      <li>I&#x27;ve been using LISTERINE STRIPS for years and loving them!</li>
      <li>evry month, they work good</li>
      <li>and I loved them.</li>
      <li>this is a superior product that cannot be found anywhere else.</li>
      <li>and surprisingly I had seen an improvement on the whiteness of my teeth after two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Good and inexpensive way to whiten your teeth.</li>
      <li>I love these!  </li>

      <li>I am happy with my purchase - it was also sent to me quickly with no problems at all!</li>
      <li>The results were amazing.</li>
      <li>If you are using this product by its own, I can honeslty say you will find it disapointing.</li>
      <li>for an effective  teeth whitening is preferable to go to the dentist.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>The 5 minute treatment does a nice job and does not hurt my teeth.</li>
      <li>My teeth are very sensitive and I find this to be the best product for them-</li>
      <li>However, the product works best with crest professional stips.</li>
      <li>I really liked them and had to get more.  </li>
      <li>These do work and are very easy to use, but I have found using peroxide with a bit of water works as well and is faster, and the dentist says it is OK to do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall fair purchase and I am quickly seeing results.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>If you are actually able to put the strip on your teeth, it keeps coming off the teeth and does not stay put.</li>
      <li>I am quite pleased with the product received and the service delivered.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>It worked for my wife better than me.  </li>
      <li>as potent as the OTC product.  </li>
      <li>I love Crest products and I have used their whitening strips before.  </li>
      <li>It felt like many needles stuck in my gums over and over for 12 hours.</li>
      <li>They stick to the inside of your cheek better than to your teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My teeth whitened even more and the best part was it&#x27;s only for 5 minutes!</li>
      <li>I sure hope you don&#x27;t discontinue them.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying a bit more for a better seal.</li>
      <li>There should be a better warning label.</li>
      <li>and you can be confident that your smile will stay bright.</li>
      <li>Would shop with user again, highly recommend for someone looking for great service.</li>
      <li>I loved it , It really works greats!</li>
      <li>The 30 minute Vivid Whites are great.  </li>
      <li>Glad that this is available through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>(I was even able to talk &amp; smile on the phone when using LISTERINE strips)!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing I like about these is that they slide into place and can be adjusted easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more useful for a quick and effective whitening.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>So easy, 5 minutes a day</li>
      <li>i was able to get most of it off and the rest absorbed into my skin.  </li>
      <li>White strips are the cost effective way to brighten up my smile, they work great.</li>
      <li>i have been using them since they came out and as usual i found the best price on amazon, and they arrived at my home very quickly. :)</li>
      <li>These work fine for me.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate you getting these to me - and so quickly!  </li>
      <li>These strips are designed to maintain a bright smile AFTER you have used the main whitening system!</li>
      <li>They are cheap flimsy strips that do not hold like the 30 minute strips.</li>
      <li>Great price will be back!</li>
      <li>Compared to the Advanced seal strips these are garbage.  </li>
      <li>These work good for touch ups after using the professional effects crest whiting strips.</li>
      <li>Good for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>both strips are different lengths (top &amp; bottom) which are textured.. which almost dissolve in your hands before you get them to your mouth!!</li>
      <li>Just a pretty box of HYPE!!  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping and very accurate product description.</li>
      <li>Find out for yourself and see fast results! &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>The box they came in is NOT Earth friendly.</li>
      <li>These were originally a gift from my dental hygienist friend.  </li>
      <li>I liked this one because you only have to keep the slippery strips on for 5 minutes, which is much more doable for me.  </li>
      <li>If you want a whiter smile quickly, they work amazing for fast results.</li>
      <li>Nothing special to write home about, just do their job.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really get much better in 2010.</li>
      <li>I loved Crest white strips but the 5 minute ones I ordered online were defective.  </li>
      <li>I have used many products but this really works without all the fuss.</li>
      <li>These white strips are very easy to use and do a great job of keeping my teeth white.  </li>
      <li>I used the 10 day intense treatment years ago and now have kept a bright healthy smile with these used daily for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>described, it is a quick 5 minute touch up.</li>
      <li>Does a good job of maintaining the whiteness level achieved through other, more intense whiting processes.  </li>
      <li>This is so easy &amp; really improves the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
      <li>Works very well and quick too!</li>
      <li>I saw that these were \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; strips, and decided that the subtle approach would probably be the best route to go for a newbie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the first set of strips, and immediately saw a drastic difference.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You will have FAR better results rinsing with hydrogen pyroxide for 5 minutes</li>
      <li>well worth it.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of root exposure and most products have been too sensitive for my teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several types of Crest Whitestrips, and I&#x27;ve always found them to be effective.</li>
      <li>I have crowns on my upper teeth, so with my daily coffee drinking my dentist recommended the Crest white strips in order to keep top and bottom teeth matching perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I use them once a week and that is enough to maintain them nice and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The 5-Minutes ones are nice because like it says, it&#x27;s only 5 minutes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> White strips are the cost effective way to brighten up my smile, they work great.</li>
    <li> I bought for a friend and do not use these. I have teeth built up from ceramic due to grinding when I was younger...they cannot be whitened as they are colored same as original teeth which is off-white. So if you have caps or other non-porous artificial surfaces on your teeth they will not change color with these strips.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction. Exactly as promised. Prompt, efficient delivery. I am quite pleased with the product received and the service delivered.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders. Be careful though and dont apply it too much on your gums because you will feel a tighly sensation and will burn a bit. i apply the strips every other day, but its been 1 week and i seen results instanly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since about four days ago when there was a coupon addict at my local grocery and, upon my request, she provided me with a $7 voucher for these whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, due to the mixed reviews, my unique bite as well as daily tobacco and coffee consumption I have taken it upon myself to use this product for twice the recommended time (ten mins vs. five) and twice the recommended frequency (twice per day vs. once per day) and surprisingly I had seen an improvement on the whiteness of my teeth after two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth but Crest knows what they are doing- even though I have been using this product twice the recommended frequency of the packaging, I have noticed merely a slight tingling sensation in my gums for about an hour after each application.&lt;br /&gt;Overall fair purchase and I am quickly seeing results.</li>
    <li> This removed tobacco stains I had on the back of my bottom teeth, along with whitening in general. EASY to apply everyday. Can&#x27;t really get much better in 2010.</li>
    <li> These strips are designed to maintain a bright smile AFTER you have used the main whitening system! It seems as though people who are not pleased with these don&#x27;t get the point that they for maintainence, not to perform the initial whitening effect. I used the 10 day intense treatment years ago and now have kept a bright healthy smile with these used daily for 5 minutes. And you do need to keep your mouth closed while they work. My dentist &amp; hygenist are amazed, especially because I am a smoker and coffee drinker.</li>
    <li> Personally, I think all teeth whitening is over-priced.  However, that being said, these work and we&#x27;ve been using Crest products for decades.  At least you get what you paid for, and the results can be noticed.</li>
    <li> After using the 30 minutes crest 3D professional effect, these due a great job at maintaining my white smile !</li>
    <li> First I would like to point out that this is the first time that I have ever used a tooth whitening product before, so I really don&#x27;t know much about them or how the various types work. I saw that these were \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; strips, and decided that the subtle approach would probably be the best route to go for a newbie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the first set of strips, and immediately saw a drastic difference. My teeth have not looked this white in at least 10 years! Now my case may be different than others&#x27; since I do not drink coffee, smoke, or ingest anything that is typically known to cause tooth yellowing. Basically it just removed the build-up from normal everyday food stains. So if you are a coffee drinker or smoker, then these probably won&#x27;t have the same dramatic effect for you as it did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for me is that once the strips are removed, some of the gel stays on your teeth. It was very easily removed, though, with a quick, light brushing with plain water. Other than that, I have no complaints: and the five minute wait time flew by before I even realized it!</li>
    <li> It really works , I used to put it before meetings and gatherings .. It&#x27;s nice</li>
    <li> I knew these were not going to be exactly like the 3D super whitening strips since they are for touch ups after your teeth are already white. These do not adhere tightly to the tooth surface, they are like the original strips, a bit flimsy and gooey. I have only used them once but hopefully they will at least take care of the daily coffee staining.</li>
    <li> I bought this one hoping I could whiten my teeth a little bit. Just after you take them off a slight difference appears but after half an hour the teeth are the same, it&#x27;s like the white washed away. I&#x27;ve been using it now for almost 20 days. Waste of money...</li>
    <li> I used these before I got crowns on my front two teeth.  Whoa, within a week my teeth were clean and white, not too white, just a natural clean looking white.</li>
    <li> i love these 5 minute touch-up stain sheild white strips. i have been using them since they came out and as usual i found the best price on amazon, and they arrived at my home very quickly. :)</li>
    <li> I loved Crest white strips but the 5 minute ones I ordered online were defective.  I put one on my upper &amp; lower teeth &amp; immediately my fingers started burning.  I looked at my fingers and saw the powdery residue from the strips.  I immediately washed it off with soap.  i was able to get most of it off and the rest absorbed into my skin.  I contacted Crest directly and was given a coupon which did not cover the full price of a new one.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using LISTERINE STRIPS for years and loving them! Can&#x27;t find them anymore so ordered CREST to be brought to me by a USA friend to Thailand..&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe how disappointed I am in this product ..both strips are different lengths (top &amp; bottom) which are textured.. which almost dissolve in your hands before you get them to your mouth!! Foams &amp; bubbles way too much (I was even able to talk &amp; smile on the phone when using LISTERINE strips)! and can&#x27;t with these.. AND must wait minutes til they curl up and fall away from teeth like salt put on blood suckers. Why they are NOT self dissolving is beyond me. The box they came in is NOT Earth friendly. Just a pretty box of HYPE!!  WHO DESIGNED THIS PRODUCT ???!!!</li>
    <li> These strips are awesome!</li>
    <li> Product worked better than I expected.  Experienced very little sensitivity.</li>
    <li> The product works . . . when it stays on your teeth; unfortunately, however, when you peel the strip off (especially for the lower teeth, because it&#x27;s a smaller strip), it starts to fold over itself. If you are actually able to put the strip on your teeth, it keeps coming off the teeth and does not stay put.</li>
    <li> Big savings off the cost at a pharmacy.  However,  note this product comes in a different box.  Depending&lt;br /&gt;on the vendor,  some are boxed in both English and Spanish.  However,  the product is close to&lt;br /&gt; the crest whitestrips that are purchased over the counter in a US pharmacy.  Some units appear to be&lt;br /&gt;not as potent as the OTC product.  The OTC brand will burn your fingers if any of the cleaner is inadvertently&lt;br /&gt;spilled onto the skin.  These versions do not.  I assume they are less powerful than the more expensive OTC&lt;br /&gt;versions,  but they still work.</li>
    <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews but I have to say something about this crap. I have tried both the stain shield and the advanced vivid each for more than two weeks following their instruction strictly. And what I got? Nothing changed on my teeth whatsoever! Forget about it if you want to remove tea or coffee stain. This is completely waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;ve used the 3D Professional Whitening strips before and they are pretty good, but these are just flimsy little strips that won&#x27;t stay on your teeth even for a minute.  They dissolve the second you put them on your teeth and they don&#x27;t really help with brightening or whitening.  Guess because they don&#x27;t stay on long enough.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but I won&#x27;t be spending my money on these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best for touchups is just to use Rembrant toothpaste and A&amp;H Whitening Booster.  They work great!</li>
    <li> Very slippery. Dont stay in place very good</li>
    <li> I loved it , It really works greats! I have used many products but this really works without all the fuss. Really recommend it to everybody who wants whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> I decided to try the 5 minute touch up strips because I had used the Professional Effects Whitestrips and I loved them. They had actually whitened my teeth dramatically. They would hold perfectly to my teeth when I put them on. Well, with the 5 minute touch up strips, I did not have the same effect. They did not stick to my teeth like I expected them to, They actually slid off and if I tried to talk with them...forget about it. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Crest need to come up with a new advanced 5 minute whitening strip that actually sticks to your teeth and doesn&#x27;t leave so much residue when taken off.</li>
    <li> I have used the 3D whitestrips for sensitive teeth and I really like it. I have a lot of root exposure and most products have been too sensitive for my teeth. The 5 minute treatment does a nice job and does not hurt my teeth. I will continue to use them daily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and my teeth get whiter after I use it everyday. So I was thinking to get one more pack and keep using it!</li>
    <li> I appreciate you getting these to me - and so quickly!  They are much less expensive than any store i have gotten them from.</li>
    <li> These are all that you need and one of the least expensive and fastest acting. You can use these or any other Crest whitening strips when you first start out. You might have some irritation and if so, just lay off another day. Once you get the teeth nice and white, it is not necessary to continue using these daily. I use them once a week and that is enough to maintain them nice and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about these is that they slide into place and can be adjusted easily. Some of the other strips stick and are very difficult to move around once they are in place. You don&#x27;t have to place them in the center every time. You can place them to the left or to the right on alternate nights to widen their reach a bit.</li>
    <li> Purchased for one of our teenage daughters and she likes them.</li>
    <li> They do not fit as well as the every six month whiteners.  They do not adhere to your teeth as well.  Move around quite a bit.  Hard to use.</li>
    <li> Works very well and quick too!</li>
    <li> It worked for my wife better than me.  My teeth got a bit sensitive after using them.  She had no issues</li>
    <li> I love this product I,m consuming this Crest whitening for about 2 yeats and leave my theet very white in only 5 minutes and without damage! Love it</li>
    <li> I use this a few times a week to help with any build up that may occur from coffee or red wine, berries, etc. It&#x27;s great for &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; in between using the stronger white strips once or twice a year. A great product that works for me.</li>
    <li> The strips do not stay on your teeth.  No whitening noticed.  The 30 minute Vivid Whites are great.  These are not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Especially after a weekend of too much red wine - I use these a few days in a row and my teeth look great!</li>
    <li> I use these every time I&#x27;m going on a trip or whenever I know I&#x27;ll be taking pics just to brighten my teeth a little more.</li>
    <li> These are worthless in every way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried practically every whitestrips and whitening product available since 1998.&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave them on for at least 30 minutes and notice nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they are as flimsy as silk, and difficult to handle.  They stick to the inside of your cheek better than to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have FAR better results rinsing with hydrogen pyroxide for 5 minutes daily.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the same active ingredient and it&#x27;s 50 cents!</li>
    <li> my favorite strips since it only take 5min and it actually works!</li>
    <li> I get SO MANY compliments on my white teeth thanks to this product!!! My teeth are very sensitive and I find this to be the best product for them- the other formulations tend to make my teeth even more sensitive. I leave the five minute strips on while I shower, and at this point I use one pouch (1 upper, 1 lower) once every week or two and that is often enough to keep my teeth sparkling white. I would give this product 10 stars if I could!!</li>
    <li> I have used white strips since their appearance in the marketplace. Crest has improved the product on a regular basis. Within 4 days, your teeth are noticeably whiter. Prolonged use restores the whiteness to a youthful appearance while not destroying your enamel. It is a great product that I recommend to anyone who desires a cost efficient way to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> i have just used a few strips only. it seems to be working but will have to wait for a few more days. i think using crest whitening toothpaste will be a big help too but it is not available in australia.</li>
    <li> It worked so well! I am happy with my purchase - it was also sent to me quickly with no problems at all!</li>
    <li> The strips are pretty flimsy and don&#x27;t stay on well.</li>
    <li> To the people complaining that this doesn&#x27;t work, these are meant to maintain your newly whitened teeth AFTER you use the regular crest strips for 30 minutes. These are NOT meant for dramatically whitening your teeth at all.</li>
    <li> Great price will be back!</li>
    <li> These actually work really well, they aren&#x27;t difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Compared to the Advanced seal strips these are garbage.  They are cheap flimsy strips that do not hold like the 30 minute strips. I cannot say how well they work because each time I used them I can&#x27;t get them to stay put for the 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;As described, it is a quick 5 minute touch up. Obviously, don&#x27;t expect results that you would see with the Crest 3D White Professional Effects or Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Crest 3D White Professional Effects and Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects in the past with fantastic results and no issues. The seals were great. But, this particular product has a serious seal issue. It&#x27;s tricky to apply onto your teeth, as the strips tend to slip and slide when applying. If possible, Crest should start using &amp;#34;Advanced Seal technology&amp;#34; on all of its whitening strip products, not just the pricier ones. As the sealing issue with the 5 Minute Touch Up is serious enough for me not to purchase it again. I&#x27;m not a very picky consumer, but the sealing problem is making these strips nearly unusable. I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying a bit more for a better seal.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using these because I&#x27;m impatient but 5-Minutes isn&#x27;t bad. I used the Maximum whiting strips for 7 days and it made my teeth extremely white. Like people notices immediately and it was nice to have people notice the money spent on these. The 5-Minutes ones are nice because like it says, it&#x27;s only 5 minutes and it keeps your teeth as white as they were when you finished the extreme strips.</li>
    <li> I love Crest products and I have used their whitening strips before.  These work fine for me.  I don&#x27;t need serious whitening, just a touch up now that then because I enjoy coffee and tea.</li>
    <li> 5 minute touch ups are the best thing ever!! If you want a whiter smile quickly, they work amazing for fast results. I&#x27;ve given some of them to a few of my friends to try them out and now they are addicted to em! Lol. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without crest white strips. Anyone who is skeptical about buying these, don&#x27;t be! Find out for yourself and see fast results! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Glad that this is available through Amazon.  Have looked all over this.  Can only find the regular whitestrips, not this five-minute touch-up that really works.</li>
    <li> It shipped super fast, and it fits the description. I had bought this before though not from Amazon. So if you already know what you want, ordering it it&#x27;s the best option!</li>
    <li> I gave this only 4 stars since I can&#x27;t get someone to do it for me.</li>
    <li> I think it works, but you would have to do it everyday to get good results.</li>
    <li> product arrived on the agreed date and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of maintaining the whiteness level achieved through other, more intense whiting processes.  Would recommend for those whose teeth are at a color level that is satisfactory to begin with.</li>
    <li> I followed directions once I removed them I suffered severe pain for 12 hours.  It felt like many needles stuck in my gums over and over for 12 hours. There should be a better warning label.</li>
    <li> I love these!  They are so much better and easier than the 30 minute strips!  These were originally a gift from my dental hygienist friend.  I really liked them and had to get more.  I only have to use them a couple of times per month.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I was recommended to use the Crest Whitening and I have recommend it to all my friends .. it is easy to use and use it whenever, and it cost less then going to a dentist!!!!!</li>
    <li> These white strips are very easy to use and do a great job of keeping my teeth white.  I alternate them with a charcoal toothpaste and have maintained my white teeth despite drinking coffee regularly.  I have not had any problems with sensitivity, as this product is very gentle.</li>
    <li> Order was delivered as expected.  Product acceptable for my needs.</li>
    <li> may be a bit uncomfortable for people with sensitive gums however the strips work just fine. Good and inexpensive way to whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> I order these Crest 3D White Stain Shield 5 Minute Touch-Ups Teeth Whitening Strips 28... evry month, they work good and I have sensitive teeth but these do not hurt them.</li>
    <li> the best you can buy anywhere. this is a superior product that cannot be found anywhere else. no one else has this</li>
    <li> The quality of the strip is not great slides everywhere hard to keep on sometimes gets the job done but these could be a lot better!</li>
    <li> used the orig white strips, professional, first and loved product and results; these 5 minutes versions are so light weight and flimsy, because of less of the chemical that whitens? that difficult to apply easily</li>
    <li> Work aight. Nothing special to write home about, just do their job. Do not have sparkly white teeth, but then I also drink lots of coffee and tea, so these strips help me no to have orange teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These do work and are very easy to use, but I have found using peroxide with a bit of water works as well and is faster, and the dentist says it is OK to do.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product ever since it was introduced in the market. It is a absolute must if your a coffee drinker. So easy, 5 minutes a day and you can be confident that your smile will stay bright. I have crowns on my upper teeth, so with my daily coffee drinking my dentist recommended the Crest white strips in order to keep top and bottom teeth matching perfectly.  A little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27; s work, my teeth more whiter, but be careful if you have sensitive teeth. I used it  six month ago, but the effect is still there</li>
    <li> I have used these white strips for the last few years and always get remarks about my nice white teeth. Since I just turned 70, that is quite a compliment. The 5 minute strips are hard to find locally so I have been ordering online. I sure hope you don&#x27;t discontinue them. Thank you Crest!!</li>
    <li> This is the touch up version of whitening strips, so don&#x27;t expect pearly whites overnight.  I liked this one because you only have to keep the slippery strips on for 5 minutes, which is much more doable for me.  The strips foam up and slowly whiten your teeth over time.  I noticed a subtle difference, but that&#x27;s all I wanted as well.</li>
    <li> These worked great! I was a little nervous because of the price, but they do work. You just may have to not use them every day if your gums are sensitive like mine.</li>
    <li> Tried this product, and had major tooth sensitivity. My teeth hurt for 3 days. I haven&#x27;t attempted to use them again. Probably will cancel my automatic delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of Crest Whitestrips, and I&#x27;ve always found them to be effective. There&#x27;s a special skill you need to stop the problem of these particular ones sliding, however:&lt;br /&gt;Keeping your mouth shut for five minutes. Five ENTIRE minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Did I just blow your mind? It&#x27;s apparently really tricky for a lot of reviewers.</li>
    <li> Product on time and a great product. Would shop with user again, highly recommend for someone looking for great service.</li>
    <li> you can tell the difference after one use.</li>
    <li> These work good for touch ups after using the professional effects crest whiting strips. My teeth are real sensitive though and they had some pain while I was using them.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Great product .  Doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time. Made my teeth hurt a tad. But overall it does its job</li>
    <li> I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t expect a just-out-of-the-dentist white, but I don&#x27;t really see any difference. I went ahead and bought the Professional Effects. It&#x27;s much more useful for a quick and effective whitening. If you really want to see a difference in whiteness, I&#x27;d say go for those or the Vivid Effects, because I simply didn&#x27;t see it with these.</li>
    <li> If you are using this product by its own, I can honeslty say you will find it disapointing. However, the product works best with crest professional stips. The results were amazing.</li>
    <li> I use these almost daily &amp; they just keep the stains at a minimal.  Big coffee drinker!  Good for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Best whiten strip I have ever use, my teeth got a lot whiter after 3 uses. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> After using the 14 day whitestrips, I still didn&#x27;t have the results i wanted. So I purchased these 5 minute touch ups and they worked awesome! My teeth whitened even more and the best part was it&#x27;s only for 5 minutes!</li>
    <li> Yes a great item if you want whiter teeth, it does work but it must be used dailry to keep them at there best. Thats&#x27;s why you must check for the lowest price, This supplier does do that, Amazon offers shipping at no cost or the lowest and fast. Just remember your use and time it for your next delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for having this item online at the local stores you will pay much more.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, all sealed packages, but saw no change in the coloration of the teeth. for an effective  teeth whitening is preferable to go to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and very accurate product description.</li>
    <li> the 5 minute crest 3d white stain shield did not have enough grips in the shield to stay on your teeth very well. the shield would slip off with the movement of your tongue.</li>
    <li> This is so easy &amp; really improves the whiteness of my teeth. What really works for me is that it takes 5 minutes &amp; I use it when I have time which isn&#x27;t everyday.</li>
    <li> cheaper than anywhere else, only 5minitue ones can keep on longer -&lt;br /&gt;not any real long term results, but useful for daily look or going out&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s apart of my routine now</li>
