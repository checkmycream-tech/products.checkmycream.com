<li> this product is that a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> My face feels softer than before and less dry than before!</li>
<li> You only use a small amount ...</li>
<li> Since you only need to use very little at a time (half of a pea size)</li>
<li> very little of it goes a long way.  </li>
<li> in just a few minutes!  </li>
<li> It is thick and creamy, almost like a lotion.</li>
<li> The product comes out as a very thick pearly paste.  </li>
<li> but this was expensive than it is sold in the mall.</li>
<li> and it feels weird putting it on</li>

    <li> Never disappointed with this product.  Always makes my face feel moisturized after washing my makeup off. As a middle aged woman I appreciate a product that does NOT make me feel dried out.</li>
    <li> I got a 1.7 fluid oz tube of this as a part of an Estee Lauder gift set.  The product comes out as a very thick pearly paste.  Keep in mind- very little of it goes a long way.  It foams up very nicely and imparts a very pleasant delicate scent.  The product rinses off very cleanly and leaves no feeling of residue. My face feels so fresh and clean and I feel like I just treated my face to a mini-spa- in just a few minutes!  I say this is worth the higher price tag because you need to use so little of it.  I will continue using this since I love washing my face with it so much.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product! It&#x27;s great that you only use very little because it foams up a lot. I use it with my clarisonic and I really like it!!
