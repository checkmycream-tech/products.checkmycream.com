<li> am using well from last long time</li>
<li> But this time it has left my hair very dry and frizzy.</li>

<li> My previous pump bottle pumps  (from John Freida)</li>
<li> Not a huge fan of this product.</li>
<li> Not sure why companies have to change things that work.</li>
<li> II&#x27;ve purchased this is the past</li>
<li> Some people have complained that they received two shampoo or two conditioner</li>
<li> It takes FOREVER to rinse out and if you don&#x27;t spend at least 10 minutes rinsing your hair feels grimy.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s seems no good after use .&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;Seriously no good at all</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t so bad that I will stop using it, but I probably will not buy it again.</li>
<li> ; shampoo was making it a tear out so badly.</li>

    <li> Great smell, leaves the hair fresh and clean without drying the scalp.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> great product and service was fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo/conditioner at a great price.</li>
    <li> Wella must have changed their formula. Not sure why companies have to change things that work. Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as it used to and even when I use a ton of conditioner my hair is hard to comb after my shower. I thought it was a fluke the first day, but three days of the same and I just think it is the product. It&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault. Product arrived quickly and as advertised. Just wish Wella hadn&#x27;t messed with a perfectly good thing.</li>
