      <li>Good items - delivered as promised - good seller</li>
      <li>Good replacement head for this model razor.</li>
      <li>The cutters were a perfect fit.  </li>
      <li>but still, it&#x27;s a good item.</li>
      <li>Part fit perfect with no issues.  </li>

      <li>They give a nice shave.</li>
      <li>It was easy to find this part, price was best available, the shipment was very quick.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for the great experience.</li>
      <li>better to order 2 or more to have them available</li>
      <li>Good as new!</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this replacement shaver head for months now and it works just as well as the original.</li>
      <li>However that looks to be true of every OEM replacement out there.</li>
      <li>Much better performance than my old one.</li>
      <li>These replacement blades with \\&quot;shields and frame\\&quot; snap right into the razor without any fuss.  </li>
      <li>My husbands blades were extremely dull, but the unit still held a charge and was in great condition.</li>
      <li>Spared the expense of a whole new unit and popped these right in.</li>
      <li>Gives a really close shave.</li>
      <li>Best price and my Remington is cutting like new!</li>
      <li>It had been about a year since I had new shaving blades.</li>
      <li>Basically, the razor works like new again.  </li>
      <li>Really sharp at first, but as with most of this style it gradually loses the keen edge feel.  </li>
      <li>It was a little more than I expected to pay</li>
      <li>It took me longer to open the package than to install the new cutters.  </li>
      <li>Not much else to say about the product, except that I now have a new shaver - another remington.</li>
      <li>was te exact replacement part I needed; took only a few seconds to install and works like a charm,</li>
      <li>Seems to work like it did when new, but not a lot better than it did with the used blades, maybe mine weren&#x27;t too bad yet even though 6 years old.</li>
