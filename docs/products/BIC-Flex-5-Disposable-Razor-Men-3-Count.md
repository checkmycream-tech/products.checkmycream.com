### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Will never buy again - I&#x27;m very happy with the Hydro 5.</li>
      <li>These are the best disposable razors I have *</li>
      <li>know this is a rather gushing review, but I can&#x27;t tell you how great the results were!</li>
      <li>I am always looking for the perfect disposable razor (which I still haven&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Best disposable razor I have used.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I have both used this razor,  and both agree it&#x27;s the best disposable we&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very good razor.</li>
      <li>A good value for the money!</li>
      <li>Great razors.</li>
      <li>And you do a great shave.</li>
      <li>That being said, I have been quite happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Great non-slip handles -</li>
      <li>This is a great razor</li>
      <li>The blades have great flexibility and did not give me any of that &amp;#34;tug n</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m quite happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great razors at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice razor that does a good job giving a close shave.  </li>
      <li>I thought the metal ball in the handle was hockey, but this is easily the best razor I have ever used.</li>
      <li>but we are happy with the nice close shave that it gives.  </li>
      <li>I heard good things about these razors, read the reviews and figured why not try them.  </li>
      <li>However, this disposable is so good that I could use it every day if I didn&#x27;t already have the Fusion setup I have now.  </li>
      <li>Good looking and does the job you hire it for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Appearance wise the Bic Flex 5 looks like a disposable on steroids and is quite impressive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;ve seldom shaved with a razor that even on one day has very notable pull on a bear that was mild at best.</li>
      <li>No cuts or scratches, great shave, and the razors look stylish as well.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, most disposables do not give a great shave, and tend to cut my face to shreds.  </li>
      <li>It is a great concept and probably a razor that most guys can use, but my skin just does not react well to this product.  </li>
      <li>husband is very pleased with this razor.  </li>
      <li>This is great for fine hair.</li>
      <li>BIC Flex 5 gave a great surprise when I got a shave as close as my non-disposable razor, and was quite comfortable as well.  </li>
      <li>It is smooth and works great on my knees.</li>
      <li>Great razor for smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>The blades don&#x27;t feel as nice.</li>
      <li>I also liked the fact the blades did not get clogged with a couple days growth.</li>
      <li>We use refillable and electric razors in our house but keep disposables around for house guests or our own travels.</li>
      <li>These are quite nice.</li>
      <li>Gave a nice close shave.</li>
      <li>Flex 5 is a nice razor.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The blades deliver a nice close shave</li>
      <li>In the grand scheme, however, that means nothing if it doesn&#x27;t provide a good shave.</li>
      <li>I do like the slide-on blade cover, which is nice for when you toss it in your toiletries bag for traveling.</li>
      <li>I can understand 2 blades being more effective - maybe 3 - but 5 seems like overkill.</li>
      <li>The razor glides smoothly and did a good job making it&#x27;s way around my knees with no</li>
      <li>By far the best you can buy.</li>
      <li>He was able to get an amazing amount of shaves per razor before having to discard it and truthfully, considering the way the price of razors with replaceable blades keeps skyrocketing, he is going to  make these disposable BIC Razors a permanent fixture in his grooming routine.  </li>
      <li>A nice and affordable razor, it delivers a nice smooth shave without any nicks.</li>
      <li>Most of the time this worked like a dream.</li>
      <li>They were too light-weight, and the blade angles were funky, which would pull my hair and cause more accidental cuts.</li>
      <li>While it doesn&#x27;t have the heft of my metal Gillette razor, it does feel a bit more substantial in the hand that most disposable razors.  </li>
      <li>I need more.</li>
      <li>, I guess for people who are somehow convinced that razors have to weigh more.</li>
      <li>should something better happen along.</li>
      <li>Okay, I should have updated some weeks ago.</li>
      <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have worried, because foam and hair just slid off, as if it were nothing more than water.</li>
      <li>Discovered these razors and I am satisfied.  </li>
      <li>, it was a much better weight feel.</li>
      <li>Even around the knees and ankles, the spots I&#x27;m most prone to nicking, I didn&#x27;t get even the slightest trail of blood.</li>
      <li>Okay, I should have updated some weeks ago.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>I was hoping this would be a more affordable alternative.</li>
      <li>These have a comfortable handle and nice heft for a disposable.</li>
      <li>I was able to go about 3 days without shaving, &amp; the razors didn&#x27;t nick my skin the way many do.</li>
      <li>Great on contours of an older face.</li>
      <li>They work as good as anything, and you get a whole razor+handle for the price of just a blade.</li>
      <li>Five blades makes your face feel really smooth and makes your face look very clean.  </li>
      <li>The handle is easy to hold.</li>
      <li>Easy.</li>
      <li>Additionally, the handle is well thought out and easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>It keeps going strong, with no sign of dullness yet.</li>
      <li>It keeps going strong, with no sign of dullness yet.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m getting the same beautiful results.  </li>
      <li>It will plow right through the fine hair on my legs and the shave is very comfortable - although I prefer the women&#x27;s razors for that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line:  Very highly recommended!!!</li>

      <li>A disposable razor that is similar to my Gillette Fusion razor is definitely a welcome site.  </li>

      <li>For disposable razors these are very nice, and will get several uses.</li>

      <li>They would be perfect for when I travel - no more worrying about being all nicked and dented while on the road</li>
      <li>The Flex5 gives a close clean shave with the 5 blades and the flexible head.  </li>
      <li>This was a much better experience and actually gave a nice shave.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think that the larger coverage of area is a good thing.</li>
      <li>a bit surprised by how much we liked this razor.</li>
      <li>I suppose as a disposable item, it&#x27;s really good, and should deserve five stars, but from my perspective of looking for a replacement of non-disposable Mac3, it still came short..</li>

      <li>They glide over the skin and remove the hair so easily and quickly, I am completely sold and will continue to buy more in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really like the BIC Flex 5 razors because they gave me an very clean shave.</li>
      <li>Then, there are the razors--doing a side-by-side comparison with the Mach 3, I found the BIC did provide a closer shave, but only marginally and it required more time since the blades (packed closely together) tend to collect hair (meaning one needs to pause and rinse more often).</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried them again in a week because the shave was so good, so I&#x27;ll update on how long these disposable razors last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In addition, by shaking the razor in hot water, I can easily clean the hair residue from the razor.  </li>
      <li>This razor seems fresh every time you use it.</li>
      <li>He said it is well crafted, has a good feel in the hand with ease of control using wet hands.  </li>
      <li>(I ran an electric shaver across it when I was done to listen for the sound of hair being cut and there was more cutting going on than when I would use the Gillette Fusion), it was still very impressive for a disposable razor and you wouldn&#x27;t notice much difference if you were just looking at</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the BIC Flex Disposable Razor, because I got a very clean shave and no nicks.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So two sides to the story, my husband doesn&#x27;t like this razor as he says the head is too big to get into smaller spaces like his chin and around his nose when he shaves. He prefers the 3 blade type.  I like this razor for shaving my legs and underarms. It is smooth and works great on my knees. No nicks or cuts. Gave a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am female. I know this is for men, but for years, I&#x27;ve used the same razor as my husband (non-disposable Mac3) and loved it. Now that he has switched over to straight edge double sided blade razors, I am open to something other than Mac3 due to pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is disposable, I was skeptical when I first started. In the past, disposables have always done a pretty bad job for me. They were too light-weight, and the blade angles were funky, which would pull my hair and cause more accidental cuts. Therefore, I was quite stressed when I tested this. Here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smooth shave - I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing this was at shaving my under arms, bikini lines, and even more &amp;#34;private,&amp;#34; hard to get to areas. (I don&#x27;t shave my legs since I tweeze that instead.) The gel strip was essential in order to create that smooth shave. I also constantly kept myself wet under the shower to help moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;2. Decent weight - compare to other disposable razors I&#x27;ve used, it was a much better weight feel. It did not feel flimsy. It was a very substantial hold.&lt;br /&gt;3. Great non-slip handles - The rubberized handles provided a lot of security under the shower.&lt;br /&gt;4. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get clogged up very much with hair for me. Granted, I was not super hairy, but I was due for a good shave because I was way past the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; stage and into the &amp;#34;fuzzy feeling&amp;#34; stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;1. This is my only big complaint but it&#x27;s a big one: Awkward glide - the shaving head is taller and wider compared to my Mac3 razors. You&#x27;d think that the larger coverage of area is a good thing. Well, the tilting mechanism of the blade head is not super smooth, and the larger flat area would cause a &amp;#34;suction&amp;#34; effect when I try to glide the blades over my moist skin. It&#x27;s like dragging a plastic flat surface over wet glass - it is smooth and quick but then it would catch and get &amp;#34;stuck.&amp;#34; I almost cut myself a couple of times because of this.&lt;br /&gt;2. The larger head - this makes getting into the nooks and crevices of the female body somewhat difficult. Maybe I will get used to it if I begin using it more regularly, but as of now, I am VERY fearful of being cut by this based on my last complaint. It does not glide smoothly enough for me to feel secure on those difficult to get to, sensitive places that I would usually feel okay with my Mac3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, as a travel, temporary replacement of my Mac3, it is acceptable. I can use this at the minimum 3 times before throwing it away. I&#x27;d not need to worry about bringing this back home with me when I travel. I recommend it for that. However, it&#x27;s still not good enough to replace my Mac3. I suppose as a disposable item, it&#x27;s really good, and should deserve five stars, but from my perspective of looking for a replacement of non-disposable Mac3, it still came short..

    <li> These are the best disposable razors I have *ever* used. They don&#x27;t nick or scrape anywhere and leave smooth, hairless skin in it&#x27;s wake. They easily last upwards of a month, individually. I&#x27;ll continue buying them for years.</li>
    <li> These are quite nice. They have a heft in the hand that belies the fact they are disposable. They are very sharp. VERY. I use these on my legs (I&#x27;m a female) and they go around and in back of the knee pretty easily - no nicks and scrapes due to not being able to navigate that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave them a solid 4 stars. I had been hoping that a 5 blade shave would give me a few more hours without stubble. Alas it is not to be. They work well, last through several &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34; and just generally are comfortable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband uses 5 blade shavers because of the closeness of the result. He also only takes disposable razors when he travels so that he can dispose of them before his return trip home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BIC Flex5 excels in both of these requirements.  The Flex5 gives a close clean shave with the 5 blades and the flexible head.  Additionally, the handle is well thought out and easy to hold.  Being a disposable razor makes this perfect for everyday use and especially travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is very pleased with this razor.  He definitely plans to use these for travel and is also considering putting away his normal 5 blade non-disposable razor and using these both at home and on the road.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m someone with really thick facial hair who can&#x27;t shave without razor burn, basically all I can do is use a trimmer. However I bought these to give them a try and wow, I actually got a CLEAN shave! By far the best you can buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bic Flex 4 for years. They work as good as anything, and you get a whole razor+handle for the price of just a blade. I keep backup Flex4s at the office, no need for an overpriced handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flex 5 doesn&#x27;t seem to do any more with its 5th blade, so I won&#x27;t be paying to upgrade next time I need more. I like tje steel bearing they add, I guess for people who are somehow convinced that razors have to weigh more. It&#x27;s a perfectly good razor, but the Flex4 is just as good for a little less.</li>
    <li> These are pretty decent razors, but I typically use the Gillette Fusion razor. By comparison, the Bic Flex5 seems cheaper. The blades don&#x27;t feel as nice. The handle is much bigger, which isn&#x27;t a big deal, but awkward for me. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to flex as much as the Gillette razors. These don&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as the Gillette blades either. I do like the slide-on blade cover, which is nice for when you toss it in your toiletries bag for traveling. Overall, these are actually pretty decent, but since I&#x27;m so used to the Gillette razors, these do not seem quite as nice and I will not be switching.</li>
    <li> This razor was far above my husbands expectations for a disposable razor.  He said it is well crafted, has a good feel in the hand with ease of control using wet hands.  He was able to get an amazing amount of shaves per razor before having to discard it and truthfully, considering the way the price of razors with replaceable blades keeps skyrocketing, he is going to  make these disposable BIC Razors a permanent fixture in his grooming routine.  It is nice to have a completely clean razor and not just a clean blade when you are ready to jettison the old, dull blades.  He was wondering if he would go back to an electric razor as the price of blades just keep climbing, but I think he has found his answer for the foreseeable future.... these BIC Razors are a new fixture in my bathroom.  A good value for the money!</li>
    <li> A nice and affordable razor, it delivers a nice smooth shave without any nicks. I&#x27;m not sure if the ball bearing adds anything to its effectiveness but over- all I have no complaints with the razor.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t seem to shave as close as the Schick razors that are similarly priced. With 5 blades, there shouldn&#x27;t be any stubble.</li>
    <li> Works great have been using for months,  hard to find in area and only come in two packs for same price</li>
    <li> I admit I didn&#x27;t notice that this was a men&#x27;s razor, but I shave, too, so here&#x27;s my opinion. I generally think the multiple-blade razors are just marketing gimmicks. I can understand 2 blades being more effective - maybe 3 - but 5 seems like overkill. However, I will say this razor really works well. It feels like it&#x27;s gliding over my skin. I can&#x27;t actually feel the cutting effect like I usually can when I&#x27;m shaving. The pivot head worked well to protect my kneecaps and ankles from the blades. There were no nicks, and no stubble at all. I have coarse hair, so that&#x27;s saying something. The handle is easy to hold. Very good razor. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> BIC Flex 5 Disposable Razors are so sharp and so easy to cut yourself, I was afraid to try them at first.  One I did, I discovered how much nicer they are for my legs and underarms and my husband&#x27;s face than the razors we have been using. They glide over the skin and remove the hair so easily and quickly, I am completely sold and will continue to buy more in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these free for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be upfront: I&#x27;m a woman, and I don&#x27;t have enough facial hair to use this as your average man would. So instead of shaving the moustache/beard area, I shaved the underarms and legs and bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May I just say, this razor gave me the closest, cleanest shave I&#x27;ve had in years without ONCE nicking me? And when you are shaving delicate areas, that&#x27;s a HUGE thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used L&#x27;occitane&#x27;s shower oil to get a foam, and then used the blades on my legs. Even around the knees and ankles, the spots I&#x27;m most prone to nicking, I didn&#x27;t get even the slightest trail of blood. Instead, it left the smoothest shave - today, nearly a week after I used it, my legs are STILL smooth, with barely a prickle of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other item I was a bit worried about was cleaning the blade. I shouldn&#x27;t have worried, because foam and hair just slid off, as if it were nothing more than water. I haven&#x27;t tried them again in a week because the shave was so good, so I&#x27;ll update on how long these disposable razors last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a rather gushing review, but I can&#x27;t tell you how great the results were! The only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; I had was the mystifying &amp;#34;ball bearing&amp;#34; caught in the handle of the razor. I had my running partner try to mock using it on his face, and it didn&#x27;t look like it really helped at all. Every time he tried to put his finger on the ball, it looked unnatural. My sister also tried this out, and again, she questioned why it was there. Occasionally, my hand would naturally rest against the ball bearing and it would glide nicely, but overall, it seems overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely be interested in purchasing these again, even if they are for men - and I don&#x27;t typically do that! They would be perfect for when I travel - no more worrying about being all nicked and dented while on the road again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/27/15: I have been using this razor every week since I posted this review. The week immediately after this review, I ended up with numerous nicks. I thought maybe that the razor had already dulled, but fortunately, the 3rd week, I once again had fantastic results. (Obviously, I got sloppy in shaving.) I almost feel like I can go longer between shaves with this razor! It keeps going strong, with no sign of dullness yet. I&#x27;ll update when I finally have to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/09/15: Okay, I should have updated some weeks ago. It&#x27;s probably been like 6 weeks, but this razor lasted a LONG time. And going back to my old razor is sad because I feel it just doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S.

    <li> Overall, these are really great disposable razors. We use refillable and electric razors in our house but keep disposables around for house guests or our own travels. These have a comfortable handle and nice heft for a disposable. I am not especially sold on the five blades--I get a fine shave with  three and prefer the smaller surface area of three vs. five blades. My husband has a beard that he shaves around so he feels the same. Yes, these provide a close shave and didn&#x27;t nick us but we were careful. There is more potential for nicks with the five blades. I will consider these when I buy our next round of disposables.</li>
    <li> I prefer to use disposable razors when I&#x27;m on a trip for business or fun, just so it&#x27;s one less thing I have to worry about when packing.  Unfortunately, most disposables do not give a great shave, and tend to cut my face to shreds.  BIC Flex 5 gave a great surprise when I got a shave as close as my non-disposable razor, and was quite comfortable as well.  No cuts or scratches, great shave, and the razors look stylish as well.  I&#x27;ve continued to buy these razors when I travel...and I&#x27;m quite happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Very highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I got these for my husband for when we travel, but wound up claiming them for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, sparse hair and dry, sensitive skin.  I am always looking for the perfect disposable razor (which I still haven&#x27;t found).&lt;br /&gt;The Flex 5 is a nice razor.  I like how it feels in my hand (a flimsy disposable inevitably winds up with me losing control of it and cutting myself) with an adequate heft, balance and control.&lt;br /&gt;The blades deliver a nice close shave and I can get at least 5 shaves out of each razor.&lt;br /&gt;The price is just a tad high to me.</li>
    <li> These BIC Flex 5 Disposable Razor have given me the smoothest shave ever. Though I find the over-design of the handle a bit much, I plan to make these my go-to blades for the forseeable future.</li>
    <li> Great razors at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, what&#x27;s with this &amp;#34;subscriptions for razor blades&amp;#34; nonsense?</li>
    <li> Great razor for smooth shave.  I have course thick facial hair which grows in different directions.  Discovered these razors and I am satisfied.  Best disposable razor I have used.  I agree with another review that these razors are wasteful in regards to the handle.  A lot of material in the handle that gets thrown away.  Bic should sell just the blades and a separate re-usable handle.</li>
    <li> First, the &amp;#34;balance sphere&amp;#34; is more gimmick then anything else. After careful examination, this little ball has no effect on the razor&#x27;s function. That being said, I have been quite happy with the results. Since I am female, I have used this for legs, underarm and bikini zone. The blades have great flexibility and did not give me any of that &amp;#34;tug n pull.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use this on the unique curves of the Achilles heel and femur bone that can so often get a nick. Again, no problems. My skin came out smooth with no &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; afterward. For disposable razors these are very nice, and will get several uses.</li>
    <li> BIC Flex 5 Disposable Razor, Men, 3-Count&lt;br /&gt;by BIC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was a bit surprised by how much we liked this razor. Its efficient. Good looking and does the job you hire it for. Woot!</li>
    <li> The ball &amp;#34;flex&amp;#34; part of these disposable razors seems pretty pointless, but the blades give a nice, close shave with no nicks.  These are definitely better than the average disposable.</li>
    <li> Extremely close shaves every time. Way better than other brands!</li>
    <li> Thought the 5 blades would work well. I got nicks and cuts the first time I used it. Will never buy again - I&#x27;m very happy with the Hydro 5.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and I am always nervous about trying something new.  I heard good things about these razors, read the reviews and figured why not try them.  It is a great concept and probably a razor that most guys can use, but my skin just does not react well to this product.  I found the shave to not be as close, ingrown hairs and my skin broke out.  So I am now back to my old stand by razors and my skin is back to normal.</li>
    <li> My primary razor is a Gillette Mach 3 and has been going on a decade, but I&#x27;m always open to change should something better happen along. The BIC Flex 5 surprised me initially with its design, specifically the ergonomic shape of its handle. In the grand scheme, however, that means nothing if it doesn&#x27;t provide a good shave. And it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I won&#x27;t be giving up my Mach 3. The BIC is lightweight--sure, there&#x27;s a weighted ball near the razor to help with balance, but I prefer the heft of the Mach 3 which allows far better control. Then, there are the razors--doing a side-by-side comparison with the Mach 3, I found the BIC did provide a closer shave, but only marginally and it required more time since the blades (packed closely together) tend to collect hair (meaning one needs to pause and rinse more often). And the &amp;#34;precision blade&amp;#34; was all but useless since it needs to be angled *just so* to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, this is a solid razor, especially considering that it&#x27;s a disposable--and light years beyond most of its disposable counterparts, too. The blades are long-lasting and it&#x27;s not uncomfortable to use (actually, I rather preferred the ergonomic design of the handle over the Mach 3).</li>
    <li> My past memory of bic disposable razors is of getting get and feeling like my face had been peeled. This was a much better experience and actually gave a nice shave.</li>
    <li> I thought the metal ball in the handle was hockey, but this is easily the best razor I have ever used. Easy. Forget the three blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thanks for the sliding cover, which maximizes life, especially in the shaving kit. Giving it a little blot after rinsing is a good idea too.  WOW, smoothest and no burn. Great on contours of an older face.</li>
    <li> A disposable razor that is similar to my Gillette Fusion razor is definitely a welcome site.  While it doesn&#x27;t have the heft of my metal Gillette razor, it does feel a bit more substantial in the hand that most disposable razors.  Part of this is related to the silver ball they placed at the top of the handle that gives some balance to the razor&#x27;s feel.  The skeleton style, black and white, design with the metal ball is also industrial modern and cool.  Never seen anything like it in a disposable razor, to be  honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does it shave?  In a word, &amp;#34;GREAT&amp;#34;.  Anytime I try out new shaving equipment, I grow out the beard for a few days and then give it a try.  On the road, I would use Edge Gel, so that is what I used for the test.  It cut through the beard without any problems.  While the shave wasn&#x27;t as close as the shave with my Fusion razor (I ran an electric shaver across it when I was done to listen for the sound of hair being cut and there was more cutting going on than when I would use the Gillette Fusion), it was still very impressive for a disposable razor and you wouldn&#x27;t notice much difference if you were just looking at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I go out of town, I would prefer using a disposable because it means that I have less to carry back home with me.  However, until now, I haven&#x27;t run across a disposable that was up to the task.  However, this disposable is so good that I could use it every day if I didn&#x27;t already have the Fusion setup I have now.  So, in short, I will be picking up more of these for my next trip.</li>
    <li> I really like the BIC Flex 5 razors because they gave me an very clean shave. I was able to go about 3 days without shaving, &amp; the razors didn&#x27;t nick my skin the way many do. I would highly recommend them and will be buying them in the future.</li>
    <li> This is great for fine hair. It will plow right through the fine hair on my legs and the shave is very comfortable - although I prefer the women&#x27;s razors for that. On the thick spiky hair on my husband&#x27;s face, however, it doesn&#x27;t do so well. It tends to tug and get clogged up. It seems like this razor was designed more for thin hair than the tougher man face stubble that it says it&#x27;s for.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this razor I was excited as it reminded me of the more expensive razor that my husband has and loves. I was hoping this would be a more affordable alternative. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get what I was hoping for. Yes this razor works all right, but the main reason I had high hopesbforbit is because of the &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; ball in the middle. Because of its placement I thought that it would give the blade swivel action. This metal ball, however, is not only not metal but it also is merely for decorative purposes and gives the blade no swivel movement at all. So for a razor it&#x27;s okay but it definitely doesn&#x27;t stand up to its more expensive swivel-allowed cousin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and thick facial hair growth, so I&#x27;m very picky about razors.  As a matter of fact, I usually do not like disposable razors, because I can&#x27;t get a clean shave and usually get nicked with them.  I was pleasantly surprised by the BIC Flex Disposable Razor, because I got a very clean shave and no nicks.  By using a thick shaving cream, the razor glides beautifully against my skin.  In addition, by shaking the razor in hot water, I can easily clean the hair residue from the razor.  So far, I&#x27;ve used it for a week and I&#x27;m getting the same beautiful results.  Finally, the protective cover that slides on will allow me to take the razor on trips safely.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have both used this razor,  and both agree it&#x27;s the best disposable we&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;The razor&#x27;s well though out ergonomics coupled with a bit of extra weight make for a razor that&#x27;s comfortable in hand.  Not sure if 5 blades are needed,  but we are happy with the nice close shave that it gives.  We were a bit baffled with the ball and wondered if that was necessary,  but after using the razor really enjoyed  the extra heft that it provided.  It&#x27;s the heaviest disposal either of us has used.  The  beefy handle offers a substantial grip and control.  The razor glides smoothly and did a good job making it&#x27;s way around my knees with no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance wise the Bic Flex 5 looks like a disposable on steroids and is quite impressive.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice razor that does a good job giving a close shave.  Recommended</li>
    <li> This is a great razor BUT here&#x27;s the  deal. FEEL OF THE RAZOR: Unlike some disposables this feels like a more expensive non solid disposable one. And you do a great shave. PULL OF THE BLADES: Most of the time this worked like a dream. One day there was some pull and I almost didn&#x27;t use it again but decided that could have been due t the way the shaving cream came out so I tired it again the same day and after and i didn&#x27;t have the same problem. CLOSENESS: Yes this has a very close shave. I have a little indentation on my chin that is hard to completely shave, due to some surgery after a big car accident. This got rid of the residue quite well. LENGTH OF US: I love, actually, the super cheapo blue razors that you use for a week and throw away. Those wear out after a little more than a week. This razor seems fresh every time you use it. SO WHY LESS THAN FIVE STARS? I&#x27;m unconvinced this razor justifies that argument that five blades on a razor automatically means it&#x27;s shaper. And there is the cost; is it that much of a savings to buy a pack with three of these than the premium razor with five blades? Plus the pull: I&#x27;ve seldom shaved with a razor that even on one day has very notable pull on a bear that was mild at best. WOULD I BUY IT AGAIN? Yes. But I don&#x27;t think this totally makes the case that buying one that works with five blades on it is actually better than finding a cheapo disposable with one blade that works and costs you a fraction less.</li>
    <li> Great razors. Five blades makes your face feel really smooth and makes your face look very clean.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible to cram any more blades on a razor or if it&#x27;s even needed. By the time the fifth blade crosses the same spot there is nothing left but face. I also liked the fact the blades did not get clogged with a couple days growth.</li>
