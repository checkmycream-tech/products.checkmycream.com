<ol>
    <li> love this product for my curly hair</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this was recommended to me instead of a pom.  It actually is pretty good and I think if I had thicker head it would be a good set.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It holds a style very well. I never have to use hairspray with this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Paul Mitchell Super Clean Sculpting Gel for years now.  I have natural curly hair and this product works great at defining the curls.  It never seems heavy or doesn&#x27;t damage my color treated hair.  I had tried another gel product by another manufacturer and didn&#x27;t have any success with my curls.</li>
    <li> This way, I don&#x27;t have to refill so often.  Very convenient</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years! It&#x27;s one if the only gels that can be re-activated with water.  I love being able to walk into a ladies room with the ability to freshen up my hair styling by just wetting my hands. I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, but most make your hair feel dirty and once you have styled your hair you must add more product to make adjustments.</li>
    <li> For just light body this Paul Mitchell clean gel is perfect for light hold. It can be used with blow dry, rollers or just crimping hair in place after shampoo. There is never any sticky residue and you are able to comb, fluff or restyle your hair the same or a second day after use. I have purchased it many times.

    <li> I was more than pleased with the purchase, I have been a Paul Mitchel fan for years, I especially like that you delivered the product qiuckly. I will purchase the product again, Thank You</li>
    <li> Great product, it&#x27;s not too sticky of a hair gel, my kids and husband love the easy to access pump!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this product and we have for years. Nothing else compares! We never let ourselves run out!</li>
    <li> reliable hair setting product.  reasonable price for its performance.  highly recommend its use&lt;br /&gt;1&lt;br /&gt;2&lt;br /&gt;3&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;5&lt;br /&gt;6&lt;br /&gt;7</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why making gel is so hard. Every gel company should take notes from Paul Mitchell. My skin is very sensitive to what I use and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with this gel. Other gel&#x27;s make my head itch, cause small pimples on my scalp and promote dandruff. Back when I tried this gel, all of that went away. Plus it works exactly as I want... It holds my hair and isn&#x27;t sticky. It will keep my hair looking wet until I run my hand through it and then my hair looks dry, but still holds where it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I get my haircut, they put in a foreign gel and sure enough, my head will itch and breakout every time. I continue to let them try other gels just to see if I can find another brand that works as well as Paul Mitchell. So far, I&#x27;ve found nothing that even comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives are this is it&#x27;s getting hard to find. Fewer salons carry the Paul Mitchell line and it&#x27;s getting expensive. $20 is pretty high but it does last over a year.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday for 5 years</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and am often approached about how I get my curls to look so defined and controlled.  This product is the answer!  I finger comb this through my hair when wet, leave-in conditioner also present, and couldn&#x27;t ask for better results.  For reference, I have tight ethnic (middle eastern) curls.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this to me and I was able to find it reasonably priced here on Amazon.  I have thick curly hair that can get out of control and this helps to keep the curls in some semblance of order.  It also freshen up with a little water as well (a good feature ).  I also noticed that it rinses out easily so it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave residue after one rinse and lather.  That makes it good for me because I really do not like to use the harsher shampoos to get rid of buildup and then I have no patience for leaving something on to work product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this and the price as well. I have used drugstore brands and other higher end produucts but this seems to be the best based on the stuff I have tried.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what you think it is. If you&#x27;re familiar with the Paul Mitchell line, this will not be a surprise. The price was right.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My salon doesn&#x27;t sell this size!</li>
    <li> I will never purchase any other gel. A little goes along way. It doesnt get flaky. Great hold i use it alot on my curly hair to slick it back in a ponytail. Lasts all day and i can wet it and it reactivates the hold. Its not heavy.  great purchase. I have sensitive skin and alot of gels dry out my scalp. This one doesnt do that.</li>
    <li> I have used this products for a few years. Provides good hold for my hair. No flaking or residue associated with this product. Cleans out easily when shampooing hair. Received the product quickly, and no problems with the buying and shipping process.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Paul Mitchell!</li>
    <li> Very light but holds my curls in place and calms my frizzes , has no smell and looks very clean on my hair</li>
    <li> I have actually used this for years and still love it.  I have very natural curly hair that is also very frizzy without the jell.  Nothing works as well as this in my opinion</li>
    <li> This is the only styling gel that works for my husband who is growing his hair long.  Hair looks shiny and natural but keeps its curl and shape.</li>
    <li> Have used this gel for years for my naturally curly hair. I love the hold without the crunch factor.</li>
    <li> Appreciate that Paul Mitchell products doesn&#x27;t use animal testing yet produces a product that does exactly what it says it will. The large bottle made this worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this gel it keeps my hair looking fresh and my hair is soft not hard like some other gels</li>
    <li> Holds your hair without being sticky or hard as a rock.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair</li>
    <li> item works as expected on hair.</li>
    <li> This gel gives my hair just enough hold.  I have thick hair and I found this works best.  I would buy it again.</li>
