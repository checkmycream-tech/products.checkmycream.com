      <li>It&#x27;s a rather light scent that stays on your clothes for a couple days, but isn&#x27;t overwhelming to be near.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>Use it if you want to be satisfied for cheap.</li>

      <li>But a great value and had lasting power.</li>
      <li>This cologne is fantastic for the price.</li>
      <li>cheap to buy everything is included like in the picture</li>
      <li>still smells good but is only strong for a couple minutes..</li>
      <li>It is actually quite pleasant for his age group--very fitting because it is light, with just enough of a spicey note to make it appealing.</li>
      <li>It is still good, but its smell is different from the one I used before.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;&#x27;s a pretty strong smell.</li>
      <li>The stuff is real strong and just doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the other colognes Playboy offers.  </li>
      <li>cheap in comparision to other products but still smells good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Its an amazing fragrance and you wont have second thought to why you bought it.</li>
      <li>simple sent, kind of vanilla</li>
      <li>the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
      <li>this is his first choice.</li>
      <li>Buying it online is super cheap compared to in the mall-- and the size is much larger.</li>
      <li>It is a sweet smell which is a nice smelling colone, I&#x27;ve had it about 6 month and use it 5 days out of the week, and use about 4 sprays of it, and it lasted this long, I&#x27;m running low though,</li>
      <li>A base encompasses vetiver, musk, amber, vanilla and sandalwood, leaving a comfortable, warm and erotic finish.</li>

<li> Too bad, because it smells good!</li>
<li> This is a extremely masculine fragance, it last about 4 hours on skin and about 7 hours on clothing.</li>
<li> To the person that said it did not last long, it is a Eau De Toilette, meaning it is used as a skin freshener not as a parfume(spelled like this in french).  </li>
<li> The scent lasts for a fairly long time and he only puts on a spray or two.</li>
<li> Have been using this since a long time.</li>
<li> The bottle was way larger than I expected.</li>
<li> that I don&#x27;t work or live in a smoking environment, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it&#x27;ll come through if you are in either environment.</li>
<li> It smells little bit like Armani Code, but does not have same class/elegance.</li>
<li> I have previously used these perfumes and always get complimented for them...</li>
<li> Not sweet nor spicy.</li>
<li> Everytime my little brother steals one of my colognes</li>
<li> mean it every single time I get compliments for using it.</li>
<li> Longevity on skin is very average.</li>
<li> like, cheep for everyday use,  girls seem to like it</li>
<li> My man wears it as an everyday cologne.</li>
<li> Stupid review needs at least 20 different words.</li>
<li> i feel like it was made wrong.</li>
<li> ; I doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it did singe my nose hairs&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this before and was disappointed when I found out stores in this area stopped carrying it.</li>
<li> This is the worst out of the playboy line.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love perfumes by Playboy. They leave that awesome fragrance to you that confuses people to decide if its strong or subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is a Strong Fragrance. It lasts for a 8-10 hours easily. I have previously used these perfumes and always get complimented for them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean it every single time I get compliments for using it. My girlfriend is head-over-heels when I wear this fragrance. So Mission Accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its an amazing fragrance and you wont have second thought to why you bought it.</li>
    <li> Great smell and fast shipping</li>
    <li> simple sent, kind of vanilla like, cheep for everyday use,  girls seem to like it, maybe it&#x27;s the smell, maybe it&#x27;s the bottle, maybe it&#x27;s me, &amp;#34;maybe it&#x27;s maybelline&amp;#34; idk and not to overpowering</li>
    <li> Love the smell on him. ..</li>
    <li> I always get complimented when I wear this cologne! The ladies love it! Highly recommended. Stupid review needs at least 20 different words.</li>
    <li> Smells good, and the bottle looks good too!  But the smell dosen´t last at all almost!  Too bad, because it smells good!</li>
    <li> My 18 yr old step son requested this for his christmas. I was a bit unsure about it but ordered it anyway. It is actually quite pleasant for his age group--very fitting because it is light, with just enough of a spicey note to make it appealing. Would buy it for him again.</li>
    <li> Top Notes:  Thyme, Mandarin Orange, Bergamot, Elemi resin, Brazilian Rosewood&lt;br /&gt;Middle Notes:  Jasmine, Lavender, Virginia Cedar&lt;br /&gt;Base Notes:  Vetiver, Musk, Sandalwood, Amber, Vanilla&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Fragrantica:  Playboy Hollywood is an oriental-woody fragrance which is ideal for the world of celebrities. It opens with citrusy sparks of mandarin and bergamot, along with aromatic nuances of thyme and elemi. A heart is composed of calming lavender with jasmine, rosewood and cedar, which create a masculine floral union of elegance and subtleness. A base encompasses vetiver, musk, amber, vanilla and sandalwood, leaving a comfortable, warm and erotic finish.</li>
    <li> Bought this as an anniversary gift for my boyfriend. He loves it and I love it! The scent lasts for a fairly long time and he only puts on a spray or two. I love snuggling up to him and not getting a cologne induced headache like i did with his old scents.</li>
    <li> This is the worst out of the playboy line.  I asked my sister who is 19 and she said &amp;#34; I doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it did singe my nose hairs&amp;#34;.  The stuff is real strong and just doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the other colognes Playboy offers.  With all those women at the bunny ranch they couldn&#x27;t have asked there opinion on this one, because im sure all those women would have told them to revise this scent. PERIOD.  but try if for yourself, to each his own.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy&lt;br /&gt;Casual wear ,great for teens&lt;br /&gt;This smells really good&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap to buy everything is included like in the picture</li>
    <li> AS THE TITLE STATES I SMELL LIKE A COMBINATION OF FERGIE AND JESUS. THE LADYS LOVE ME WHEN I WALK INTO THE CLUBS. I HAVE NOT GOTTEN THIS MUCH ATTENTION SINCE I DIDNT BATHE F0R A WEEK LAST MONTH. THANK YOU PLAYBOY FOR MAKING ME THE MAN I AM TODAY.</li>
    <li> Ok so this product is good first off. It is a sweet smell which is a nice smelling colone, I&#x27;ve had it about 6 month and use it 5 days out of the week, and use about 4 sprays of it, and it lasted this long, I&#x27;m running low though, but when I run out I am going to get this again.</li>

    <li> Smells wonderful and lasts a while. I get a lot of compliments on the smell of this.</li>

    <li> There is nothing great to write about. It smells little bit like Armani Code, but does not have same class/elegance. Longevity on skin is very average. Projection is not so great.&lt;br /&gt;I now use it as bathroom freshener!!</li>
    <li> Playboy colognes are the best. I am telling any man, if you love cologne and want to get a great cologne, get this one</li>
