      <li>but besides that i loved it.</li>

      <li>I learned wearing two mascaras makes your lashes look better from You Tube</li>
      <li>I LOVE this - used it for years.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara and have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>The product that I bought at a retail store was better.</li>
      <li>This was my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>I am Mary Wallace and I do love this product</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>Will order more.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I love the extender.  </li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>okay i LoVVEEEE</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m hoping this was just a fluke because I normally love this product for its staying power and easy removal.</li>
      <li>But as far as the product being delivered on time or before time, I have no complaints, the delivery time was great</li>
      <li>The white stuff goes on easily and dries quickly, and the end result gave me the best lashes any mascara has given me.</li>
      <li>The color part of the mascara worked fine to color my lashes.</li>
      <li>so this is a huge bargain.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and does not clump.  </li>
      <li>but it did not go on as smoothly and tended to clump and flake when I never had these issues with this product before.  </li>
      <li>It did arrive on time and its original packaging.</li>
      <li>Which is great when you work long hours.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my absolute favorite mascara</li>
      <li>Lastly this product makes my lashes look good.  </li>
      <li>Mascara was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner, the only thing is one of the wands broke off when I opened it and couldnt use that one!</li>
      <li>This is a true waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>maybe i just got lucky ?</li>
      <li>This is my very first review of any product and must say that I was inspired to write it because I loathe this mascara to this extent.  </li>
      <li>Stays on well and goes on just as good as my absolute favorite, mabelline XXL Pro very black.</li>
      <li>I love the two-step process because the mascara really sets and is completely waterproof.</li>
      <li>I applied the color mascara from wand #2 right over as best as I could, assuming the &#x27;white&#x27; would eventually dry to clear.</li>
      <li>I received quickly, packaged well, and as promised, a new fresh mascara,which has always been the case buying here but not always at retail stores.  </li>
      <li>i always curl my lashes first</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>This is the first mascara that REALLY lengthened my lashes AND made them look fuller!</li>
      <li>No smudging even during hot yoga.</li>
      <li>The product Maybelline Intense XXL Pro Waterproof, Brownish Black Mascara was good</li>
      <li>This product makes your lashes longer and more noticeable, but it does also make it all clump together and even harder to take out.</li>
      <li>My lashes are short and light so unless I have a mascara with some density</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>It definitely gives you full lashes, but at what price?</li>
      <li>I would try all the new ones but would always wind up coming back to this as it never disappointed.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>As I get older my lashes have thinned terribly to near extinction.</li>
      <li>It truly takes an eXtra eXtra Long time to remove it, so the name of this product is appropriately given by Maybelline.  </li>
      <li>It stays on for the whole day and keep the lashes long and curled.</li>
      <li>I finally reverted to my old ways of ordering online while stationed overseas, and BAM!</li>
      <li>I was a little skeptic to try this, but it was SO worth it.</li>
      <li>the product was not dry and it did not make my lashes look clumpy... witch i read in some reveiws</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;m now retired, I don&#x27;t use makeup everyday and when I do, I rarely check myself for &#x27;damages&#x27; once I leave the house, therefore I hadn&#x27;t noticed that the white mascara (?)</li>
      <li>if that had something to do with the result but by far i can say it made my lashes look amazingly long.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve preferred &#x27;waterproof&#x27; mascara as it would better &#x27;set&#x27; my short thin lashes than regular</li>
      <li>i loved the price but the mascara flakes off and what does not come off in flakes is left on your lashes as a greasy film that is difficult to remove...do not like it!</li>
      <li>i did notice i had to dip the black in sometimes to get it to spread around the whole brush</li>

<li> My lashes appear really long.  </li>
<li> It may have been an bit old, because it seemed dried out.</li>
<li> Not sure if it was old or defective</li>
<li> but if you try to sleep with it on it gets a little clumpy The next day.</li>
<li> It was received well packaged and was exactly as expected.</li>

<li> I love the white base coat--</li>
<li> The base coat holds the top coat on all day and helps emphasize my lashes.</li>
<li> try using the #2 wand by itself until I find something else to replace it with, but I would not recommend this mess to anyone.</li>
<li> In the past, I have purchased other brands of mascara for three times the price that don&#x27;t perform as well.</li>
<li> Messy to apply.</li>
<li> Would have given 5 stars but some of the tubes were dried out...  </li>
<li> As usual Maybelline has a winner.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually wear the waterproof mascara, but purchased this for an upcoming cruise.</li>
<li> Not sure what happened</li>
<li> so im not sure</li>
<li> hard to remove it because it is WATERPROOF</li>
<li> Hard to remove.</li>
<li> Very hard to find - think Maybelline discontinued it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sorry it was discontinued.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t found the replacement product, unfortunately.</li>

    <li> I love this mascara and have been using it for years. My lashes are short and light so unless I have a mascara with some density, my lashes don&#x27;t show at all. I love the two-step process because the mascara really sets and is completely waterproof. No smudging even during hot yoga. In the past, I have purchased other brands of mascara for three times the price that don&#x27;t perform as well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i loved the price but the mascara flakes off and what does not come off in flakes is left on your lashes as a greasy film that is difficult to remove...do not like it!</li>
    <li> As usual Maybelline has a winner.  My only wish is for a truly waterproof mascara that holds up when teaching hours in a pool environment.</li>
    <li> I wish this was not a discontinued product--it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find and it&#x27;s my absolute favorite mascara</li>
    <li> The product Maybelline Intense XXL Pro Waterproof, Brownish Black Mascara was good I liked it also but to me it did not give me the long  lashes that it promised it would give. But as far as the product being delivered on time or before time, I have no complaints, the delivery time was great the packaging was very good.</li>
    <li> This product makes your lashes longer and more noticeable, but it does also make it all clump together and even harder to take out.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara.It stays on all day and all night! Which is great when you work long hours.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear the waterproof mascara, but purchased this for an upcoming cruise. Stays on well and goes on just as good as my absolute favorite, mabelline XXL Pro very black.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and does not clump.  I love the extender.  My lashes appear really long.  Does not flake or rub off during the day.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara while traveling and absolutely loved it. I seared far and wide at all my local stores, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I finally reverted to my old ways of ordering online while stationed overseas, and BAM! I found it :) Sooo happy over this find!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores so was very happy to find it online again. Hope Maybelline brings it back!</li>
    <li> I love the white base coat--just don&#x27;t forget the topcoat or you&#x27;ll have a bit of an other-worldly look :). The base coat holds the top coat on all day and helps emphasize my lashes. Great product that is now discontinued. I haven&#x27;t found the replacement product, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars but some of the tubes were dried out...  some to the point of garbage bin.</li>
    <li> muy bueno todo ,envio rapido  buen precio buena cualidad recibido mas o menos en el tiempo previsto&lt;br /&gt;los recomendo good purchase ....ok</li>
    <li> This discontinued mascara is one of my favorites.  It was received well packaged and was exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any visible volume, even after using for a week.  I don&#x27;t care for the primer stuff, but would use it if it worked!  The color part of the mascara worked fine to color my lashes.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic to try this, but it was SO worth it. The white stuff goes on easily and dries quickly, and the end result gave me the best lashes any mascara has given me. Great for someone looking to lengthen and volumize their lashes!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  I&#x27;m so sorry it was discontinued.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite. Messy to apply. Hard to remove.</li>
    <li> It may have been an bit old, because it seemed dried out. The product that I bought at a retail store was better. Oh well. It happens</li>
    <li> I LOVE this - used it for years.  Very hard to find - think Maybelline discontinued it.  The primer is the best ever made - wish it was available by itself.</li>
    <li> Works really good but if you try to sleep with it on it gets a little clumpy The next day.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite mascara. I would try all the new ones but would always wind up coming back to this as it never disappointed. However, this time was different. Not sure if it was old or defective but it did not go on as smoothly and tended to clump and flake when I never had these issues with this product before.  It did arrive on time and its original packaging. Not sure what happened but I&#x27;m hoping this was just a fluke because I normally love this product for its staying power and easy removal.</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes look reallllllllllllllly long!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;.. ... ... ... ... ... ... .. ... . .. . . .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, so I&#x27;ve seen mascara&#x27;s come and go...for longer than I&#x27;d like to admit. As I get older my lashes have thinned terribly to near extinction. I&#x27;ve preferred &#x27;waterproof&#x27; mascara as it would better &#x27;set&#x27; my short thin lashes than regular formulas.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m now retired, I don&#x27;t use makeup everyday and when I do, I rarely check myself for &#x27;damages&#x27; once I leave the house, therefore I hadn&#x27;t noticed that the white mascara (?) on wand #1 with what I will assume are the lengthening fibers stays visibly white, like children&#x27;s bottled glue!! I applied the color mascara from wand #2 right over as best as I could, assuming the &#x27;white&#x27; would eventually dry to clear. You know what they say about &amp;#34;assuming&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;As others experienced, this does give a nice illusion of a raccoon, if you like that sort of look.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try using the #2 wand by itself until I find something else to replace it with, but I would not recommend this mess to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am Mary Wallace and I do love this product</li>
    <li> I never used this mascara b4 it made my eyelashes still together and made them clumpy but it made them look longer</li>
    <li> This is a true waterproof mascara. It stays on for the whole day and keep the lashes long and curled. I go to the GYM and this is the only Mascara will stay on without smudging. LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was very fast and the price is great.</li>
    <li> okay i LoVVEEEE this mascara ! it sales at Walmart for somewhere about 7 dollars so this is a huge bargain. i received this mascara within 2 days of me ordering it and i got standard shipping ! i always curl my lashes first so im not sure if that had something to do with the result but by far i can say it made my lashes look amazingly long. the product was not dry and it did not make my lashes look clumpy... witch i read in some reveiws it did. maybe i just got lucky ? i did notice i had to dip the black in sometimes to get it to spread around the whole brush but besides that i loved it. oh and its also reallyyyyy!!!!!!!!!! hard to remove it because it is WATERPROOF so i recommend using a makeup remover to remove the mascara or lotion (as i did) ! hope this helps i will be buying more !!</li>
    <li> I like this product as I like the white primer that comes with it, as well as the mascara itself.  I have no problems with clumping, and it stays intact through my day, including work which makes me sweat and still it remains looking good.  I normally wear only black but recently began coloring my hair red, so the color works well in that way too.  The seller was great too.  I received quickly, packaged well, and as promised, a new fresh mascara,which has always been the case buying here but not always at retail stores.  Lastly this product makes my lashes look good.  They aren&#x27;t really short or sparse just not like they used to be when I was younger.  I learned wearing two mascaras makes your lashes look better from You Tube and this is one of the mascaras i use.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Mascara was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner, the only thing is one of the wands broke off when I opened it and couldnt use that one! So I was out that one, never had that to happen before! Would be nice if Seller sent another one to replace that one, but am sure that wont happen!</li>
    <li> This is my very first review of any product and must say that I was inspired to write it because I loathe this mascara to this extent.  It truly takes an eXtra eXtra Long time to remove it, so the name of this product is appropriately given by Maybelline.  Additionally, it sweats on to my eyelids and under my eyes in a very short amount of time.  It definitely gives you full lashes, but at what price?</li>
    <li> Great.  Will order more.</li>
    <li> This was a big surprise! This is the first mascara that REALLY lengthened my lashes AND made them look fuller!</li>
