<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This eye pillow is great after a long day. The material is soft and silky and cool to the touch, and the blue pattern is pretty. Plus, the lavender smells great! I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars, however, because of the zipper. I understand that some people will want to take the cover off of the pouch to wash it or maybe heat it up, but I figure that my eyes are never that dirty . . . and it&#x27;s not like this pillow is for public use, and I prefer the cooling effect. But the zipper is very cold and hard, and I have to be sure to position the pillow so that it doesn&#x27;t touch my face (metal on skin is not exactly relaxing). However, this is just a small flaw and overall I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this eye pillow. The lavender smells wonderful and is very calming during Savasanah. I highly recommend this !</li>
    <li> I got this to rest across my eyes when I have a migraine. Its wonderful. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong, and the weight is pleasant. The back of this is satin which is nice. I haven&#x27;t used it much yet but it seems as though it will hold up to use.</li>
    <li> I love my Savasana Now Aromatherapy Yoga Eye Pillow. It is so soft and it the aromas are wonderful. It is very calming. I use it for my yoga practice and in my acupuncture practice. The Eye Pillow comes highly recommended. And the price is right.</li>
    <li> Great product and amazing customer service. Received my order less than 24 hours after placement. On Memorial Day, no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pillow is fantastic. Nice quality, the lavender smells divine (not too strong), and I love the idea that I can heat the pouch inside or freeze it. I suffer from migraines and can see myself reaching for this frequently. I&#x27;ve also taken it to my monthly massage appointment. My massage therapist liked it so much, she&#x27;s planning to order a few for her business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a nice carrying pouch as well. I haven&#x27;t downloaded the free audio meditations yet, but I will do so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely planning to purchase another and will most assuredly order from Savasana Now again!</li>
    <li> I really love this EYE PILLOW. The effects are both relaxing and soothing. After a long day of working it is a very helpful tool for me to relax and regain some much needed rest. Thank you for this wonderful gift. I will be sure to recommend this to my clients.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and looks exactly like the image pictured. The materials are high quality. I like the smell of lavender and expect it to be fragrant. The fact I can heat the inner bag is a plus.</li>
    <li> Excellent little pillow for eyes &amp; forehead!</li>
    <li> I have had my Savasana Now Eye Pillow for a few weeks now, and I must say, it is excellent. I initially used it mainly for the cooling effect on my eyes and forehead, which is great. The granules inside keep the cold for a long while. The cover is a nice silk-like fiber that feels great on the skin creating a buffer for the cold. Today, I used it for the heating aspect. What a treat! After about 40 seconds in the microwave (take it out of the cover since it has a metal zipper), I placed it on my eyes and forehead. The aromatherapy was released with heat (more so than the cold) and was very soothing. The Savasana Now Eye Pillow is a quality product that is versatile and a great value. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful product. The fabric is a soft, lovely satin and the size is perfect to cover my eyes. And the lavender smell is light and calming.  I liked this so much that I ordered a second one for my husband. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Eye Pillows are very nice</li>
    <li> Love this eye pillow! It is just the right size and weight. The smell is heavenly and the fabric is beautiful. I love the fact that it is washable too. The pillow comes in a carrying case so it stays off the floor until you are ready for it during yoga.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to apply heat to my eyes. The silk slipcover has a zipper, so it must be removed before being microwaved.  That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but the zipper opening is tiny compared to the bag of flax seed, making it very difficult to put back in before it loses its heat.  It does smell nice.</li>
    <li> Very relaxing! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she really enjoys it. The scent is very nice and the fabric is of high quality. Purchasing experience was easy. It came right away!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to enhance your yoga or for general relaxation.</li>
    <li> The Savasana eye pillow with lavender is great. The scent is actual lavender, not the artificial one sometimes used. The pillow is larger than many you can get, which makes it more comfortable, not feeling it might slip off. The fabric is luxurious and sensual. I like the drawstring bag that it comes with, and the earplugs. The whole package. Ones in a handy box, convenient for storing. I always like to have my own pillow rather than using ones that other people have handled and had on their sweaty faces. This is a winner!</li>
    <li> Great product but if you are reading this review Savasana, pls make the zipper opening larger so that when I take out the inside to microwave, it is more efficient. Right now, it is too difficult and incovnenient to take out. It is only a construction problem.</li>
    <li> After having open abdominal surgery last year,  which has caused me constant pain I decided to buy this eye pillow for therapeutic reasons.  Warming the lavender eye pillow and placing it on my scar has provided much needed pain relief, other heating  devices like gel pads are just too heavy and I found this pillow not to be too heavy, but just right.      It is smooth, silky, no problems with it falling off my eyes at night while going to sleep. Breathing in the lavender smell helps me to relax and go to sleep easier.    I have slowly started to get back into Pilates &amp; placing the pillow on my forehead while doing some of my exercises has had a relaxing effect, and helped me to start enjoying my Pilates once again.</li>
    <li> For the last ten years or so, my migraines have been so intense and painful, if locking myself in a dark room does not help, I end up having to visit the ER for a shot. I do NOT like taking pharmaceutical medicine of any sort (as with most people). When I saw this Eye Pillow, I knew I had to try it. Last night, I had a stress migraine that was putting me in tears so I tried this. After falling asleep with it covering my eyes, I woke up relieved to find my migraine gone!! There are two different ways to use this: cold or hot. Since it obviously takes longer for something to cool down, I already had this chilling in the freezer for a couple hours. (Be sure to place the Eye Pillow inside a zip lock bag before placing it in the freezer as to no ruin it.) To warm it, simply remove the inner sack from the pillow case and place in the microwave for 20-30 seconds. (The pillow case has a zipper closure and you do NOT want to put metal in the microwave!!) The Eye Pillow itself is made from natural lavender and flaxseed but surprisingly, the smell is NOT overwhelming!! It is more of a relaxing, peaceful aroma that almost immediately helps your body relax and unwind. The pillow case is a very soft, silk that helps the Eye Pillow conform to your facial curves to completely block out light. There are no uncomfortable straps; the pillow will sit comfortably in place. Without the straps, you can also place this on the back of your neck, shoulders, or wherever to help relieve the pressure and tightness of your muscles, too. I noticed that this also helped to reduce the puffiness in my eyes making me look more alert. Weighing a little over six ounces, this is NOT too heavy feeling either. It measures roughly 5 inches by 9 inches, this is long enough to cover both your eyes completely or curve comfortably around the back of your neck. They include a very nice, vinyl like, draw string closure, carry bag to help keep it clean while not in use or to take with you on the go. This is most definitely the BEST Eye Pillow with MANY different uses I have used yet!! I will be keeping this around for a very long time!!

    <li> I haven&#x27;t yet used this but....it seems very good quality &amp; smells wonderful!! I&#x27;m a migraine sufferer of 45 years &amp; thought this sounded like something I&#x27;d use to lay over my eyes plus it can be heated or put in the freezer to make it cold.</li>
    <li> I received my Savasana Now Eye Pillow as a gift and LOVE it! I use it on my forehead, eyes and behind my neck to relax in bed. The lavender scent is subtle but pleasant, and I love waking up to that. I&#x27;ll have to order another one soon; my 3 year old grand daughter insists on having the pillow on her face when she sleeps with me.</li>
    <li> Enjoying this Eye Pillow, the options to have it heated or cooled makes even more appealing.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This helps  me, it&#x27;s kind of slippery but if I like down then put it on it stays. I am using it for headaches, I am keeping it in the freezer till I need it. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I Love my eye pillow.. I use it every day... I saw similar ones at a Yoga retreat in Massachusetts .. 2 x&#x27;s as much money and yours is just as nice..&lt;br /&gt;I just wish you had more colors. I would have preferred a darker one, purple or maroon would have been nice. The fabric is lovely, but if I place it over my eyes when I have not removed my eye makeup you can see the mascara on it... Oh Well I guess I will be washing it often.</li>
    <li> I DID HELP ME SOME AND WAS VERY SOOTHING BUT DIDN&#x27;T STAY COOLD FOR VERY LONG.</li>
    <li> The Eye Pillow is a great addition to my migraine relief aids. I put the eye pillow into a Ziploc bag and put it in the freezer until I was ready for bed. First, the pillow doesn&#x27;t get so cold that it is uncomfortable to place on your eyes/head/neck. The eye pillow is a soft silk which feels really good on your skin when on the colder side. The scent of lavender/flax seed was very relaxing indeed. It isn&#x27;t overpowering, I think it is a perfect relaxing amount. The audio that comes included was very peaceful and relaxing as well. After a hectic day it was nice to be able to relax and fall asleep.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product! high-quality, better than expected. Outstanding customer service. I use for eye pressure, stress, and sleep. Very effective. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Very nice eye pillow! I use this eye pillow for yoga. Perfect size, great weight, and the lavender smell is just enough to be relaxing without being overpowering. Love that it has its own storage bag to keep it clean and for travel. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> At yoga class, the instructor hands out similar lavender pillows towards the end of class. So I thought it would be nice to have one at home and found this on Amazon. Love it, and also ordered one for a relative with health problems. It also comes with a nice storage bag, and a CD (have not listened to it yet).</li>
    <li> CoolStuffToYou got this one right in opinion. This is a small but the pillow brings many benefit to it when you hot and it will release the lavender small immediately to your senses, cold the pillow do the same but at a slower rate. If you do any form of medication this will enhance the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lavender has many benefits for our body and with our busy schedules we just don’t take the time to explore what Lavender does for our bodies daily functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoolStuffToYou gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product</li>
    <li> I love this eye pillow.  The lavender scent is very relaxing and the weight is just right on my eyes.  I can recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful &amp; very well made. I&#x27;m thinking of getting a few to use for gifts with the holidays in mind. So far, I&#x27;ve only used mine in my yoga class, but can see several great uses for it in the future, including when I have migraines.</li>
    <li> I love my new eye pillow.  It is soft and smells wonderful and is just the right weight.  I use it for Savasanah in my yoga practice.</li>
    <li> This eye pillow is a very good quality, soft again my face, nice lavender scent. I love the carrying case for when I travel. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how it does with hand washing.</li>
    <li> Daughter LOVES this!!</li>
    <li> I am highly pleased with my eye pillow!</li>
    <li> This eye pillow smells so wondrous and the light lavender smell helped to relax me. This eye pillow is definitely a sensory relaxation tool. It undoubtedly helped ease my stress and tension from a long day at work. I normally have slight insomnia and this allowed me to get rest and sleep. It felt like it had granules of lavender and another light scent that induced an aura of calmness for me. The pillow applied the right amount of gentle acupressure to my eyes. The fabric was soft and silk like that it felt cool to the touch. This pillow was an excepted relief for my migraine that came on suddenly that it helped relieve my eye pressure.&lt;br /&gt;***I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion***</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  It&#x27;s soft and smells great.  It&#x27;s the perfect eye pillow for relaxation/meditation after my yoga class!</li>
    <li> I do not practice yoga but received this pillow as a gift last year.  I primarily use this when I go to bed at night.  Once settled in, I cover my eyes and inhale the wonderful scents and fall asleep every night.  It is a great way to end my busy day!</li>
    <li> Another great gift for someone who&#x27;s been a great help to me.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Beautiful pillow, case and quickly received after ordering , thank you!</li>
    <li> I loved the pillow when it arrived, but in less than a months time the lavender smell has disappeared.  This, plus the fact the zipper pull half the time hits my nose left me disliking the product.  The zipper issue is easily resolved (I flip it over) but lacking the smell defeats the aromatherapy purpose I bought it for.</li>
    <li> I have trouble falling asleep. Now I warm the insert and put it back in the case and lay the warm pillow over my eyes. Between the warmth and the wonderful lavender smell, I am now out like a light.  Sweet dreams!</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this eye pillow.  I have used it every day since I received it.  I got it because I get sinus headaches a lot right behind my eyes. It comes with a nice case on the pillow.  You take it out of the case and heat it in the microwave for about 20 to 30 seconds put it back in the cover and place it over your eyes.  It is so relaxing.  It helps soothe my headaches.  It does have a lavender scent so if you are sensitive to lavender I would be cautious.  You can also use it cold, although I have not tried that yet.  It comes with directions that are easy to follow.  The only thing I would have to say is that the zippered area where you remove the eye pillow to heat or cool it is a bit small so it takes a little bit of time to get the eye pillow back in the protective case.  It would be nice if the opening was just a bit larger.  Oh, and as an added bonus you get a carrying bag with it so you can take it anywhere you  need to.  I would not hesitate to buy it again.  I did receive this product for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> The lavender eye pillow smells good. It relaxes me and easies the stress of a busy day. I am able to fall right a sleep. I just love it. I would buy another.</li>
    <li> I love this eye pillow! I use this for my clients in spa sessions, and they love it too!</li>
    <li> I love it. The pillow smells fantastic and really has relaxing effect. When I sniff it I forget everything. It has decent size which means it covers a face-area upward of a nose. The product was delivered very quickly. I wood recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I carefully chose this eye pillow after weighing the many options available through Amazon. I wanted something elegant to use with clients as part of my therapy practice. The pillow exceeded my expectations. The material is lovely, the embroidered pattern richly stitched. Colors are exactly the soothing shade I was hoping for. The weight of the pillow feels just right to stay put and aid in relaxation. And the scent is just right as well. At first I thought it might actually be too strong, but once you put it over your eyes what remains is a soothing scent that&#x27;s complementary rather than overpowering. I also like that the filling is in a separate bag so you can easily remove it to wash the outer covering. I would happily buy this product again. It adds just the right amount of subtle sophistication to my professional work.</li>
    <li> The Savasana Now pillow is perfect for travelers like me. I recently brought my eye pillow on a cross country trip-was able to tune out the other passengers while peacefully relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a health care professional responsible for guiding patients with relaxation techniques, the Savasana Now pillow is on my reccommendation list. From soothing essential oil scents to the either warm or cold versatility it offers, the pillow offers relief from tension. I definitely suggest getting one for home and office to help unwind and relax!</li>
    <li> Love the eye pillow, very comfortable.  The company I ordered this from is very professional.</li>
    <li> I use the pillow a bit differently than suggested and find it very relaxing.  In the wee hours of the morning, my neck often feels stiff,and I have trouble falling back to sleep.  I find the pillow to be just the perfect size to ease the tight muscles in my neck.  Of course I keep the eye pillow next to my bed,  where it is readily available..  We  need all the help we can find to ease tension these days.  This eye pillow is the perfect size for me, unlike others which are heavy and bulky.  Oh yes,  I do also use it as an eye pillow!</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my father on father&#x27;s day and he loves it. I had to sneak a peek to make sure it was legit before wrapping it up. I found the lavender to be very fresh and the pillow itself had a nice weight for its intended purpose with a silky textured cover. The product was exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> Soft and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Excellent items,love it</li>
    <li> I bought three of these...one for a sister in law who is ill, one for a daughter with migraines and one for ME.  So far all of us love them and feel quite relaxed.</li>
    <li> Very lovely fabric, pattern and aroma! Reasonably priced for nice quality.  Packaging super good, unexpected decals and ability to dowload audio a bonus.  And the follow up from customer service was an extra special touch.</li>
    <li> The Savasana Now eyepillow has helped me with multiple parts of my life. Not only do i use it for savasana in yoga, but i also like to use it in the morning if i am having trouble sleeping with the morning sun that is rising earlier. If i am ever feeling tension or stress, i just pick up my eyepillow and as soon as i have it nearby i can already smell the lavender from it. The soothing smell of lavender instantly helps to soothe me, while the flax seed that is in the pillow offers the slightest bit of pressure to allow my eyes to relax and bring me into a state of calmness. When using this pillow in yoga i like to use it for restorative classes or savasana. When using it off the mat it comes with multiple uses. Sometimes i even use it cold for headaches, or warm for body aches. And at night if i have a hard time falling asleep, i know to reach for my eyepillow. Love this eyepillow!</li>
