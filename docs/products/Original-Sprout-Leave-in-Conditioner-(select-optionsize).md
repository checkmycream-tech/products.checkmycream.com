<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smell nice and keeps my bi-racial granddaughters hair moisturized.  With this product, the detangler and Sweet Pea Curl Serum she is definitely a &amp;#34;hot tot&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Saw a recommendation for Original Sprout on a parenting community.  My daughter (1 1/2) has super fine hair and because it is winter, it is super static-y right now.  I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since nothing else has helped.  First off, this stuff smells amazing.  It smells just like you walked out of a salon.  And it left her hair soft, easy to comb through and did not weight her down.  The next day - no static.  That night, after washing my own hair, I stole a bit and found my hair looked GREAT the next day.  Again, not heavy, super soft, and my curls were more defined.  (I bought the curl product too and also love it).  I am getting 2 bottles of this - one to keep in her bathroom and one in mine so I don&#x27;t have to walk across the house to get some!  Love that it is natural, good for the entire family and again the scent.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We love this product for our daughters thick yet fine hair. She is constantly getting knots. When we use this, the knots just slide out. Love that it is chemical free.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well and smells amazing. Worth spending the few extra bucks to get something that is free of garbage and actually works!</li>
    <li> Works really well keeping my very curly hair from being impossible to brush. I can now brush before it&#x27;s wet and has a handful of conditioner in it. Nice stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!!  Makes hair smell soft and smells good</li>
    <li> Over-rated gook!  This product left my hair heavy and weighted down.  Save your money and go for a drugstore brand, which work better than this.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly hair that is hard to get a comb through. We use this product after she bathes, and our comb goes through her hair without a problem.</li>
    <li> Love the  product  wrap  better for shipping</li>
    <li> Love love love this product !!</li>
    <li> Recommended by friends. Leaves kids hair looking great, especially if it&#x27;s curly. Gives the curls a nice healthy shine. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old toddler hair is curly however, product &amp;#34;leave in conditioner&amp;#34; does not provide adequate moisture</li>
    <li> This is excellent for children&#x27;s long hair. easier to detangle and comb and stays that way for most of the day.</li>
    <li> We tried many different products looking for something to help our little girl&#x27;s thick, fine hair.  This product line is amazing.  We combine the leave-in with the miracle detangler and a drop of the Tahitian hair oil.  What can I say, it has saved our relationship!  I used to literally have to chase her around to brush out her tangles.  This product line has saved time and tears, is all natural and does not irritate her delicate skin.  I cannot praise it enough.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thin, curly hair and we have tried about everything to keep it as tangle free as possible.  Not only does it smell AMAZING (I even use it!), but it does the trick.  We add a few pumps into her tresses every night before bed.  The cost is worth the results!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I have a 5 year old daughter who insists on growing her hair long! She has a lot of fine blonde hair that is always tangled and this stuff combined with the &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; has made our lives so much easier and almost completely free of &amp;#34;ow mommy!&amp;#34;s :)&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my niece&#x27;s hair, which is super thick, and she has a ton of it, and it worked beautifully. HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who wants to make their lives easier with long hair either on you or your child!&lt;br /&gt;Can be used on wet OR dry hair.</li>
    <li> Original Sprout is a fantastic line. Organic, no tears, smells good, and makes my kiddos hair soft as silk. I even use it now:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched far and wide for regular conditioners, spray in conditioners, leave in conditioners, etc, for my kiddo.  Nothing seemed to work on her fine-but-thick, very wavy, easily tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff..this stuff works without ruining her lovely waves.  Her hair is soft, and shiny.  And brushing her hair is no longer a painstaking exercise in trying not to snag and pull at her locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem pricey, but a little goes a long way.  I really recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Thrilled to find this on Amazon, I never thought to look!  It is about $8 less than buying from the salon.  I have been using Leave-In Conditioner for years for both my 8 year old daughter (fine, thinner hair; half Asian) and myself (thick, coarse, straight Asian hair).  All you need is a little dab about dime sized (not a full pump).  If you use too much then you won&#x27;t be able to work it into your hair.  I wash my hair daily with shampoo only (no rinse out conditioner) and use Leave-In Conditioner daily on damp hair, mostly on the ends to keep them from being dried out from using heat rollers.  I follow the same routine for my daughter with an even smaller amount.  This product is a lifesaver for us in the summer when we are in the sun at the beach and pool.  You can even put a little in your hair before you go in the water to help protect your hair.  I always take it with us on vacation to Maui.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Great for 2 year old hair!</li>
    <li> My young daughter has soft curly hair...  no more crying or hair pulling.  Very light weight in the hair.  Love that you can use it on wet OR dry hair.  That solved my problem to taming dry hair!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it on my kids for 2 years now. Very happy!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic, smooth kid hair, smells great!</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft and manageable!! great for kids!!</li>
    <li> Gets out my daughters big tangles easily, leaves her hair soft and smelling good.</li>
    <li> LEAVES GR. DAUGHTER HAIR SHINY AND MANAGEABLR. SMEELS NICE TOO.</li>
    <li> After years of fighting with my girls to let me brush their hair, I finally found a formula that works great for us! This conditioner is part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always put this conditioner in their hair after a bath (where I use just a cheap shampoo, maybe a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner). Their hair usually dries easy to brush through and there&#x27;s no static. Sometimes after they sleep on it, it gets a little knotty, so I spray [[ASIN:B002B8BCA6 Original Sprout 12 oz Miracle Detangler]] in it and then brush it with [[ASIN:B0031ZV8OS Denman Tangle Tamer-Pink]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products all work so well. I&#x27;m so happy to have found things for my kids&#x27; hair that they and I love!! I highly recommend all of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a leave in conditioner for a long time. I wanted something that was natural but everything I was trying smelled really bad &amp; would leave my hair oily the next morning. My friend recommended this because her daughter had very dry curly hair. This stuff is AMAZING! I use it for myself and my 4 year old son. My last bottle lasted me over 6 months. A little bit goes a long way. It really shines and softens our hair. Highly recommend. I&#x27;m cheap but this is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Very nice on my kids hair.</li>
    <li> goods on smoothly, leaves curly hair curly all day and night.  No annoying scents, organic and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this at one those hair places for kids and I loved it.  i finally ran out of it so hence the Amazon purchase.  Makes my kids hair smell great and if one puts it in their hair while still wet and then brushes it will reduce tangles.  Thankful this is a leave-in conditioner instead of a washout since it makes for an easier bath time.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and makes my son&#x27;s hair feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t work very well for my mixed (1/4 Asian, 1/4 Black, 1/2 white) baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I have long,dry, curly hair and it gets all knotted up. It is slowly beginning to dread. Tried this product and it didn&#x27;t help detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> I can hardly think of the appropriate words to praise the Sprout products.  I have had great success with the detangler spray, so I thought I would try this as well.  It&#x27;s really effective and leaves my hair so soft and manageable without weighing it down.  I have long, thick hair, but the strands are thin.  Very prone to breakage.  If your hair is fragile like mine, this leave-in conditioner is perfect for getting a comb or a Wet Brush (LOVE!!) through it without ripping and tearing through the tangles.  My favorite combo...Sprout detangler, leave-in conditioner, and the awesome Wet Brushes.  Very happy with my purchases.  This seller is reliable...packs product very well and ships fast.  I will buy more from them when I run out.  Thumbs up to another great Amazon seller!!</li>
    <li> This has really made our lives easier.  No more fights over brushing my son&#x27;s curly hair.  We use the miracle detangler too. The smell is nice and you only need a little.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and breaks out in rashes easily and this has been wonderful. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> My toddler has wavy hair that needs conditioner after every shampoo.  This doesn&#x27;t condition as well as  John Masters Organics (which is also a leave in conditioner.) I struggle to comb through her hair after Original Sprout. But, not with John Masters.</li>
    <li> I recently went natural and I use this product in my hair every day both after a wash and in between. My hair smeel so good and looks healthy. It a great leave in.</li>
    <li> Softens my hair very nicely! Although if you apply too much and close to the roots it does make your hair look a bit oily. Overall great product, just use on mid-shaft to ends!</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner, except for the price.  Aside from my pocket feeling lighter, the product helps to save me time and actually a bit of money in that I don&#x27;t need to use rinse out conditioner in my shower.  It&#x27;s very concentrated and will last some time if used sparingly.  There is no overwhelming smell.  Whether I let my hair dry naturally or blow dry, my hair always results in being silky and manageable.  If I use rinse out conditioner in the shower, I prefer not to use this product because then my hair is weighted down and looks stringy.  Try using this in place of your rinse out conditioner and see if you don&#x27;t like the results.  A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t lather it on.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! My daughter and I both have thick wavy ie prone to tangles hair and I love using this on both of is. Really helps with the tangles!! Makes our hair nice and soft plus it smells great too! This is a staple in our after shower routine!</li>
    <li> The Original Sprout line is fantastic. Clean smelling, tear-free and without damaging or harmful chemicals. My daughter has been using it since her first haircut at 2. She is six now. We use the shampoo, conditioner and curl calmer (daily). As a result, Bella has fantastic, curly, frizz-free hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Makes your hair feel smooth and silky. And you don&#x27;t need  a whole lot, just a little in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it makes my and my daughter&#x27;s hair feel.</li>
    <li> Take this from someone who&#x27;s spent probably $300 on hair products that failed to work. My boyfriend&#x27;s aunt is a salonist and she showed me original sprout products. I started off with the shampoo &amp; conditioner and it has done AMAZING things for my hair. Better than anything  I have EVER used. Now I decided to try a treatment to keep my hair healthy and when I first used this, it was amazing. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and it goes through your hair so nicelyy. It smells amazing and it truly does keep your haiir soft and less frizzy. Even my boyfriend said so! Worth that bit of money!</li>
    <li> This is THE ONLY product we can use on our girls hair! We have super curly and perfectly straight, both fairly medium to thick hair. It is a product we have and will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! My boss used it on her toddlers hair and she suggested it to me when I was griping about the high price of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m African American (with a white father and African mother) with natural hair. My hair has a range of different textures which can make finding the right product challenging -  I twist it if I want it curly of comb/brush it thru and let it air dry if I want it without defined curls. This is a light weight product (light on scent too, thank you!) but heavy enough to hold the curl formation for a couple of days even with attending the gym and bootcamp class! and I&#x27;m bouncing around and sweating a lot plus sleeping on it! Granted I use a silk pillow case and I do have to use a heavier gel if I want to pull it back in a bun but it works great on curls - highly recommend and it&#x27;s so inexpensive with natural products - yay!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love... it makes my daughter&#x27;s fine hair super soft and shiny.  It also smells great.</li>
    <li> Love love love this for my kIds! ! Use the shampoo and leave in conditioner. Both my kids have sensitive skin and scalps and this works great.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to use in my 4-year old daughter&#x27;s hair because it has been SO staticy this winter.  I put this in her hair before using the hair dryer and it works WONDERS!  Her hair finally looks normal again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!! We first purchased it in 2009 at a kids hair cutting place. I started using it for myself and it&#x27;s the only leave in product I&#x27;ll use. It&#x27;s great to detangle and works wonders with my crazy frizz. I love it so much I&#x27;m afraid to use any other product in their line!</li>
