      <li>I love the smell...</li>
      <li>sure there is something better.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m confident of even better results with continued use.</li>

      <li>Pretty good oil....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overly strong, but more pleasing than the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is light and actually really nice, it fades quickly and does not bother me at all.</li>
      <li>Id love to tell you how great this product was, but someone ripped the package open and stole it out of my mailbox before&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Easy to work into your beard.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and overpowering.</li>
      <li>First off, the name is amazing.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice at first</li>
      <li>It made my beard easy to manage and silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I liked the product in general, smells nice and does soften the beard.</li>
      <li>After a single use, my beard became much more tamed, manageable, and this stuff smells great, but not overbearing at all.</li>
      <li>Much prefer Honest Amish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments of how nice my beard looks all thanks to this</li>
      <li>and this balm really makes it smell really nice.</li>
      <li>The scent it gives off throughout the day is great, not too strong or strange.</li>
      <li>Firstly, customer service is amazing,Jeannette reached out to me to make sure that i didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
      <li>I was also worried that it would have strong smell that I would notice all day below my nose in my &#x27;stachell region, but it has a mild fresh scent that you don&#x27;t really notice when it&#x27;s on; nothing that overpowers my own intoxicating, pheromone rich musk.</li>
      <li>Smells great, I don&#x27;t have a long beard, mine is still close to the skin, but a full beard.</li>
      <li>Clean woodsy smell.</li>
      <li>But they&#x27;re also popular with the ladies right now, meaning that a lot of guys are taking the journey to Real Man Land, which is full of beards and high-functioning alcoholism.</li>
      <li>I swear by this stuff, my beard looks amazing and feels velvety soft.</li>
      <li>More oil than wax, will not help unruly beards stay straight.</li>
      <li>Not a bad product, but</li>
      <li>Luckily I came across this stuff and gave it a shot</li>
      <li>, it got a little bit softer, easier to brush, nice shine to it, and most importantly kept the strays in line.</li>
      <li>I find a good conditioner much better than a initially-greasy balm for keeping my beard soft enough.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews</li>
      <li>love the smell ... keeps beard soft</li>
      <li>Love that it is all natural</li>
      <li>I got this stuff about a week ago and so far I have really been loving it.</li>
      <li>I like the smell better than Natural Man.  </li>
      <li>My favorite balm so far.</li>
      <li>or so it is gone and all is right in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, i tried it right away</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell. It smells like pine and mint intensified by 100.</li>
    <li> love the smell ... keeps beard soft</li>
    <li> Smells kind of weird but you get used to it. Works great and easy to use</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of the smell although it does seem to soften the feel of your beard through the conditioning benefits. It helps to shape your beard and hold it together which is nice for times when your face gets a bit wiry. However, it most certainly does not help get under beard to moisturize any dry skin. Not a bad product, but sure there is something better.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Not too fond of the scent but it&#x27;s not overbearing. Good price too.</li>
    <li> I have been growing my beard for a good solid year with only one minor trim along the way.  It started to look a little straggly which is why I started to look into beard conditioning and overall care.  This product had some really good reviews, so I though hey why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this and Honest Amish heavy duty beard conditioner at the same time so I could compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the run down:&lt;br /&gt;Natural Man&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to work into your beard.  It gives a nice conditioning feel and does not leave a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;There is one downside for me, the smell.  It is a little on the strong side and not a particularly a scent myself or my wife enjoys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest Amish&lt;br /&gt;  Also very easy to work into your beard.  I like the smell better than Natural Man.  It did order the heavy duty, so there is an ever so slight greasy feeling when first worked in.  Within 30 minutes or so it is gone and all is right in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as function, you can not go wrong with either of the mentioned products.  For me the smell is what will keep me going to Honest Amish.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he thinks it&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s tamed his Van Dyke and it looks wonderful !</li>
    <li> I wish I had paid more attention to the earlier review that raised questions about the smell.  For the most part I liked the product and it&#x27;s consistency, but the smell seemed a bit off.  When my 10yr old son asked me why my beard &amp;#34;smelled like throw up&amp;#34;, it became clear why the smell was bothering me.  My 8yr old confirmed that he also thought that&#x27;s what it smelled like.  Too bad, because I really wanted to like this.  Maybe others don&#x27;t have the same affiliation though, as I see plenty of positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this stuff and I have noticed that his beard is way softer!</li>
    <li> Works great, though not strong enough to really keep those &amp;#34;rogue&amp;#34; hairs down. The scent it gives off throughout the day is great, not too strong or strange.</li>
    <li> More oil than wax, will not help unruly beards stay straight. Smells nice, provides a shine.</li>
    <li> This product delivers all that is promised. They smell is amazing too without being overly strong.</li>
    <li> The wife likes the way it smells and it does a decent job of taming the beard but will not control or allow you to shape your facial hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth can in almost a year. I&#x27;m not sure how I ever went with out it. I&#x27;ve tried a number of other products some good some bad but none as awesome as this one</li>
    <li> All natural ingredients. Clean woodsy smell. Definitely helps me tame &amp;#34;the forest&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works well.  My beard has gotten a lot softer in just two weeks. I have had a beard so long I had forgotten that it irritates my face, until it went away. Every guy with facial hair should give beard balm a try. Also, the twist off lid is a excellent detail. Great job !!!</li>
    <li> Good for the beard, however I expected this product to be not as wet during application.  It smell like turpentine.  Make it more dryer and add a better smell to it.</li>
    <li> I find a good conditioner much better than a initially-greasy balm for keeping my beard soft enough.  I found it takes a couple of hours to have it stop leaving grease behind if it&#x27;s touched by anything.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
    <li> The smell is great. Helps control the bushyness.</li>
    <li> Not terrible but not great. Scent is good but nearly impossible to get out of the tin.  Way too hard, like candle wax. I store it near a heat source so I can use it.  Much prefer Honest Amish.</li>
    <li> It smells great and makes my husband beard smooth. Stop alot of the itch. An early Christmas present he needed. Would buy more.</li>
    <li> This stuff works as advertised. Helps keep hair in place and controls flaking. I find the smell neither offensive or pleasant. It&#x27;s fairly neutral with a slight piney scent.</li>
    <li> Not only does this balm smell great, it helps control &amp;#34; bushy beard &amp;#34; I&#x27;m on my second tin, and I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> Amazing, handmade product. small amount goes a long way. It relaxes my beard hair, makes it a lot easier to manage and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.Their staff is very personalable  and always willing to help. Buy this product, it will make your beard happy!</li>
    <li> Seems to be very good product. Usually trying to grow a beard, my cheeks itch too much. This product is keeping that under control. Love that it is all natural</li>
    <li> Very good, It was beyond my expectation. One of my friends recommended this conditioner to me and I bought based on his recommendation. When I received it I saw that It is very good. I am completely satisfied from my purchase.</li>
    <li> Decided to give the Natural Man Beard Conditioning Balm a try after using the Natural Man Beard Oil. Just like the oil the conditioning balm works just as well! I had been using a different conditioning balm but figured I would try this new beard balm since I had enjoyed the Natural Man oil. The scent is light and actually really nice, it fades quickly and does not bother me at all. My girlfriend really likes the way it feels and looks! I&#x27;ve since purchased this as a gift to my father, who has a very thick beard himself. He really enjoys this product as well. This is a great gift for anyone you might know with a beard. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> After trying a number of different products, I finally found this natural beard balm that works!  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but I feel like I must regarding this product. First and foremost, this balm is just great. I have a long, and thick beard that sometimes causes a lot of hairs to stick out, which then makes my beard look &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;unkept&amp;#34;. With just a few amount of this fantastic beard balm, those crazy annoying hairs are kept at bay. In addition, adding this balm gives your beard a bit of a shine to it and overall just makes your beard look healthy and stand out. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments of how nice my beard looks all thanks to this balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having never purchased anything for my beard prior, I was a bit hesitant to see if I would like the feel of balm in my beard but I am happy to report that I truly love it. The balm has a very nice smell to it. It&#x27;s not too strong and overpowering. When you have a long beard, it can get a bit smelly regardless of washing it or not and this balm really makes it smell really nice. The balm itself is very soft, and goes on easily. I like to mix it in my beard and run my fingers through it and then finish it off by using my beard comb to get it look nice and combed. Trust me fellas, you cannot go wrong with this balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I have to say that this is one of the best companies around for customer service. Went I first purchased it, I received an email from them letting me know that the batch I had just received was not to their normal standards. They explained that the batch of beard balm I received was harder than normal and that it wasn&#x27;t to be shipped out. Nonetheless, I reached out to them and exchanged a few emails back and within a few weeks, they sent me not only one new batch of balm, but two!! It really is nice to see companies to go out of their way to make sure the customer is truly satisfied. For that alone, I really love this company and I applaud their efforts of going the extra mile. Not only do they have a fantastic product, they also have the right people behind it.</li>
    <li> I liked the product in general, smells nice and does soften the beard. I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;d say it controls stray whiskers, but it does make the beard softer. My biggest complaint is that it&#x27;s difficult to get from the tin to the beard. It&#x27;s pretty hard in the tin and tough to get on your fingers to apply it to the beard, almost like you can&#x27;t get enough at a time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few different beard balms. They&#x27;ve all smelled kinda weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this the best out of any I&#x27;ve tried so far. This has a spearmint smell. It&#x27;s not overly strong, but more pleasing than the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look manly and smell like spearmint gum. That&#x27;s a win win.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I don&#x27;t have a long beard, mine is still close to the skin, but a full beard. I trim my beard with scissors and this product helps keep the hairs tight and not look like wild hair growing in every direction.</li>
    <li> smells like ginger and works well</li>
    <li> Keeps the beard from getting dry, a little greasy but does the job.</li>
    <li> this was a Christmas gift for a barber. He really likes the product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> Throughout history great men have always had beards. Some people say that a man&#x27;s power and wealth is defined by the size of his beard. Of course with great power, comes great responsibility. The responsibility of grooming a beard is a tall task, but it is absolutely necessary for a quality beard. A beard should look refined, and have a purpose. It should not be the sign of laziness, and inability to find a shower. I myself have tried a number of different conditioners, and shampoos, with varied results. The Natural Man Beard Conditioning Balm hit all of my requirements. It made my beard easy to manage and silky smooth. Look no further men, this is the quality product you need.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t have the proper beard to grow out but this product did not change the softness of my hair at all. Not a huge fan of the smell or the oily texture either.</li>
    <li> It was definitely less product than I thought I bought.  I ordered this for my son...he likes the product, I just wish it came in a larger amount.</li>
    <li> This is great product.  It gives a soft, manageable feel to my beard (previously I was dealing with a lot of itchiness, especially at night time) and is not greasy or smelly in any way.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Id love to tell you how great this product was, but someone ripped the package open and stole it out of my mailbox before&lt;br /&gt;I ever saw it. Probably some crackhead with a really great beard.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff about a week ago and so far I have really been loving it. I&#x27;m relatively new to the beard game, about 4 months in, and although my fiancee has now grown to love the beautiful beast growing on my face, she was occasionally bothered by the scratchiness. I myself have dealt with some itchiness, but sometimes you have to pay a price to look awesome. Luckily I came across this stuff and gave it a shot and my beard feels so much better. It&#x27;s a lot smoother and less irritated now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that it would feel oily or waxy but it goes on light, it just adds a nice softness. I was also worried that it would have strong smell that I would notice all day below my nose in my &#x27;stachell region, but it has a mild fresh scent that you don&#x27;t really notice when it&#x27;s on; nothing that overpowers my own intoxicating, pheromone rich musk. I will definitely be picking up more once I run out, although so far it looks like it will last for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to stop me for shaving my beard. Yes, It&#x27;s hard to have a long beard without related problems. Long beard men know what I&#x27;am saying. But this product is the solution. Just try it once and I am sure you will be one of the fans like me.</li>
    <li> Pretty good oil....only issue I have is how much it smells like a lemon.</li>
    <li> It smells really nice at first but after a while it gets a very acidic smell. My girlfriend thought I had thrown up in my beard..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of different products to soften and manage my beard.  So far this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found.  It really seems softer to the touch and lays nicer.  My Dad is going to try it out too.</li>
    <li> Really great for my beard and my wife loves the mild fragrance.  My favorite balm so far.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Was a little concerned when I read some of the reviews about the smell. I think this comes from not washing your beard properly. Treat it like the hair on your head and use a good beard shampoo. If not, use a good moisturizing shampoo. Combine this with a beard oil, coconut oil or tea tree oil etc. You get the point. I think you will be very pleased with the results. Leaves your beard looking very full and healthy.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff, my beard looks amazing and feels velvety soft. The spearmint lavender smell is light and drives my lady wild.</li>
    <li> Firstly, customer service is amazing,Jeannette reached out to me to make sure that i didn&#x27;t have any issues. I got this because it&#x27;s reasonably priced, i tried it right away and my beard felt and looked much better, it got a little bit softer, easier to brush, nice shine to it, and most importantly kept the strays in line. It also has a subtle scent which grows on me daily. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days so i&#x27;m confident of even better results with continued use.</li>
    <li> I had originally wrote a negative review but learned the product was formulated wrong.  I have now been sent a replacement and found the product to be very good.  Nice herbal smell and it softened my beard well and controlled ruly whiskers.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend, he used it twice and now it just sits in the bathroom.. He said he doesn&#x27;t like the smell. I didn&#x27;t like the scent either.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Smells great to. Totally will buy again.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend liked the smell and feel of the product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend who has some beard-druff.  He hasn&#x27;t given me an update on how its working, he&#x27;s been using a beard oil too.  Getting your man to use products might be a struggle but this stuff is masculine and the natural oils don&#x27;t have a strong scent that some guys hate.  Ladies sneak a finger dip for your cuticles and dry spots!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried other products and they worked but the scent was not very good. My wife hated it. But this stuff my wife loves is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to let you in on a little secret...beards suck. They&#x27;re hot, they&#x27;re uncomfortable, they itch. But they&#x27;re also popular with the ladies right now, meaning that a lot of guys are taking the journey to Real Man Land, which is full of beards and high-functioning alcoholism. After my 18,000th complaint, one of my amigos told me to find something to help me/make me shut up and an evening spent wandering around Amazon led me to this. First off, the name is amazing. Natural Man Beard Conditioning Balm? That makes me feel like it&#x27;s the secret product lumberjacks and baseball players on playoff pushes use to sculpt their wily face thatches. I felt confident that using this balm would immediately transition my beard from \\&quot;not impressive facial hair,&#x27; to \\&quot;masterful old growth forest on a man full of confidence and sage advice.\\&quot; Also, the product comes in a tin. Applying products that come in tins to your facial hair immediately ups the masculinity factor by several magnitudes. That kind of dedication separates the facial hair enthusiasts from the average beard growers who are just too lazy to shave. I expected one of two things to happen when I used this. Either I would wake up with a beard/body from the movie 300 and testosterone would leak from my pores and other men would become more manly just by being near me, or I would use it and my beard would be less irritating and maybe softer. Surprise ending, both outcomes happened, except the first one. So in summation, if you are looking for a product to make your beard suck less, thus making you complain to friends less/make you stop itching, and make your beard softer, then this is a good product for you. IF you are looking for the ultimate beard accessory for facial hair enthusiasts, IE a beard balm in a tin, then this is DEFINITELY the right product for you. I am totally buying this again.</li>
    <li> first time purchasing,will not purchase again</li>
    <li> First time using this and I have to say, I&#x27;m highly impressed. Ordered some after the wife started to complain that my beard was getting a little too wild and that I started looking like I was homeless (calm down, some homeless men have amazing beards). After a single use, my beard became much more tamed, manageable, and this stuff smells great, but not overbearing at all. My wife loves the smell and actually complemented on how much better my beard looked after using it. If you&#x27;re man enough to grow a beard, I guess you should be enough of a gentleman, as well,to keep it under control.</li>
    <li> I love the smell...my husband hates it...so it&#x27;s just sitting in the shelf...:(</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable affect on my beard.  It does smell like an Aveda product when first applied, but after a few hours smells slightly rancid.  I used the product for a few weeks and then discarded it in favor of a an oil rather than a solid balm.</li>
