<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> purchased this for q-tips. they fit perfectly and are easy to access without having to touch more than what you need.  trying to think of a reason to purchase more because it is so handy.  probably could use for hair rubber bands or even certain floss picks.  just what I needed.  I don&#x27;t like having glass in the bathroom if I can help it so this was perfect.</li>
    <li> This item is very functional. Not does it&#x27;s design for cotton swabs, I am using this to put baking soda and used when brushing teeth. I love how it&#x27;s made, elegant and have lots of space inside. I am now planning to buy another one to be used in my other bathroom.</li>
    <li> I have multiple bathrooms, so I bought two of these.  One large box of Q-tips, completely filled both boxes with none leftover.  The box is acrylic, not glass.  It is see through.  It is a nice way to keep Q-tips handy on the bathroom counter without getting dirty.  The container is attractive enough, but obviously nothing super special.  It works, it holds all the Q-tips (in two boxes) and I don&#x27;t have to fuss about them anymore.</li>
    <li> Nice little box. transparent. Made of plastic. Can hold things. Has a lid. If you are looking for an item with these features, then here is your solution.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my cabinet. It is not too big. It opens easily.</li>
    <li> Great for cosmetic square facial cotton!  I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> The one I received was an imitation not made by Danielle Enterprises. I already own some containers made by Danielle and this was a much cheaper quality nor did it come in the packaging used by Danielle.</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture, seems of decent construction, and is what I wanted! Just a nice looking container for cotton swabs. They fit perfectly in there, and you can store plenty!</li>
    <li> I love this holder for Qtips.  They fit very nicely in it and it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my counter.</li>
    <li> This little box is a perfect fit for Q-tips. The cover keeps them protected from dust, etc. Nice addition to remodeled bathroom storage.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, item as described, just what I was looking for.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I like it. It is good since it wa snot free shippinh it was kind of expensive. But it was okay</li>
    <li> I bought two of this box previously, so I know that I received a very cheap imitation from eRiver. The product received is much lighter, the top doesn’t stay put.  I could give two, maybe three, stars for the box itself, but in comparison with the real deal it’s just junk.</li>
    <li> Whatever reviewer said that this item is cheap plastic is being ridiculous.  This IS acrylic--a perfect weight of acrylic--if it were made any thicker in acrylic it would be a bulky, cumbersome box.  It is solid, sturdy, and works great!  I got one for a relative and also one for me at Christmas--we both love them!!! It looks very quality on my cosmetic counter--thanks for a great product at a very reasonable price!!!</li>
    <li> Great for Q-Tips. You can pick up each one in the center and not transfer germs from your hand onto the swab. Very attractive holder. I got one for each bathroom.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide what to use this container for and finally put the Q-tips in it which is perfect.  It is very convienent sitting on my make-up vanity.  It can be used for cotton balls, jewelry just for starters.  I am happy I ordered it as it looks great on the vanity.  I&#x27;m thinking of ordering a couple more.  The price was also good.</li>
    <li> This a perfect size container that is wide enough to hold a good amount but not so deep that you have to reach way down to get at the contents. The acrylic is ightweight but well made. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Nothing more nothing less.  Satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this container, it&#x27;s Excellent for holding Q-Tips, just like you see it in the picture.  I store this container in the Bank { Bathroom }.  There Fantastic, because it keeps the Q-Tips Clean &amp; Sterilized for when I need to use them.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about the Q-Tips getting Dirty, especially where I live; where I live is in my own Opinion, to be Very Dusty, and that&#x27;s NO GOOD for trying to keep Q-Tips Clean and Sterilized; so by having this container, it does just that, it keeps the Q-Tips Squeey Clean and Sterlized.</li>
    <li> Beautifully made, heavy duty acrylic. Perfect holder for q-tips and cotton squares.  Looks beautiful on my vanity.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for some nicer ways to store (in this case) floss picks.  The lid is a little slippy, but overall it looks way nicer than the ziploc baggie the flossers are packaged in.  Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this little box.</li>
    <li> Pretty, practical , no hiding this away, lovely  Just what I have searched for.  Does the job too.</li>
    <li> I love these containers. I had bought two. The knob fell off on one of them but it was a simple fix with gorilla glue.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase for our guest bath! It&#x27;s inexpensive but looks nice. We ended up purchasing other coordinating items as well. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for cotton swabs.  Purchased for use in our trailer because it is lightweight and seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> After I saw this box, I bought a couple more, and also bought some other similar products. The acrylic is pretty, very clear. The box is sturdy and well made and the lid fits well. It is a reasonable size for small items other than cotton balls, could be used for lots of things. Haven&#x27;t had it long but it doesn&#x27;t seem to scratch particularly easily.</li>
    <li> What can i say that the others have not? This looks so nice, is very sturdy and lightweight. I put my cotton balls in here instead of q-tips. Love it &amp; no complaints!</li>
    <li> It holds my q-tips in my bathroom in an elegant way. It protects it from dust and hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just an acrylic cube with a lid that holds cotton swabs. And that is what I use it for.</li>
    <li> looks nicer than expected for the price. fits q-tips perfectly.</li>
    <li> so cute. now i can&#x27;t decide what to put in it. think just putting q-tips inside of it is just too boring</li>
    <li> When I was ordering the crystal mouthwash holder, I saw this cotton ball holder and though that I could use that.  The one I was using did not have a cover.  It arrived the next day, along with the mouthwash holder and I love it.  My housekeeper fills it every week when she is here.  Incidentally, I order the cotton balls from Amazon also.  You could use this for many things on your vanity or in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve always had a large box of Q-Tips in the bathroom drawer which took up too much room.  The acrylic box is elegant sitting on the bathroom counter.  Now the larger box of Q-Tips can be stored in the closet.</li>
    <li> perfect to keep your Qtips.</li>
    <li> This was a little smaller than what I was expecting BUT it is functional and is perfect for q-tips that I can keep on the counter in the guest bathroom.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product!  It&#x27;s not glass but it looks like glass which makes it look even nicer.</li>
    <li> As many others have stated this container is perfect for q-tips and that&#x27;s what I use it for.  My only complaint is that there&#x27;s not a very pronounced rim for the lid to sit in and the lid will easily slide off when you&#x27;re getting it off of a top shelf in your medicine cabinet (which is where mine is) .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight but feels plenty sturdy. Q-tip brand cotton swaps fit easily on their side. Love this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS THING. PERFECT SIZE AND THICK PLASTIC</li>
    <li> Excellent size for cotton swabs.</li>
    <li> Keeps q-tips neat and tidy.</li>
    <li> I got this to be a q-tip holder, although the box suggests cotton balls. It fits q-tips perfectly and as someone else said, you pick them out by the middle, not the end, so it is more sterile than an upright q-tip dispenser. It looks nice (looks like glass or crystal eventhough it&#x27;s plastic), is durable, reasonably priced, and works as intended, what more could you ask for :-)</li>
    <li> i bought 2 of these...1 for qtip &amp; the other for cotton balls....perfect for my bathroom!</li>
    <li> So glad I got this. It looks great on my vanity.                   Sara B. in NC</li>
    <li> You can not beat this little item for the price.  Big help to organizing my bathroom.  It is a sturdy container.</li>
    <li> Way smaller than I thought.  Too pricey for what it is.  Cute but tiny</li>
    <li> Useful to keep in shower. Fits nicely on shelf and holds good number of cotton balls.</li>
    <li> Cotton swabs fit great in this holder.  Right at your fingertips, without grabbing the cotton ends.  Acrylic doesn&#x27;t break if you drop the cover either!</li>
    <li> I like this style of holder because it allows you to grab the q-tip wand at the center. The cotton heads don&#x27;t get contaminated by germs on your fingers, a big plus when dealing with infants, injuries, post-op healing, etc. It holds a good amount of swabs too!</li>
    <li> Good size for odds and ends in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. It holds a lot of Q-Tips and keeps them from getting dirty.</li>
    <li> I love my little cube! I use mine for pony tail holders but you could put just about anything in it. Cotton swabs, cottons balls, cotton squares, jewelry, trinkets or any small items. It is made of a quality transparent acrylic and blends in with most bathroom decor. It is easy to clean with soap and water.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to match Danielle cotton pad dispenser and to hold Qtips on make up table.  In past I had bought Qtips cardboard decorative containers which were a nightmare to replenish and being cardboard didn&#x27;t hold up too long.  I found this dispenser to be much easier to fill as it is not as tight a fit as Qtip cardboard dispenser and it looks better.  I also now can buy a more inexpensive drug store version of cotton swabs.  So it not only looks great, it can save me money.</li>
    <li> Very nice and hardy plastic, strong and thick not cheap at all and a very pretty but yet simple/neutral design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality wise this is definitely 5 stars but when it comes to having to fill this up again, in my case with q-tips, unless you have the patients there is no way you can get them all straight and fit as many as it could possibly hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this for just cotton balls or round cotton pads as its too small in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it and since i haven&#x27;t found anything else in the market that i really like i would probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> Quality and style go hand in hand with this stylish and handy box!  Looks great in our bathroom!  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a very neat little box for the bathroom. It is just what I needed for small storage. Very pretty and durable.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a nice holder for cotton swabs for your bathroom counter, I don&#x27;t think it gets much better than this. Swabs fit perfectly into it, and the clear acrylic construction lets you easily see if it needs replacing. The box also allows you to easily grab swabs by the middle handle area, avoiding any cross-contamination issues you might risk with holders that stand them on end and force you to grab one of the tips.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. They are very nice and classy looking. They can go with any décor in any bathroom and they have a very high end quality to them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cotton ball holder for cotton swabs. This is a nice way to keep a necessary (for me) item on the bathroom countertop without it looking messy.  The holder is what I consider elegant. It looks like a piece of crystal yet keeps the swabs clean and lined up inside. I gave it a 4 start instead of 5 because I would like it taller. I would definitely recommend this item and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.  Couldn&#x27;t find anything nicer in local stores.</li>
    <li> Lots of flashing and sharp edges on the lid.  Also the ball on the top of the lid is different on the knock-off, not nearly as attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for storing cotton buds. I keep it in my bathroom and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Wow this was one of three items purchased I love this item and would purchase another one love it in my house</li>
    <li> Cute little acrylic box. I use it for my make up q-tips. Excellent and durable clear acrylics. It looks really nice on my vanity. Over a year after and it still looks great. No complains at all</li>
    <li> This is sturdy, has the weight of glass with out the hazard.  It&#x27;s a great way to put something on the counter that you need every day without taking up a lot of space and looks very unobtrusive.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality acrylic.  The 3.5 x 3.5 size is a great match to the Acrylic Necklace Keeper sold by Amazon.  I used this smaller box to hold my bracelets.  It is nice to have the two clear acrylic boxes brightening up my dresser.</li>
    <li> This item is fancy looking. You get more than what you paid for. The lid fits easily and perfectly. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This container is perfect for me! It is well made with smooth seams. The acrylic is of medium weight and doesn&#x27;t feel super thin or cheap. The lid fits squarely and seats well. I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a  show piece for your courter it does not take up much space .Just Stunning ,The acrylic is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I like to be organize and this is just great. its clear so it matched with everything else I have in the room.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these I love the size and the clean look of them.&lt;br /&gt;Plus they are perfect for Qtip&#x27;s and for fabric covered rubber bands.&lt;br /&gt;May order another.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for your bathroom counter, keeps dust from getting to your qtips. Very convenient to have them right there in their attractive container.</li>
    <li> Very elegant really satisfied with them.  Dressed up my vanity a lot.  Already found several different unusual&lt;br /&gt;uses for them.</li>
    <li> This looks great, not cheap looking. It almost looks like glass but is very heavy duty acrylic instead. Pretty sitting out.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product. It&#x27;s the perfect size for Q-Tips but doesn&#x27;t take up hardly any counter space. I also really like that it&#x27;s clear because if I want to change the color scheme in my bathroom, this will still go with everything. The lid stays in place pretty well and the box does a great job at keeping the contents dry from stray water drops from the sink.</li>
    <li> I use it for my cotton swabs. Looks like if it was glass with out the worry of it breaking. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Not like the first one offered that was no longer available and made in Canada.  This one is a lighter plastic made in China.</li>
    <li> A perfect solution on your bathroom counter to protect the q-tips and make them accessible to your family members. :-)</li>
    <li> I picked this little item up for wanted something small that would hold cotton squares that I use to wet &amp; clean my little four legged angel&#x27;s eyes every morning.....  Looks super attractive seeing in one of the bathrooms &amp; serves it&#x27;s purpose without putting out an excessive amount of $$.......Nice!</li>
    <li> this small little think just looks so awesome. i and my husband we love it so much. it easy clean too. so happy i got it.</li>
    <li> Love this have bought a slew of them for different items</li>
    <li> Hard to seat the top on this little acrylic holder but otherwise not much to say.  It does hat it says it does, hold those qtips.</li>
    <li> Looks good in Bathroom</li>
    <li> This is cute and very durable. I love it so much. Looks classy too and stands out on my dresser.</li>
    <li> I have to be organized and this little thing here is a good heavy plastic and hold quite a few qtips. This looks great sitting on my counter with the other Heavy plastic I bought from Amazon.</li>
    <li> It looks exactly like the picture. It fits into my medicine cabinet perfectly. Q-tips are a perfect fit. Fingers can touch only the middle of Q-tips and not the ends when removing from the container.</li>
    <li> This product is constructed well and serves the purpose.  It looks nice in the bathroom. I will most likely get another one.</li>
    <li> Nice little acrylic cotton swab holder.  It sits well on the counter and the quantity of contents is always visible.</li>
    <li> It holds q-tips, but is a part of a set of items for the bathroom. We have the whole set and it looks and functions great.</li>
    <li> Great find...was looking for it, found it, love it.  Holds plenty of q-tips and looks great while doing it.</li>
    <li> It looks a lot better on the picture than in person. In person it&#x27;s just a plastic box. it does the job and it is what it is, but don&#x27;t expect nothing fancy!!!</li>
    <li> This acrylic box was better than expected, and looks much better in person. It is the perfect compliment to your bathroom decor, and just the right size too. Excellent quality at a great price, just perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought it to put my q tips in and to add to my décor.  It looks great! Good access to the Q-tips.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, reasonable price and looks good. The top could be a little heavier but I wont take any stars off for that.</li>
    <li> This little box is very well made. It has thick, see-through plastic, which looks like glass. The top fits snugly -- no sticking or jiggling. It makes it easy to select a cotton swab without touching the cotton ends and without disturbing other cotton swabs in the box. It looks so nice on the bathroom counter and it is so very useful. We used to pull a counter drawer open and rustle around in it for the cardboard box of swabs with the opening on the back for removing the swabs. That was not nearly so convenient and it didn&#x27;t look nice sitting out on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the Right &amp;#34;q-tip &amp;#34; container. I didn&#x27;t want the usually round ones and basically never purchased any. But now I found the ones I&#x27;m very happy with!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, for the quick shipping and lovely design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula</li>
    <li> I liked the design of this to match an apothecary jar I also purchased. With 4 Grandchildren in the house daily I wanted unbreakable storage but the beauty of &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; I believe they both filled those requirements beautifully. Holds the q-tips with easy access and covered (unlike the q-tip box which is open all the time).&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped with apothecary jar and both arrived well packed and on time.</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my Q-tips and I think it&#x27;s the cutest clear hard plastic box (which actually looks like glass). This container allows you to pick up Q-tips buy the center instead of the sides. It has a neat and clean appeal to it!</li>
    <li> I thought this looked like a nice little box, but when I received it, the box had greasy stains all over it, and the box itself didn&#x27;t seem like the quality in the picture.  It might work for someone, but I didn&#x27;t like it.  2 stars because I got a refund.</li>
    <li> Not as heavy duty as I was expecting.  Very light weight.  For the price I&#x27;ll keep it, but would have preferred something a little more substantial.</li>
    <li> This is large enough to hold enough Q Tips, but does not have too large of a footprint.  It is attractive and functional. Good product.</li>
    <li> It is adorable.  Well constructed and it does not take up a lot of room on my counter.  It looks so nice and it is so handy.  And the price is right.  Which is what you hope for when you order stuff on line.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my new bathroom and it is the perfect size to hold my cotton balls, ponytail holders and smaller hair accessories.</li>
    <li> This was reasonably priced and fits my needs. It is in a drawer with the lid off most of the time, but it is nice enough to sit out on the counter if needed.  I was tired of messing with the cardboard/plastic containers that Q-tips are sold.  I would often end up throwing away many because they would be knocked out and fall to the bottom of a deep drawer.  This sits in a shallower drawer and it&#x27;s easy to access with no swabs being knocked out and thrown away.</li>
    <li> Cute item, exactly what we described and what i needed.</li>
    <li> This works fairly well, but the lid tends to not slide on easily, meaning it&#x27;s often not sealed when you thought it was.  Makes the purpose for which I use it, keeping q-tips clean in the bathroom, a little moot.</li>
    <li> Thin plastic not heavy acrylic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s square, plastic and see-thru.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy. It looks very nice.&lt;br /&gt;We use it to hold cotton swabs (q-tips) on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;It does not fit in our medicine cabinet--we have an older cabinet.</li>
    <li> Nice, useful, basic acrylic product. Better than the drop-down feeders, which don&#x27;t actually feed Q-tips but cause you to have to chase them back up the hatch to get one out. Here, just lift the lid and be done with it. Not too cheap-looking, either. Like it.</li>
    <li> Except it came from China and took forever to get to me.  No biggie.  It keeps dust off my Q-tips and fits very nicely on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for qtips.  Looks very nice, not cheap looking.  Really pleased with this purchase I will probably buy more in the future.  The lid easily lifts off but secures nicely.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect and the box looks nice.  I use it for my sticky notes.  I don&#x27;t use them overly often but want to keep them handy and contained so they don&#x27;t get seperated or bent at the corners.</li>
    <li> Was not a genuine Danielle product. Was a cheap made in China knock off. Returned.</li>
    <li> I got this for my vanity to hold Q tips and it&#x27;s perfect for that.  Very nice, heavy, clear acylic which looks like glass, great quality item.  It&#x27;s perfect for my use.  Shipping was prompt and the price is good as well.</li>
    <li> I USE IT ON THE BATHROOM COUNTER AND LOVE IT, I HAVE USED IT TO DEPENSE DIFFERENCT ITEMS AND FOUND THAT IT WORKS AND LOOKS GREAT</li>
    <li> What can I say I use it exactly how it is pictured. It holds A LOT of Q-tips and is made of very thick plastic. But be careful as it might crack if the lid or the container is dropped from a tall height.</li>
    <li> I have two of these in every bathroom now. In one I keep Qtips and in the other I store the dental floss plackers. Keeps everything clean and organized.</li>
    <li> Really recommend this product. Great quality. It looks great in any bathroom style.&lt;br /&gt;What a neat/decorative way to keep cotton balls, q-tips, etc.&lt;br /&gt;So much nicer than in picture.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I got it! I am ordering another set for guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> I ordered two Danielle Square Acrylic Cotton Ball Holder, Single Tier holders. One of the holders I received is from eRiver and it is made up of cheap plastic and is very thin. The top doesn’t stay put. It is just a piece of junk!!! I contact seller about a replacement or refund. No reply from them so far. I wish I had a option of giving half star or zero stars for this review.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first one of these last year. It was made of heavy acrylic &amp; very sturdy. The one I just purchased - the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; one - is much lighter &amp; cheaper feeling. They look identical, but the quality in my new one is definitely lacking. Disappointing, but oh well. It didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
    <li> I really like this time.  I bought 2 so that I could have one on my dressing table and one in the bathroom.  I am even thinking these might make a great gift for someone too.</li>
    <li> Nice, elegant and does it job.!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s attractive but the lip on the cover which sits in the bottom of the holder is so small that the cover slides on and off with barely a touch.  It exposes the cotton balls which is pretty important if you want them to be kept sanitary.    Seller ships immediately so received sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Item was of good quality, I was very satisfied with this purchase. This is good size container for its purpose.</li>
    <li> This is well made and looks nice sitting in my bathroom.very easy to clean and fits a ton of qtips but you can put anything else you&#x27;d like in it. Its an okay comparison price to other acrylic containers. I would repurchase this.</li>
    <li> this is the second that i purchase. they are neat, clean, well sized, lid has a good grip, no headache about rust. I would highly recommend it to everyone for Q tips or cotton pads. well made product</li>
    <li> I wanted something to store my q-tips in, and this perfectly fits the job.  The size is just right for standard issue cotton swabs and I suppose it would work perfectly for cotton balls or other misc. items.</li>
    <li> The Acrylic Cotton Ball Holder is perfect for my q-tips.  It looks very expensive on my counter.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wish the length would be higher... the width is perfect. It fits my Q-tips in a very organized manner.</li>
    <li> Great service &amp; product!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect little Q-tip holder. Looks nice in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Ｉｔ＇ｓ　ｂｅａｕｔｉｆｕｌ，　ｂｕｔ　ａ　ｌｉｔｔｌｅ　ｂｉｔ　ｅｘｐｅｎｓｉｖｅ</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still chuckling as I bought this thinking it was different from the Elife Acrylic Cotton Ball Swab Qtips Holder Box Organizer. It&#x27;s identical. Does a nice job of holding the cotton balls, and the handle is easy to grab.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT AS ADD ON SO GREAT PRICE; - HEAVY DUTY MATERIAL- LOOKS EXPENSIVE IN PERSON- I HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A FEW COMPLIMENTS OR INQUIRIES REGARDING THEM - I HAVE THEM IN BATHROOM BUT MY HUBBY USES THEM IN HIS MAN CAVE FOR HIS COFFEE TABLE AS A CATCH ALL - AND ALL OF HIS FRIENDS WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE GOT THEM SO FUNNY THE THINGS GUYS GET EXCITED ABOUT LOL</li>
    <li> I like the very clear acrylic material and the workmanship and it is a good size container for cotton balls.</li>
    <li> Love that this isn&#x27;t breakable (like glass) and keeps the q-tips it neat order. Great product for countertop organization! Easy to refill and looks great!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to store our q-tips in. It is covered and keeps them clean and is easy to open and get them one at a time out. Looks nice on the counter!</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and fits q-tips perfectly.  The last one I had was glass and of course got broken by the kids so this is a big improvement.</li>
    <li> Good for what it was worth.No regrets for buying it!</li>
    <li> Perfect width for holding Q-tips.</li>
    <li> Service good. Product to pricy to purchase. Made no effort to return.</li>
    <li> Pretty, Functional, and just what I needed for Q-tips on our bathroom counter. I liked that the swabs lay down so that you don&#x27;t touch the tips and therefore stay clean. It is a really nice looking container, I highly recommend it! I&#x27;m thinking of getting two more!</li>
    <li> Very useful.  No sharp edges.  would like to find one item that holds the equivalent of 3 of these, side-by-side, in a row.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s functional, sure--but it will be kept in a drawer.  The base is fine; it&#x27;s the top with which I have an issue.  The knob on top has a very prominent seam, and, on top of that, there&#x27;s a spot along it where a bit of plastic sticks up and is rough.  I&#x27;ll look for a glass or crystal box that&#x27;s worthy of being displayed.</li>
    <li> Fell it is too small for the price.</li>
    <li> So, not much to say here.  It&#x27;s a square, clear acrylic (plastic) box that I use to keep my cotton swabs in.  It is well made and the size is perfect for my intended use.  It allows the swabs to lay horizontally so that they can be picked up by their sides rather than the other vertical styles that forces one to grab them from the cotton part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint on these is not about the product, but rather the shipping time.  Beware that these come from China.  It took nearly 6 weeks for we to get it.  Not a deal breaker since it&#x27;s an insignificant item for me, but it would have been nice to know before ordering that it would take that long.  I may have chosen something closer.</li>
    <li> I know, I know...it&#x27;s my fault. They do give the dimensions in the description, but I went by the picture and previous reviews only.  I can&#x27;t believe I paid $13 for this tiny box. I probably could have got something very similar downtown for much much cheaper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple and goes well with any decor. I love that the tips fit perfectly inside this and my q-tips are readily available for daily use.</li>
    <li> Great, I love it. I keep my cotton ball and some makeup sponges in it.</li>
    <li> Fits my Qtips perfect and looks nice On my counter. I like that you grab them from the middle instead of the tip, more sanitary.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not extravagant but it&#x27;s functional. Easy to refill and use everyday. Looks good on your bathroom counter. I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to hold disposable eye shadow applicators -  it&#x27;s the perfect size for the purpose and fits in the bathroom drawer so it&#x27;s out of sight.</li>
    <li> This cotton ball holder is very good.  The appearance was as described.  Good value, great price, excellent delivery time.  Very unique look for a small cost product.</li>
    <li> Love this on my vanity, I use it for cotton balls</li>
    <li> very nice, delivery good</li>
    <li> I think I said it all in the header. It&#x27;s just not nice enough to have &amp;#34;displayed&amp;#34; in your bathroom. I have seen nice plastic that almost looks like glass. This is NOT it.</li>
    <li> Great acrylic container I use it for cotton swabs. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> really nice, looks as pretty as on the picture, no way dust will cover my cotton balls now :) very happy i got it, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I ordered this piece to prevent myself from having to go under my sink daily after my shower to get a QTip. The holder does hold a nice amount of QTips, but it feels cheap. At the end of the day, it gets the job done, but I may try to get a fancier/more decorative holder down the road.</li>
    <li> el vendedor muy responsable el producto llego sin detalles sellado y el color y tamaño pedido  llego en la fecha acordada se lo recomiendo 100%</li>
    <li> Very good looking (a little luxurious look as well), comfortable, large enough to hold the cotton tips...very happy with the purchase...strongly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support the Amazon review community with your product reviews...it is very helpful.</li>
    <li> I know, I KNOW .... It SAYS that it is for Cotton Balls ....&lt;br /&gt;and I am SURE that it would serve that purpose quite well too.&lt;br /&gt;However, we use them for COTTON SWABS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have previously purchased \\&quot;Cotton Swab dispensers\\&quot; and was not happy with them as they seemed to jam.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased containers that held the Cotton Swabs \\&quot;On End\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;THIS caused you to touch the Cotton Swab, not the stick, when getting one.&lt;br /&gt;AND you would often touch OTHER swabs.&lt;br /&gt;Any Touching of the swab portion potentionally contaminates THEM ... NOT a very good idea!&lt;br /&gt;(Sorry, I am a retired Public Health Epi Investigator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS holder allows you to grab the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; without touching ANY of the swabs and the swabs don&#x27;t jam!&lt;br /&gt;I find them easy to clean and to refill without contaminating any of the swabs!&lt;br /&gt;PLUS, I like the way they look on our lavatory counters.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price, and to ME .... they LOOK more expensive than they ARE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{Did my review help you decide?}</li>
    <li> Hard to find a dispenser for cotton swabs that doles them out one by one.  The swabs stick to one another, defeating any effort to dispense them individually.  So, I bought this little acrylic box to hold them and it does the job.  I thought it might be a little heavier than it is; it is a little light weight. I would have given this product a higher rating if it were heavier. But it looks good on the bathroom counter and holds quite a few swabs.  The lid is just a &#x27;lift off, put back&#x27; kind of lid; a hinge might be nice, but I&#x27;ve never seen an acrylic box like this with a hinge.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this handy thing! I can fit cotton balls and q tips in it!</li>
    <li> i bought two of these, one for q-tips and one for dental floss pics. Its the perfect size for both and i like that its plastic and not glass (though you really have to look to know its plastic) because if i do knock it off the counter i don&#x27;t have to worry about glass shards that are so hard to get up. Much safer with the same classy look. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Good quality; works well for storing Q-tips.</li>
    <li> The container i ordered was suppose to be made out of acrylic and not plastic!! I have ordered the same before and it was acrylic.</li>
    <li> Matches my other acrylic items that I have for my makeup area. Looks great and my q-tips fit perfectly in it.</li>
    <li> After searching several web sites I decided on this swab holder by Danielle because it was one of the few in a neutral (clear) color and it allows the user to select a swab by only touching the middle instead of the cotton on the ends.</li>
    <li> I used to have a box of Q tips sitting on my dresser until I saw this product.  I&#x27;m really pleased with it - looks much better on my dresser!</li>
    <li> Love it! it&#x27;s perfect for qtips this way you don&#x27;t end up grabbing the cotton ball ends just the middle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;cotton ball&amp;#34; holder but I use it to store my Q-Tips. Very well made and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> yep -- it a nice little acrylic box..  its not cheapo plastic -- this will last years, it wont yellow - it is made well - a rare find in a world of cheap plastic imports</li>
    <li> Works well, looks good and unlike some other holders reviewed, major brand Q-tips fit. I didn&#x27;t like the thin acrylic it&#x27;s made with (for the price) so how long it will last remains to be seen.</li>
    <li> Just convenient container to keep my Q-tips on hand. Its a sturdy container a little bigger than a deck of cards. It&#x27;s small enough to keep on my dresser without overcrowding it. I can easy see it because of the clear acrylic good buy. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very lightweight. The other product I purchased (tall acrylic cotton ball holder) is a better weight, has a nicer ball top (this one you can see the mold lines) but supposedly both are made by same manufacturer? Even the box is generic, does not say &amp;#34;Danielle&amp;#34; anywhere on it.  I bought the 2 as a set but they don&#x27;t match.  What&#x27;s going on here, Amazon??</li>
    <li> The acrylic is so clear it that it is mistaken for actual glass. Hands down, I&#x27;d definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> It might sound dumb to call something that&#x27;s plastic beautiful, but in my opinion it is. I keep my Q-tips in there and it goes on the counter of my master bathroom. It feels almost as heavy as glass. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box from the package, it looked cheap.  If I had seen it from a store, I would not have bought the product for the price,  more than $10.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it in my bathroom and it serves the purpose quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I gave only 3 stars just because of the price for the value.</li>
    <li> Goes with any decor. I was bored with the traditional containers for the bathroom. This is a great alternative. Really love it. Got it pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Love these things. They make whatever you put into them look nice.</li>
    <li> Looks great in my son&#x27;s bathroom.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> A beautiful piece of Acrylic</li>
    <li> I question this item as to whether it&#x27;s acrylic at all! It&#x27;s more like a cheap, thin plastic and &#x27;Made in China&#x27;! 👎</li>
    <li> I love these acrylic holders because they make the cotton stay so nice and clean. They&#x27;re a good size for a limited space, they&#x27;re affordable and match any color scheme. Excellent delivery service from the seller.</li>
    <li> The product looks great.  I use this for cotton swabs instead of cotton balls.  Would likely order another one for my other bathroom.</li>
    <li> Bigger then what I was expecting but I&#x27;m not complaining. It&#x27;s big enough to use for qtips or cotton balls. I&#x27;m using it for qtips. It&#x27;s a good price for the quality and there&#x27;s not issue with the lid.</li>
    <li> Purchased for cotton swab storage. The size is small enough to fit in standard medicine cabinet, but the item is also not too bad to look at sitting on the bathroom counter. Somewhat sturdy feeling and holds about 150 original style Q-tips (swabs are laying sideways and fit in just perfectly). Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived with a flaw on one corner seam, but I kept it anyway and just turn that corner to the back. It looks nice, and it&#x27;s big enough that I can half fill with Q-tips and also fit some cotton pads in it. Definitely wish it had a little more weight to it, but it&#x27;s a good product none-the-less and easy to clean off as compared to the copper-lidded one I used to have that would rust.</li>
    <li> Again this is a beautiful addition to my remodeled bathroom. I decided to do clear accessories and this is another beautiful addition.</li>
    <li> I like that cotton buds lie horizontally in this container rather than vertically like most. Makes it easier to pull one out at a time. It can hold a lot and seems to be indestructible against my curious toddler, who broke my last one (which was glass). I liked it so much I bought exactly the same one to hold cotton pads. Their low profile and square shape fit into my make-up vanity nicely.</li>
    <li> Plastic is sturdy enough and the lid fits in a shallow groove snugly enough that it won&#x27;t fall open with a casual nudge.  I bought two, One holds regular q-tip brand qtips laying flat with cotton facing side walls (not standing up, seems slightly cleaner to not grab them by the cotton tips.)  The other holds flat, circular cotton pads that are often used to remove cosmetics.  Easy to grab either out of their respective containers.  Very happy with these.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a well designed useful product that you&#x27;ll enjoy for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;Q tips fit perfectly and choosing to pull them one at a time is a breeze.</li>
    <li> I use it to store my dental floss picks in it since I already have matching ones for my balls and tips. It is smaller than you think it will be but does it&#x27;s job and looks nice. Definitely looks like glass, not acrylic so it&#x27;s a good deal I guess.</li>
    <li> This acrylic holder is great for q-tips. I think it is really cute and will be easier to clean than my old glass one with the metal top.</li>
    <li> Very good looking on the counter - using for q-tips and cotton balls - great size and not too cheap looking. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Fits on the shelf in medicine cabinet. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the matching cotton pad dispenser and they are both perfect. They look really nice together and keep my stuff organized.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. Looks nice and very compact. good quality plastic. Highly recommend it. Ideal for cotton swabs or cotton balls.</li>
    <li> A little bit bigger as cotton holder</li>
    <li> OK, but not the quality of original two I had already ordered and received.  This one is much lighter weight and not the material quality of the others I ordered and received.  It is OK, but I am disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> Great price and good quality!  Thick and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Very nicely made and is fun to use. Perfect size for q-tips.</li>
    <li> A Great see through plastic box. I use for Q-Tips.</li>
    <li> A little cheap looking but it does the trick. It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Works great. Holds lots of Q-tips. Very sturdy and looks nice on the counter.</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM! I bought 3, one for my q-tips laid them down flat, one for my cotton balls and I am still thinking what to use the extra one for any ideas? anyway i love them they are thick and do not look cheap it also has a nice cut once you take the lid off it goes great with my acrylic muji drawers!</li>
    <li> Makes q-tips look a lot nicer. Def a better display than the cardboard, space-consuming box the swabs come in.</li>
    <li> We use it everyu day and it works very well; the chamfering of the box-to-lid could have been more distinct as to make the lid fit more firm into the box.</li>
    <li> Would have like a smaller container but it works for what it it.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for a small bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I owned only for a month so I see how its last.</li>
</ol>
