      <li>the color always looks great and permanently stays for hours!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful color to go out at night to a club, but you can also pull it off during the day because it&#x27;s not</li>
      <li>Love the color!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Love this MAC!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great Product!  </li>
      <li>It wasnt as bright as i thought it would be</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re more into matte makeup, this may not be for you, but I urge you to try it out!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This is a great shade that I personally thinks great on most skin tones.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice shade that goes well with most skin tones and looks super cute to even a simplified outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for spring and summer!</li>
      <li>This lipstick is such a beautiful color!  </li>
      <li>*too* over the top.  </li>
      <li>will be ordering more MAC products.</li>
      <li>added on top.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an NW15 and my best friend has very, very dark skin and the color looks amazing on both of us.</li>
      <li>Fun, shimmery, and cute!</li>
      <li>Very nice and high quality product absolutely original</li>
      <li>I love the color , if you like bold lipstick this is def a winner .</li>
      <li>this lipstick is perfect, i can wear it when i am tanned or pale...</li>
      <li>It is very creamy, rich and it has a nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>good for a night out because it catches attention at the same time</li>
      <li>I love the vibrant color and the smoothness of the lipstick.</li>
      <li>I bought this from the M.A.C store and I absolutely love it, I have med brown complexion and this color looks great either used as lipstain with minimal application or with full application with a M.A.C. clear lip glass</li>
      <li>Its really moist and dosent have much staying power, infact its kind of messy but its beautiful.</li>
      <li>You can get the real thing from Mac for 16 dollars and shipping is always free.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>because i have the retro matte listick which is the exact Shade except its alot nice and lasts alooottt longer (because its matte) than this one, this one is more like a basic everyday lipstick, doesn&#x27;t really draw attention or look superfab</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a go-to color if you don&#x27;t know what to wear...</li>
      <li>Just muster up the willpower to get outta your pj&#x27;s and buy the real stuff at the MAC counter.</li>
      <li>This lipstick stays on very well.  </li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using a lip liner, because it&#x27;s kind of messy.  </li>
      <li>It is a bold pink color and a great alternative to classic red as I consider this to be a classic pink.</li>
      <li>this kinda pink draws plenty of attention and makes you look sexy in a young and vivid way!</li>
      <li>Love how it is long lasting wear!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very opaque medium-dark hot pink fuchsia.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so fun, with a blend of pink and purple (magenta) with a bit of gloss.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t bring the feeling that hot red can - maturity and obvious seductiveness.</li>
      <li>The color last and last just like any other M.A.C lipstick and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>There will be no regrets!</li>
      <li>if I get lost with all of my lipsticks and want a bold color, I usually end up grabbing this one.  </li>
      <li>It is creamy so it needs to be applied a few times during the day , but it is pretty</li>

<li> No really, the color at the MAC counter doesn&#x27;t even come close to this lipstick.</li>
<li> Just a little bit will go a long way.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s very lively and dramatic!</li>
<li> and I was a little dissapointed.</li>
<li> The gloss simmers down after extended wear, but man, this can stay on!</li>
<li> and I had to apply a few coats so it wouldnt look chalky to me.  </li>
<li> It is darker than I usually wear.</li>
<li> carefull this can look horrible on some skin tones im nc 37 and have to be careful when i wear it.</li>

    <li> Love this MAC!!!!!!!!!!! Love the color!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> this lipstick is perfect, i can wear it when i am tanned or pale... the color always looks great and permanently stays for hours!</li>
    <li> I bought this from the M.A.C store and I absolutely love it, I have med brown complexion and this color looks great either used as lipstain with minimal application or with full application with a M.A.C. clear lip glass added on top. The color last and last just like any other M.A.C lipstick and goes on smooth. I receive compliments every time I wear it. It is a bold pink color and a great alternative to classic red as I consider this to be a classic pink.</li>
    <li> Love how it is long lasting wear! It is very creamy, rich and it has a nice smell to it. It just took a while to get to me, but it did make it and I love it. will be ordering more MAC products.</li>
    <li> This lipstick stays on very well.  It is darker than I usually wear.</li>
    <li> This is a great shade that I personally thinks great on most skin tones.  I&#x27;m an NW15 and my best friend has very, very dark skin and the color looks amazing on both of us. It&#x27;s a very opaque medium-dark hot pink fuchsia. It&#x27;s in the amplified line, so it is PACKED with pigment and color.  Just a little bit will go a long way.  It&#x27;s a wonderful color to go out at night to a club, but you can also pull it off during the day because it&#x27;s not *too* over the top.  It&#x27;s really a go-to color if you don&#x27;t know what to wear...if I get lost with all of my lipsticks and want a bold color, I usually end up grabbing this one.  I highly recommend using a lip liner, because it&#x27;s kind of messy.  This is a MUST-HAVE in your MAC lipstick collection.</li>
    <li> I have bought this several times. I love the vibrant color and the smoothness of the lipstick.</li>
    <li> All the hype about this color i just had to get and I was a little dissapointed. It wasnt as bright as i thought it would be and I had to apply a few coats so it wouldnt look chalky to me.  It def needs a liner hopefully itll gorw on me.  Its only 15 on the actual MAS site so no need to buy from here haha</li>
    <li> its lovelyyyy but im upset because i have the retro matte listick which is the exact Shade except its alot nice and lasts alooottt longer (because its matte) than this one, this one is more like a basic everyday lipstick, doesn&#x27;t really draw attention or look superfab</li>
    <li> Very nice and high quality product absolutely original</li>

    <li> Please do not buy ladies. You can get the real thing from Mac for 16 dollars and shipping is always free. You have been warned ladies.</li>
    <li> I have been a big fan of MAC lipsticks since they last long on your lips usually and of course this girl about town does the same as well! It&#x27;s probably the 3rd time for me to purchase this color. it&#x27;s very lively and dramatic! good for a night out because it catches attention at the same time it doesn&#x27;t bring the feeling that hot red can - maturity and obvious seductiveness. this kinda pink draws plenty of attention and makes you look sexy in a young and vivid way!</li>
