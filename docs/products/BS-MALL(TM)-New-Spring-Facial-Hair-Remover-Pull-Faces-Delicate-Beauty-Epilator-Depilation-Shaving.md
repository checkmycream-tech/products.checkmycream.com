      <li>Luckily I work from home.</li>
      <li>I still decided to purchase since there aren&#x27;t many hair removal techniques that are completely painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is super easy to use and people who have never tried facial threading at home can use this with ease as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the pink color and the box it comes in is adorable.</li>

      <li>This works very well.....</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t putting too much on the line if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
      <li>I actually really do like this product</li>
      <li>so it was too much of a hassle to complain</li>
      <li>have found that using a warm compress prior to using actually does lessen the pain.</li>

<li> Right now I have to do my face in small patches, can&#x27;t take it otherwise!</li>
<li> It also works with a slight curve, and you don&#x27;t have to hold it parallel.</li>
<li> Buy this: it works, it&#x27;s simple, and it costs less than ONE wax at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> You must be a little habit-ed to facial removal to bear the pain if you have never tried before.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not really precise enough for that, and you will just have no eyebrow at all.</li>
<li> Go slow for sensitive areas.</li>
<li> The knobs are rough and sharp at the points.</li>
<li> I usually have a upper lip wax or a threading every 2 weeks.</li>
<li> Made my face breakout in small white bumps!</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t worry about ingrown hairs like some other methods.</li>
<li> Otherwise you still need to vary your teeezers for those rogue thick hairs that seem to grow back every other day.  </li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> Hair removal is never fun.</li>
<li> My advice is to use it daily so the hairs don&#x27;t get to thick all at once</li>
<li> and I knew I had the concept down</li>
<li> so it forms an upside down &#x27;U&#x27; shape and then hold against the skin where you are wanting to remove the hair.</li>
<li> You can roll it up and down.</li>
<li> Hurts a little but it got rid of all of my facial hair of course you need to still tweeze in hard to reach places but this product is a must if you wear a lot of foundation.</li>
<li> Obviously, this thing is going to be painful at first but after using it a few times you kinda build a tolerance to it</li>
<li> this hurts less.</li>
<li> The little box is a plus.</li>
<li> A little painful however but worth it</li>
<li> You will get the hang if it after a few minutes.</li>
<li> Anyway, as soon as I did figure out how to work it, it actually was much less painful than I expected.  </li>
<li> so the hair doesn&#x27;t get thick again</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t work on leg hair - too thick.</li>
<li> Get a wax quality job without getting a wax, seriously.</li>
<li> It dont hurt as bad as a waxing and gives the same result.</li>
<li> Painful and left my face with marks like if a cat scratched the hell out of me</li>
<li> Painful on my upper lip but everywhere else is tolerable.</li>

    <li> Not worth it. It doesn&#x27;t catch the hairs if your hair is coarse/thick. Also, it seems to rip the hair at the surface of the skin and not pull it out.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to buy a good facial hair remover for emergencies when I do not have time to go to the salon and can use some thing at the convinience of my house. This is super easy to use and people who have never tried facial threading at home can use this with ease as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the pink color and the box it comes in is adorable. It pulls the hair very easily. You must be a little habit-ed to facial removal to bear the pain if you have never tried before. But if you have done this at a salon before then doing it your self will not be that difficult. It makes using this so convinient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Hurts a little but it got rid of all of my facial hair of course you need to still tweeze in hard to reach places but this product is a must if you wear a lot of foundation.</li>
    <li> Painful and left my face with marks like if a cat scratched the hell out of me but it did its job no hair!!!! ;)</li>
    <li> This works very well..... I purchased two. I usually have a upper lip wax or a threading every 2 weeks. Decided to try this.....&amp;#34;clean upper lip&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;If you are used to plucking your eyebrows, this will not hurt you at all. If you&#x27;ve ever had a threading..... this hurts less. It feels like a rubberband pop against your skin. There are video&#x27;s on you tube on how to use these Spring Hair removers.</li>
    <li> Works great love it! Got here quickly!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and cute packaging. Painful on my upper lip but everywhere else is tolerable. I&#x27;m just glad that it works. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great! The little box is a plus. Also, fast shipping. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know. I returned mine. It arrived dirty and looked like it was used. Plus, it didn&#x27;t work. People do swear by these though, so maybe mine was just defective.</li>
    <li> works awesome.. it takes a while to get adjusted to pain... but with pain comes beauty..</li>
    <li> Works but hurts.  You have to keep at it so the hair doesn&#x27;t get thick again were it hurts alot. This item is great for on the go and vacations were waxing is not an option.  My advice is to use it daily so the hairs don&#x27;t get to thick all at once because then it is kinda painful.  Otherwise you still need to vary your teeezers for those rogue thick hairs that seem to grow back every other day.  I would definitely recommend having this item in your beauty products.</li>
    <li> This hurts, but it gets the job done.  It is also time consuming.</li>
    <li> Not a bad little tool. Obviously, this thing is going to be painful at first but after using it a few times you kinda build a tolerance to it so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. You literally are ripping multiple hairs out at a time. But it does work so if you&#x27;re alright with pain, I&#x27;d try it out.</li>
    <li> I actually really do like this product but it is extremely difficult to learn how to use. TIP: you can use your finger tips to twist as if you were rolling up a ball in between them--it has to be fast enough to rip the hair but this motion works. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have to be a perfect inverted U-shape when you use this item. For example, when doing your upper lip, you can rest it atop of the skin alongside the curvature of your mouth (side-to-side) and it will still work.</li>
    <li> Awesome. You don&#x27;t have to use a U shape. It also works with a slight curve, and you don&#x27;t have to hold it parallel. It will work perpendicular as well. You can roll it up and down. Use astringent afterwards to avoid blemishes. You might want to spray it with alcohol before you use it. They must be vigilant in their quality control because there was a hair in it when I opened it. This is great if you have a nervous habit. I normally use a nail file to clean under my fingernails obsessively. This is great to use at your desk. Luckily I work from home. I don&#x27;t know how it would look in front of others. I ran out of hair on the first day. I only wish I was latina so I could have more fun. The knobs are rough and sharp at the points. I used a Dremel to smooth them down. A nail file would work too. Go slow for sensitive areas. It doesn&#x27;t work on leg hair - too thick.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how this product got good reviews unless the folks were just lying. This is a piece of junk. Doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This tool is the best. I just got it today and it worked perfectly. Plucking my lip and chin takes forever and the hairs are so stubborn; this thing rips them right out. My skin is so smooth. Yes, it hurts on the lip but the skin will numb (just as if we&#x27;re plucking). I don&#x27;t have to walk around with a constant stubble anymore. Highly recommend. Get a wax quality job without getting a wax, seriously.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:3b3a32289f686658ae437f5f2fdadf67]] I just love my BS-MALL(TM) New Spring Facial Hair Remover Pull Faces Delicate Beauty Epilator Depilation Shaving system. I can now get all the fine hairs off my lip. It dont hurt as bad as a waxing and gives the same result. I just love it. Very cost effective and cute. I can keep in my bag and whip it out when i need it. I am so happy I was given the chance to review this product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Made my face breakout in small white bumps!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Removes my facial hair easy and quickly.  This reminds me of threading.  I wish I could use it on my eyebrows, but I would not recommend it.  It was actually addicting.  I wanted to remove all my hair and trying to find more hair I missed so I can use this.</li>
    <li> It does the job, so I am pleased with the product! a must have for any woman!</li>
    <li> If the metal and coils were thinner, it would catch more hair. It takes quite a bit of getting used to. But it does work, when used correctly.</li>
    <li> Hurts like crazy, but removes ALL the fuzz once you figure out how to use it! It took me a while to realize you have to roll the loop against the grain of the hairs. I love it, but hope the pain lessens soon. Right now I have to do my face in small patches, can&#x27;t take it otherwise!</li>
    <li> This is a neat little tool and works on most facial hair - the finer the better.</li>
    <li> There IS a bit of a learning curve...I was a little discouraged at first. The instructions seem too simple to be helpful (I thought so) but it really is quite simple to use! Once that first stubborn little facial hair came out and I knew I had the concept down, I wished that I had this little gem many moons (and dollars!) ago. Easy and effective, and the pain level is lower than waxing and threading both. I see the roots coming out so I don&#x27;t worry about ingrown hairs like some other methods. A little tip: buy a soft facial brush (or even a brush designed to brush a baby&#x27;s hair from the dollar store) and lightly exfoliate the area (dry) after you are done. It seems to make the job easier the next time around, plus it&#x27;s good for your face anyway. Buy this: it works, it&#x27;s simple, and it costs less than ONE wax at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT FOR EYEBROWS (except maybe to clean up a unibrow) because it is not designed to pull out hairs along an arch. It&#x27;s not really precise enough for that, and you will just have no eyebrow at all.</li>
    <li> It works. Pulls out mustache hair when you roll the spring. Hair removal is never fun. It does hurt a bit but beauty is pain.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I ordered several to have on hand not just at home but the office too. Easy to use. You will get the hang if it after a few minutes. Very effective!&lt;br /&gt;Never tweeze again!</li>
    <li> Works great. Removes hair and leaves skin looking smooth and great. A little painful however but worth it</li>
    <li> I have been looking for some time for a cheap yet effective way to remove hair on my upper lip. I came across this item and I figured for 7.99 I really wasn&#x27;t putting too much on the line if it didn&#x27;t work. I read reviews prior to purchasing and a lot of them mentioned that it was painful. I still decided to purchase since there aren&#x27;t many hair removal techniques that are completely painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time was quick and it came in a cute little box. It is a spring type deal with handles on each end. It took a little while to learn the right technique and I was hesitant at first knowing it was probably going to hurt. To use this, you hold the spring so it forms an upside down &#x27;U&#x27; shape and then hold against the skin where you are wanting to remove the hair. All while doing this, you twist the handles outward. Anyway, as soon as I did figure out how to work it, it actually was much less painful than I expected.  I was surprised at how well it did remove the hair as well. I have used several times now and it seems as though the hair growing back is finer and lighter. After using, my skin doesn&#x27;t look irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that using a warm compress prior to using actually does lessen the pain. I have heard ice helps, but haven&#x27;t tried that myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> its actually so easy to use, way less effort than threading.  if its not working for you watch a youtube video explaining it.  however this did come unsealed for me, but it wasnt damaged or anything so it was too much of a hassle to complain</li>
