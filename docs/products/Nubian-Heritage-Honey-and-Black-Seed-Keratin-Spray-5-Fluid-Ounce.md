### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is great at keeping my hair in great condition.  </li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>So if you like a fresh floral or a fruity fragrance this is probably not the best pick for you.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love the way my hair feels with it!</li>
      <li>love the smell!</li>
      <li>I liked it in the cream, but spray is even better!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell, honestly.  </li>
      <li>It also adds a nice sheen.</li>
      <li>but it is VERY strong...</li>
      <li>This one is perfect, leaving my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Easy to comb longer hair!</li>
      <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
      <li>I love love love the smell! ....</li>
      <li>A note about the fragrance, to me it smells mostly like vanilla, which I love.  </li>
      <li>If you like the scent, you&#x27;ll like being able to smell it all day, but if you don&#x27;t, it would probably bother you.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s because the fragrance is so potent that I&#x27;m immediately repulsed by it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Then I switched to Tresemme which was lovely but after using it for a year it almost seemed like it stopped working.</li>
      <li>Love it, its make my hair shiny and silky.</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve ever seen for non-professionals who use heat styling tools (flat iron, curling irons).  </li>
      <li>love the easy way that it sprays.</li>
      <li>Either way, the hair comes out soft, smooth, and with great shine.  </li>
      <li>I think it would be fine for the majority of folks</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the fragrance is strong, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it light either.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is SO smooth and slippery.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t going to coat your hair and make it shine or feel super slippery smooth like cone products.</li>
      <li>I love Nubian Heritage products and the fact that they use mostly organic, all natural products.</li>
      <li>Using this, my hair was not damaged, smelled great, and reverted right back to curly when I washed it.</li>
      <li>is very natural, which is why I love it.</li>
      <li>Still going to try to use it when I rarely straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I did  not put this in my hair for any extended period of time to ascertain if it does actually replace the shine in your hair.  </li>
      <li>I spray this on freshly washed and conditioned hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t blow dry very often, but I am going to buy some more of this because whenever I find something I love, it ends up</li>
      <li>One bottle lasted me more than a month with regular usage.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that the smell is a bit strong.</li>
      <li>and it really makes your hair super soft and shiny if you blow-dry a lot</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t like anything heavy, sticky or that causes any kind of buildup - especially because I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day.</li>
      <li>I use both, my technique leaves much to be desired, and my ends don&#x27;t suffer for it because of this product.</li>
      <li>I really care about how a product performs.  </li>
      <li>It works very well as a leave in conditioner</li>
      <li>lt is smooth when l flat iron</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair feel nice and soft without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>So when I sprayed this thing first, on my daughter&#x27;s hair, I immediately scanned the ingredients, and everything sounded natural.  </li>
      <li>Luckily for me, it only costed my $3.50 on the clearance section of Walgreens, I would have been fuming if I paid the price they&#x27;re asking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a little dissapointed - i thought i would love this</li>
      <li>so I wanted just a little more protection from the heat ( blow dryer).</li>
      <li>I have normal hair that appears to be thinning.</li>
      <li>I tried this only once;  I don&#x27;t think it is right for my hair type.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like most products that are recommended for curly hair.</li>
      <li>I use rose and jasmine absoluts, and from my searches, true essence from other flowers are extremely expensive, and they actually smell like flowers, not like a cheap Walmart hand lotion.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend spraying this lightly on your hair and then adding a little of the heat protect leave in conditioner they have as well.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair that I had not straightened for over 4 years.</li>
      <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t as soft anymore, it seemed to be getting dryer.</li>
      <li>I already had the heat protectant spray from this line,but my hair is fine and very tightly coiled</li>
      <li>Though I do think this is a small amount of product for the price, you really don&#x27;t need a whole lot.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement (I&#x27;ve used about 2/3 of the bottle so far).  </li>
      <li>It smelled nice, pretty disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>but my hair is such that it needs a bit of styling generally.</li>
      <li>Really weighed down.</li>

    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever seen for non-professionals who use heat styling tools (flat iron, curling irons).  I use both, my technique leaves much to be desired, and my ends don&#x27;t suffer for it because of this product.</li>
    <li> I will continue to use this from now on.  It helps manage my frizz and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> I air dry my hair but my hair is such that it needs a bit of styling generally. Because of this I need heat protection. In college I used Sunsilk but that disappeared. Then I switched to Tresemme which was lovely but after using it for a year it almost seemed like it stopped working. My hair wasn&#x27;t as soft anymore, it seemed to be getting dryer. I pulled off it for awhile to see if that helped and it did, but after a couple months I saw the same problem. I was beginning to become leery of cones anyways, so I began searching for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;This is very natural, which is why I love it. It isn&#x27;t going to coat your hair and make it shine or feel super slippery smooth like cone products. However, it will protect your hair and it does feel softer when using. I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t like anything heavy, sticky or that causes any kind of buildup - especially because I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day. The only downside is that the smell is a bit strong. After spraying though it seems to settle and dissipate. I would recommend spraying this lightly on your hair and then adding a little of the heat protect leave in conditioner they have as well.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff! It works very well as a leave in conditioner and it makes my hair feel nice and soft without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> First off I didn&#x27;t recieve a sprayer so that is disappointing, I am in contact with the seller to see if they can ship just that to me as I think that would help with portion control. This is a semi heavy oil if you are caucasion, in my opinion. I have normal hair that appears to be thinning. My hair itself is very thick and used to be curly, but is now straight. I blow dry it when I wash it every 3-4 days and I wanted a product that would help protect against heat damage and have some shine as well. I love Nubian Heritage products and the fact that they use mostly organic, all natural products. My family uses their lotions and soaps daily. So, I have found that using a pea sized amount doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair but I don&#x27;t get the glossy shine I am looking for. I will let my daughter, who is biracial take if for a spin and see how she likes it as a leave in as she doesn&#x27;t tradionally heat style her hair.</li>
    <li> I love love love the smell! .... and it really makes your hair super soft and shiny if you blow-dry a lot</li>
    <li> I already had the heat protectant spray from this line,but my hair is fine and very tightly coiled so I wanted just a little more protection from the heat ( blow dryer). I used this serum along with the spray and my hair felt like silk! This stuff is SO smooth and slippery. It also adds a nice sheen. Sometimes my hair feels a bit brittle after blow drying...not with this serum. I love this product. I don&#x27;t blow dry very often, but I am going to buy some more of this because whenever I find something I love, it ends up discontinued  :(  I&#x27;m not taking any chances with this one! Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that I had not straightened for over 4 years. I bought this product because I wanted to switch it up and straighten my hair. Using this, my hair was not damaged, smelled great, and reverted right back to curly when I washed it.</li>
    <li> This is great. I liked it in the cream, but spray is even better! Easy to comb longer hair! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little dissapointed - i thought i would love this but i didnt. The product made my hair stick and rough and it smelt &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like most products that are recommended for curly hair. Unfortunetley this ended up being one of them. I think it would be fine for the majority of folks but it made my hair dry and brittle for some reason. Really weighed down. It smelled nice, pretty disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for me. Still going to try to use it when I rarely straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great at keeping my hair in great condition.  My hair can be dry and coarse without any product before drying but some hair oils leave it too oily.  This one is perfect, leaving my hair soft and shiny.  I love the fragrance but it is VERY strong...to me it&#x27;s similar to Juicy Couture.  So if you like a fresh floral or a fruity fragrance this is probably not the best pick for you.</li>
    <li> I agree with a previous review.  I have 4a/b textured hair, for reference.  The benefits of this product are really obvious when it is used with heat.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell, honestly.  I really care about how a product performs.  I spray this on freshly washed and conditioned hair.  Then, I layer a cream heat protecting leave in over it.  Next I either roller set and dry under the hood dryer or I let my hair air dry and then blow dry with a hand dryer.  Either way, the hair comes out soft, smooth, and with great shine.  If I use another spray leave in (such as Chi keratin mist), I don&#x27;t get the same smoothness, strength or shine.  Though I do think this is a small amount of product for the price, you really don&#x27;t need a whole lot.  One bottle lasted me more than a month with regular usage.</li>
    <li> Love it, its make my hair shiny and silky. lt is smooth when l flat iron</li>
    <li> I tried this only once;  I don&#x27;t think it is right for my hair type.  I am going to give it another try before I reach my final conclusion.</li>
    <li> Luv it.  Product as described.  Heat protected my hair, held my curls, and my hair was left softcandcsmooth when I combed it out. Would luv to try other hair products from this company.</li>
    <li> love the smell! love the easy way that it sprays. Love the way my hair feels with it!</li>
    <li> Thought bottle was bigger</li>
    <li> Due to coloring, my hair was getting coarse &amp; had lots of split ends.  I&#x27;ve been using this every time I wash my hair &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement (I&#x27;ve used about 2/3 of the bottle so far).  My hair is not completely fixed, but it&#x27;s much softer with less split ends.  A note about the fragrance, to me it smells mostly like vanilla, which I love.  I don&#x27;t think the fragrance is strong, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it light either.  The scent takes a long time to fade away.  If you like the scent, you&#x27;ll like being able to smell it all day, but if you don&#x27;t, it would probably bother you.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I did  not put this in my hair for any extended period of time to ascertain if it does actually replace the shine in your hair.  That&#x27;s because the fragrance is so potent that I&#x27;m immediately repulsed by it.  I abhor artificial fragrance, and avoid it in all products.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t cause me to sneeze (which some does), its artificialness and potency is enough to distract me from all life.  It&#x27;s like you want to get away from it, except it&#x27;s on you, so there&#x27;s no running away.  So when I sprayed this thing first, on my daughter&#x27;s hair, I immediately scanned the ingredients, and everything sounded natural.  The words used were: \\&quot;Rosemary extract, Honeysuckle flower and Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract.\\&quot;  Does \\&quot;extract\\&quot; mean fragrance in this sense, b/c there&#x27;s no way in heck this is from actual flowers.  I use rose and jasmine absoluts, and from my searches, true essence from other flowers are extremely expensive, and they actually smell like flowers, not like a cheap Walmart hand lotion.  So if you don&#x27;t like fragrances, this product is not from you.  Luckily for me, it only costed my $3.50 on the clearance section of Walgreens, I would have been fuming if I paid the price they&#x27;re asking.</li>
