      <li>/&gt;They are the greatest way to curl hair.  </li>

      <li>These curlers work great.</li>
      <li>It comes with a great supply of rollers and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
      <li>Great curlers and</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>The 30 curler set is perfect for rolling a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>Perhaps this product works better with hair that takes a curl easier than mine!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fast, and the curls are awesome!  </li>
      <li>If you want beautiful curls roll your hair and leave in until the rollers cool (about the time it takes to apply your makeup).  </li>
      <li>Live the on and off switch and perfect curls.</li>
      <li>This is my 3rd system I&#x27;ve owned over a 20 year period and it is too me the best system.</li>
      <li>Love these.  </li>
      <li>My hair retains water more then others so using this product dries out my hair.</li>
      <li>I have used Caruso rollers since I was a kid, and I remember the quality being much better in the 80s.  </li>
      <li>My wife has used these for many years.  </li>
      <li>The curls stay in for many hours and it helps to smooth out my frizz.</li>
      <li>but this one gives her more space to heat the curlers more quickly.  </li>
      <li>Easy to control the size of curl with the variety of rollers.  </li>
      <li>So easy to use.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and whether from age, coloring, or blow drying the ends of my hair had become frayed.</li>
      <li>But there&#x27;s a huge bag of the jumbo rollers.</li>
      <li>the curlers are light weight and comfortable.</li>
      <li>They are a quick fix for my hair, do no damage to my hair and</li>
      <li>place the curler on the steamer - part hair for the roller and roll hair - that quickly</li>
      <li>They curl hair quickly.</li>
      <li>I needed more medium sized curlers, so if you anticipate needing more mediums or smalls, just order them extra</li>
      <li>used 5 big rollers yesterday (shoulder length hair) and it held nicely all day in the Georgia heat and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
      <li>one time I was able to purchase just the steamer portion of the set, and purchase them directly through Caruso</li>
      <li>If you just want more body with a light curl just roll all of your hair and then start removing the rollers starting with the first one you put in immediately.  </li>
      <li>hair is baby fine and normally won&#x27;t hold a curl for very long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love these, my hair not only has curl and style</li>
      <li>I love this product while it works, but it really only lasts about 6-8 months before I have to replace it.  </li>
      <li>Heats quickly and leaves hair soft, not fried looking.</li>
      <li>It clicks the whole time</li>
      <li>When set on the pro setting, the steam comes out fast and the curler is ready in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ready by the time you&#x27;ve gotten the section you need--apply the roller.  </li>
      <li>Not too much to say on the Caruso Hair Setter system.</li>
      <li>they work fast.</li>
      <li>Better then expected.</li>
      <li>I had a learning curve to set the curlers correctly,  but now I really like the way my hair looks and feels</li>
      <li>Very inconsistent curl.</li>
      <li>The steam setting doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it used to, either, so the curls don&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours, even in the cool, dry climate I live in.  </li>
      <li>I had used a friend&#x27;s Caruso just a month previous, and my hair looked fantastic &amp; held curl all day without hair spray or product!</li>
      <li>But, it is so much better for my hair than a blow dryer that I not only replace this one, but I also keep an extra of the travel one for trips.  </li>
      <li>You just let the steam get the curler hot nothing more, if it&#x27;s wet you left in on the steamer too</li>
      <li>they can easily burn  one due to steam..</li>
      <li>The professional setting steams much faster.  </li>
      <li>Caruso normally would sell the steamer for 14.95.  </li>
      <li>I buy a new one.  </li>
      <li>This one, for example, clicks loudly and nonstop while on the steam setting.  </li>
      <li>but they no longer sale directly to the public and now to buy the steamer</li>
      <li>The last couple years she&#x27;s been using bottled water so far no problems and</li>
      <li>She normally uses the single size</li>
      <li>I am crazy about Caruso rollers and they are all I will ever use because I have very fine, wispy hair that breaks off easily and can&#x27;t handle curling irons, but it seems like each subsequent Caruso system I purchase gets a little lower in quality.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Caruso Hair Setter for over 30 years, my hair is long (down to my waist), thick and very healthy and I color my hair and have for all of the 30 years</li>
      <li>No dry heat to damage and make hair brittle, only a moist heat to curl and add shine.  </li>

<li> The unit is much smaller than I anticipated, which is an added bonus while getting ready in my tiny bathroom--fits on the area of a small sink where the soap dish would sit.  </li>
<li> I am disappointed that after 3 attempts at the same curled hairstyle, my fine &amp; very straight hair isn&#x27;t holding a curl as it did with her non-ionic Caruso set.</li>
<li> Her current one is getting old and she was afraid they might not be available in the future</li>
<li> This may be because my hair is very long (mid back)</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t dry it out like curling irons do.</li>
<li> My steamers last from as little as 6 months to as long as a year</li>
<li> For the people who say they had a wet mess - it&#x27;s because they left the curler on the steamer too long.  </li>
<li> This system definitely curls but leaves hair a little damp at times.  </li>
<li> Be careful bec.</li>
<li> So have to blow dry for a few minutes after.</li>
<li> I had previously purchase a Caruso and it lasted for years.</li>
<li> --my hair is much less damaged than when I used the blow dryer.</li>
<li> You can put the roller cap on the steam for about 2 seconds if you want--it captures a little steam and warmth, which is helpful if the section of hair you&#x27;ve rolled has a lot of volume to it.  </li>
<li> For me this is a miracle in a little box.</li>
<li> Cheaper than a checked bay round trip</li>
<li> It has a slightly annoying clicking sound when it is producing steam.</li>
<li> This was reason enough for me to buy another when the last one went bad.</li>
<li> What a waste!</li>
<li> Wife loves it had three in the past 15 years,she uses hers every day only one went bad because of the hard water that we have here in Utah.</li>
<li> I am disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair is fine and whether from age, coloring, or blow drying the ends of my hair had become frayed. No amount of conditioner or treatment would give my hair the body and bounce it once had,  until Caruso. For me this is a miracle in a little box. My hair comes out bouncy and the curl lasts for days even without product. Amazing! Thank you Caruso.</li>
    <li> These work great for me. The curls stay in for many hours and it helps to smooth out my frizz.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  When they finally wear out, (every 4 to 5 years). I buy a new one.  They are a quick fix for my hair, do no damage to my hair and the curlers are light weight and comfortable.</li>
    <li> It heats up in 1 minute and works great,  I love it !!!</li>
    <li> I had a learning curve to set the curlers correctly,  but now I really like the way my hair looks and feels</li>
    <li> Used it once....curls stayed for about 2 hours. The second time I tried to use it, it would NOT turn on! What a waste!</li>
    <li> Very inconsistent curl. That&#x27;s all I will say. Since my last review was removed.</li>
    <li> Not too much to say on the Caruso Hair Setter system. This is my 3rd system I&#x27;ve owned over a 20 year period and it is too me the best system. Your curls will last for days and its not with electric heat but steam (which is healthier for your hair).&lt;br /&gt;Another 5 star product!!!!</li>
    <li> My Caruso roller set is almost 20 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it daily, so it does not have a lot of wear and tear, but it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is baby fine and normally won&#x27;t hold a curl for very long.&lt;br /&gt;I used 5 big rollers yesterday (shoulder length hair) and it held nicely all day in the Georgia heat and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;Works best to just style with fingers or one swipe with a vent brush after removing the rollers from hair.</li>
    <li> These curlers work great. Heats quickly and leaves hair soft, not fried looking. By the time I&#x27;m done putting them in, I start taking them out. They curl hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Caruso steam setter for 25+ years, and this one is number 4!  it&#x27;s fast, and the curls are awesome!  I wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else on my hair... it doesn&#x27;t dry it out like curling irons do. and the best part:  IT&#x27;S THE FASTEST CURLING YOU WILL EVER SEE!!</li>
    <li> I have used the Caruso Hair Setter for over 30 years, my hair is long (down to my waist), thick and very healthy and I color my hair and have for all of the 30 years and I roll my hair daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the greatest way to curl hair.  No dry heat to damage and make hair brittle, only a moist heat to curl and add shine.  You choose just how curly you want your hair.  If you just want more body with a light curl just roll all of your hair and then start removing the rollers starting with the first one you put in immediately.  If you want beautiful curls roll your hair and leave in until the rollers cool (about the time it takes to apply your makeup).  For the people who say they had a wet mess - it&#x27;s because they left the curler on the steamer too long.  You just let the steam get the curler hot nothing more, if it&#x27;s wet you left in on the steamer too long.&lt;br /&gt;I place the curler on the steamer - part hair for the roller and roll hair - that quickly no waiting.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;I bought two so I always have a backup.  I one time I was able to purchase just the steamer portion of the set, and purchase them directly through Caruso but they no longer sale directly to the public and now to buy the steamer only you pay $29.95.  Caruso normally would sell the steamer for 14.95.  My steamers last from as little as 6 months to as long as a year and that&#x27;s with daily use.  When they go out after 6 months is when I would buy the steamer.  The 30 curler set is perfect for rolling a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> Love these, my hair not only has curl and style it is also sleek and shiny.  A hint, it is bulky, so traveled to my daughters house.  Instead of paying for a checked bag both ways I sent her a set and used it while I was visiting.  Cheaper than a checked bay round trip and she now has this set</li>
    <li> There are two settings.  The professional setting steams much faster.  It clicks the whole time it&#x27;s on that setting, but that&#x27;s OK--just a reminder.  So easy to use.  The unit is much smaller than I anticipated, which is an added bonus while getting ready in my tiny bathroom--fits on the area of a small sink where the soap dish would sit.  When set on the pro setting, the steam comes out fast and the curler is ready in about 5 seconds--15 seconds would be max steam penetration.  You just need to get used to putting the next curler on the steamer before you prepare your section of hair.  It&#x27;s ready by the time you&#x27;ve gotten the section you need--apply the roller.  You can put the roller cap on the steam for about 2 seconds if you want--it captures a little steam and warmth, which is helpful if the section of hair you&#x27;ve rolled has a lot of volume to it.  I needed more medium sized curlers, so if you anticipate needing more mediums or smalls, just order them extra--they come in packs of 6 on Amazon.  But there&#x27;s a huge bag of the jumbo rollers.</li>
    <li> I love this product while it works, but it really only lasts about 6-8 months before I have to replace it.  But, it is so much better for my hair than a blow dryer that I not only replace this one, but I also keep an extra of the travel one for trips.  I wash my hair at night and use it in the mornings--my hair is much less damaged than when I used the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Had these years ago and decided to try them again. Live the on and off switch and perfect curls. Easy to control the size of curl with the variety of rollers.  If you like volume and curl without heat damage these are a must have</li>
    <li> Love these.  I can curl my bleached hair and it doesn&#x27;t damage it.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchase a Caruso and it lasted for years. This was reason enough for me to buy another when the last one went bad. It comes with a great supply of rollers and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Wife loves it had three in the past 15 years,she uses hers every day only one went bad because of the hard water that we have here in Utah. The last couple years she&#x27;s been using bottled water so far no problems and this one is an extra one</li>
    <li> Better then expected.</li>
    <li> Great curlers and they work fast. However, they do not last all day. This may be because my hair is very long (mid back) plus I&#x27;m not using product but still a great alternative tool.</li>
    <li> This system definitely curls but leaves hair a little damp at times.  So have to blow dry for a few minutes after. My hair retains water more then others so using this product dries out my hair.</li>
    <li> Only the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; steam works. It has a slightly annoying clicking sound when it is producing steam. I had used a friend&#x27;s Caruso just a month previous, and my hair looked fantastic &amp; held curl all day without hair spray or product! I am disappointed that after 3 attempts at the same curled hairstyle, my fine &amp; very straight hair isn&#x27;t holding a curl as it did with her non-ionic Caruso set. I don&#x27;t know if the model affects the curl, or if our water is so much different in my city than in her city?  Regardless, something about this set is causing prohibiting my hair from holding the same curl. The curlers do produce volume, however, I will need to rethink what style I want. I am disappointed. Perhaps this product works better with hair that takes a curl easier than mine!</li>
    <li> these are great!!  I find these curlers are healthier for my hair than electric curlers, and my hairstyle lasts for days, even in rainy or humid weather. this is the third set I&#x27;ve purchased .</li>
    <li> I have used Caruso rollers since I was a kid, and I remember the quality being much better in the 80s.  I am crazy about Caruso rollers and they are all I will ever use because I have very fine, wispy hair that breaks off easily and can&#x27;t handle curling irons, but it seems like each subsequent Caruso system I purchase gets a little lower in quality.  This one, for example, clicks loudly and nonstop while on the steam setting.  I don&#x27;t think it is supposed to do that.  The steam setting doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it used to, either, so the curls don&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours, even in the cool, dry climate I live in.  I wish Caruso would go back to the type/quality of products they had in the 80s.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for travel.  Be careful bec. they can easily burn  one due to steam..</li>
    <li> My wife has used these for many years.  Her current one is getting old and she was afraid they might not be available in the future so I ordered this for her.  She normally uses the single size but this one gives her more space to heat the curlers more quickly.  Should last for years.</li>
