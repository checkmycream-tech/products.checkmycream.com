      <li>Also, I put this tattoo on my wrist the first time and on my finger the second time and both times the tattoo stayed intact for 5 days.</li>
      <li>but unfortunately it comes off really quick (easy to wash off) by the end of the day a lot of it is rubbed off.</li>

<li> did not stay on very long</li>

<li> THAN EXPECTED</li>
<li> I have ordered other designs from Tattify as well.</li>
<li> I purchased these because I&#x27;m unable to get a real tattoo for myself</li>
<li> They also don&#x27;t look trashy because they&#x27;re just plain black.</li>
<li> Really small to the point</li>
<li> they were hard to read.</li>
<li> , IT WAS HARD TO PUT THIS ON WITHOUT A TON OF THE SHINY EXCESS AROUND THE TATTOO THAT SHOWS HOW FAKE IT IS.  </li>
<li> This tattoo is cliche, boring, and over produced in actual tattoo form.</li>
<li> Looks too fake??</li>

    <li> My sister just loved this super cute temporary tattoos I will be ordering soon for me I just loved them. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves the tattoo&#x27;s! her only complaint is that they don&#x27;t stay long enough. (As in she loves them, not bad quality).</li>
    <li> Super cute on, easy to put on, but only lasted a couple hours. If you are artistically inclined, just use a sharpie.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t stay on too long.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay on too easily, but what did I expect from a temporary tattoo. Bought these for my sister&#x27;s daughter, she liked them.</li>
    <li> 3 stars because after an hour it sarted to come off.</li>
    <li> These were great...but didn&#x27;t last very long at all...</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t even last 1hr before it was gone....</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS TATTOO,  HOWEVER, IT WAS HARD TO PUT THIS ON WITHOUT A TON OF THE SHINY EXCESS AROUND THE TATTOO THAT SHOWS HOW FAKE IT IS.  IT WAS ALSO MUCH SMALLER THAN EXPECTED BUT ALL IN ALL I LIKED THEM</li>
    <li> So cute and fun. They last about a day or so, but you have to watch if putting on hands it washes off.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these temporary tattoos. They go on very easy. They only last for 2-3 days before they start to peel away but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. If I wanted it to be permanent I would get a real one.  I have ordered other designs from Tattify as well. Great company.</li>
    <li> Really small to the point they were hard to read.</li>
    <li> did not stay on very long</li>

    <li> I love tattoos unfortunately I cant decide what to get permanently on my skin so these will fill the spot of tattoos till I decide on what to get. This is so dainty. but unfortunately it comes off really quick (easy to wash off) by the end of the day a lot of it is rubbed off. this is perfect for going to music festival</li>
    <li> The kids loved them!!!! Easy to put on and take off, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. They also don&#x27;t look trashy because they&#x27;re just plain black.</li>

    <li> Very pretty design but did not adhere.  Lasted all of 5 minutes and the bird was totally smudged.</li>
    <li> Cute and just as pictured.</li>
    <li> These temporary tattoos look just like the picture.</li>
    <li> This tattoo is cliche, boring, and over produced in actual tattoo form. Why have people bought these?? Why are there reviews?? Looks too fake?? Get a real tattoo and how about not a terrible one.</li>
