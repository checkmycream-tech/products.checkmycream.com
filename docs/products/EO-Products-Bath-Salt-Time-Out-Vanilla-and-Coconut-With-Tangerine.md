      <li>Otherwise, nice stuff!</li>
      <li>Good quality Works great</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>Wonderul would buy again and stock up for winter great smell and feel your body and soul will love this soak</li>
      <li>It has a nice soothing scent and leaves your skin silky.  </li>
      <li>Good Stuff - wish the Eucalyptus had more scent :)</li>
      <li>so nice and relaxing and refreshing for foot bath..</li>
      <li>How could any salt make me feel better, I said to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more of the eucalyptus scent, but it was non-existent.</li>
      <li>EO&#x27;s products are simply the best.  </li>
      <li>If you care about organic (purity is the qualifier,) then beware of many products made by EO.</li>
      <li>love love thank u</li>
      <li>Love this soak.</li>
      <li>They are relaxing, refreshing and whatever you need them to be.  </li>
      <li>I love the EO line of bath salts.  </li>
      <li>love the smell love the salt..</li>
      <li>Takes so much more than another brand.</li>
      <li>No tricky additions on the ingredients list like most manufacturers.</li>
      <li>I love these bath salts.</li>
      <li>eucalyptus just feels better...</li>
      <li>The combination of Eucalytus &amp; Arnica works perfectly for a long soak in the tub.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent on these is mostly pine and lime to my nose (which are in the ingredients list) and not eucalyptus or arnica, so if you are looking for something with a strong eucaluptus smell, these are not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would recommend them everyone who needs to relax or calm or just enjoy a good soak.</li>
      <li>If the Amazon description were more accurate, I would not have purchased this product.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant smell and dissolve pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>EO is organic and free of harmful inredients</li>
      <li>These are great for relaxing after a long week.</li>
      <li>so I gave these a try and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more real soon.</li>
      <li>They really do work!!</li>
      <li>The arnica in this blend is VERY effective, similar to a mild muscle relaxer and far safer.</li>
      <li>Kind of short on Arnica scent.</li>
      <li>I have been going through the many bath salts on Amazon and so far I like these</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be as impressed as I was by these, I usually buy plain salts and mix my own oils in</li>
      <li>These are my favorite for a long soak in the tub after dancing all night.</li>
      <li>Pricey and a small container, but good stuff.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think bath salt was going to really do anything for me.</li>
      <li>Really just calms the mind and body to get to a serene sense of bliss.</li>
      <li>Very relaxing and soothes my muscles.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, the USDA organic label (for the oils) is very suspect.</li>
      <li>EO is the best, try them and you wont be sorry!</li>
      <li>is that they are almost all salts (not like calgon or Japanese bath salts) and the scent is clean and not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A little gritty and a bit pricey otherwise a great natural addition to my bath.  </li>
      <li>Overall,  I didn&#x27;t find it worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>I usually use Epsom salts,  and they are much more affordable.</li>
      <li>My mind was clear my body felt cleansed.</li>
      <li>The water feels so soft and comforting.</li>
      <li>I totally couldn&#x27;t believe that it would make me feel like I was giving a new body.</li>
      <li>It does leave the Jacuzzi tub with a slightly oily film, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone with chronic or occasional pain looking for natural relief.</li>
      <li>I suffer from chronic pain and have two active children to keep up with so at the end of the day a long hot soak frequently becomes a lifesaver.</li>
      <li>Okay, but very weak odor.</li>

<li> I was wrong,</li>
<li> I found the scent almost unnoticeable,  and the salt is difficult to dissolve.  </li>
<li> when you have a cold...</li>
<li> and when you don&#x27;t have a cold it smells like a spa treatement to me...</li>
<li> but it has some very questionable ingredients in the bath salts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Says use a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; ounce. You actually need to use 3-4 ounces for a bath. Otherwise, nice stuff!</li>
    <li> Kind of short on Arnica scent. Takes so much more than another brand.</li>
    <li> This will lift you up when you are down or not feeling well. EO is the best, try them and you wont be sorry! EO is organic and free of harmful inredients</li>
    <li> I have been going through the many bath salts on Amazon and so far I like these the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about them is that they are almost all salts (not like calgon or Japanese bath salts) and the scent is clean and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent on these is mostly pine and lime to my nose (which are in the ingredients list) and not eucalyptus or arnica, so if you are looking for something with a strong eucaluptus smell, these are not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> when you have a cold... eucalyptus just feels better... and when you don&#x27;t have a cold it smells like a spa treatement to me... thus the reason I buy it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the EO bath salts for several years. I like the Be Well the best but I also like Time Out with vanilla and tangerine. Very relaxing and soothes my muscles.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be as impressed as I was by these, I usually buy plain salts and mix my own oils in but I had a coupon so I gave these a try and was not disappointed. I suffer from chronic pain and have two active children to keep up with so at the end of the day a long hot soak frequently becomes a lifesaver. The arnica in this blend is VERY effective, similar to a mild muscle relaxer and far safer. I would recommend this to anyone with chronic or occasional pain looking for natural relief. The scent is pleasant and not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> A little gritty and a bit pricey otherwise a great natural addition to my bath.  Wish the container was larger.</li>
    <li> These are great for relaxing after a long week. Really just calms the mind and body to get to a serene sense of bliss.</li>
    <li> I receive EO Be Well Bath Salts with Eucalyptus &amp; Amica through Subscribe and Save for several months.  It has a nice soothing scent and leaves your skin silky.  It seems to have a calming effect.  It does leave the Jacuzzi tub with a slightly oily film, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> love the smell love the salt.. so nice and relaxing and refreshing for foot bath..&lt;br /&gt;love love love thank u</li>
    <li> Okay, but very weak odor. Also, a very small bag for the cost. I was hoping for more of the eucalyptus scent, but it was non-existent. Smelled like Epsom salts and not much else.</li>
    <li> A must have for soaking muscles.</li>
    <li> Wonderul would buy again and stock up for winter great smell and feel your body and soul will love this soak</li>
    <li> Good Stuff - wish the Eucalyptus had more scent :)</li>
    <li> EO&#x27;s products are simply the best.  My kitchen and bathroom look like an EO display case.</li>
    <li> Good quality Works great</li>
    <li> Love this soak. Great for aches and pains!</li>
    <li> This is truly a quality organic product. No tricky additions on the ingredients list like most manufacturers. Burt Bees, for example, claims to be an organic type product but it has some very questionable ingredients in the bath salts.</li>
    <li> I love these bath salts. When I get out of the tub, I feel so relaxed. The combination of Eucalytus &amp; Arnica works perfectly for a long soak in the tub. The water feels so soft and comforting. I never want to get out of the tub.</li>
    <li> I love the EO line of bath salts.  They are relaxing, refreshing and whatever you need them to be.  I would recommend them everyone who needs to relax or calm or just enjoy a good soak.</li>
    <li> I felt soothed and my muscles felt relaxed after a 20 min soak.  Pricey and a small container, but good stuff.</li>
    <li> If you care about organic (purity is the qualifier,) then beware of many products made by EO. Specifically, their bath SALTS are predominately sourced from California. After Fukushima,  products (wine, fruits, fish) from California are suspect anyway, but salt sourced from the Pacific Coast of California is just plain ludicrous. If the Amazon description were more accurate, I would not have purchased this product.  In my opinion, the USDA organic label (for the oils) is very suspect. On a different note, the packaging is not very attractive.</li>
    <li> I found the scent almost unnoticeable,  and the salt is difficult to dissolve.  Overall,  I didn&#x27;t find it worth the cost.  I usually use Epsom salts,  and they are much more affordable.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite for a long soak in the tub after dancing all night. They really do work!! Pleasant smell and dissolve pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think bath salt was going to really do anything for me. How could any salt make me feel better, I said to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.....I was wrong, the feeling you will get when using this bath salt is amazing! I totally couldn&#x27;t believe that it would make me feel like I was giving a new body. I could feel the difference within minutes of soaking myself in the tub. My mind was clear my body felt cleansed. Oh the feeling of a bath salt is beyond my understand of relaxation. I will be buying more real soon.</li>
