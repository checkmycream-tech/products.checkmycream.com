<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love Giovanni products, but especially love this leave in conditioner and the way it makes makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner that I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried many. It leaves my hair soft and moisturized . Not greasy. It also defines my curls.</li>
    <li> Works. Helps create &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; and get the knots out.</li>
    <li> Best for KimmayTube recipe! I used to use Kinky Kurly Knot Today for my Kimmay Tube recipe, but it was sooooo expensive! Giovanni is just as good and more budget friendly!</li>
    <li> Works well for my Sisterlocks. Light and gives good conditioning. Does not build up, nice fragrance. I mix it with water in a spray bottle for daily use.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this leave in for years.  I finally got my hands on some and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.  I&#x27;m black with a relaxer and I rollerset my hair every week.  This has quickly become my leave in conditioner of choice.  It&#x27;s come the closest to making my hair as soft as the Dominicans make it when I have them do my hair. (LOL)      I noticed that my hair actually takes LONGER to dry when I use this for roller sets than other leave in conditioners.  I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so moisturizing and locks that moisture in.    My only suggestion is that less is more.  The only time I&#x27;ve had a problem is when I&#x27;ve used too much.  You could literally see the conditioner stuck in the comb as I combed it out.  And my hair feels a bit harder when it&#x27;s dry.  I have arm pit length hair and using a quarter size amount is more than enough.</li>
    <li> This product line is my wife&#x27;s favorite. She has really fine hair and uses this and the shampoo by Giovanni every day. Wish they offered a larger size or refill economy size as I&#x27;ve installed a dedicated dispenser for Giovanni in her shower.</li>
    <li> Finally! I&#x27;ve tried just about every kind of leave-in out there.  I live in the high desert and have extremly curly hair so it dries out rediculously fast.  I use Giovanni immediatly after I shower (usually at night) and comb it through with my fingers. This is the only product that I can do that with and have soft chunky curls the next morning. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or wet looking.  Awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner when looking for something that would leave my hair feeling moisturized, but that didn&#x27;t leave a film or coating and that didn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.  I am African-American with short naturally curly hair and I love this leave-in conditioner.  It has a light consistency, \\&quot;dissolves&#x27; into the hair strands, and is great for wash-n-gos.  It leaves my hair feeling moisturized, but you can&#x27;t actually feel it in my hair.  It smells good and wears well under other styling products.  The ingredients are amazing and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I think this has protein and my hair does not like protein. it makes my hair stiff and hard after air drying. i wont buy this again</li>
    <li> As others have said, Giovanni Direct Leave-In is a fantastic product which leaves my hair soft, manageable, and smooth.  I apply it on my wet hair after getting out of the shower.  I only need to use about a dime to quarter sized amount on my long nearly tailbone length hair.  I smooth it through with my fingers and then comb through my hair.  The comb slides through effortlessly after applying the product.  It really works a treat!</li>
    <li> Not the best leave in product. it left my hair sticky and it got dirty very fast.  wont buy it again. I bought the 3 pack and i didn&#x27;t even used one bottle completely. what a waste...buy the magnetic conditioner instead... thats great, especially for dry, unruly hair..</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite leave-in conditioner. It is all natural, light-weight and is excellent for detangling. I have thick, long, relaxed hair, so spray-on leave-ins do NOTHING for my hair. This has the consistency of a regular conditioner, but is light enough to use daily. I LOVE this stuff and I wish it came in a larger size. Try it out, you will NOT be sorry.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hair, which needs moisture! This leave-in is very light. It&#x27;s as if you were just adding water to your hair. I don&#x27;t use it alone. I will add that or water, then another creamy moisturizer and some oil. But it&#x27;s great for a base and if you feel your hair is dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> Something is going on with Giovanni brand hair care products. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but for a while now, you never know if you&#x27;re getting a good bottle of it or a bad bottle of it. I&#x27;ve sworn by this Direct Leave-In Conditioner for a few years now, and the last bottle I bought of it, just a couple weeks ago, left my hair sticky and disgusting feeling, even when I used a very small amount. For this reason, and because the same thing has happened with their shampoos and conditioners, I would recommend never buying any of their products without first looking at it and smelling the exact bottle you&#x27;re buying. If it smells or looks even slightly different from what you&#x27;re used to, don&#x27;t get it.    Even in the stores, you see yellowing, awful looking bottles of Giovanni products when they should be clear. I used to see this only at the big drug store chains and attributed it to aging stock, but now I see it regularly at Whole Foods and my local natural foods store, where I used to be able to get a good bottle of it.     Apparently the company claims this is normal. I would be fine with it if it were just the color of the product, but when it&#x27;s like this the stuff doesn&#x27;t work right, and it&#x27;s just plain nasty to use. I suspect the few negative reviews of this product are a result of getting a defective bottle. It&#x27;s really that bad when you get a bad bottle. I hope this stops happening sometime, because I would like to be able to go back to using Giovanni products with confidence, but until then I&#x27;m done with the brand.</li>
    <li> This is a very moisturizing conditioner and my hair is a type 3c/4a/4b and is unfortunately extremely picky and it loves it! And there are also natural ingredients inside and it smells great! I would totally recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Everything it said! very light, smells good and make de-tangling a breeze, may need to pick up a few more bottles cause my entire family loves it!</li>
    <li> Love this for my fine relaxed hair very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this leave-in. I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair and I can&#x27;t get over how great this makes my hair feel. It leaves my hair soft, smooth, and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner based on a lot of YouTuber with natural hair mentioning it. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the conditioner and the texture of my hair once I used it. It has become a staple of my hair care regiment. I only wish that i could find a bigger container.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have bi-racial curly hair and this is a good staple item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural 4b/c and I love for this product! Works immaculately on my coarse hair!</li>
    <li> this product like my  oily  with  a white  residue.i was not  happy with  it&#x27;s  result my  hair  became  tangled when my  hair is never tangled.</li>
    <li> My natural hair is defined as 4a which consists of very tight, pen-sized coils. This product is the only one Ive been able to use that allows my coils to remain soft after application. I only use a nickel size amount and my hair feels soft and conditioned all day. It&#x27;s definitely weightless with no drips and ugly white residue. I highly recommend this product to women with 4a hair types who are new to the natural hair. I also recommend the Giovanni Smooth As Silk Deeper Moisture Conditioner. I use it when I cowash and it&#x27;s great for that on my hair type.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! Like my hair is 99 percent softer and it&#x27;s no frizz and just amazing I will be purchasing some every couple months</li>
    <li> I love this leave in conditioner it also is a natural product. It does not leave my hair sticky at all no matter how much of it use. I use a lot of their products and I&#x27;ve been relatively happy. I even use it to detangle my hair in the shower. If I use a denman brush I makes my curls look awesome. I like that it is not greasy or heavy. I still will use a natural oil to seal my ends. It has a nice light scent. I use it for twist, roller sets, and wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The product ingredients has changed and Alcohol is a leading ingredient.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was happening to my hair, I used this all the time, my hair looked great.  At some point, evidentally long enough to see the effects of the change.  Didn&#x27;t know I had to check the ingredients everytime I recieved a new shipment!  My hair was back to breaking off again.  Going back to Mixed Chicks, at least they can leave the ingredients alone.  I cancelled my auto delivery today upon my discovery and disappointment.  This company had a great product till they changed it.  Won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
    <li> My hair type is 4c and very dry. Using this product was eliminated the massive amounts of shedding and breakage so I can retain my length. Can&#x27;t ask anymore than that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this leave-in conditioner for ~6 yrs or so and loved it.  They have changed the formulation with aloe as a new main ingredient.  The new formulation is heavier and stickier in your hands.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well, often leaves my hair frizzy.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as good either.  I was bummed, sent giovanni an email and haven&#x27;t heard back. Now whenever I see the leav-in cond. in a store I look to see if I can find an old bottle with the original formulation.  Haven&#x27;t had any luck finding any but then I came across Giovanni vitapro fusion, protective moisture, leave-in hair treatment.  It comes in a smaller cylindrical bottle and is a spray on liquid.  I looked at the ingredients and they were identical to the new direct leave in conditioner minus the aloe.  When I got home I compared to the ingred on an old bottle of leave in conditioner and it is the same except no panthenol.  So it&#x27;s different but it does give you the soft texture that the old conditioner did but doesn&#x27;t help with frizz and it seems you have to use more.  Perhaps the two used in combination will give me what I&#x27;m looking for.  I miss the old stuff.  So, I&#x27;m looking for something new but experimenting with what I&#x27;ve got.</li>
    <li> My hair is a lot healthier since I&#x27;ve started using this product. The cons are:     (1)when I curl my hair, it does not hold very long despite using hairspray     (2)I have to wash my hair everyday otherwise my hair would become flat and oily.   **For healthier hair, daily washing is not recommended**    I&#x27;m Asian with fine unprocessed hair.</li>
    <li> love the product! leaves your hair feeling soft and conditioned.</li>
    <li> Dont buy from them they will sell you the wrong shampoo and then not give you a refund even though there store page says they do!!!! Order from CosmeticMall or somewhere else instead!!!!</li>
    <li> i have natural hair and this leave in helps to keep my hair moisturized and holds my curl when i do twist out styles. i love it.</li>
    <li> this product gets a well deserved 4 stars from me. It delivers what it promises, it is weightless, which is great for natural kinky hair. It gives hair that moisture splurge in the drier winter climate in South Africa. I only recently bought this product, so it is still new to my hair but my hair is enjoying it at the moment. The leave in has a subtle smell, which is not bad but it is not great either. I recommend this product to dry hair that needs a face lift.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s very helpful for me. It lasts a long time, so it&#x27;s not as expensive as it seems. Since I swim a lot in chlorinated water, this leave-in conditioner is just right for me. The travel size is good too.</li>
    <li> Curly hair and this is my go-to.</li>
    <li> I go through a bottle of leave in per month and I love this stuff</li>
    <li> Now I know that this isn&#x27;t an all natural product but after hearing everyone say how well it works on natural hair I decided to try it.  I have very dry, coarse 4c natural hair and I&#x27;m in the stage of trying different products I think this will be  a staple of mine.  The first time I used it I was a little heavy handed with the product but it is weightless so my hair didn&#x27;t feel heavy or saturated but OMG did it feel soft.  I had tried Carols Daughter leave ins and they made my hair feel brittle and dry and I&#x27;ve tried Shea Butter line through Target (no results) but this makes my hair feels so soft and makes it manageable which is a shock to me.  So my routine for those who are interested: I shampoo or co-wash my hair, then I apply EVOO throughout and section and apply the Giovanni Direct Leave In as I detangle (this seems to work best for me since my hair is so thick).  I use a wide tooth detangling comb and my new love (Tangle Teezer - LOVE, LOVE, LOVE It) after detangle I twist that area and continue throughout. Usually I let it air dry or go right into styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I love the product and i&#x27;m glad I brought the 3 pack from Amazon</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in conditioner, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and I refuse to give it up. I bought the 3 pack, cant beat the price. It leave my hair silky, shiny and manageable. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner. It was recommended for me by a friend who had a daughter with very thick and long (black) hair. I have the same thickness and texture of hair and need a creamy leave-in conditioner to comb through my wet hair before I twist it. This fit that bill but, even for my hair, I found it a bit heavy, and I found that it did not go as far a the Abba leave in that I&#x27;ve settled in to.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is so soft and weightless and leaves my hair feeling light, full and very easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair so soft and I have 4c type hair. It has great slip so I am able to detangle my hair without pulling my hair. Just a little goes a long way. I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This was one of the first leave-in conditioners I used after going natural. I&#x27;d put this on my hair after conditioner washes, and it left my hair with a good amount of moisture, but little slip. I have to say, when I used Kinky Curly&#x27;s Knot Today, however, my opinion of Giovanni changed slightly, since Knot Today gives me ample moisture and slip for my 4a/4b hair.    Giovanni does perform for the price, and it&#x27;s advantage is that it&#x27;s cheaper (being half the price of Knot Today&#x27;s $11). It&#x27;s still good, but in my opinion, and for my hair, Knot Today is better. But, everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so try it and decide for yourselves.</li>
    <li> This works wonders for my 4a african american textured hair! I use it as the Leave-in part of the L.O.C. method. It leaves my hair so soft and moisturized! Don&#x27;t forget to follow-up wit oil!</li>
    <li> I bought this after having the smooth as silk conditioner work so well on my hair. this product is stellar. It has a thicker consistency than the smooth as silk conditioner put goes on smooth. After styling with a bit of Shea Moisture cream and a little bit of aloe vera gel, my curls were smooth and well defined. Yes.</li>
    <li> My favorite leave-in conditioner for my 4B hair. This is a must have for me. This helps my hair to remain moisturized all day in this hot and humid Florida weather. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair soft and silky whether it&#x27;s wet or dry!  I cannot be without this leave-in I love it he natural ingredients, my hair drinks this up!</li>
    <li> Horrible conditioner. It leaves a yucky white residue</li>
    <li> Heard something good about this leave in so I decided to try it since I was going natural and I haven&#x27;t regret it. It&#x27;s definitely weightless but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using much of it while your is still wet. I love using this conditioner while styling because of the moisture. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair line....I love all there products.</li>
    <li> I put this on the ends of my hair when my hair is still damp from the shower. It moisturizes my naturally dry ends very well and makes my hair feel super soft after it dries. It&#x27;s hard for me to find a good conditioner for the ends of my hair. I don&#x27;t put it on the roots because it makes my hair look greasy early in the day. I don&#x27;t dye, blow dry, or straighten my hair so i can&#x27;t say anything about that.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product, however I just wish it came in a much larger size. I use it several times a week and although three came with my order, a larger size would work much better for me.</li>
    <li> This leave in is awesome!!  A little goes a long way with this product.  I use it as a moisturizer then I seal with either; coconut, olive, or grape seed oil.  I&#x27;ve tried a few organic moisturizing creams but none compare to this.  If you have normal hair that isn&#x27;t chronically dry this leave in will give your hair exactly what it needs.  Ordering 5 bottles if not in stores next month.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this leave in weightless conditioner!  It is easy to use and now I don&#x27;t have to spend extra time in the shower rinsing my long hair!</li>
    <li> I have tried several other leave in conditioners but keep returning to Giovanni. My hair is soft and manageable without being weighed down or greasy. If you follow the &#x27;curly girl&#x27; method of not using silicone products this one fits the bill! And this product won&#x27;t break the bank either.</li>
    <li> I love love love this leave in condish. I will never use anything else. Its great for detangling and moisturizing my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with natural type 4a hair. I love the regular deeper moisture conditioner but the leave-in was a little too light. It&#x27;s ok, so I use it occasionally if I&#x27;ve co-washed (i.e. haven&#x27;t shampooed in a while) and my hair doesn&#x27;t need something toooo heavy. Otherwise, Keracare naturals leave-in is superior.</li>
    <li> I recently went natural about 6 months ago and my hair is 4c type. I needed a conditioner that was going to actually do what it says.. Condition and leave my hair feeling soft and manageable. This was a great buy , 3 came in a pack I don&#x27;t know why buy I&#x27;ll take it.GREAT PRODUCT. TRY IT :-)</li>
    <li> I feel this is a great leave in conditioner.  Hair feels really silky and soft.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair almost down to my waist. It is difficult to brush when wet due to millions of tangles and so I always use some sort of detangler. Normally, I use some sort of spray-in detangler but when looking for something new, I came across this and bought it after seeing all the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does help a little bit with detangling but not as much as I&#x27;m used to unless I put in a ton. But then if I put in a ton, it leaves my hair almost like straw and heavy so that my curls are hardly even there. It&#x27;s really gross. So I use a tiny amount and struggle at times to brush it out which makes me frustrated because why else am I using this product?</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I have a twa that&#x27;s dyed blonde and I&#x27;ve been looking for this product because of the reviews on youtube. Couldn&#x27;t find it at target, so I ordered it from Amazon.com. I use this leave-in conditioner to curl my hair. This is my first time using it and I can honestly say, \\&quot;THIS STUFF IS AMAZING\\&quot;!!! It leaves my hair super-dupa soft and has absolutely NO greasy feel after it dries. I&#x27;ve used other leave-ins and they DON&#x27;T compare to the quality and feel of this leave-in. To get 3 (8.5oz) bottles for this price is incredible. I DEFINITELY WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN WHEN MY 3 BOTTLES RUN OUT!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT. (In a spray bottle, mix 1/4th vegetable glycerine, a tablespoon of sweet almond oil, fill the rest of the bottle with water. This is a great leave-in conditioner for my hair as well. Then I apply the Giovanni Leave-in Conditioner. My hair is without a doubt super soft.</li>
    <li> UPDATE (10/2014):  THE 4B HAIR IS STILL BOUNCY &amp; SOFT! I have not changed my leave-in conditioner in 3 years because this one still does the job incredibly well. I&#x27;ve added Giovanni&#x27;s Smooth As Silk Deep Moisture Conditioner to the regimen and made other adjustments to increase effectiveness:    - Slather hair with extra-virgin coconut oil (cold expeller-pressed) and let it soak in while you handle other business (i.e. a quick &amp; dirty pre-poo)  - Wash scalp with Shea Naturals Thickening Shampoo (or whatever brand/formulation applies to you) or not (meaning, go straight to deep conditioning). Rinse with cool water, but at the end switch to warm/very warm water.  - Use Giovanni&#x27;s Deep Conditioner. Let soak in under plastic cap under a low-heat dryer (or not) for half hour to an hour.  - Rinse out completely with cool water, make that quick switch to warm/very warm water, don&#x27;t shake or wring dry and add the Giovanni Leave-In Conditioner. Let the water and product absorb into hair for 15-20 minutes.  - Slather hair again with extra-virgin coconut oil, paying special attention to ends. This step seals in the moisture.  - Then, use whatever holding/styling products (in my case, large section-by-section Jane Carter Wrap &amp; Roll Foam and Andalou Naturals Medium Hold Sunflower Gel). I still use Kiss My Face Upper Management Gel [Medium hold] sometimes, particularly for slickbacks. Don&#x27;t forget to trim those ends with BARBER scissors!    NOTE: I usually do some type of wet set, not a wash n&#x27; go. I think the procedure still applies though to a wash n&#x27; go.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I have medium-long 4B hair (fine, curly). I was looking for a leave-in that would detangle, but with mostly natural ingredients. Thanks to a previous, similar reviewer, I purchased this leave-in at a SuperTarget.    Bottom line: It did what other conditioning products did not.    I smooth on 2 quarter size (or less) dollops of thisin my freshly washed (and sometimes conditioned) hair. I wait 10 minutes. Then, I can put a sturdy wide tooth comb through my hair with minimal resistance. The hair loss is dramatically less. I can do a wet set of my hair more quickly (in combo with Kiss My Face Upper Management Gel [Medium hold]  and Jane Carter Wrap &amp; Roll Foam over it). Also, my hair looks and feels incredibly soft as well as healthy when the style is dried. There&#x27;s no residue, and most importantly, my curls aren&#x27;t weighed down. It&#x27;s bouncy time!    I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year. I don&#x27;t anticipate switching to anything else anytime soon.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything on my hair--it feels like my hair is naturally healthy, soft, and smooth.  I have dyed and highlighted my hair over half a dozen times in the past year, so needless to say it can be dry, brittle and damaged. After using this, it feels like I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair.  I can run my fingers through easily, which is not the case with any other conditioners or leave-ins I&#x27;ve used.  I use it sparingly, mixing a tiny amount of conditioner with a splash of water in my hands before applying it to my hair.</li>
    <li> A very good leave-in.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> For a leave-in conditioner it&#x27;s just okay. I leaves too many flakes personally for me. I have one more bottle because I brought in bulk...Won&#x27;t do that again. I know some of you like it and by all means use what works, but as a natural this didn&#x27;t work for me..</li>
    <li> I have long thick curly hair that is often dry and frizzy.  I live in the south where it is humid.  This product is a great natural solution to tame frizzies and keep my hair under control.  I have been happy with all of the Giovanni products.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, while still providing moisture and control.  Great to throw in my beach bag and put in my hair after swimming.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair, 3C, and this product works great. It leaves my hair super soft and aides in defining my curls. This is now one of my staple products.</li>
    <li> I have blond wavy hair and I can&#x27;t live without this product. Used someone else&#x27;s once and been using it for years since. A little goes a long way, I let it air dry and wash every 2 or 3 days and my hair still looks great. Just simple, healthy, natural hair.</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in conditioner.  It makes my hair so silky and healthy. It is one of the best leave-in conditioners in the market.</li>
    <li> Nice leave in conditioner but it does seem to dry my hair out personally. Wish it held on and kept the hair more moisturized. But overall great product.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite product for Curly hair! I use about a half dollar amount for my whole head and it keeps the frizz away and keeps your curls looking absolutely perfect. This product came the next day of ordering perfectly packaged and ready to use. Thanks for a smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> I have very thick coarse hair that loves to suck up any conditioner I put into it.  I needed something that would condition my hair but not leave it feeling dry.  I was lead to this one through a YouTube video about hair maintenance.  I am so happy I tried it.  I now use the whole line!  My hair feels so smooth when it is done and my hands are even soft!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy coat even though it goes on white.  The pack of 3 has lasted me awhile and I will be ordering my next round here shortly.</li>
    <li> My Walmart is horrible at keeping this in stock. Thanks goodness for Amazon because this is THE BEST leave-in conditioner out there for natural, curly, and textured hair (4a-4c). I use this mostly as a base for my leave-in moisturizer and twists.</li>
    <li> This product meets my earth friendly body friendly criteria. It works just great and I use it on a daily basis. I even use it as a styling product at times when my hair is short. I would much prefer fragrance free but this fragrances light.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner in Kimmay Tube leave-in recipe mix, and my hair loves it. I&lt;br /&gt; never tried Giovanni before hearing about the recipe and now I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I got a great deal on Amazon (I got 4 in a deal) so I could not resist buying it!&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. The ingredients are great. However, this made my hair feel a bit like straw. It didn&#x27;t really cut down on the frizz factor. It managed to define my curls a bit, I guess. I didn&#x27;t like the consistency of it when I put it into my hands. Hair type: Wavy/Curly/Frizzy long hair, thin, lacking volume Race:Indian</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great for my thick, dry hair. I use a vey small quantity each time but it goes a long way and my hair feels great. The conditioner is also very light &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my naturally curly and super thick hair. Has a wonderful, light scent. No sticky residue, didn&#x27;t leave my hair &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;... actually made my hair easy to untangle with my fingers and the resulting curls were very defined. Good price too!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for many years.  I use with after shampooing with my favorite Giovanni shampoo.  It lasts until the next shampoo.  All I have to do is spritz my hair with a little water every morning before picking it out, and it is as soft and managable as it was when I first shampoo.  A light, fine mist of water is all that is necessary. You don&#x27;t have to have a heavy oily product, what your hair needs is water.  Get that spritzer and go to it!</li>
    <li> I got this because my sister said it did wonders for her hair. She has just about the same course hair type as me. For me, it&#x27;s like any other product I used: poor. I can find something half the price. This item also sat on my hair and when my hair dried, I saw white residue.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this Leave-In very much. I have curly-kinky hair and when I apply this conditioner it leaves my hair (strands) with a white coating, but when it dries it is absolutely wonderfully. I have this Product 4 stars because I deducted one star for the fragrance/scent/smell-I do not like the smell. I LOVE the fact that it is natural and safe to use and that it is a Leave-In. The only additional thing I add to my hair after this Leave-In is &#x27;Coconut Oil&#x27;...the combination works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Received very quickly, this is my 2nd time ordering this 3pk, love using it on my Indian curly or any curly/deep wave hair, it makes my curls pop without weighing it down</li>
    <li> Great leave in conditioner! Use it daily and this is my second time getting the 3-pack. Made my hair super soft, and I use it as a detangler because my hair is long!</li>
    <li> This is my go to leave-in conditioner. It has good slip for detangling and works so good on my hair.  I do however, add a small amount of olive oil to all of my conditioners, and its been working great for me.  I still seal with a little argan oil and am good to go.  I&#x27;ve been using Giovanni for over two years and recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality leave-in.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Deva Curl gel and then defuse my hair and my curls come out beautiful and hydrated. It will usually last for about 3 days if i put it up in a loose bun before I sleep.</li>
    <li> outstanding product moisturizes very well and you only need a quarter size amount very impressed! i definitely recommend for all hair types!</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner ever, it detangles and strengthens! It is a staple in my healthy hair journey, I use it for my hair which is extremely thick and coarse, and my kids hair which have curly mixed hair, it works wonders on all 3 of our hair types! I use this in combination with argan oil on our hair daily. I recommend this conditioner to everybody.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awkward and sticky on my hair instead of making it smooth and absorbing in nicely.</li>
    <li> Have ordred this product many time, and it is good as always :)</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE This stuff!!!!! I am natural and I love this for after a washing or co-washing. It helps me to de-tangle the hair but it also is a great base for my moisture regimen</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Giovanni products, but I will not buy this one again. It has an unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I big chopped.  On Nov 21, 2013. I tried several other leave in conditioners. Nothing even comes close to Giovanni. It is light and non greasy. I&#x27;m in love and will definitely purchase again. 3 8oz bottles for $20. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> The seller sent these very fast. After using it I can say that I like the way it makes my hair feel. I only use a quarter size in the evenings before going to bed so that my hair is softer in the morning.</li>
    <li> I like this leave-In conditioner because it really helps with manageability of my hair.  I have very thick hair which can be difficult to comb through but once I put this conditioner in it&#x27;s easy going from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling moisturized for a long time and leaves it feeling a little dry.  However, that&#x27;s nothing that a little olive oil mixed in water can&#x27;t cure.</li>
    <li> Love this! Will order again in future!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this is my go to leave in conditioner. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> too heavy for me not my favorite</li>
    <li> I saw another comment that mentioned this problem. The pack of three of these products seem like they&#x27;re going bad, like they&#x27;ve been on the shelf forever. The smell is a little different than the regular product and the consistency even seems different. I had originally purchased one and I loved it, so I decided to stock up but the second time around these just were so different.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave-in.  So good, in fact that I&#x27;ve had it on Subscribe and Save for well over a year.</li>
    <li> My natural hair loves this stuff. Best twist-out results I&#x27;ve ever had! Would recommend to anyone looking for an effective, inexpensive leaveinconditioner</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my hair so soft &amp; silky &amp; gives my 3c curly hair type so much body &amp; bounce &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave that white messy residue buildup.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that it may be too greasy for my fine wavy hair, making it flat. Instead it maintains my hair full and bouncy, and no frizz. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these from amazon and used it the same day it came. I didn&#x27;t even need a comb to detangle my hair. The next day  I bought a 3 pack. That should tell you how much I love it. This is my first choice in conditioner for my natural, unprocessed hair. It also mixes well with other products.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an affordable leave in conditioner for my very curly, frizzy hair.  This product is the best I have found and have been using it for about a year.  When I found out I could get it at Amazon for a better price than the health food store, I was very happy.  It has natural ingredients, blends well in wet hair and does not weigh down your hair or leave it gummy.  It is very cost effective because you do not need much to be effective.</li>
    <li> White as the driven snow, works well but being the first leave in conditioner I tried with my long curls I used way too much. Still trying to find that sweet spot. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others and definitely consider purchasing from this source again.</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as I had expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I love this leave in conditioner and it is very convenient to have it arrive at my door step!!  I am an African American woman who sports natural hair and this product is great for natural hair.  This is one of the items that I subscribe to.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m African American and have 4c type hair,  this softens it and helps with getting the knots out when paired with another product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic product that is all natural. I combine it with a little cocount oil on my hair when it is about 70% dry and a little shea butter on the ends then braid it up. When I take out the braids the next day, the bounce and shine on my hair is incredible. You only have to use a little bit for great results :)</li>
    <li> I find that this product actually makes my hair drier when I use it. I&#x27;ve heard such great things about this product but for me, it leaves my hair too dry &amp; since I bought the three pack thinking that I would love this product, I add it to water in a spray bottle &amp; spritz my hair with it in conjunction with other hydrating products &amp; I find that this works better for my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner along with the deep moisturizing conditioner have really attributed to a wonderful change in texture for my natural hair. It makes my hair smooth and very moist. It is not easy finding a product that is truly moisturizing, not oily but actually moisturizing without leaving a sticky gummy feeling behind. I see a very notable difference in my natural styles. I am getting tons of compliments. This conditioner will be a permanent part of weekly regimen. I am concerned about some of the reviews about the bad bottles of conditioner. I will keep my eye out for yellowing conditioner as well as the smell. I am new to using these products and so far am extremly happy. I will update if i begin to have problems. Right now this a must have for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated - I would probably give this product 3 or 4 stars now. I now find it a bit drying on my hair and probably will not use again. Not sure why the change...</li>
    <li> I have been using Giovanni Leave-In Weightless Conditioner for two years now and it is the finest product of it&#x27;s type that I have ever tried. I am a guy with a full head of medium weight wavy hair who wants just a bit of moisture and control. With wet hands, I can distribute a tiny dab of Giovanni evenly through my hair (wet or dry), making just one 8.5 oz, bottle last for months. Other no-rinse products I have used seem to either create build up over time or cause chemical damage if left in all day. And unlike many styling products, Giovanni Weightless has no waxy or oily properties to cause a stiff feel or greasy look. My hair always looks and feels completely natural after use. Just received my second 3 pack meaning that I am now starting my fourth bottle and third year with complete satisfaction so far.</li>
    <li> Best product I hve found to work on my natural (African American) hair  I found using lil more thm recommended on my hair has worked for  me</li>
    <li> LOVE Giovanni products! They don&#x27;t contain any of &amp;#34;the bad stuff&amp;#34;, for a reasonable price. This leave-in conditioner is great! Hydrates my super-dry hair removing the frizz, and making it soft without making it greasy. You can tell it really nourishes the hair. It is now one of my must-haves.</li>
    <li> It has been hard for me to find a leave in conditioner that works for my curly hair. This particular brand works well. I use it in combination with coconut oil. And for the price, its a good deal.</li>
    <li> No problem here, very happy with my order.</li>
    <li> This leavin is great. Need bigger size</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner as a natural who only co wash this is greatand I love the smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and my hair is longer and stronger than ever, I wouldn&#x27;t change conditioners for the world!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Direct leave-in&amp;#34; is a very good idea,and I usually use it when I get up in the morning without having a shower.</li>
    <li> I love love love this conditioner my hair feels amazing</li>
    <li> The Giovanni products are perfect for my natural curly styles.  Glad I discvoered these products.  I live in the south and this particular brand is not so popular.</li>
    <li> Makes my curls pop. It&#x27;s light on my fine hair.  Hair feels soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This leave-in is just what I was looking for to use on my naturally curly-coily hair.  It is great for detangling and moisturizes without leaving build-up.  Great for wash and go days!</li>
    <li> Decent product but the moisture level just isn&#x27;t there. I have kinky hair and it drinks up moisture. It smells ok. Works well on natural loose wavy hair. Use it everyday on my daughter hair. No build up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few months ago and love the results. I put it in a spray bottle with water and use it as a leave in when I wear a wash and go. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> It work wonderful for my natural hair great products</li>
    <li> I have used other Giovanni products which I LOVE LOVE LOVE, but this product makes my hair feel like straw. IT was money wasted. So now, I just use the Frizz be gone by giovanni which works like a miracle.</li>
    <li> I find this a bit too light to add moisture to my thick hair but its a nice product in general because it contains no harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I used this every day and I love it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Gives me lots of moisture. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> What a great product! I love how my hair feels after using this leave in conditioner. A little goes a long way! The price was quite cheap for the quality of product! Will be buying more of this item!!</li>
    <li> WOW! This is just wonderful stuff. Left my hair tangle-free and manageable. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I am growing out my natural hair and a lot of naturalistas rave about this product. It is to heavy for my hair to use as a leave-in product, so I just mix it up with my deep conditioner and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> i have thick kinky natural hair, this conditioner makes detangling SOOO much easier &amp; quicker! this stuff literally cuts time it takes to do my hair in half. it also makes my hair feel soft. i bought 3 bottles of it for a reason, this product is essential to my hair regime. natural girls should really try it. however it doesnt smell great, but i dont care about that.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good timing. I would recommend to a friend. the conditioner is lite. my hair felt soft . the product is natural. great price. i will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use this Leave-In Conditioner daily.  It keeps my curls well moisturized without being greasy.  It takes some time for the white color to go away sometimes.</li>
    <li> I have almost waist length mainly 4b natural hair which I have lovingly nurtured for the last 5 years. Up until a couple of weeks ago I had been using Giovanni Direct Leave-in-Conditioner for about 4 years with fantastic results.  My hair used to be extremely easy to manage after applying the leave in conditioner and my hair was in very good condition. However over the last couple of weeks I noticed that my hair was becoming brittle, dry and prone to tangling even though my hair care routine had not changed, (water, shea butter/natural oils and protective styling).  This resulted in me having to spend hours gently detangling matted hair. I decided to investigate; I washed my hair applied the leave in conditioner, and plaited my hair in four. I then let my hair air dry. A few hours later my hair was a dry, brittle, mess impossible to part without spritzing it with lots of water and jojoba oil. I have spent 6 hours detangling my hair this evening (my second detangling session of the day). My hair has returned to a manageable state, but only after applying another company&#x27;s leave in conditioner (Mixed Chicks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last two weeks I have lost a lot of hair through the detangling process and am not happy at all. I&#x27;m not sure what has been done to this product but I am sure that the 6 Giovanni conditioners that I have in my bathroom will all be thrown in the bin. I will not be using Giovanni products again.</li>
    <li> It was a good leave-in Conditioner when I going natural.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner it is so lightweight. It does not weigh my hair down but keeps it moisturized. For the price its a great buy!</li>
    <li> I have really thick, curly hair (type 3c). This stuff works wonders as a leave in. I put other products on top of this for added curl definition, but a little goes a long way. These bottles are very small, though, and I prefer to buy this product in the larger sized bottles. Amazon, unfortunately, does not offer the same size/price as offered from massagewarehouse.com or from TJ Maxx /Marshalls where I buy bulk quantities.</li>
    <li> I use it after swimming. It smells like spit. Initially my hair is soft after using it, but when I lie down and wake up the next morning, my hair feels like it has some type of powdery residue on it and it&#x27;s very dry appearing (although you can&#x27;t actually see any flakes). I continue to use it because I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet, and so far it has prevented me from getting the damaged swimmer&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I have read and heard some great comments about this product. I have been using this product faithfully and my hair feels wonderful. I have officially found a great leave in conditioner for my hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEE ITTTT! So great for natural hair!</li>
    <li> I heard so many good things about this leave-in so I had to try it. I like how it makes my hair feel and I think it will be an excellent summer styler for wash and gos, or if you want a really light leave-in for fluffier styles.  My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t plat nice with my SheaMoisture products.  It can leave white flakes in the scalp region, not a good look.  But in the summer I&#x27;ll use it for WnGs.</li>
    <li> Leaves a great hold for everyday use and it&#x27;s 100% organic.</li>
    <li> This used to be a great leave in but they changed the formula if its not broke plz don;t try to fix it. the old formula had leaves on the bottle and left my hair soft and light. This one just weighs my hair down and i had to add water and coconut oil to it to fix it a little bit,but it still left a residue on my hair and was still a little hard.im going to have to find a different leave in.</li>
    <li> This is a great light weight leave-in conditioner. When you first apply it, it will appear white, but don&#x27;t be alarmed, as long as you apply it to wet hair it will dry and the color will completely disappear. You will love how well it works in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years well now. I have natural afro textured hair. It is very moisturizing. I like the price of this 3 pack as well. Good buy.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have used on my natural 4C hair.  It helps with detangling and there is no white build up on my hair.  I can use daily without any problems.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> this stuff was just terrible for me. it left my hair feeling tacky and sticky and a greased up. just no. i tried using it after shower and after blow dry but the results were always the same. my hair is medium thick and wavy.</li>
    <li> I am the new number one fan of Giovanni Direct Leave In Conditioner.  I love all of Giovanni&#x27;s products but I must say, everything I have heard about this product (positive) has been nothing but the truth!  Great slip, conditions my scalp very well and absolutely gives my natural hair what it needs------ MOISTURE!  I love this product. I brought the package of three.</li>
    <li> Work really well. Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Used on my daughter&#x27;s 4a hair last night and it feels like straw today!!  Must be the alcohol - returning for sure!</li>
    <li> This conditioner will have you at &#x27;weightless moisture&amp;#34;. I love it. I started using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair first, then I fell in love with it. It will moisturize the hair and give it strength. It will look white when you first apply it, then it will melt like the snow.</li>
    <li> I tried this at my sister&#x27;s house and it works great for combing through my extremely tight kinky hair. I ordered more as soon as I returned home for myself. Its awesome.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to try this and am soooo glad I did. I used this to moisturize my hair for a twist-out and the results are remarkable. Very defined cork screw pattern that I have not been able to achieve with other products.</li>
    <li> I use this product and some coconut oil when doing two strand twists.  My hair comes out nice and soft.  No other product is needed and you cannot beat the prices.</li>
    <li> A staple product for my naturally curly hair. I put a teaspoon full in my hair when it is wet along with the Giovanni sunset lotion and scrunch it which turns into a foamy mousse texture. I let it naturally dry for a bit then diffuse. Perfect curls every time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and have only used it once or twice. I&#x27;m just not keen on the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing. It&#x27;s as if it still needs to be mixed with some type of oil...I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. But, people do rave about it...I just didn&#x27;t have that experience.</li>
    <li> Great on my natural hair.....brings out my wave pattern.</li>
    <li> Great product for mixed hair and natural African American hair.  Also great for any naturally curly hair</li>
    <li> My ultimate favvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvorite leave in!!</li>
    <li> This product came about a week ago and it came as advertised. Nice packaging, and very lovely smells. :) You DO get three bottles, so they aren&#x27;t lying when they say &#x27;pack of 3&#x27;. I keep hearing so much about Giovanni, so I decided to test it out myself and purchase it. The only downside is, if you don&#x27;t live in the States, it&#x27;s a little harder to purchase this since apparently this item can only be sold within the States. So luckily for me, I was able to find a way to get it shipped to my country. Giovanni is mostly natural products too, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about all these harsh chemicals and bad odors. The scent is nice, very mild.</li>
    <li> That sad face is exactly how i feel when using this as a leave in on my 4c hair.... The hype is unwarranted in my humble opinion. When used alone it leaves my hair feel dry and crunchy. Yuck, No complaints on the seller , the price is for 3 smaller bottles but nonetheless the product is definitely not on my repurchase list</li>
    <li> Not great for us naturally curly girls.  It works fine if I blow dry my hair &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34;.  I am Caucasian with extremely curly coarse hair.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is THE BOMB!!!!!  I use it to do my 2-strand twists.  Keeps my hair VERY moisturised so I only take them down at the end of the week to moisturise again and pin them back up.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite leave in conditioner. I like the smell, the thickness, and how it makes my hair feel. It plays nicely with other products and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my fine 3c/4a hair.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! It works great</li>
    <li> If you have dry hair, I recommend combining this with a more moisturizing leave-in, such as jane carter&#x27;s or shea moisture&#x27;s leave-ins. This is good for detangling, and i love the fact that it stays wet/moist for a while. however, my edges and nape were a bit dry and harder to comb.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair that tangles badly. I thought this was a regular conditioner (I didn&#x27;t read the description very well) and couldn&#x27;t firgure out why it wasn&#x27;t helping. My bad! Once I realized it was a &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; conditioner, I tried it. It honestly didn&#x27;t work well for me. I do love that It is enriched with certified organic botanicals, has no animal by-products and it&#x27;s cruelty free. It wasn&#x27;t for me but I still love these products from Giovanni!</li>
    <li> Perfect condition, Brand New.  No leaks during shipping.  3 bottles sealed together in plastic to ensure safe shipping.  This product is good, especially as a finishing product, a little goes a long way.  I might not purchase again because it really is weightless.  It is called weightless Direct Leave-In conditioner, meaning it will not weigh the hair down and that is absolutely true.  Depending on the hair style, like normally when I do a twist-out I like to use a conditioner with some weight to it in setting up the twists, but when I take it down this is a good product to use during that stage.  Since I use this sparingly in the final styling stages, it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love how it does not dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product for my daughter, she loves it.</li>
    <li> My hair gets dry easily, so this is really good for softening up a few days after washing, so that I can style it easily. Be careful not to use too much, because it can flake when it dries. Ive never had a problem when I use a small amount.</li>
    <li> OMG! Giovanni Direct Leave-In Conditioner, Weightless Moisture is the best!  I heard nothing but great reviews about this product and I was not disappointed when I finally tried it - in fact, I was amazingly surprised.  One does not have to use a lot of this product - about a quarter-size will give you full coverage. It makes your hair feel so wonderful and does not weigh it down. It is worth the money!!</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel great  it does not have that heavey sticky feal to it that most leave in have. Makes for great transitioning leave in for black hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used. I bought it for my 5 year old daughter for something to use after her baths. Her hair gets really tangled and none of the kids conditioners ever work. This stuff is awesome! I now use it for myself and my son too!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, it completely detangles her hair and makes it shiny and smooth. I love that Giovanni uses natural ingredients. I have since started using several other Giovanni products and I really love them all!</li>
    <li> This products is not for me,really did not like it,but might be fine for others&lt;br /&gt;everyone is different,I like things that smell good,</li>
    <li> Not bad if you need something little but if your hair is more on the dry side you may need something heavier.</li>
    <li> This left my daughter&#x27;s hair dry, bulked up, and frizzy. I experimented with different amounts, using both less and more than my initial application, but it didn&#x27;t work for her at all. She has extremely curly hair, and a lot of it. I was not impressed and tossed the rest of the bottle. I&#x27;ve used rinse-out conditioners on her that were more moisturizing!</li>
    <li> You can buy this same sized product at vitacost.com for $4.87. Why are you paing more for the same item?</li>
    <li> Giovanni&#x27;s haircare products are wonderful. Natural and benefits the hair. If it says it is what is, then that&#x27;s what you get from their products</li>
    <li> Lighter than air and does a great job.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on another review and I think it was a good value for the money and a good product as well. I will say that product is weightless and NOT greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> My go-to conditioner. Never fails. I am obsessed with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, it is the boom.</li>
    <li> I bought this leave in because it is the MHM approved hair product list. I dilute it with water and use it as a leave in and it make my hair feel smooth and soft; my fingers glide easily through my cource natural curly/kinky hair after I apply this product. I was also very happy to find this deal at the time I did and I saved a lot of money on this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I never thought I needed a leave-in conditioner since I have very fine wavy hair, but I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year, and love it.  You only need a small amount (I use two squirts in my mid-back-length hair), which I apply by squishing into my hair.  It provides a nice barrier for your hair before you add in any styling products that may be drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s practically impossible to over-apply it; it really is so lightweight that even adding in too much won&#x27;t make your hair greasy-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also Curly-Girl-friendly for those following a no-silicone, no-sulfate routine.</li>
    <li> Great for coily hair!!! Wash n add small amount goes a long way... Make my hair feel amazingly soft. Curls stay shiny just a great quality product for coily hair. Try and I believe you will be pleased!!!</li>
    <li> so quick  results after using procduct once on natural hair. Works great with new hair care regiment for maintaining soft hair.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as promised.  It is not too \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;, does not weigh hair down, and leaves it shiny and managable. Smells good too.  Is great for my toddler girl&#x27;s hair which tends to tangle easily even with conditioner, this makes it easy to comb-through while wet.</li>
    <li> I am a mixed Native American/African American woman and I just bought this conditioner in preparation for my natural hair after removing extensions. I haven&#x27;t taken the extensions out yet, but they&#x27;re nearing the very end of their life, so when I recieved this shipment I thought, hey, I&#x27;ll jus try them on my (human hair) extentions and see if it helps at all. Let me tell you it helped a LOT. Not only does the hair feel softer, but it&#x27;s less frizzy, and it even brought back some of the natural curl that was there originally. Needless to say, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update this review after I get to try this stuff on my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/26/14&lt;br /&gt;Extensions have been removed me after a healthy haircut (I&#x27;m also transitioning from chemically relaxed to natural hair), I can officially say this stuff rocks. I&#x27;ve never had less trouble detangling my hair, and it helps my hair hold moisture lots better. I get great curl definition when combined with other curling agents. I&#x27;ve even put a bit of this in a spray bottle with some water to help with nighttime detangling. This is great. Get a bottle somewhere and at least try it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding hair products that make my hair look nice without making my face break out. This eliminates frizz without weighing down my curls.</li>
    <li> This is a really good leave in conditioner. I mix it with oils and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> It made my 4C hair easy to comb through !!</li>
    <li> I like it very much but you have to be careful with how much you put on.  Can make your hair sticky.</li>
    <li> I have been natural for over 3 years now and I have to admit that I absolutely love this leave in conditioner and my hair is in love with it as well. I have 4b/ 4c hair type and this makes my hair so much softer and tangle free. It does not weigh my hair down and the texture and dryness of my hair has significantly improved. I love Giovanmi Direct Leave-In-Conditioner, and I would definitely recommend this to someone else.</li>
    <li> Great product, absolutely love it, I do not use any other product on my hair as this has the nutrition and effects of a styling gel al in one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok so far.  Everyone on youtube raves about it so I wanted to see what all the hype was about.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. This is the best leave in conditioner that i have found my naturally curly hair (4a, 4b). I like how thick it is, it melts in my hair leaving it really soft and moisturized. I cannot complain, this is a staple product in my natural hair regimen.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner was recommended to us by a relative.  My and my daughter&#x27;s hair tangles easily.  This product is pretty good at coating the hair to ease detangling.  My only wish is that it were a bit thicker/creamier.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it every week on my coarse natural hair. It helps to hold hydration, gives a great shine and I love the fact that I can get it on auto ship. I hate running out of stuff. Ultimately it saves me money because I don&#x27;t pick up other things that are shiny objects in Whole Foods where I had been buying it. I hate when I hear people talk about &#x27;good&#x27; hair and &#x27;bad&#x27;  hair. But hopefully you will get what I am saying here, people tell me all the time &amp;#34;I wish I had good hair like yours&amp;#34;. I find it pretty funny because I know my hair texture...and kindly adjust their thinking; bottom line... it really does help make it manageable.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner came highly recommended and I now know why- it&#x27;s amazing! It really is lightweight but you can feel the moisture infuse into each strand and it saturates your hair well with only minimal combing or brushing needed to disperse it. This pack of 3 is going to last me a loooong time and is great value!</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I love this to the infinity power.  This is the best leave in conditioner ever.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product over and over again.  This product made my hair so soft and manageable. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am honestly am not sure if this product makes much difference in conditioning my hair. I put this in my hair along with oil. Sometimes my hair feels a little heaving from all of the products but this is a creamy leave in that is very light weight. Since my order came with 3 bottles I&#x27;ll keep using it but I&#x27;m not 100% that it&#x27;s making much difference. Putting oil in my hair, on the other hand, makes a clear difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years on my daughters&#x27; hair to keep it soft and tangle free. Since it doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed out it makes shower time a little quicker and easier.</li>
    <li> I have 3b/3c hair and this works great.  The products says light but it is very thick and my hair loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.. its weightless and smooth, it don&#x27;t leave a residue in your hair like some products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this product!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t paying enough attention to the ingredients when I bought this product.  I discovered that it contains the preservative Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate.  This is a non-natural ingredient and can cause skin and eye irritation.  See this link to Truth in skin care:    [...]</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is creamy and I was a little concerned that it would be too heavy for my fine hair, but it works wonderfully to condition and my hair has body!</li>
    <li> I like this leave in. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency; not too thick or too thin.  You can put it on wet or dry hair. This pairs well with the Dabur Vatika Coconut oil.  Since I use this just about every day, I searched and found a 1 liter bottle at Massagewarehouse.com for $12.99.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought...I assumed it was spray...doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell....and it seemed to make my hair kinda stiff</li>
    <li> A great product for natural hair!</li>
    <li> I have not used any other moisturizer with the same results as this one and it is definitely not the most expensive of the collection I have. Works especially well immediately following a co-wash or normal shampoo and condition!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this leave in.  I am a natural haired woman with children with curly to straight hair... I used this on everyone.  It makes hair soft and manageable without being greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> my hair is natural and Giovanni keep my hair health and easy to manage, if your hair is natural you must try there products</li>
    <li> I have dry damaged hair and for me this didn&#x27;t work any better than the store brand leave ins. It did absolutely nothing for my hair. I would recommend Neutrogenas New Triple Repair leave in or Not Your Mothers leave in. Both great leave in products!</li>
    <li> I love Giovanni&#x27;s leave-in! It&#x27;s actually weightless, and smells great! It makes my hair soft and easier to detangle!</li>
    <li> The product has a creamy texture that is not at all heavy on the hair. Good stuff! I use mine as a base for my leave in treatments.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and very good to detangle hair....try it, I am sure you will love it too...excellent for naturally curly hair</li>
    <li> My all time fav. It detangles my hair and makes it managable to comb. It also softens my hair. I recommend this product, especially if u have thick hair like me</li>
    <li> I have been completely natural for 7 months. My hair is 4b/4c. I have had the hardest time trying to figure something out. I have purchased many products with very little luck. Many of my co-workers told me about this product. I finally purchased it from Whole Foods. After my ends were cut I used it and loved it. I received so many compliments on my hair. \\&quot;And if I do say so myself\\&quot; I really did wear it well :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets an A+ for me. I wish I tried it sooner. I am also using the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie along with this. It is all working well together. I hope this journey is finally taking a better road.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a conditioner that is light weight, but does my natural 3c/4a hair good!  I purchased from the Vitamin Shoppe, but I will be purchasing from Amazon from now on.  This is a great deal!  I also will be trying other Giovanni products in the future.  This will be a staple in my hair regimen.  I like it better than Shea butter (shea butter was too sticky for me).  I did not enjoy mixing up the Shea butter and adding oils.  I&#x27;d rather use the organic products by Giovanni.  Also, I have very sensitive skin and so far no new acne!  I just wish the bottle size was bigger.  I wash my hair once a week, so this bottle will only last me a good month.</li>
    <li> This has GOT to be the ABSOLUTE BEST leave-in conditioner on the market.....at least for me.  It leaves my hair soft and detangled. I follow up with either an oil or cream and my curls just POP!!!</li>
    <li> I love this leave in conditioner, it&#x27;s a little difficult to find in my area but immediately stocked up when i found it here!</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have tried. I actually didn&#x27;t use leaves ins for a while because none worked for me but this works great on my  4b hair.</li>
    <li> Definitely one of the cheaper and low quality conditioner out there. Not much effective as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for my hair. I finally found exactly what I need to have my very curly hair looking on point all day everyday😍😍😍😍😍</li>
    <li> I bought more expensive thinking it&#x27;s work better I have this natural curly hair and always have to use stuff that coast 3 dollars a bottle, and they don&#x27;t sell it so I thought I try something differnt. I cant even get me hands or brush threw my hir with this stuff, but the smell is pretty, I won&#x27;t buy again, I have almost 3 bottles sitting around, which my mom won&#x27;t use eather she tried it too.</li>
    <li> Love. Love my Giovanni Leave-in. It&#x27;s a must have for my kinky curly hair.</li>
    <li> If all of the 5 star reviews haven&#x27;t convinced you yet, let me talk about my experience with this product. I purchased this item on a different Amazon account, the three pack. After washing my hair and using this leave-in, the difference was immediate. It has a slight scent which I can only describe as lightly shampooey. The consistency seems heavy in your hands, but once you apply it, you realize that it does not weigh down your hair. It leaves no residue as long as you use enough and don&#x27;t over-do it. I have very long, thin but voluminous hair and expect this three pack to last me at least 4 months (and this is considering that I gave one to my sister, who also loves it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using special shampoo, coconut oil (which made me break out but was awesome on my hair), jojoba oil (which I still use on my skin) and every other hair product I owned. Now I use either Herbal Essences or Dove shampoo/conditioner and this leave in afterwards. That&#x27;s it! This product left my hair manageable, shiny, and with so much volume. I am in love!</li>
    <li> My hair is straight and fine textured, and hennaed, so this conditioner is a bit heavy for me.  I use it mainly at the ends, and only a little bit.  My reason for giving it 5 stars though is I have been using it before I go swimming.  I wet my hair and put this in (a moderate amount) and then wear a swim cap and I&#x27;m set.  It has alleviated my super dry scalp and seems to prevent that brittle chlorine feeling.  I use the Giovanni Nutrifix deep conditioner after swimming, and after using a chlorine shampoo.  Seems to be my perfect trifecta against the chlorine.</li>
    <li> Love this product, leaves mine and my boyfriends hair moisturized and without frizz. This is my boyfriends go to leave in now we bought 4 of them. He suffers from really bad dandruff and with this it has gone away.</li>
    <li> I chose this product , as a recommendation form someone. I love how my hair feels when I use it and my hair seems to be more moisturized since I began using it</li>
    <li> Great product. Use very little. I use a pea size for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Really really like it!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I have a 3 pack! When I find a new product that is wonderful I share and everyone loves it. Its a great leave-in and when I flat iron my hair its a nice weightless formula but my hair is still nicely full of moisture.</li>
    <li> I have heard a lot of hype about this product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be for me. It leaves my naturally curly hair pretty dry no matter how much oil I use along with it.</li>
    <li> Was excited to try it based on review and completely satisfied.  I would purchase again if on sale.</li>
    <li> (preamble - I am a biracial guy (black father, white mother) - I never paid much attention to the curly hair types but at at glance I&#x27;d suppose I have 3A or 3B. Long and loose)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am another former Mixed Chicks user who decided to check this stuff out once the Mixed Chicks leave-in ran out and I was looking for a less expensive alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not only is this stuff less expensive (a 3-pack of these 8.5 oz bottles is only slightly more expensive than a single 10 oz bottle of MC), it also works far better for my hair! MC was the first stuff I found that could keep my hair from frizzing and puffing out without also locking it in place like a helmet. But it still did leave a bit of a &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; behind and didn&#x27;t react well to disturbances. Also, I was obviously growing dissatisfied with the amount I&#x27;d have to use what with the cost of a 10oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Giovanni Direct Leave-In provides all of the same benefits with none of the problems. My curls are well-defined and behaved but still feel soft and springy. They can be played and messed with and suffer no ill-effects. It also seems like the Giovanni Leave-In is actually conditioning my hair into a better more hydrated state. I don&#x27;t need to use as much and if I skip a day it&#x27;s not a total disaster! The other stuff seemed more like it was just sitting there and doing an OK job, but Giovanni is behaving more like a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I am extremely satisfied and have found a new product for the long haul!</li>
    <li> Leaves a white residue that flakes off like dandruff after a couple days. For the naturalistas who go long periods without washing, this is definitely a problem. If something is meant to be left in, it should assimilate seamlessly. Also dries a bit sticky for me. May be a good product, but for these reasons it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of protective styling and I can really tell a difference in the health of my hair!</li>
    <li> Very nice conditioner for leave in. Doesnt make it feel greasy and it helping my hair and split ends heal and I can straighten my hair easily.,</li>
    <li> This is a great leave-in! I have fine, thin, long, straight hair and I only use a tiny bit (quarter-sized) on hair past my neck. My hair brushes nicely. Very soft clean scent.</li>
    <li> Lightweight but still moisturizes and can use it every day on my natural hair. I used to have to go all the way to Whole Foods to find this but am so glad that Amazon is carrying it.</li>
    <li> Best moisture rich conditioner on the market for natural hair.  Coupled with Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Conditioner, make for a great leave-in! My hair is soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve EVER used on my hair, hands down. I now buy it in bulk from Amazon because of my daily use of this product. I love the clean, citrusy smell it leaves and the spiral curls are fantastic!!</li>
    <li> There is nothing better than this Leave - in conditioner</li>
    <li> Great for my natural hair! My TWA love this this product. A very very small amount goes a long way and leaves my hair soft and really help define my curls in my Teeny Weeny Afro.  It is making my transition back to my natural black hair easy and it is priced right!</li>
    <li> I moved from the east coast to the west coast and it is extremely dry here.  The humidity levels are incredibly low and the products that used to work, such as glycerin, now make my hair hard.  I have dry, curly, hair and the Giovanni Leave-in conditioner is the only thing that makes my hair feel soft and moisturized after a wash.  I use an apple cider vinegar rinse to remove buildup, so my hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> Good for the money. light weight smells great.</li>
    <li> This product is a fantastic leave in for women with fine hair as it does NOT weigh hair down. The results from using this product are bouncy, big curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for all hair types.</li>
    <li> For results I prefer [[ASIN:B001E77KQA Neutrogena Triple Moisture Silk Touch Leave-In Cream]] to the Giovanni, but will keep using the Giovanni.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giovanni is a better deal pricewise. Similar price, bigger bottle, and I found less is more.  My medium-thickness shoulder-length hair was detangled but felt coarse until I stepped it down to a mentos-sized blob. After that it had a nice silky feel. It rinses cleanly off my hands and, presumably, my hair also. But if you use it without washing out the previous application, it&#x27;ll go back to feeling sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neutrogena gives better results, texture-wise. I&#x27;m guessing it has a little more oil, or at least oils that work better with my hair. Very soft and smooth, and no harm done if you re-apply it without washing.</li>
    <li> After watching tons and tons of youtube videos of the natural gurus, I decided to try this stuff. I initially purchased this leave in conditioner at Whole Foods. Color me impressed! The product is light, yet moisturizing. I always follow it up with an oil, but for someone with less dry hair this lightweight leave in might do just the trick on its own. Because I am a product junkie, I have tried what feels like EVERY leave in on the market for people with my hair type. This stuff wins, hands down. Not sure I will ever use another leave in!</li>
    <li> Have used this for 4 years and love it. Light weight and very little scent for daily leave-in conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s curls. I have taken away one star as it used to be organic, now is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and I would like to keep the pressure on to get back to full organic. If you have a kid who puts their hair in their mouth, this is even more important, though too much of anything can cause issues.</li>
    <li> great value for the price</li>
    <li> This product is seriously the Holy Grail of all leave in conditioners. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months ago and I lieterally trashed all my other leave ins conditioners because this one has left me super duper happy. I&#x27;m natural with a hair type that&#x27;s 4b and I must say that despite the fact that my hair is thick and coarse, it really dosen&#x27;t take much of this product to keep my hair well moisturised. This is literally one of those &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34; type of products. So if you&#x27;re cautious about how much of the product you put in your hair, the bottle should last you about 2 1/2 months depending on how frequently you wash your hair.</li>
