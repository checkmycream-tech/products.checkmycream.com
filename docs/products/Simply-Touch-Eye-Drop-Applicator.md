      <li>it was a wise purchase.  </li>
      <li>My husband says it is ok, nothing great.</li>

      <li>Very easy to use and quite effective.  </li>
      <li>very easy to use.</li>
      <li>and she was thrilled, having been worried about how she would be able to handle the post op madications.</li>
      <li>You can easily put drops in your eyes!</li>
      <li>When I used it, the medication became a dome shape and it stuck more to the applicator than my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is ok.</li>
      <li>While I was hesitant to buy a product on Amazon with no reviews, I am glad I bought this, and I will pick one up for my mom as well.</li>
      <li>It would work fine for someone more agile, but my mother does not have the finger dexterity to use it.</li>
      <li>This wonderful little eye drop applicator saved me from running-out of eye drops and having to buy more.  </li>
      <li>So easy.</li>
      <li>easy to use and saves money by not wasting drops</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good with eye gel, too; you can see exactly how much you are using.  </li>
      <li>This is a very unique type of eye drop applicator that is made right here in the USA from a special type of plastic.  </li>
      <li>When I first saw the applicator I wasn&#x27;t too sure ir</li>
      <li>easier and softer on the eye to use a clean finger</li>
      <li>also give these as special gifts to my family, friends, and neighbors who struggle with trying to use old-style eye drop dispensing bottles.  </li>
      <li>It comes nicely packaged, with its own little clear carrying case, which would make it easy to take with you since it will fit in a purse or pocket.</li>
      <li>No aiming, no misses, fast and easy,  </li>
      <li>This really WORKED!!</li>
      <li>Maybe with some skill you could use it effectively, but with the same amount of skill I could just look up eye drop techniques on the Web and master those.</li>
      <li>The Inventor is a World-class, Board Certified, and award winning Ophthalmologist who has impressive medical credentials and extensive surgical experience in the specific area of cataract eye surgery.</li>
      <li>I just got this applicator and tried it out for the first time.</li>
      <li>Worked the first time I used it</li>
      <li>This product makes it so much easier and definitely lives up to its name giving more control to the user.</li>
      <li>Simple and easy</li>
      <li>(I have a man&#x27;s medium/woman&#x27;s large hand which worked well</li>
      <li>After using, I wash it with a little anti-bacterial hand soap and rinse with warm water to keep it sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>A redesign of the handle part might make it much easier to use.</li>
      <li>I really like that</li>
      <li>I really lke concept but</li>
      <li>this is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t waste drops that are worth more than gold by weight!</li>
      <li>It saves money by making sure you get just the right amount and no more.  </li>
      <li>recently visited the simplytouchusa.com web site to listen to video testimonials from actual eye patients, and to learn more about how the applicator is made and how to use it, which was very helpful.  </li>
      <li>Never could put drops in my eyes before, more ran down my face than I got in my eye.</li>
      <li>if you have steady hands...</li>
      <li>I love this little eye drop applicator.  </li>
      <li>My drops are expensive and this applicator works great and savings me money.</li>
      <li>It also pays for itself many times over by allowing over-the-counter eye drops, which I use for ongoing dry-eye conditions, to last almost twice as long.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the handle is tiny, and you do need a fairly steady hand to get the drop on the applicator in the first place.</li>
      <li>One can only hope this applicator will work effectively and last a long time.  </li>
      <li>New, and cautiously recommended.</li>
      <li>; if one has exceptionally large, rough hands, maybe experiment grasping a 1.5 inch popsicle stick first [NOT using drops or putting it into the eye] just to test the tiny grip first).  </li>
      <li>I found this applicator quite simple to use in front of a mirror, holding my bottom eye lid down and touching the drop on the applicator to my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I bought it for a 95 year old</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear that you get the complete drop.  </li>
      <li>soon after that I noticed he had stopped using it completely for some reason (I never asked why).</li>
      <li>With a less nervous patient this may be useful.</li>
      <li>I WAS WRONG, nothing could be easier to use, you simply put a drop on the applicator, pull own the lower eye lid and touch the applicator to it.  </li>
      <li>After washing one&#x27;s hands, one eye drop is squeezed into the tiny cup, then one stares ahead into a mirror, and barely touches the applicator&#x27;s cup end to the eye.  </li>
      <li>I sent an email to Simply Touch to confirm about proper usage for prescription glaucoma medication and was pleasantly surprised to receive a call from the creator of Simply Touch, Dr. Silverman (it is so seldom to receive such a personal touch nowadays).  </li>
      <li>Self-application is easy with no waste of expensive medication.  </li>

<li> Self-application is easy with no waste of expensive medication.  </li>
<li> I asked the company if they thought it would be useful for putting in thick eye gel.  </li>
<li> I recently had eye surgery and had to use 4 different types of expensive prescription eye drops (i.e., 100s of dollars for tiny little bottles) 4 times a day for many weeks.  </li>
<li> I have only just begun to use Simply Touch but find it an extremely efficient and simple tool for administering eye drops.  </li>
<li> This applicator makes instilling eye drops into the eye quite easy, without wasting any of the often expensive prescription product.</li>
<li> There is a little clear case included to put the applicator in.  </li>
<li> HIGHLY recommend if you have trouble with drops,!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to believe but it really works.</li>
<li> Takes too long to use.</li>
<li> the other hand, I did give this as a gift a few months a go to an older person using prescription eye drops and whilst I was there</li>
<li> My method now, based on the instructions given to me:  using Simply Touch, put a drop in one eye; close that eye; while keeping that eye closed, put another drop of medication on Simply Touch and put that drop in the other eye; close that eye as well; keep both eyes closed for a minute or two; then wipe away an tears/excess medication from around the eyes.  </li>
<li> If you are like me, and have difficulty with eye drop bottles, can&#x27;t get the drops in, can&#x27;t feel if they are going in, hate to waste money and don&#x27;t want too over-dose, this is great.  </li>
<li> but I just rinsed it well and let it dry in the case.</li>
<li> It saves up to 50% of over-the-counter and expensive prescription eye drop solutions, and even when it is turned sideways or all the way over, eye drop solutions will not fall-off the applicator (i.e., due to its unique and patented surface-tension design).  </li>
<li> At a price of over $12.00, well, it was a gasp seeing how little this tiny stick with cupped end was!</li>
<li> Putting the drop on the applicator is harder that just using the bottle.</li>
<li> Not really serviceable.</li>
<li> I discarded after a couple of tries.  </li>
<li> The common instructions for glaucoma medication when administering eye drops in the traditional manner is to have the head leaning back and to press against the tear ducts with your fingers to avoid the medication running down into the nose.  </li>
<li> One side is stamped Rx for prescription eye drops; the flip side shallow cup is marked for nonprescription (OTC) drops.  </li>
<li> It does appear to use less eye drop liquid than the previous cup- a dark blue eye drop bottle holder, which did not always get the drop into the eye.  </li>
<li> One side is for prescription eye drops and the other is for over the counter.</li>
<li> This tiny applicator is approximately one and a half inches long, with the slightly concave cup&#x27;s diameter about 1/4 inch.  </li>
<li> It is made in the USA of some sort of grippy, rubbery, slightly flexible, plastic-like substance.  </li>
<li> Now all you have to do is place a drop on the end, pull your lower lid down a little and place the drop.  </li>
<li> After eye surgery I started using this little device to put prescription eye drops in my eye.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had trouble putting eye drops in my eyes for a number of years now.</li>
<li> Biggest waste of time and money.</li>
<li> I have trouble with placing drops in my eye&#x27;s for years.</li>
<li> He blinked excessively making direct application of drops difficult.  </li>
<li> This product is a nifty little thing that works!</li>
<li> It comes with a small case that can be kept in a wallet (I kept it in my coin wallet).</li>
<li> Much to small for my shaky hands</li>
<li> Difficult to use and not worth the effort.</li>
<li> This item is very, very small.  </li>
<li> he was totally unable to use it at all.  </li>
<li> It works as described - except that it is difficult to pick up and it is difficult to tell which side to use for the types of solutions.  </li>
<li> What am i doing wrong.</li>
<li> It was almost impossible to get the drops from the applicator into his eye.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very easy to use and quite effective.  You do have to approach the eye at the angle shown in the directions.  If you do not, you&#x27;ll likely run into your eyelashes and lose the drop.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble putting eye drops in my eyes for a number of years now. This product makes it so much easier and definitely lives up to its name giving more control to the user. The redness on my eyelids is diminishing also which is an extra bonus.</li>
    <li> Basically ineffective. Spouse required multiple eye drops after cataract surgery.  He blinked excessively making direct application of drops difficult.  Use of this devise proved to be the same challenge.  It was almost impossible to get the drops from the applicator into his eye.  I discarded after a couple of tries.  With a less nervous patient this may be useful.</li>
    <li> I used this for over the counter eye drops and it worked for me well. One side is for prescription eye drops and the other is for over the counter. It comes with a small case that can be kept in a wallet (I kept it in my coin wallet). I think they recommend washing it after use with soapy water but I just rinsed it well and let it dry in the case. Before this I needed help getting eye drops in my eye and that was quite a chore and a lot had to be used. I found this applicator quite simple to use in front of a mirror, holding my bottom eye lid down and touching the drop on the applicator to my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I did give this as a gift a few months a go to an older person using prescription eye drops and whilst I was there he got someone to help him use it and soon after that I noticed he had stopped using it completely for some reason (I never asked why). It just didn&#x27;t work for him. I give it 5 stars as it worked perfectly for me and I think anyone willing to put the effort in will find this the best choice for putting eye drops in your own eye.</li>
    <li> I asked the company if they thought it would be useful for putting in thick eye gel.  They recommended it.  I don&#x27;t.  I had to scrape the plastic against my lid to get the goop in ... easier and softer on the eye to use a clean finger</li>
    <li> gave it to a lady who was about to have cataract surgery and she was thrilled, having been worried about how she would be able to handle the post op madications.</li>
    <li> I really lke concept but sometimes the  eye medicine does not leave the applicator.  What am i doing wrong.</li>
    <li> It would work fine for someone more agile, but my mother does not have the finger dexterity to use it.</li>
    <li> I just got this applicator and tried it out for the first time. I am recovering from eye surgery and need to put multiple drops in my eye. This applicator makes instilling eye drops into the eye quite easy, without wasting any of the often expensive prescription product. Works for OTC drops too. It comes nicely packaged, with its own little clear carrying case, which would make it easy to take with you since it will fit in a purse or pocket. While I was hesitant to buy a product on Amazon with no reviews, I am glad I bought this, and I will pick one up for my mom as well.</li>
    <li> I love this little eye drop applicator.  I recently had eye surgery and had to use 4 different types of expensive prescription eye drops (i.e., 100s of dollars for tiny little bottles) 4 times a day for many weeks.  This wonderful little eye drop applicator saved me from running-out of eye drops and having to buy more.  It also pays for itself many times over by allowing over-the-counter eye drops, which I use for ongoing dry-eye conditions, to last almost twice as long.  I really like that I no longer have to hold my head way back to use eye drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also give these as special gifts to my family, friends, and neighbors who struggle with trying to use old-style eye drop dispensing bottles.  I keep one at home and one in my travel bag.  After using, I wash it with a little anti-bacterial hand soap and rinse with warm water to keep it sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently visited the simplytouchusa.com web site to listen to video testimonials from actual eye patients, and to learn more about how the applicator is made and how to use it, which was very helpful.  This is a very unique type of eye drop applicator that is made right here in the USA from a special type of plastic.

    <li> This product is a nifty little thing that works! You can easily put drops in your eyes!</li>
    <li> Difficult to use and not worth the effort.</li>
    <li> This tiny applicator is approximately one and a half inches long, with the slightly concave cup&#x27;s diameter about 1/4 inch.  It is made in the USA of some sort of grippy, rubbery, slightly flexible, plastic-like substance.  One side is stamped Rx for prescription eye drops; the flip side shallow cup is marked for nonprescription (OTC) drops.  It does appear to use less eye drop liquid than the previous cup- a dark blue eye drop bottle holder, which did not always get the drop into the eye.  This does not require one to tip back one&#x27;s head.  Simply Touch claims one won&#x27;t blink, but maybe that will improve with practice.  After washing one&#x27;s hands, one eye drop is squeezed into the tiny cup, then one stares ahead into a mirror, and barely touches the applicator&#x27;s cup end to the eye.  One&#x27;s moist eyeball appears to immediately attract the liquid drop out of the cup.  (I have a man&#x27;s medium/woman&#x27;s large hand which worked well; if one has exceptionally large, rough hands, maybe experiment grasping a 1.5 inch popsicle stick first [NOT using drops or putting it into the eye] just to test the tiny grip first).  The applicator is to be washed in soapy water after each use, for sanitation.  There is a little clear case included to put the applicator in.  At a price of over $12.00, well, it was a gasp seeing how little this tiny stick with cupped end was! One can only hope this applicator will work effectively and last a long time.  New, and cautiously recommended.</li>
    <li> Self-application is easy with no waste of expensive medication.  I have used this for several weeks and I am still amazed by how efficiently it does the job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe but it really works. My drops are expensive and this applicator works great and savings me money.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever. After eye surgery I started using this little device to put prescription eye drops in my eye.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier.  Never could put drops in my eyes before, more ran down my face than I got in my eye. Now all you have to do is place a drop on the end, pull your lower lid down a little and place the drop.  So easy.</li>
    <li> easy to use and saves money by not wasting drops</li>
    <li> very easy to use. great for someone who has problems using eye drops.</li>
    <li> It saves money by making sure you get just the right amount and no more.  One drop sticks like glue on the applicator until it gets in your eye.  It&#x27;s good with eye gel, too; you can see exactly how much you are using.  If you are like me, and have difficulty with eye drop bottles, can&#x27;t get the drops in, can&#x27;t feel if they are going in, hate to waste money and don&#x27;t want too over-dose, this is great.  HOWEVER, the handle is tiny, and you do need a fairly steady hand to get the drop on the applicator in the first place.</li>
    <li> This item is very, very small.  It works as described - except that it is difficult to pick up and it is difficult to tell which side to use for the types of solutions.  That is how I feel about it.  However, I bought it for a 95 year old he was totally unable to use it at all.  A redesign of the handle part might make it much easier to use.</li>
    <li> Much to small for my shaky hands</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this since I&#x27;ve gotten it. Maybe with some skill you could use it effectively, but with the same amount of skill I could just look up eye drop techniques on the Web and master those. It is simply too flimsy and doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence the medication will get in your eye. When I used it, the medication became a dome shape and it stuck more to the applicator than my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Also try youtube for eye drop applicator tricks. That is where I learned my current one.</li>
    <li> No different then an eye dropper</li>
    <li> It is ok. It doesn&#x27;t appear that you get the complete drop.  My husband says it is ok, nothing great. I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the applicator I wasn&#x27;t too sure ir it was a wise purchase.  I WAS WRONG, nothing could be easier to use, you simply put a drop on the applicator, pull own the lower eye lid and touch the applicator to it.  That&#x27;s it, you&#x27;re done. No aiming, no misses, fast and easy,  Also, it will hold two drops if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 different devices...this one works!!  Simple and easy if you have steady hands...this is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t waste drops that are worth more than gold by weight!</li>
    <li> Biggest waste of time and money. Didn&#x27;t perform as advertised. eyedrops everywhere but in my eyes! Don&#x27;t bother with this bogus product.</li>
    <li> This really WORKED!! I have trouble with placing drops in my eye&#x27;s for years. I wished I bought then. HIGHLY recommend if you have trouble with drops,!</li>
    <li> I have only just begun to use Simply Touch but find it an extremely efficient and simple tool for administering eye drops.  I sent an email to Simply Touch to confirm about proper usage for prescription glaucoma medication and was pleasantly surprised to receive a call from the creator of Simply Touch, Dr. Silverman (it is so seldom to receive such a personal touch nowadays).  My method now, based on the instructions given to me:  using Simply Touch, put a drop in one eye; close that eye; while keeping that eye closed, put another drop of medication on Simply Touch and put that drop in the other eye; close that eye as well; keep both eyes closed for a minute or two; then wipe away an tears/excess medication from around the eyes.  The common instructions for glaucoma medication when administering eye drops in the traditional manner is to have the head leaning back and to press against the tear ducts with your fingers to avoid the medication running down into the nose.  With Simply Touch the drops are administered with the head upright; it was explained to me that there is no need to put the head back after administering the drops, nor is there need to press against the tear ducts; it is blinking, not gravity, that forces the medication into the tear ducts, so just wiping away any excess before opening the eyes/blinking is sufficient.</li>
    <li> Putting the drop on the applicator is harder that just using the bottle.</li>
    <li> Not really serviceable. Takes too long to use.</li>
    <li> Worked the first time I used it but then, the medication just would not stay on the applicator.  I wound up wasting a lot of drops trying to get the applicator to work.</li>
