      <li>Love this thing...</li>
      <li>Wanted more attachments but could no order.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I was going to feel about this considering the price, but oh MAN</li>
      <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
      <li>I understand the market to which it was made for &amp; geared towards, but it could&#x27;ve been a bit more durable or made with a material of better quality.</li>
      <li>To my delight, this dryer has been absolutely FANTASTIC!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t even turn it on, I didn&#x27;t know how many stars to give it.  </li>
      <li>My favorite shape for banding hair.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for this hair dryer for a while and found it on amazon, thank god :) ,</li>
      <li>This is a good product not loud and the brush is good</li>
      <li>I loved my new panasonic kurukuru!</li>
      <li>By week 4, along with the popping sound there were sparks shooting from the styler.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy the cheap ones.</li>
      <li>i tried to smooth out some of the frizz with hair cream</li>
      <li>When I saw it available again, I decided to buy another for backup as after 5 years of use</li>
      <li>I was nervous that the outlet plug wouldn&#x27;t fit in a US socket, but I had no problems.</li>
      <li>, It is fast and leave my hair in a nice shape.</li>
      <li>It has been good so far.</li>
      <li>brought this product because of a natural hair blogger who loved it.</li>
      <li>It is also a good tool for natural hair.</li>
      <li>good quietly.i highly recommend it for quick blowdry</li>
      <li>you have fine, straight, wavy, or loosely curled hair, then this is perfect for you!</li>
      <li>The original Panasonic Kurukuru is the best (in hot pink).</li>
      <li>I originally purchased one of these stylers 5 years ago</li>
      <li>I usually buy this wonderful gadget at the Korean market, but they stopped carrying it-</li>
      <li>recommend this to anyone unless your hair is super fine...</li>
      <li>It works great on drying long hair.</li>
      <li>Trying it for the first time was an experience because of the shape of the brush, which is more like a comb.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would live up to the one my mother has, but it&#x27;s just as good, even better because it uses US standard outlets no problem.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a perfect tool for people who has very straight hair but want to have little wave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Takes a little longer to get hot, but great item!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping Panasonic has made a good quality, longer lasting blower brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I think), plus a cool setting.</li>
      <li>i used this once and ended up with a head full of frizz.  </li>
      <li>and my hair is quickly straightened, without needing a straightener.</li>
      <li>The way it&#x27;s designed lets your hair get close to the heat source, so it works really quickly.</li>
      <li>Luckily, found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>and when i used it to find it works just like my old thrift store find, i was ecstatic!!!!!</li>
      <li>Works great for light curly waves for not overly thick hair.</li>
      <li>This is a powerful hair dryer in a compact size.  </li>
      <li>sometimes it is very hot but in general it is ok.</li>
      <li>I must say that Amazon made it very easy to return the defective item &amp; the refund was issued within 24 hours of their receiving it back.  </li>
      <li>It has different settings (heat, cool, and set) and is really quick and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I will stick with my lower wattage dryer and even though it takes a bit longer to dry my hair, I am more comfortable with it.  </li>
      <li>This gets my hair dry fast and is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried for straightening my hair without leaving it flat.</li>
      <li>I saw a woman using it in my club and got curious when she told me that this is the best and it is hard to get it :)  </li>
      <li>Dries verry verry verry good but better for thicker hair types i have thin hair and</li>
      <li>and it gets hot very fast.</li>
      <li>Even at home, I tend to use this one more often than a regular hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Today I plugged this in and noticed it was not blowing hot air.  </li>
      <li>Since it seemed to style my hair better, I continued using the 2nd purchase...</li>
      <li>reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is so hot..</li>
      <li>This dryer gets HOT.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a Gold n Hot blow drier for over 7 years without damage</li>
      <li>this thing is just too hot.</li>
      <li>cuz i can&#x27;t style my hair without it ;)</li>
      <li>I love this product because I use it only when my hair is damp</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works pretty well, but it is not super &amp;#34;low-noise&amp;#34;, not much lower than other hand dryers.</li>
    <li> Have used it for about 3 weeks. Love it. Dry and style your hair fast and nicer. Can&#x27;t give it a five star because don&#x27;t know how ling it will last.</li>
    <li> i used this once and ended up with a head full of frizz.  it may as well be a regular blow dryer because that&#x27;s how the end results were on my hair.  i have long thick curly hair so it may be the texture.  i tried to smooth out some of the frizz with hair cream but this frizzed it so bad i couldn&#x27;t do anything to help it. felt it was a total waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I have some health issues at the moment and find drying my hair using a round brush and dryer to be almost impossible.  I do have a similar dryer by another manufacturer but it only does not give off much heat.  I read the reviews on this dryer and it sounded like it was something I could use.  The product arrived on time and was well packaged.  No clamshell to deal with--I also knew the instructions would be in Japanese.  Trying it for the first time was an experience because of the shape of the brush, which is more like a comb.  That wasn&#x27;t a problem though, the heat was the problem and I felt it was just too harsh for my fine, thinning hair.  I will stick with my lower wattage dryer and even though it takes a bit longer to dry my hair, I am more comfortable with it.  I sent it back but for anyone with a nice, thick head of hair who want to get their hair dried quickly, I think you should give this a chance.  It is well made and I am just sorry it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to dry my hair so I start off with my regular hair dryer and finish with this one. It leaves my hair soft and straight but not board straight like a flat iron does.</li>
    <li> Just got this and used it once.  I like how it performs.  I do wish that the directions and other information about the dryer were in&lt;br /&gt;English.</li>
    <li> Takes a little longer to get hot, but great item! If your hair is curly, you&#x27;re not going to blow it out completely straight with it. But you can use it maintain your hair straight once straight and not use the hot iron.</li>
    <li> Great product and good price!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this type of hot brush many years and found Panasonic product is the best on the market so highly recommend to others .</li>
    <li> Love!!!! Still working and recommended this product over any!!!</li>
    <li> Works great for light curly waves for not overly thick hair. Low noise great price! 10times better than conair version. Dont need plug converter in us and canada.</li>
    <li> Love this thing... I don&#x27;t know how people survive without the Kurukuru... there is no way I would ever blowdry the old-fashioned way. The original Panasonic Kurukuru is the best (in hot pink).</li>
    <li> i like it. more than good. sometimes it is very hot but in general it is ok.</li>
    <li> I had one similar while living in Asia, have looked here for years and all you can buy are the round brush ones, Hopefully if I ever need another I can still find them.  Does everything I need.</li>
    <li> I was searching for this hair dryer everywhere. I finally caved and decided to purchase it online. I just felt like a diva ordering a hair dryer all the way from Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not good at using a round brush with a hair dryer. This is the perfect solution. I&#x27;ve tried other brush style dryers and none them match up to this one. I was nervous that the outlet plug wouldn&#x27;t fit in a US socket, but I had no problems.</li>
    <li> Thank you panasonic for this magic hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Everything is good!  It let me surprise that is so fast than i expect.  The comb is a little bit soft.</li>
    <li> I brought this as christmas gift, but didn&#x27;t use it till this month after a complicated moving situation and oversea trip.  When i used it in Europe with a convertor, it burned the hotel&#x27;s fuss and almost started a fire, it sent sparks and etc.  i was so scared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe Panasonic would product something like this!!!  i was such a big fan of this product for a long time.  what a shocking disappointment!</li>
    <li> Dries verry verry verry good but better for thicker hair types i have thin hair and the brush teeth are a bit hard and hurts my scalp but i would buy it over and over again because it out dries any dryer store bought for sure!</li>
    <li> there were no directions in English.  The dyer sparked when close to water.  Wanted more attachments but could no order.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I was going to feel about this considering the price, but oh MAN I love this dryer.  It has different settings (heat, cool, and set) and is really quick and easy to use.  It&#x27;s not super quiet but definitely not as loud as a normal hair dryer.  I use it on my girls&#x27; hair in the morning on occasion, and on my (short) curly hair to straighten it.  Works wonderfully.  You do have to be careful of the plastic bristles though as they can be pokey on the scalp, and can get bent during storage if it&#x27;s jammed in with other hairbrushes/tools, etc.  When this wears out or breaks I&#x27;m definitely buying another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to cut the time to stye &amp; dry my hair in the busy morning. This product allows me to do both and my hair is quickly straightened, without needing a straightener. I&#x27;ve also found it helpful when traveling. I don&#x27;t need to carry a big blow dryer and hair brush. Even at home, I tend to use this one more often than a regular hair dryer. It gives me the feeling of styling my hair like I care, even though I&#x27;m just drying it.</li>
    <li> nice but i miss the roller brush. i searched all over to try to buy the curling brush attachment but could not find it anywhere. thought this would come with it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, various temperature settings! I am terrible at hair styling but this makes the job a breeze! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I had another KuruKuru, Middle east version, that had a package of some different brushes and styling parts which worked for me 2 years, the best thing about that one was its flat brush, which was made with a rubber like material and was very good.&lt;br /&gt;But this one just had one brush, and the brush teeth got bended after the first use, they are made of hard plastic material.&lt;br /&gt;The price of this one was twice the price of my old KuruKuru.&lt;br /&gt;While they had the same form my older one&#x27;s parts are made with slightly different size, which I can not use in this one. the reason I got this new one was the voltage difference between US and Middle east 110/220.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I use it only when my hair is damp and I no longer use the hair drier. I use this.&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully. I have a lot of hair so I wouldn&#x27;t think of using this with my hair straight out of the shower, I would take forever!&lt;br /&gt;But if my hair is damp and I need styling then this is my go-to tool. I was afraid it would work like &amp;#34;hotel-driers&amp;#34; that once they overheat it would shut down, but this one doesn&#x27;t! It stays working for a long while without a problem. The brush is great. I really like this product and I use it a lot.</li>
    <li> This dryer is awesome!  This is a powerful hair dryer in a compact size.  It is also a good tool for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I use this hair dryer to straighten my hair and it takes less than 5 minutes. the only bad thing is the rubber comb wears out after one year.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great brush dryer and the power is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The ends of the brush are a little hard though so it might take some getting used to at first.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like it, good item, but after one year and 3 month stopped working and I couldn&#x27;t find spare parts !</li>
    <li> I saw a woman using it in my club and got curious when she told me that this is the best and it is hard to get it :)  I ordered it and was pleasantly surprised by the results, It is fast and leave my hair in a nice shape.</li>
    <li> i bought this dryer to replace a brush dryer that i brought from the second hand store about 6-7 years ago. everybody that ever used that brush dryer wanted to buy it from me because it worked so well. because it was used when i got it, the brand name had rubbed off so i don&#x27;t know what brand it was. i do know that i have looked on amazon and other sites trying to find a similar item for a decent price. and i often found dryers that were over $50, so i never purchased any of them. my used dryer died last year, but i refused to part with it so i glued it and duck taped it;-). so when i found this dryer for $26, i was very pleased! and when i used it to find it works just like my old thrift store find, i was ecstatic!!!!! its a really great dryer, AND its reasonably priced! if your thinking about buying this, don&#x27;t hesitate its a great dryer!!!</li>
    <li> Wish I had this when I was in college. It saves time and my hair looks great. My God-sister turned me on to this. Thanks, Sis.</li>
    <li> once i plugged it for the first time its made a electric shock that made me run out my room with lot of bad smell,it was near my cat wile she was sleeping ,,, OMG i will never ever buy fake stuff again</li>
    <li> Today I plugged this in and noticed it was not blowing hot air.  I may have used this item 20 times since purchasing it in October 2014.  I used to have one from Korea and it lasted forever.  So it is dissapointing that this one had such a short life.</li>
    <li> satisfied with everything!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic hair dryer for years.  I have very coarse, curly hair and this nifty little wand straightens and sleeks it out.  I usually buy this wonderful gadget at the Korean market, but they stopped carrying it-I panicked.  Luckily, found it on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been through so many of these (the dryer usually lasts for about 2 years for me, but I use it almost daily after I wash my hair).  Not sure where I would be without it, probably in frizz central.  Shipped on time and price is perfect.</li>
    <li> Like KURUKURU dryer. I can never find a hair dryer like this one in the U.S. This is my third one. I like it and use it every day. I only bought this one because I lost the brush head while traveling.</li>
    <li> The product produces good results, use with care as it is easily broken had to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased one of these stylers 5 years ago &amp; it&#x27;s still working.  When I saw it available again, I decided to buy another for backup as after 5 years of use, there&#x27;s a good chance it will just poof one day.  When I received the 2nd one, it had been redesigned a little bit.  Upon using it, I liked the new design much better!!!  Since it seemed to style my hair better, I continued using the 2nd purchase...putting the old one up to be used as a backup.  Around week 2, I began to hear an occasional pop; but nothing bad seemed to happen.  By week 4, along with the popping sound there were sparks shooting from the styler.  Concerned that it might set my hair on fire, I requested a replacement.  Sadly, that seller would only give a refund.  I must say that Amazon made it very easy to return the defective item &amp; the refund was issued within 24 hours of their receiving it back.  Since I liked the current version of this styler so much better than the old, I purchased a 3rd styler from a different seller.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd week now &amp; have not heard even one pop.  So, I&#x27;m hoping the defective styler was a one in a million occurrence.  I decided to give this styler a 5-star rating as I really do love it &amp; I may have purchased the only defective item out of the millions made.  After careful thought, I determined that it would be wrong to give a 4-star for having one minor problem in over 5 years!!!  At my age, if this one lasts over 5 years like the last one, it will more than likely outlive me!!!  If anything changes, I&#x27;ll be back with an update</li>
    <li> I loved my new panasonic kurukuru! a useful tool for everyday &amp; so practical! it took me a while until I found this little lovely dryer pink!</li>
    <li> I only had it for a month.  I saw a few red sparks, and then it went dead!! It won&#x27;t even turn on anymore.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Works excellent for my blow outs without over drying my hair. Highly recommend it for people with natural hair.</li>
    <li> I owned a very old version of this product that we had picked up in Japan. The bristle part had started to break after years of use, and I was panicking since nothing else I&#x27;ve tried seems to do the trick.  My hair is very wavy and gets crazy (frizzy &amp; wavy) if I don&#x27;t blowdry it thoroughly. This gets my hair dry fast and is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried for straightening my hair without leaving it flat. I was so happy when I found it online, and it is still a great product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have very long, colored hair ( so some degree of damge) and I decided to buy this one to replace my regular dryer since it&#x27;s too tired to comb through them while blow them dry.&lt;br /&gt;But somehow this is not so much as it promised, 1st, it features &amp;#34;low noise&amp;#34; while it really isnt much lower on its noise; 2nd, it may damage your hair further, &#x27;cause I felt my hair split more after I start to use it. The volatge is fine but the power is weak, it will take you longer if you already get used to normal dryer</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter are using this for over 6yrs, each unit last about 2yrs so this was our 3rd unit. For everyday use, I think it is ok to buy it every other year. It works great on drying long hair.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law has had a similar Panasonic hair dyer for years that she purchased in Taiwan.  I used it at her house a few months ago and was so pleased with the results that I went on a search for one.  To my surprise, I discovered that they really don&#x27;t sell these in the US.  I found a round-brush John Frieda hair dyer, but it had almost no power (low heat, would have taken 45 minutes to dry my hair completely!).  I had to return it.  When I came across this dyer on Amazon, I was a little hesitant to purchase it.  Since it&#x27;s made for the Japanese market, I was concerned that the voltage would be a problem.  To my delight, this dryer has been absolutely FANTASTIC!  When I say that it has totally transformed my hair, I am not exaggerating!  I have fairly thick, shoulder length hair and to get my hair to look smooth with a decent amount of style, I would have to first blow dry with a traditional dyer and then use a straightener.  I have two babies under the age of two and I just don&#x27;t have time for this!  Now I sit down on the couch with this dyer - I don&#x27;t need a mirror, you just run the brush through your hair - it heats up wonderfully (very hot, I love it!), is lightweight, and within ten minutes, my hair is COMPLETELY dry and STYLED.  My husband has complimented my hair several times in the past week since I started using this dyer.  He hasn&#x27;t done that since my pre-baby days (when I had time to style)!  In summary, PURCHASE THIS DRYER!  Don&#x27;t be concerned with reviews that say it will not work with American outlets.  It absolutely will.  My mother-in-law&#x27;s Panasonic dryer has literally lasted her through YEARS of use in the US.  Panasonic really should start distributing this product to the US market.</li>
    <li> No instructions in English so I am doing the best I can with it</li>
    <li> I was looking at these KURUKURU dryers and was very intrigued.  I wanted a blower/brush that I could travel to Europe with.  I think I saw a Kurukuru that would be dual voltage but this one wasn&#x27;t it.  I opened the box and removed the dryer to test it but didn&#x27;t test it. I was trying to find how to set it for US voltage, but the truth is that it only comes as US Voltage and no other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are warned that it is packaged for the Japan market.  That is the truth.  There isn&#x27;t a shred of English translation for any of the instructions.  The instructions are  all in Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, since I already had it out, I took a picture of it showing it&#x27;s voltage markings and it&#x27;s hair brush.  I was surprised at how wide the brush was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Panasonic products.  I&#x27;m tired of replacing a blower brush every 4 to 6 months.  I&#x27;m going to see if I can find the other KURUKURU which I believe had dual voltage.  I&#x27;m hoping Panasonic has made a good quality, longer lasting blower brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t even turn it on, I didn&#x27;t know how many stars to give it.  I didn&#x27;t want to give too few and I couldn&#x27;t give it a perfect, so I just picked the middle.  I hope that doesn&#x27;t hurt their rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;m trying to figure out where to insert the picture.  I can&#x27;t find the link.</li>
    <li> i really like it.but it is not low noise as it was mention but good quietly.i highly recommend it for quick blowdry</li>
    <li> My favorite shape for banding hair. The ones that are a complete round brush shape tend to tangle, but his adds a smoothing element.</li>
    <li> Have short, curly hair which is much easier to style if I can dry it to a bit of smoothness. This is probably the best dryer I&#x27;ve used to date. Absolutely no problems with electric power using even at highest setting. Lightweight yet excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I had used a similar Japanese dryer before but couldn&#x27;t buy the same one from US so I bought this one from Amazon instead.&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty much the same and it&#x27;s a perfect tool for people who has very straight hair but want to have little wave.&lt;br /&gt;Usually, I have other dryer to dry my hair initially and use this dryer to make some waves.&lt;br /&gt;Then it&#x27;s very easy to style my hair. It works better with little bit wet hair. For me, it takes about 2-3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say $20 is very cheap but excellent investment for quick hair styling. I use it everyday... I wish I can post my hair picture before and after using this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Some times it has wierd noises and when i put it in set stage the power goes up and down</li>
    <li> This dryer gets HOT. So hot that it&#x27;s scary! I grew up with one of these. My mother is Japanese and she would pick up one of these when she would go back. Very hard to these types in the US, so I was happy to find this one on Amazon. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would live up to the one my mother has, but it&#x27;s just as good, even better because it uses US standard outlets no problem. With my mother&#x27;s, you cannot use it more than a few minutes or it will overheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is relatively quiet, it&#x27;s small and again, it is HOT just at the low setting. I don&#x27;t dare use the high setting. I have very curly mixed-race hair and I use this when I&#x27;m trying to straighten my hair, which I don&#x27;t do very often because it&#x27;s such a tough process. But this helps by being a brush + the heat...it gets most of the curl out of my hair, then I follow up with flat iron. I have only used this on DRY hair...it is easier for me to straighten my hair when it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, as I&#x27;m maintaining my straight style, all I have to do is use the brush in the morning to remove lumps or waves from sleeping...the brush is good for turning ends under or out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone unless your hair is super fine...this thing is just too hot. I feel though that girls who blow dry every day can really save time with this having the brush already attached. The cord swivels too, and that definitelyhelps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is so hot..it&#x27;s scary. I try not to use it for more than a minute at a time and that works for me as I will turn it off to separate sections.</li>
    <li> the stars say it all.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and the recipient liked the product. They were happy with it but I can&#x27;t speak to product performance.</li>
    <li> I have used it only twice. It has been good so far. If I issues with it I will inform you</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last 15 plus years. My regular store closed down, happy to have found it when I did.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy the cheap ones. Just save your money and buy the great quality. This is a good product not loud and the brush is good</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this hair dryer for a while and found it on amazon, thank god :) , cuz i can&#x27;t style my hair without it ;)</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who can&#x27;t manage the hair dryer/round brush combo and I recently got a short hair cut so I knew I had to find a tool to help me out.  I was reading reviews of the John Frieda round brush when I came across this. It&#x27;s got a higher voltage, 700 watts on the high setting, 400 on the low (I think), plus a cool setting. It&#x27;s not a round brush per se, more of a rounded flat brush, actually. But it&#x27;s got enough curve to work and I like that the brush is smooth, hard plastic and not the grabby bristles that come with most round brushes. Does it replace a salon blow dry + flat ironing? No. But it&#x27;s way better than the awkward two arm tango with a dryer and a brush. The way it&#x27;s designed lets your hair get close to the heat source, so it works really quickly. What I used to do in 20 minutes with a brush and blow dryer I can now do in about 7 with this pink magic wand. Yes, the packaging and instructions are only in Japanese, but the writing on the brush is in English. You don&#x27;t need instructions, you plug it in and do your thing.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It does not heat up, like some other dryers. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> This review is for people who have natural hair &amp;/or people who have thick or coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;I brought this product because of a natural hair blogger who loved it. I wanted to get a blow drier that was easy to handle &amp; that didn&#x27;t necessarily get my hair super straight, just dried and stretched.&lt;br /&gt;It did work really well as far as giving me the results that I wanted and it gets hot very fast. It cuts down the time of drying my hair to almost 20-25 minutes (If I was using a regular blow drier &amp; round brush we&#x27;re looking at about 50-60 minutes of drying time). If my hair is already dry and I am stretching my curls, it takes about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that its very &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; when it comes to dealing with natural hair. My hair isn&#x27;t that coarse, but it is very thick. I&#x27;ve had this product for about 5 months and the plastic near the base of the brush has already broken (I noticed it cracked after the third time using it on wet hair). It is also very hard to clean (as I clean my tools right after I finish washing my hair).&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine, straight, wavy, or loosely curled hair, then this is perfect for you! I understand the market to which it was made for &amp; geared towards, but it could&#x27;ve been a bit more durable or made with a material of better quality. I&#x27;ve had a Gold n Hot blow drier for over 7 years without damage (that I replaced this with) and I also have an Ion blow drier thats coming up on 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll end up getting another one anyways because I do like the product, I just wish it was stronger!</li>
    <li> This Japanese Panasonic hair dryer has only 2 types of control - cold and burn your scalp off!  I ordered 2 and returned them both. In my opinion they are lethal weapon in the hands of a child.  I was terribly disappointed.  Also the same thing happened with a similar Panasonic one purchased in Japan very recently.  I  have used nothing but these hairdryers for the past 30 years BUT never had Panasonic.  All other original Japanese dryers in this style have 3 control switches cold -  warm and high and more accessories.  The high control does not burn your hair or scalp.  This panasonic is cheap and nasty and I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really good blow dryer. And works really well on natural African American texture hair. My only complaint is sometimes it makes popping sounds while using it.</li>
    <li> It giving off from the brush a red spark because of the  bad electric since the first time I use it.</li>
