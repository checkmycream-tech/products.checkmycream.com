      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ps do not freak out because it is a bright blue/violet-</li>
      <li>Good stuff</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was delivered in pretty good time &amp; in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just need more power!  </li>
      <li>Yes I would not recommend based on my own experience.</li>
      <li>What was nice about the product is I do not think it begins to work until heat is applied.</li>
      <li>This is a good product,  I have used it for many years &amp; have never had any complaints with it.</li>
      <li>, nice.</li>
      <li>It always gives good reliable results &amp; is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>love it, thank you...&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Always great. arrived fast.</li>
      <li>I have used this for years with 20 volume developer on my dishwater blonde hair and it works perfectly every time.</li>
      <li>Ugh...so girls, there are better ways to do this, in my opinion</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Once I washed it out most of that was gone</li>
      <li>A full process probably would have made my hair fall out!  </li>
      <li>I used with loreal 30 developer and it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t lighten up as well as it says, but I enjoy the purple undertones.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, but not my favorite, only because I need the 7 level lift, not the 4.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because idk if it&#x27;s the bleach or me, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the bleach.</li>
      <li>It did work thoroughly and quickly.  </li>
      <li>I was doing my own head, and that, for me, takes extra time.</li>
      <li>This product is really nice for lifting only 4 levels of hair color.</li>
      <li>What I do acknowledge is this stuff makes my blonde more cool in tone.  </li>
      <li>Also, I never do a full process b/c I like the natural brown tones of my original color coming through.  </li>
      <li>Kaleidocolors comes in several tones so be sure to select the right one for your hair procedure.</li>
      <li>If you need to pull more color, I&#x27;d suggest a different product.</li>
      <li>This means you get more even processing if you are doing something like a foil that takes quite a bit of time to put in properly.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t bleached my hair in a long time, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I am a real person</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much of anything and just damaged my hair.</li>
      <li>It dries WAY too fast</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job very well.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still kind of stiff.</li>
      <li>the other bleaches I&#x27;ve used lifted and spread so much better than this.</li>
      <li>that is the toner to take away the brassy yellow/orange and unwanted tones that normal hair pulls.</li>
      <li>it is not available in my town, I&#x27;m so glad I can buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
      <li>Right after my appts I usually deep condition</li>
      <li>It is available in 2 other colors of containers.</li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair that I have fully highlighted to a light blonde for over ten years.  </li>
      <li>Very natural as highlights.</li>
      <li>Usually I don&#x27;t spend more than twenty min.</li>
      <li>it is pretty obvious</li>
      <li>I used with clairol pure white 10 volume developer.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t surprised because it always goes orange when I bleach it</li>
      <li>This is the first haircolor product to get me back to the blonde</li>
      <li>My hair girl uses a different bleach every time to try out new stuff.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, this stuff does exactly what is says it does.</li>
      <li>The brassiness of my naturally medium blond hair is completely toned down and out by this purple wonder.</li>

<li> The brassiness of my naturally medium blond hair is completely toned down and out by this purple wonder.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like bleach, it actually smells like berrys and the amount of damage to your hair is significantly less than normal bleach.</li>
<li> I imagine if you leave it in your hair too long it might give you a blue or violet tint.</li>
<li> just long enough for every last oil to dry up and leave me!  </li>
<li> Just remember to carefully read what the product will actually achieve.</li>
<li> This will not allow you to lose track of time and leave it in too long.</li>
<li> have dark blonde hair that had not been foiled or processed in any way throughout the length of the hair.</li>
<li> BE careful</li>
<li> and it bleached my hair to a pale blonde.</li>
<li> I used it on my hair with foil, in very small - about 1/16th inch - sections, with pieces woven out of each section for a natural, sun-kissed look.</li>
<li> It also only takes 10 minutes to develop, unlike usual bleach which is anywhere from 30-40.</li>
<li> I have never had this issue with the other bleaches.  </li>
<li> but usually the second time I get results...</li>
<li> Once the foil was in I wrapped my head in plastic wrap and applied heat from an ordinary, hand-held hair dryer.</li>
<li> The package says that it&#x27;s for use on lighter hair, but I used this on my dark brown, nearly-black hair with (non-Clairol)</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll have to leave it on for longer than recommended and use heat on it, but that&#x27;s par for the course when your hair is as dark as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I recommend doing half your head, and then letting it set, and then do the other half.</li>
<li> I used the dryer for 8 to 10 minutes, put it down for a bit, and used it for maybe another 10 minutes.</li>
<li> Kaleidocolors does tone down brass</li>
<li> but so did the other bleaches without zapping the holy life out of my hair!  </li>
<li> I have naturally black hair</li>
<li> According to google 4 tbsp is 2 oz which is just what the little packet calls for.</li>
<li> POOR lifting and the blue in the bleach will stain hair, clothes, everything.</li>
<li> Not orangey or green</li>
<li> While bleaching the second time, it turned a terrifying green color -- I assume as a result of the purple toner mixing with my yellow-orange hair -- but when I rinsed my hair out it was bleach-blonde and ready to be dyed again.&lt;br</li>
<li> but I hate that I have to have a certain amount of words to leave product reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I usually have ends breaking off after I bleach, but not with this product!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like how it goes on your hair and makes it very hard and tangly.</li>
<li> and wow, is it AWFUL.  </li>
<li> This is the worst bleach I have ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent and does what is was made to do. Yes I would not recommend based on my own experience. Fast shipping. Works great! Sorry you will see these same words any many of my reviews. I am a real person but I hate that I have to have a certain amount of words to leave product reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I give something five stars it is pretty obvious I like the damn product. I hope Amazon changes this policy.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do. Just remember to carefully read what the product will actually achieve. Kaleidocolors comes in several tones so be sure to select the right one for your hair procedure.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been processing my hair at home for years and years with this product. I use it with 30 volume developer as per the instructions on the Kaleidocolors mixing recipe (2 scoops per 1 oz of developer) and let it set under foils with heat. The brassiness of my naturally medium blond hair is completely toned down and out by this purple wonder. Have never had a reason to try anything else or to have a salon do it for me. It&#x27;s been foolproof for years for me. Good stuff if you want platinum, Marilyn-esque color without totally frying your hair to straw.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. Always great. arrived fast.</li>
    <li> The package says that it&#x27;s for use on lighter hair, but I used this on my dark brown, nearly-black hair with (non-Clairol) 30 developer  and it bleached my hair to a pale blonde. You&#x27;ll have to leave it on for longer than recommended and use heat on it, but that&#x27;s par for the course when your hair is as dark as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is supposed to be used on  untreated hair (but as I am obviously incapable of following any sort of directions) I used it a second time to bleach out the orange dye I had used, and it did the trick. While bleaching the second time, it turned a terrifying green color -- I assume as a result of the purple toner mixing with my yellow-orange hair -- but when I rinsed my hair out it was bleach-blonde and ready to be dyed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair was already a level 5 or 6 before I used this. I used with clairol pure white 10 volume developer. It did work thoroughly and quickly.  It lightened my hair to an 8 or 9 within 10-15 min. I don&#x27;t like how it goes on your hair and makes it very hard and tangly. Once I washed it out most of that was gone but it&#x27;s still kind of stiff.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple different brands of bleach on my blonde hair, but this one takes the cake! It doesn&#x27;t smell like bleach, it actually smells like berrys and the amount of damage to your hair is significantly less than normal bleach. I usually have ends breaking off after I bleach, but not with this product! Plus it also has a built in toner, which erases the additional step of toning- which is easier on your hair (especially if you bleach your hair continuously). It also only takes 10 minutes to develop, unlike usual bleach which is anywhere from 30-40. I don&#x27;t think I will switch bleach anymore, this is now my one and only choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps do not freak out because it is a bright blue/violet- that is the toner to take away the brassy yellow/orange and unwanted tones that normal hair pulls. It will not turn your hair blue or purple, just keep in mind it is only to be on your hair for ten minutes or so. I recommend doing half your head, and then letting it set, and then do the other half. This will not allow you to lose track of time and leave it in too long. I imagine if you leave it in your hair too long it might give you a blue or violet tint.</li>
    <li> This is the first haircolor product to get me back to the blonde I once was...love it, thank you...&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is a good product,  I have used it for many years &amp; have never had any complaints with it. It always gives good reliable results &amp; is easy to use.  It is available in 2 other colors of containers. each one giving different degrees of lightning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in pretty good time &amp; in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is not available in my town, I&#x27;m so glad I can buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but not my favorite, only because I need the 7 level lift, not the 4.  But this does it&#x27;s job very well.  I just need more power!  If you only need a bit of lift, this&#x27;ll work for you!!</li>
    <li> My hair was orange... I bleached it twice and used 40 developer. I wasn&#x27;t surprised because it always goes orange when I bleach it but usually the second time I get results... O well.</li>
    <li> This is the worst bleach I have ever used. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because idk if it&#x27;s the bleach or me, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the bleach. According to google 4 tbsp is 2 oz which is just what the little packet calls for. Well this is definitely NOT enough considering this product does NOT spread at all!!! I haven&#x27;t bleached my hair in a long time, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the other bleaches I&#x27;ve used lifted and spread so much better than this. Idk what happened or what I did wrong, but it did not lift my hair evenly even though I made sure to saturate it with 2 packs. It dries WAY too fast and I had to keep adding developer. It didn&#x27;t do much of anything and just damaged my hair. Definitely not using this again.</li>
    <li> Best bleach I have ever used, the color is perfect! Not orangey or green, nice. I used with loreal 30 developer and it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> NOT recommended. POOR lifting and the blue in the bleach will stain hair, clothes, everything. BE careful</li>
    <li> I have used this for years with 20 volume developer on my dishwater blonde hair and it works perfectly every time.</li>
    <li> I have medium brown hair that I have fully highlighted to a light blonde for over ten years.  My hair girl uses a different bleach every time to try out new stuff.  This last time she used this and wow, is it AWFUL.  My hair feels like straw and a crunchy hay bale.  I have never had this issue with the other bleaches.  Right after my appts I usually deep condition and it comes back to life over two days. Kaleidocolors does tone down brass but so did the other bleaches without zapping the holy life out of my hair!  What I do acknowledge is this stuff makes my blonde more cool in tone.  Like a Swedish blonde.  I like that aspect.  Also, I never do a full process b/c I like the natural brown tones of my original color coming through.  A full process probably would have made my hair fall out!  This stuff also takes longer to process.  Usually I don&#x27;t spend more than twenty min. after the last foil, waiting....but with this stuff, my hair girl said, &amp;#34;this stuff takes longer to work....&amp;#34; and we waited and waited....just long enough for every last oil to dry up and leave me!  Ugh...so girls, there are better ways to do this, in my opinion</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lighten up as well as it says, but I enjoy the purple undertones.</li>
    <li> This is the best I could find.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Seller!</li>
    <li> I think this is an excellent produce. Just remember to use heat with it, as per the instructions. I used it on my hair with foil, in very small - about 1/16th inch - sections, with pieces woven out of each section for a natural, sun-kissed look. It took me about 30 minutes to put in the foil. I was doing my own head, and that, for me, takes extra time. Once the foil was in I wrapped my head in plastic wrap and applied heat from an ordinary, hand-held hair dryer. I used the dryer for 8 to 10 minutes, put it down for a bit, and used it for maybe another 10 minutes. Though I hadn&#x27;t used this product before, I knew my hair was likely to take longer to process than suggested on the product instructions which say to use heat for 10 minutes. (I&#x27;ve had my hair highlighted before, both at home, and in a salon, and it always seems to take longer than the instructions suggest.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark blonde hair that had not been foiled or processed in any way throughout the length of the hair. The color lifted to almost white-blonde. Very natural as highlights. What was nice about the product is I do not think it begins to work until heat is applied. This means you get more even processing if you are doing something like a foil that takes quite a bit of time to put in properly.</li>
    <li> lightens great,fast,easy on scalp</li>
    <li> This product is really nice for lifting only 4 levels of hair color. The toner in it helps to neutralize my redness from bleaching. I have naturally black hair so 4 levels of pull isn&#x27;t enough for me. If you need to pull more color, I&#x27;d suggest a different product. Other than that, this stuff does exactly what is says it does.</li>
