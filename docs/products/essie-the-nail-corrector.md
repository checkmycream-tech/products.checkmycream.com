      <li>:).  </li>
      <li>It makes painting your nails quite easy because you can clean up your mistakes very fast with great results.</li>
      <li>, it makes it easy to get the polish out of cuticles</li>
      <li>I can get it off of their skin easily too.  </li>
      <li>This worked awesome only one time, the first time I used each tip.</li>
      <li>It works perfectly for cleaning up those little mistakes I often make when giving myself a manicure.</li>
      <li>Oh also, I really liked the polish remover that was in it, since most polish removers (even non-acetone, sensitive, moisturizing, etc.)</li>
      <li>It comes with three tips, and is already filled with nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>this beats using qtips to clean the polish on edges of my nails.</li>
      <li>I like this pen for getting close to the nail in clean up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this ESSIE correct her pen, I&#x27;ve tried other corrector pens before</li>
      <li>The only downside is that I really would&#x27;ve liked to be able to refill it.</li>
      <li>Favorite nail product by far!</li>
      <li>I liked that it came with an extra tip as well.</li>
      <li>then other corrector pens but overall I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
      <li>I do my own manicures and live the deep reds, purples and magentas.</li>
      <li>I also had to use multiple tips very quickly.</li>
      <li>this really doesnt work well at all.  </li>
      <li>This did not work very well for me.</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve given the Essie corrector pen a 5star except that after you use all the tips, I had to order a new pen!  </li>
      <li>I do not like the fact that once the refills are gone you have to buy a whole new pen</li>
      <li>This item is of high quality.</li>
      <li>This makes it so easy to remove the polish from skin and when I do other peoples nails</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use, and the tips can be used several times with the proper care.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that the item comes with a few extra tips, but when I first used this pen I was dissapointed: the tip wasn&#x27;t saturated enough with nail polish remover liquid</li>
      <li>I have trouble painting my nails on my right hand as I am right handed.</li>
      <li>Dried out very quickly.</li>
      <li>Between my 5 year old and dog I am always getting bumped while doing my nails</li>
      <li>This tool helps my manicures look professional</li>
      <li>so it was hard to clean the edges of my nails.</li>
      <li>It must have been sitting around too long and too old.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re using dark colors where polish in the cuticles is especially obvious this is really helpful.</li>

    <li> I do my own manicures and live the deep reds, purples and magentas. This tool helps my manicures look professional</li>
    <li> It was ok.  really needed to rub hard to remove any polish from my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice that the item comes with a few extra tips, but when I first used this pen I was dissapointed: the tip wasn&#x27;t saturated enough with nail polish remover liquid so it was hard to clean the edges of my nails.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these at a cosmetics store and I think it&#x27;s really great! It works perfectly for cleaning up those little mistakes I often make when giving myself a manicure. I liked that it came with an extra tip as well. The only downside is that I really would&#x27;ve liked to be able to refill it. Maybe it IS refillable and I just haven&#x27;t figured out how to do it. Oh also, I really liked the polish remover that was in it, since most polish removers (even non-acetone, sensitive, moisturizing, etc.) dry my hands out like crazy!</li>
    <li> Not refillable. Tip got dirty quickly. Does just an okay job of removing excess nail polish. I ended up buying a Stair Nail Pen-Style Polish Corrector that I like much better. I gave this one away.</li>
    <li> this really doesnt work well at all.  i went back to the pointed qtips and nail polish remover instead of this after a couple tries.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller.</li>
    <li> Favorite nail product by far! It is so easy to use, and the tips can be used several times with the proper care. Would recommend this product to any nail artist.</li>
    <li> Great product for getting a salon like finish on the nails.  It is a well kept secret at the nail spa.</li>

    <li> This item is of high quality. Excellently constructed, it is a perfect item to pack for traveling or just carry In a purse. And it works great!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Essie Nail Corrector Pen.  It is a timesaver for removing unwanted nail polish from skin.  This is a nail product that I will always include with my manicure items.  Love it and recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this ESSIE correct her pen, I&#x27;ve tried other corrector pens before and I haven&#x27;t had the great results as I&#x27;ve had with this. It comes with three tips, and is already filled with nail polish remover. It is a little bit more expensive then other corrector pens but overall I&#x27;m very happy with this. It makes painting your nails quite easy because you can clean up your mistakes very fast with great results.</li>
    <li> this beats using qtips to clean the polish on edges of my nails. Comes with 3 additional tips so works great! MUST HAVE if you do your own mani&#x27;s at home like me to save some $$$.</li>
    <li> This product is actually really good, ice used it before. However, the one I received was completely dried up and therefore useless. It must have been sitting around too long and too old.</li>
    <li> Dried out very quickly.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without the nail corrector pen. Between my 5 year old and dog I am always getting bumped while doing my nails and this defiantly comes in handy. I do not like the fact that once the refills are gone you have to buy a whole new pen but I did not want to subtract a star because of it. It is a five star product !</li>
    <li> This worked awesome only one time, the first time I used each tip. Once it gets polish on it it&#x27;s impossible to use again. Definitely won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This did not work very well for me. It helped remove some of my nail polish mistakes, but did not completely remove it from my skin. I also had to use multiple tips very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed this before.  If you are looking at this, buy it.  I try to get smudged nail polish off w a q-tip of cotton square or my finger but I ruin everything!  My niece, 9, loves to do nails and I got this for her too (I didn&#x27;t give it to her yet don&#x27;t tell :) ).  I use a lot of crazy colors that are obvious on cuticles.  This makes it so easy to remove the polish from skin and when I do other peoples nails I can get it off of their skin easily too.  I don&#x27;t know how I lived w/out this for so long! :).  Seriously it&#x27;s great, it makes it easy to get the polish out of cuticles and I&#x27;m an Essie girl.  If you&#x27;re using dark colors where polish in the cuticles is especially obvious this is really helpful.</li>
    <li> I have trouble painting my nails on my right hand as I am right handed. I seem to not be able to paint my nails without getting it on the edges of my nails. I like this pen for getting close to the nail in clean up. Q-tips don&#x27;t work as well as it spreads to the nail.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!  I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I even watched YouTube tutorials on how to use it.  Save your money.</li>
