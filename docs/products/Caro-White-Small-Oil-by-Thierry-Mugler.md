### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Good work done</li>
      <li>Good when used with the cream.</li>
      <li>This oil surprisingly works well.</li>
      <li>Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Very light and not greasy.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>This oil is ok.</li>
      <li>However I love this oil.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Best lotion ever just like the one I buy back home</li>
      <li>To me, the cream does a better job then the oil.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>But I did use Retin A 1.0% for good peeling with it and noticed that my new skin wasn&#x27;t redarkening like it does if I use RA alone.</li>
      <li>My complexion is brighter and blemish free all over.</li>
      <li>but eh, nothing special.</li>
      <li>it leaves the body feeling nice n soft....</li>
      <li>After getting a super tan I decided to try it because of the reviews and affordable price.</li>
      <li>but again, if you know you have sensitive skin, stick with Vitamin C serum, works a lot better without the rash.</li>
      <li>I received it right on the nose.</li>
      <li>have heard that Caro White is inferior to Caro Light which is the original product, so perhaps I&#x27;ll try that instead.</li>
      <li>Amazing, a little sticky but it works so well with the carowhite cream.</li>
      <li>Very oily</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much change...</li>
      <li>The star was for really fast delivery</li>
      <li>This has worked really well so far.</li>
      <li>I cant say whether it works or not simply as I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing, not too greasy if used moderately.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin in any way, don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
      <li>I also dislike the smell of it and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>

<li> The first time I used it, my face flushed within minutes, at first I thought ok its a hot day, maybe its that, and decided to use it for a few days and see what happened, but by the end of the second day, not only was the flushing getting worse each time I put it on, but I then started breaking out in a bad rash which is only now starting to clear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Not sure I mixed it with 55H+</li>
<li> 50ML IS JUST TOO LITTLE.</li>
<li> Been using this oil in conjunction with a lightening lotion for a month and have seen little to no changes in skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> but unfortunately my skin was sensitive to this product.</li>
<li> pale complexions, maybe not,</li>
<li> but maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong but for now, I do not recommend it.</li>
<li> It makes my hands feel dirty.</li>
<li> I used the oil on my arms and broke out in a really bad rash that lasted for almost a week.</li>

    <li> The star was for really fast delivery but unfortunately my skin was sensitive to this product. I used the oil on my arms and broke out in a really bad rash that lasted for almost a week.</li>
    <li> Very light and not greasy. Good when used with the cream.</li>
    <li> Works! Lightened my skin a couple shades already.. I like to bleach as an African-American woman....</li>
    <li> it leaves the body feeling nice n soft.... i just wish it came in a larger bottle.. will order again</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin in any way, don&#x27;t use this product. I cant say whether it works or not simply as I wasn&#x27;t able to use it long enough. The first time I used it, my face flushed within minutes, at first I thought ok its a hot day, maybe its that, and decided to use it for a few days and see what happened, but by the end of the second day, not only was the flushing getting worse each time I put it on, but I then started breaking out in a bad rash which is only now starting to clear.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if its suited to already- pale complexions, maybe not, but again, if you know you have sensitive skin, stick with Vitamin C serum, works a lot better without the rash.</li>
    <li> I received it right on the nose. Good work done</li>
    <li> I did see a different in my skin by using this product .</li>
    <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
    <li> This oil surprisingly works well. After getting a super tan I decided to try it because of the reviews and affordable price. But I did use Retin A 1.0% for good peeling with it and noticed that my new skin wasn&#x27;t redarkening like it does if I use RA alone. Very moisturizing, not too greasy if used moderately.</li>
    <li> Very oily but I like it</li>
    <li> Been using this oil in conjunction with a lightening lotion for a month and have seen little to no changes in skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that Caro White is inferior to Caro Light which is the original product, so perhaps I&#x27;ll try that instead.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT BUT IF ONLY IT COMES IN A BIGGER BOTTLE. 50ML IS JUST TOO LITTLE.</li>
    <li> Amazing, a little sticky but it works so well with the carowhite cream. It strengthens it.</li>
    <li> I mix this with the carowhite lotion and cream seperatly. I love this it gives the lotion and cream a boost. I love this product. I must say I am a mac shade nc45 but I am trying to get rid of a permatan. This has worked really well so far. My complexion is brighter and blemish free all over. I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: If you are wondering this is by dreams caro white not angel but it works the same.</li>
    <li> Not sure I mixed it with 55H+</li>
    <li> I could use a bigger bottle. 50ml for that price is abit steep. However I love this oil.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much change...</li>
    <li> This oil is ok. I do not like the feeling of it when I put it on. It makes my hands feel dirty. I also dislike the smell of it and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. I&#x27;ve tried to combine it with the cream but eh, nothing special. To me, the cream does a better job then the oil. I do not recommend the oil but maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong but for now, I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever just like the one I buy back home</li>
