      <li>I use this brush cleaner on the brushes in my vacuum cleaners, great product.</li>

      <li>Works very effectively removing hair from brushes, particularly when used frequently.</li>
      <li>I figured someone has to have invented a gadget to clean brushes, and I was right.</li>
      <li>It is very sturdy and strong.  </li>
      <li>This is TOTALLY worth the price.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now instead of throwing out my $25 Olivia hair brush, I&#x27;m able to clean it and make it last</li>
      <li>Got reinirsemt didn&#x27;t get right product</li>
      <li>Much faster than using a comb to clean the bristles.  </li>
      <li>The trick is to clean as much as you can while dry then soak the brush in warm soapy water and start cleaning again.  </li>
      <li>Easily cleaned my round hair brush as well as the dog brush and was easy to clean after the dog brushes with a a bit of rag with antibacterial on it.</li>
      <li>This saves you from wasting time trying to clean hairs out of your brush, or giving up and throwing the hair filled brush out entirely.</li>
      <li>Soaking in hot water, using scissors to try to cut off the hair wrapped around the barrel, etc.  </li>
      <li>Much better and easier than the smaller ones.</li>
      <li>Even wading it in hot water doesn&#x27;t dislodge the debris.  </li>
      <li>This thing got most of the hair out with the big end</li>
      <li>Will buy more in the future</li>
      <li>First soak your brushes in Dawn liquid.  </li>
      <li>After using this for the first time, you will wonder how you ever lived without it.</li>
      <li>First things first, mine had a bright blue handle, not white as in the photo online.</li>
      <li>In real life this product looks cheaply made, so I was surprised at how well it works.</li>
      <li>I let my brushes go too long so now that i have this tool, I will stay on top of it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this after spending the better part of 30 minutes cleaning a boar bristle brush that I had let go for too long.  </li>
      <li>It sounds strange but if you give this to someone as a gift this will soon turn into that favorite gift they can&#x27;t imagine living without.</li>
      <li>Only downside is the wires bend and fall out fairly easily, so it will probably need replacing periodically.</li>
      <li>Using a little warm water and shampoo combined with this, and it even gets all the lint/gunk that builds up.</li>
      <li>This side can really get into and pull out the lint.</li>
      <li>You just really have to work at it.  </li>
      <li>the plastic bottles are a definite plus for their light weight and unbreakable</li>
      <li>Big and strong enough to clean any brush.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love, love, love this product.  So simple yet so useful.  I don&#x27;t think my husband has ever cleaned his brush but now thanks to this little gadget, it&#x27;s spotless!</li>
    <li> Works better than just using a comb. Using a little warm water and shampoo combined with this, and it even gets all the lint/gunk that builds up.</li>
    <li> Works well to get hair out of a brush with traditional soft bristles.  Great for my dog&#x27;s brush. Does not get rid of the fuzzies that accumulate at the base of each bristle.  What is that stuff: oil and dust?</li>
    <li> Brush cleaner.  Somewhat disappointed because the packaging caused the wire cleaning parts to be bent when received.  Not worth the hassle of returning product.</li>
    <li> Genius to clean any type of brush</li>
    <li> First things first, mine had a bright blue handle, not white as in the photo online. In real life this product looks cheaply made, so I was surprised at how well it works. Using this brush took me a total of 1 minute: 15 seconds to rake my hairbrush with the big side, 15 seconds to rake my hairbrush with the smaller / finer side, and then 30 seconds to clean the brush cleaner itself. It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried to clean my hairbrush with. I highly recommend this product in order to extend the life of your hairbrush.</li>
    <li> This is great i clean all my brushes with no hard work at all. Really happy with this its a real must have.</li>
    <li> So easy to clean my brushes.  I have super long hair and I also loose just as much. LOL..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on all types of brushes. It does a great job cleaning the hair out of your brush without causing damage. It&#x27;s a solid yet flexible brush.</li>
    <li> This is TOTALLY worth the price.  If I added up how many hair brushes I&#x27;ve thrown away because of not being able to clean them, the price would far exceed what I paid for this cleaner!  Get it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Works well but I was under the impression I was getting a white one, since that&#x27;s what&#x27;s pictured but it&#x27;s a really ugly powder blue.  Ick</li>
    <li> I use this brush cleaner on the brushes in my vacuum cleaners, great product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful to clean brushes with.</li>
    <li> Love it! Will buy more in the future</li>
    <li> There must be something wrong with me I look like I am the only person that didn&#x27;t think this product was great. I read all the reviews on this and they were great so i ordered it.  It is a lot biger than i thought it would be but the size may be listed and i just over looked it. I couldn&#x27;t wait to clean my brush and it didn&#x27;t have a lot of hair in it. This thing got most of the hair out with the big end but when i got through most of the rake things were bent all kind of ways and i didn&#x27;t do it hard I tried to push them back like they went but they just stay like they were. then i tried to use the small end to get the dust and lint out and it didn&#x27;t do anything. and the worst part was getting the hair off the big end when i got through cleaning the brush it stuck to the little rake things and didn&#x27;t want to come off. It must be me because everybody else loved this thing but I think i do better and a lot less trouble just using my comb to get the hair out of my brushes.maybe i just got a lemon i realy don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Such a clever little device, using it all over the house to detangle pet brushes and clean our vacuum brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this brush cleaner. It&#x27;s perfect for everyday use. I don&#x27;t use the bigger bristles though. It&#x27;s just easier to use the smaller bristles. Saves a step. Between this and monthly soak in gentle shampoo, my brush is better than ever!</li>
    <li> This has always been described as looking a little ugly but working fantastically and it is oh so true.  I had two different types of hairbrushes that I have been trying forever to get all the hair out.  I have had some medical issues so I was loosing a lot of hair for awhile and it clogged up all my brushes.  A plastic tip vented hairbrush th and a smaller metal round hairbrush that was hopeless clogged.  This great brush cleaner helped me loosen that tightly wound fine hair and pull it out in clumps so that I was able to throw it away.  It also clean the vents of all the hair build up in there.  Trust me, I have used everything from professionally soaking it in chemicals to loosen up hair and then broken combs trying to pull hair off and this is the BEST! BEST! BEST! So if you can relate buy this immediately.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush cleaner!</li>
    <li> Works very effectively removing hair from brushes, particularly when used frequently. Only downside is the wires bend and fall out fairly easily, so it will probably need replacing periodically. That said it is very reasonably priced and not much of a deterrent given how well it works.</li>
    <li> Easily cleaned my round hair brush as well as the dog brush and was easy to clean after the dog brushes with a a bit of rag with antibacterial on it.</li>
    <li> I love to add syrup to my coffee...the plastic bottles are a definite plus for their light weight and unbreakable</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought one of these years ago.  It is much larger than I expected.  That is not a problem, just different.</li>
    <li> It really works to get all the hair out of your brushes including the little fuzz balls that gather at the base of the bristles. Then you can clean your brush by your preferred method. It&#x27;s very sturdy and seems like it will last for years. This is easy and almost fun to use!</li>
    <li> Husband says this is one great brush cleaner. Nuff said!!</li>
    <li> Got reinirsemt didn&#x27;t get right product</li>
    <li> This was bigger than I was expecting, although I don&#x27;t know if the size is in the description and I just missed it, but it&#x27;s about 9&amp;#34; long.  It works well to get the hair out, but I was hoping for something to get the little lint/dust pieces and get around each bristle and it didn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
    <li> at first it looks like a strange contraption but it&#x27;s wonderful to use. other girls borrow it from me to clean their hair brushes as well. easily gets hair and lint out</li>
    <li> I generally use round, vented brushes, which love to grab shoulder length hair.  They are ridiculously difficult to clean... But this handy, dandy device is great.  It really does the job - even on round brushes.  All my hairbrushes are squeaky clean!  Love this thing.</li>
    <li> I use this on a natural bristle brush where it&#x27;s great at removing the bits of lint that seem to get stuck on the brush.  But where this cleaner is best, is when the brush has those little plastic tips on metal bristles that collect lint balls at the base which are impossible to remove.  The trick is to clean as much as you can while dry then soak the brush in warm soapy water and start cleaning again.  The lint balls will go away (with some effort) and your brush will be like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush cleaner has two sides but the only side that is really useful is the smaller end with stiffer wires crammed closer together.  This side can really get into and pull out the lint.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It surpassed my expectations!</li>
    <li> I adore this little tool! It&#x27;s handy and nifty, and works very well. After using this for the first time, you will wonder how you ever lived without it. You know how you use your comb to clean out your brushes sometimes, but it takes forever? This saves you from wasting time trying to clean hairs out of your brush, or giving up and throwing the hair filled brush out entirely. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this brush cleaner for a different purpose, not to clean a hairbrush.  I use it to remove the fibers and lint from the rug bristle-brush on my vacuum.  It works beautifully and removes 100% of the fibers/lint very quickly and easily.  Much faster than using a comb to clean the bristles.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product, and glad I purchased it.  It is very sturdy and strong.  I&#x27;m sure it will last a very long time, maybe longer than me!!  Love it.  Recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the SECOND TIME I was sent a blue tool instead of the white shown on the website.  Other than that disappointment, this cleaner is superior to the Denman in the way it works.</li>
    <li> GREAT product to have!</li>
    <li> Love it! Best hair brush cleaner I ever bought. Much better and easier than the smaller ones.</li>
    <li> wonderful to remove dog hair from brushes</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see the size of this brush.  Big and strong enough to clean any brush.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> clean up is now beezy</li>
    <li> My brushes were filling up with my hair all over. I had no idea how to go about and clean them. This double sided rake is just perfect for all of my brushes. Super quick and easy, and it&#x27;s all clean now. I love it. It&#x27;s well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Needs patience but works well.  Wish I found this sooner as I just wasted $10 for a different one that I couldn&#x27;t return.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it does.  No more breaking combs for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this after spending the better part of 30 minutes cleaning a boar bristle brush that I had let go for too long.  I figured someone has to have invented a gadget to clean brushes, and I was right.</li>
    <li> I use the medium sized Olivia combo ion brush and it&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I use a good bit of product on my frizzy wavy hair to get it smooth and shiny, so I end up with lots of hair and product caked up on my brushes.  I have tried cleaning them in many different ways to little or no avail.  Soaking in hot water, using scissors to try to cut off the hair wrapped around the barrel, etc.  This Olivia product made my \\&quot;clogged up\\&quot; brush look BRAND NEW in about five minutes.  The design is genius and unlike any other product I have seen.  I could not believe the results.  Now instead of throwing out my $25 Olivia hair brush, I&#x27;m able to clean it and make it last indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW UPDATE: I found a new AMAZING use for this tool! I have a professional hair dryer with a screen-type filter cap on the back.  Of course it gets clogged with lint and dust and the holes in the plastic cap are so small it&#x27;s hard to get into the holes to clean out the lint.  Even wading it in hot water doesn&#x27;t dislodge the debris.  This smaller end of this tool instantly will clean out all lint by the individual tines working their way down into the areas to clean.  It took 1 minute to totally clean the filter better than when. Spent 15 minutes with tweezers trying to clean out each opening.  I would buy this tool,again at double the price.  It&#x27;s well-designed and well made and feels so substantial that it will probably last forever. Unfortunately for the Olivia company, I won&#x27;t be buying new brushes as frequently now that I can clean the \\&quot;gunked up\\&quot; ones to be like new.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this! It works great on all different types of brushes. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice for getting to the bottom of the brush for cleaning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great tool to clean your brushes.  You just really have to work at it.  I let my brushes go too long so now that i have this tool, I will stay on top of it.  I used this tool combined with a razer blade to get the little dust balls off of the bristles that have knobs on the end.  First soak your brushes in Dawn liquid.  Then use the tool with the razor blade.</li>
    <li> I wish I had purchased one of these earlier - I didn&#x27;t even know they existed.  I used to take scissors through my combs and brushes to clean them, but this makes short work of cleaning the hair out.</li>
    <li> Who knew I&#x27;d love such a weird item? It cleaned all the hair from my brush in nothing flat.  I accidentally ordered two, so I gave one to my sister.  Great invention.</li>
    <li> Amazing little thingamabob! Just wonderful. Ugly packaging. Would have liked it to have been in a plastic protector or shell. This goofy looking thing works like a charm. I&#x27;m not losing this for anything in the world. This is the kind of goodie that all your friends &amp; family we&#x27;ll &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; and never want to return. It sounds strange but if you give this to someone as a gift this will soon turn into that favorite gift they can&#x27;t imagine living without.</li>
    <li> Works great, I love it!!</li>
