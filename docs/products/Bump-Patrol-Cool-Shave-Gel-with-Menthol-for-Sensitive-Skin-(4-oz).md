      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent and effective product for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Best price so far I have found.</li>
      <li>Cool and refreshing and does a great job reducing irritation and bumps.</li>

      <li>100 times better than can gel and</li>

      <li>He loves the cool Gel!</li>
      <li>Great product, better than using regular shave gel.</li>
      <li>For more than five years, this clear shaving gel has been my favorite!</li>
      <li>My bumps have now vanished and I get a pain-free smooth shave each time.</li>
      <li>The gel itself has a light, but refreshingly clean scent.</li>
      <li>I use this gel with Bump Patrol Intensive Aftershave Treatment (original formula).</li>
      <li>I decided that if I were to actually clean my skin, hairs and pores while shaving I might as well try this shave gel.</li>
      <li>It helps to ensure a clean, close, shave, without irritation.</li>
      <li>I have used Cool Shave Gel for two years now.</li>
      <li>At first I recieved the item as a pack of 2 and when I got it, it was not shipped in a secure shipping box, it was taped together and thrown into a bag to be sent off.</li>
      <li>The scent is pretty mild, almost non-existant (and I like that).</li>
      <li>I cant comment on exactly how much this helps reduce bumps, but in conjunction with my safety razor and face wash, I have reduced my bumps significantly.</li>
      <li>Just enough lather to see where it is applied, slick coating for smooth and safe scalp shaving in the shower - good stuff</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>but I know my dad was prone to bumps at first because of his skin</li>
      <li>Man it really does chill your skin out!</li>
      <li>price and value here on Amazon is reasonable, but your best value is probably via Wal-Mart or walmart.com, where you can find this same item sold individually for only $2.36 (plus $3.95 shipping if buying online).</li>
      <li>product works great for me as I use it to shave my entire head, face and neck every other day.</li>
      <li>It really coats the area well and leaves a tingly, refesshing feel afterwards.</li>
      <li>Works very well for shave gel.</li>
      <li>And I actually really like it.</li>
      <li>; I also use a lotion called &amp;#34;bump stopper 2&amp;#34;for my after shave lotion&amp;#34; it works very well in tandem with this shaving gel. . .</li>
      <li>Thanks,</li>
      <li>I use Gillette and was using their normal shaving gel at first and then used Bump Patrol</li>
      <li>These shaving gel tubes may have fewer ounces than others you&#x27;d see on a store shelf, but when you use this product as directed, it will outlast other shaving creams/gels by many days, if not weeks, depending on your shaving habits.</li>
      <li>Great product, only need a small amount to produce lather.</li>
      <li>My husband has very sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS COMPANY AND</li>
      <li>and it is maximized even more when you use it on a shave brush since no gel is wasted on rinsing excess off of your hands and fingers.</li>
      <li>and it beats normal shaving cream.</li>
      <li>it is not available in most of the chain stores listed on the website.  </li>
      <li>so I use a brush and lather it right back up.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fairly new at shaving</li>
      <li>The bottoms of both gel containers blow out, (probably due to having heavier items stacked on top of it), and the entire bag was soaked in the sticky shave gel.</li>
      <li>At first they asked me to advise them on how I wanted to get compensated back.</li>
      <li>I can shave in the bikini area everyday during pool season (which is all year round because I own 5 properties in Florida, don&#x27;t be a hater!) and not get any bumps.  </li>
      <li>I use this when shaving b/c i have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Like if your shaving the left side of your face the right side will loose</li>
      <li>A month later, after I TOLD them I had thrown everything away because it was distroyed and a huge mess, NOW they want me to send them back the damaged product</li>
      <li>If you try this stuff you will never go back to your old shave cream.</li>

<li> During use, should the lather on your skin appear to be wearing thin, just apply a little bit of water to your face or shave brush to re-lather, without the need for adding new gel!</li>
<li> Only received 3 and of those three two were broken and empty.</li>
<li> and so am I. Being 18 and having bumps is not cool, but using this changes that.</li>
<li> I have always used Gillete Fusion razors but felt as if I was missing something.</li>
<li> Goes on thick...</li>
<li> Very small amount is required.</li>
<li> Even with the expensive Fusion Razors always had in-growns.</li>
<li> Very terrible managment, terrible customer service and terrible idea to have sent a fragil item in a bag and not a box.</li>

    <li> For more than five years, this clear shaving gel has been my favorite! The gel itself has a light, but refreshingly clean scent. These shaving gel tubes may have fewer ounces than others you&#x27;d see on a store shelf, but when you use this product as directed, it will outlast other shaving creams/gels by many days, if not weeks, depending on your shaving habits. Just a little bit goes a long way...and it is maximized even more when you use it on a shave brush since no gel is wasted on rinsing excess off of your hands and fingers. During use, should the lather on your skin appear to be wearing thin, just apply a little bit of water to your face or shave brush to re-lather, without the need for adding new gel! I keep adding water during the entire shaving process, ultimately using only a tiny fraction of an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price and value here on Amazon is reasonable, but your best value is probably via Wal-Mart or walmart.com, where you can find this same item sold individually for only $2.36 (plus $3.95 shipping if buying online). [4/29/15]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great for me as I use it to shave my entire head, face and neck every other day. I use this gel with Bump Patrol Intensive Aftershave Treatment (original formula). The two are made for each other. Both are designed to help heal and prevent razor bumps. Using these products has made a noticeable difference for me. Bump Patrol is &amp;#34;Dermatologist Approved, Barber Recommended.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have found.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head in the shower.  This is the best I have come across and it beats normal shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Great product and it arrived in a timely manner</li>
    <li> Perfect! the only product to solve my razor bumps</li>
    <li> My husband has very sensitive skin! He loves the cool Gel!</li>
    <li> Great product and it arrived on time</li>
    <li> Meets and exceeds expectations.  My Brother uses this and likes it.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time and feels great when shaving, bump fighter razor works well with this.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and works great, rinses well.  This is a product I would recommend.  Shame it is not available in most of the chain stores listed on the website.  Good for Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neville</li>
    <li> The closest and most comfortable shave ever!!!! No nicks or cuts at all.</li>
    <li> My neck breaks out with almost every other shaving cream. Using Bump Patrol and the same shaving technique, I have no problems.</li>
    <li> Cool and refreshing and does a great job reducing irritation and bumps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new at shaving but I know my dad was prone to bumps at first because of his skin and so am I. Being 18 and having bumps is not cool, but using this changes that. I use Gillette and was using their normal shaving gel at first and then used Bump Patrol After Shave. I decided that if I were to actually clean my skin, hairs and pores while shaving I might as well try this shave gel. And I actually really like it. It smells shockingly really good too. Like a smooth lotion almost after, and it clears up so you can see where and what you are shaving which makes it that much better. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to someone if they asked on what shaving gel to choose.</li>
    <li> Just enough lather to see where it is applied, slick coating for smooth and safe scalp shaving in the shower - good stuff</li>
    <li> Works great, smooth shaving, I&#x27;d buy this again!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, and am very happy to get a product I like and would recommend to any black man. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 6 years now, takes only a few drops and has no sent. 100 times better than can gel and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Had this send overseas to an APO, package arrived in perfect condition. Best price so far I have found.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving gel I have found. After trying other products and shaving for 40 years, I would not consider using anything else.</li>
    <li> Good product. Thanks,</li>
    <li> Great product, only need a small amount to produce lather.</li>
    <li> Different products work for different people. This product reduces skin irritation and bumps.  I&#x27;ve tried using several products (shave gel, etc.) and no luck until I tried this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He says it works great.  It eliminated those white bumps on his face from shaving.  He uses it with BP after shave treatment.</li>
    <li> been using this  for years great product</li>
    <li> HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS COMPANY AND ALL THE HEADACHES I&#x27;VE BEEN THROUGH WITH THEM SINCE AUGUST! (Today is 10/16/2013). At first I recieved the item as a pack of 2 and when I got it, it was not shipped in a secure shipping box, it was taped together and thrown into a bag to be sent off. That would have been great had the item been a shirt or something that wasn&#x27;t in a container. The bottoms of both gel containers blow out, (probably due to having heavier items stacked on top of it), and the entire bag was soaked in the sticky shave gel. I&#x27;ve been trying to recieve a refund, some sort of compensation or something and all I keep running into with this company is excuse after excuse. At first they asked me to advise them on how I wanted to get compensated back. I made a requested and it was denied. Then asked to get my money back, and was denied once again. I sent pictures, wrote emails back and forth, gave my phone number to them and all its been is a fiasco and not one person knows whats going on over there. Over a month later I demanded my money back, sent pictures of the damaged product and said, they would pay me back once they recieved the damaged product back. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? A month later, after I TOLD them I had thrown everything away because it was distroyed and a huge mess, NOW they want me to send them back the damaged product or else they wouldn&#x27;t pay me back?!?!? Very terrible managment, terrible customer service and terrible idea to have sent a fragil item in a bag and not a box. Never do business with this company.</li>
    <li> I have used Cool Shave Gel for two years now. My bumps have now vanished and I get a pain-free smooth shave each time. This is an excellent and effective product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Very small amount is required. I have always used Gillete Fusion razors but felt as if I was missing something. Even with the expensive Fusion Razors always had in-growns. Bought the shave cream along with the after shave (a must have to minimize bumps). Only drawback to the after shave is that it dried my left hand that I use to apply it, but it does not have that effect on my face or neck. I now only place a dab of the after shave on the tip of my fingers and apply.  I also apply on the back side of my neck to eliminate any bumps as I also shave my head every morning. Overall an excellent product.</li>
    <li> The only shave gel I will use.  I can shave in the bikini area everyday during pool season (which is all year round because I own 5 properties in Florida, don&#x27;t be a hater!) and not get any bumps.  I am 58 yrs. old and can still wear a suit that shows a little skin and by golly, I sure as heck don&#x27;t want to put up with shaving bumps.  Walmart used to carry this product, but stopped.  Big mistake on their part!</li>
    <li> Works very well for shave gel. Especially with electric razors. It helps to ensure a clean, close, shave, without irritation.</li>
    <li> Ordered 4 tubes. Only received 3 and of those three two were broken and empty.</li>
    <li> regular item that i use.</li>
    <li> Prevents razor nicks and burn. Requires just a tiny bit for use. Can relubricate with same dose to get even closer.&lt;br /&gt;Best product on the market that I have found.</li>
    <li> Lathers great with a brush...  Goes on thick... I will say that it does have a issue with staying lathered up once on the skin after about a minute or so. Like if your shaving the left side of your face the right side will loose it&#x27;s lather so I use a brush and lather it right back up.  But it&#x27;s NOT a big deal to me at all. I don&#x27;t mind. My favorite part about this product is how well the menthol works. Man it really does chill your skin out! I LOVE IT! WHICH HELPS KEEP ANY AND ALL RAZOR BURN IN CHECK!&lt;br /&gt;LISTEN UP&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; I also use a lotion called &amp;#34;bump stopper 2&amp;#34;for my after shave lotion&amp;#34; it works very well in tandem with this shaving gel. . . So def check it out. AND START SHAVING WITH A BRUSH IF YOU DONT ALREADY! HELPS BIG TIME WITH RAZOR BURN, AND INGROWN HAIRS!!! &amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; TRY IT!</li>
    <li> Great product, better than using regular shave gel. It cleared my skin up in a week!</li>
    <li> I cant comment on exactly how much this helps reduce bumps, but in conjunction with my safety razor and face wash, I have reduced my bumps significantly. I love the cool feeling and good lather (I apply with a boars hair shaving brush). The scent is pretty mild, almost non-existant (and I like that). I am a new wet shaver, so take this review with a grain of salt (the only other thing I used was shaving soap that came with my kit).</li>
    <li> very good product. i like %11</li>
    <li> I use this when shaving b/c i have sensitive skin. It really coats the area well and leaves a tingly, refesshing feel afterwards. I can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> This gel is non foaming and provide the perfect amount of lubrication for shaving your face or head. If you try this stuff you will never go back to your old shave cream.</li>
