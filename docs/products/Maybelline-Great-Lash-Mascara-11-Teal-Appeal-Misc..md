      <li>Quality not the best expected from your company...</li>
      <li>As with most mascara, it&#x27;s not as bold as in any of its lovely ads, but for reality&#x27;s sake, reality was still pretty nice.</li>
      <li>The item was shipped to me very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I am a blonde &amp; have light brown lashes show it shows up great.</li>

      <li>great mascara but color is darker than expected</li>
      <li>The mascara is easy to apply and really highlights my eye color!  </li>
      <li>I love the brilliant teal green of this particular shade of mascara.</li>
      <li>I am a loyal maybelline mascara user.</li>
      <li>I have light brownish red eyelashes so the color shows nicely.</li>
      <li>Bet it would  look great alone over dark eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Still very pretty.</li>
      <li>I love this new color of Maybelline (teal appeal).</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve been told I have \\&quot;amazing blue</li>
      <li>and it only shows in bright white light.</li>
      <li>My lashes are a little bit darker, even though I&#x27;m blonde, but after a couple of coats, the color came out very nice and looks interesting.</li>
      <li>and it came super fast in the mail deff recommend.</li>
      <li>I have yet to try the red mascara for Aradia, but I&#x27;m sure it would work just as well.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for in mascara.</li>
      <li>Thanks Maybelline!</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more of this....</li>
      <li>This is so pretty and very teal.</li>
      <li>Stays on all day easily washes off instantly with soap and water.</li>
      <li>Wish their dark mascaras were made of the same great formula.  </li>

      <li>it worked better than I expected!</li>
      <li>packaging older in nature.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend...</li>
      <li>Never saw teal in any store, rarely can I find blue mascara.  </li>
      <li>The three or four times I have purchased, most if not all were very dried out.</li>
      <li>As above, the teal color is great and difficult to come by.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a little dark, which is okay for me, because I&#x27;m using it for cosplay and it needs to be a specific color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing that this is generally the same as the \\&quot;Totally</li>

    <li> i was looking for the perfect color mascara and now i got it.  i will buy another for my friends</li>
    <li> Very Teal. I&#x27;ll probably put dark brown mascara underneath, as I have white eyelashes. Bet it would  look great alone over dark eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Stays on all day easily washes off instantly with soap and water. Purple and blue are great too.  Wish their dark mascaras were made of the same great formula.  Highly recommend...</li>
    <li> I like the color and have used Maybelline for years. This did cause irritation to my eyes, but I don&#x27;t know if it is the color or that I have used a different mascara lately.  Still very pretty.</li>
    <li> I try never to be ordinary &amp; I&#x27;ve been told I have \\&quot;amazing blue eyes\\&quot;. I have worn Maybelline Royal Blue for years. Then I found this beauitful color at my local store last year. It is Awesome! I am a blonde &amp; have light brown lashes show it shows up great. It does not work well on darker lashes,tho. I give it 5 Stars!! Thanks Maybelline!</li>
    <li> Amazing for girls with blond eyelashes &amp;#34;A+&amp;#34; rating from first time use it goes on good and pigmented on the first application</li>
    <li> Looove it !! Great fun color and it came super fast in the mail deff recommend.I can&#x27;t to rock my lashes next time I go out.</li>
    <li> I am a loyal maybelline mascara user. I was very excited to find this. I wear it with a teal eyeliner no eyeshadow and it looks amazing. I have light brownish red eyelashes so the color shows nicely. I bought the purple as well and plan on getting the blue next.</li>
    <li> As above, the teal color is great and difficult to come by.  The price was excellent.  The mascara is easy to apply and really highlights my eye color!  The item was shipped to me very quickly.  Very high quality service.</li>
    <li> great mascara but color is darker than expected</li>
    <li> love this maybelline mascara</li>
    <li> okay...packaging older in nature. reconsider dealing with this person in the future.  Quality not the best expected from your company...</li>
    <li> i used this mascara at my sisters bridal shower. her colors were purple and teal so it went along with the decor</li>
    <li> I like this mascara, it is however a little too dark for my taste. It looks like it&#x27;s black with a tint of teal. I used to have a bright colored teal mascara before but I can&#x27;t seem to find it. This was not quite what I was looking for, but it works for now.</li>
    <li> item arrived on time and as expected</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for in mascara. Came in new, unopened packaging and was the teal green color described on the product information. When applied to my dark brown/black lashes, it looks sorta mint green &amp; it rocks when out in full sunlight. Will definitely buy more of this....</li>
    <li> I should know better than to purchase mascara from Amazon. The three or four times I have purchased, most if not all were very dried out. I like the color.............</li>
    <li> I love this new color of Maybelline (teal appeal). I was excited when I seen it. I&#x27;ve looked in stores and can&#x27;t find the teal appeal color. I would buy this color again and again. Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m guessing that this is generally the same as the \\&quot;Totally Teal\\&quot; color that Maybelline is advertising presently. My mom managed to find it at a drugstore after us searching forever at Target and Wegmans, and I was excited to try it. I&#x27;ve got to say, it worked better than I expected! My lashes are a little bit darker, even though I&#x27;m blonde, but after a couple of coats, the color came out very nice and looks interesting. As with most mascara, it&#x27;s not as bold as in any of its lovely ads, but for reality&#x27;s sake, reality was still pretty nice.</li>
    <li> Never saw teal in any store, rarely can I find blue mascara.  I like to use the same color mascara as the clothes I&#x27;m wearing. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> It goes on well but you cant really tell its teal and it is reallllllly dark not like to the picture on the package</li>
    <li> I love the brilliant teal green of this particular shade of mascara.</li>
    <li> if you have dark brown lashes, this takes 10 or so coats to show up the slightest bit blue. and it only shows in bright white light.</li>
    <li> This is so pretty and very teal. Looks great on and does not clump. This is a quality product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as light as you would think. It turned out to be a dark blue</li>
    <li> Eeee. This stuff goes on well and it&#x27;s a little dark, which is okay for me, because I&#x27;m using it for cosplay and it needs to be a specific color. If you want something lighter then I&#x27;d recommend something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see the color is darker (sorry for lighting/bad quality)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://imgur.com/5n7ZqQO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Using it for Vriska Serket cosplay, if anyone was wondering. I have yet to try the red mascara for Aradia, but I&#x27;m sure it would work just as well.</li>
    <li> The packaging was intact but beaten up and looked like it had been sitting around for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gotten the courage to try the mascara yet.</li>
