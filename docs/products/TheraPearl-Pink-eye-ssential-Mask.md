      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>My dog is adorable though</li>
      <li>it has a thicker, better strap and can be heated.      </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not as perfect as other models out there where the &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; of it that presses against you is more pliable.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use, and it&#x27;d held up to multi-month use.</li>
      <li>The mask Doesn&#x27;t stay cool for more than 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>The portion that covers the eyes and raised, so this makes it comfortable without it feeling like it is pressing on your eyes.</li>
      <li>It freezes really quickly, it is so easy to clean</li>
      <li>They sent us a free pack to try.</li>
      <li>Of course it makes it easier to sleep, because it blocks out all light.</li>
      <li>The woman on the phone was very nice and friendly and we corrected the problem and I got the product 2 days later.  </li>
      <li>I also have a small head and find the elastic a perfect size to secure it.</li>
      <li>and it stays cool for over 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Comfortable to use the first time.</li>
      <li>I used this eye mask post-surgery and it is really outstanding -- far superior to those blue gel masks.  </li>
      <li>My doctor recommended a simple warm wash cloth.</li>
      <li>I also have 2 TheraPearl neck/shoulder packs for keeping me cool during our hot summers.</li>
      <li>give to your girlfriends or bridesmaids for post-bachelorette fun.</li>
      <li>Stay warm for a long time with just seconds in the microwave.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t see it holding up to the heat for long.</li>
      <li>It is tight fitting at first, but after you get the stretch band stretched out to your head size it works great.</li>
      <li>this eye mask has everything the blue one has to offer and more.  </li>
      <li>I first seen a therapearl pack at work in the pharmacy.</li>
      <li>Heats up well but can be too hot at times.</li>
      <li>The tiny spheres in the eye mask allow for better contact with the eye socket.  </li>
      <li>I have dry eyes and wanted a mask that would be easy to keep clean and thought plastic would wash well</li>
      <li>but this one is a thicker material and is really great for my red, dry irritated eyes!!</li>
      <li>Very comfy and served me well after an eyelid surgery.</li>
      <li>Very soothing.</li>
      <li>Works great to de-puff my tired eyes.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>But I really like the thickness of the beads</li>
      <li>So there isn&#x27;t any real contour to the shape.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s always ready when I need it.  </li>
      <li>Really helps me allergy eyss</li>
      <li>At least the money goes to a good cause....</li>
      <li>We all liked it and tried to order it for our customers, but was not able to from our supplier.</li>
      <li>but this time my adorable little Toy poodle got my attention</li>
      <li>It is not really all that comfortable, either.</li>
      <li>I had to order a second one because I ruined the first one.</li>
      <li>For someone who has chronic migraines and need something that can be hot or cold when need be this works good.</li>
      <li>The have good prices, and I like how they can be hot or cold.</li>
      <li>eyes\\&quot;  too much time looking at a screen, and also with my allergies, which are just starting to kick in.</li>
      <li>The beads are soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably good but not perfect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I also find it perfect to wear it backwards like a headband to chill the base of my skull when I have a headache (or I just need to cool down).</li>
      <li>For the price it really does last long before you even think that you need a new one.</li>
      <li>I just placed the warm wash cloth on the mask, lowered my head, placed the strap behind my head and sat back for a soothing break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Long lasting, really helps my eyes out.</li>
      <li>When I heated the mask to try use warm, the mask was so uncomfortable that I had to take it off after a minute or two.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My fiancee loves this for when she has puffy eyes due to allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have other TheraPearl products. Love the brand.</li>
    <li> Great for headaches and sinus pressure</li>
    <li> Almost perfect.  I wish the head band was adjustable, but otherwise spot-on.  I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> If your allergies act up with puffy eyes, this is the perfect answer for  the problem!!</li>
    <li> Does its job, very comfortable and refreshing.</li>
    <li> It cools down the eyes. Not supercomforting.</li>
    <li> best for post surgery mask cools quickly is light on face</li>
    <li> I needed a product to help with my dry eye issue. My doctor recommended a simple warm wash cloth. But with that method alone, the cloth lost any heat it had within two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this item heated in the microwave for 15 seconds, I was able to combine it along with the warm cloth for a good 10 minutes of warmth to my eyes - just what the doctor ordered. I just placed the warm wash cloth on the mask, lowered my head, placed the strap behind my head and sat back for a soothing break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask held the wash cloth in place AND kept it heated - perfect.</li>
    <li> this eye mask has everything the blue one has to offer and more.  it has a thicker, better strap and can be heated.      this makes the perfect gift!  give to your girlfriends or bridesmaids for post-bachelorette fun.</li>
    <li> This a nice mask. I had to order a second one because I ruined the first one. I put it in the microwave like always for 15 seconds but this time my adorable little Toy poodle got my attention and I left it heating for almost a minute. It was so blown up..out of proportion...wrinkly..wrapper bunched up burn, etc. LOL! Destroyed so I ordered another one. My dog is adorable though so I am not upset.....</li>
    <li> I have tried this eye mask a dozen times since I purchased it. I&#x27;ve placed it in my very cold freezer for 2-3 hours between uses, but it barely stays cold for 20 minutes. It is not really all that comfortable, either. It&#x27;s fairly stiff and doesn&#x27;t really hug my eyes as needed. If you&#x27;ve had eye surgery or have other needs for ice around your eyes, save your money and use a bag of frozen peas.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is very small (I am a petite, 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; woman), and the plastic sticks to your skin. This makes it very uncomfortable to wear. In order to use this product with any degree of comfort, I have to put a cloth handkerchief it cloth napkin on any area the mask will be in contact with. If I don&#x27;t, the plastic causes my skin to start sweating and sticking to the mask - and that is after the mask has been in the freezer. When I heated the mask to try use warm, the mask was so uncomfortable that I had to take it off after a minute or two. I will stick to my iMak mask from brownmed.com</li>
    <li> Cant beat it for the price. Fits well and can be manipulated/molded when frozen. I&#x27;ve found the colder the better(deep freeze) for prolonged use.</li>
    <li> For someone who has chronic migraines and need something that can be hot or cold when need be this works good. It is tight fitting at first, but after you get the stretch band stretched out to your head size it works great. This takes time though!</li>
    <li> Comfortable to use the first time. Exploded in microwave the second time it was heated despite following use instructions. Unfortunate experience.</li>
    <li> Bought this for use after eye surgery. I was supposed to use cold packs for 3 days then switch to warm compresses so I thought this would be perfect. Not. Why did I waste my money? Doesn&#x27;t work well heated or frozen. This was a disappointing purchase.</li>
    <li> I have Sjogrens disease so I use hot and cold packs on my eyes a lot and this is one of the better ones. I was using the blue one with the beads but this one is a thicker material and is really great for my red, dry irritated eyes!!</li>
    <li> I suffer from migraines and heat wraps and ice packs are the best things for some relief. I bought this and I love it but the only downer is that it doesn&#x27;t stay cold for as long as I would like. I have never heated it because I have a heat wrap to substitute this as soon as the coldness wears off.</li>
    <li> I have dry eyes and wanted a mask that would be easy to keep clean and thought plastic would wash well but it would feel uncomfortable to wear. It it actually the opposite. It seems to mold to the eye area. Stay warm for a long time with just seconds in the microwave. I would recommend this to anyone needing an eye compress.</li>
    <li> Works great to de-puff my tired eyes.  I haven&#x27;t tried it warmed up.</li>
    <li> Works good.  4 stars because I think some kind of cover would be a good thing to add so when it&#x27;s ice cold you can control it a little.</li>
    <li> A great design! Stays cold or hot for 20-30 minutes. Very soothing. It does have to be squished a bit to be comfortable on the eyes or place a thin cloth or tissue under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find it perfect to wear it backwards like a headband to chill the base of my skull when I have a headache (or I just need to cool down). The space made to go over your nose perfectly fits on my neck to allow me to keep full range of motion. I also have a small head and find the elastic a perfect size to secure it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It freezes really quickly, it is so easy to clean and it stays cool for over 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I use when I get a bad sinus headache. I keep in freezer rest of the time. I have not warmed in microwave though. To be honest, I don&#x27;t see it holding up to the heat for long. I may be wrong though. I bought to use for a cold mask and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve done.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, really helps my eyes out. I love the cold therapy. I don&#x27;t care for warm therapy but follow instructions and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Nice eye mask. The beads are soft.</li>
    <li> Heats up well but can be too hot at times. It works and for a good cause. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and the company! A couple days after I ordered it online I received a phone call from the company because there was a problem with my address.  The woman on the phone was very nice and friendly and we corrected the problem and I got the product 2 days later.  I would order from them again and if anyone has any doubt ordering with them, you have nothing to worry about! They were great and the product works great!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  I store it in the freezer so it&#x27;s always ready when I need it.  I also have 2 TheraPearl neck/shoulder packs for keeping me cool during our hot summers.</li>
    <li> I first seen a therapearl pack at work in the pharmacy. They sent us a free pack to try. We all liked it and tried to order it for our customers, but was not able to from our supplier. So I found some on amazon of course and got the eye mask. I love it. Great price and quality. I will probably get more of there products, as I suffer from migraines and I need one for my head too. I will also get one for the family for aches, pains, bumps, and bruises. The have good prices, and I like how they can be hot or cold.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times now since I received it.  I keep it frozen, but find it just too cold to use on my bare skin.  I fold a Kleenex and lay between the mask and my eyes and that&#x27;s all it takes.  Helps with \\&quot;computer eyes\\&quot;  too much time looking at a screen, and also with my allergies, which are just starting to kick in. Great price too...give it a try!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use for reduce the dryness in my eyes and eliminate the bag under my eyes. It works nice.</li>
    <li> When used with the elastic strap, it pushes on my eyes.  So I removed the strap and it&#x27;s too flat.  So I ended up pushing on the ends with my hands to shape them to my face, which is kind of awkward.  But I really like the thickness of the beads, they hold the cold really well, so I&#x27;m keeping them.</li>
    <li> The mask Doesn&#x27;t stay cool for more than 5 minutes. At least the money goes to a good cause.... Hopefully.</li>
    <li> The portion that covers the eyes and raised, so this makes it comfortable without it feeling like it is pressing on your eyes. The straps are very comfortable and adjustable. Easy to clean! For the price it really does last long before you even think that you need a new one. Of course it makes it easier to sleep, because it blocks out all light.</li>
    <li> I have had many masks before, but this one works the best. It fits nicely over my eyes when I need it.</li>
    <li> It busted in microwave</li>
    <li> Really helps me allergy eyss</li>
    <li> I used this eye mask post-surgery and it is really outstanding -- far superior to those blue gel masks.  The tiny spheres in the eye mask allow for better contact with the eye socket.  If you open your eyes while wearing it, it&#x27;s a little psychedelic!  but a superior product.  And a good cause.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been testing this product for quite a while now, both in hot and cold mode. It&#x27;s reasonably good but not perfect. Here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence you have a pillow of plastic which is wholly flat on each side. It&#x27;s sealed around the edges. So there isn&#x27;t any real contour to the shape. There are little beads inside which hold the heat or cold but they don&#x27;t press through the plastic at all. It&#x27;s not like they contour to your eye sockets. So if all you want is a general heat or cold against your eye area, you&#x27;ll be all right. You&#x27;ll get a feeling of heat or cold. But if you have an actual sore area in the sockets and what you&#x27;re looking for is that contoured pressure, like a fabric bag would provide, you can&#x27;t get it. The plastic just doesn&#x27;t bend like that. And it&#x27;s definitely worse in cold mode than heat mode, because the plastic gets that much stiffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use, and it&#x27;d held up to multi-month use. But it&#x27;s not as perfect as other models out there where the &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; of it that presses against you is more pliable.</li>
    <li> Very comfy and served me well after an eyelid surgery. Use now for migraines or even sinus pain. Highly recommend!</li>
