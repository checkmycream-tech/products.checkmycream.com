<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I totally loved these brushes I highly recommend the purchase. If you are looking from a complete set that has everything you need this is the best one to purchase and the price is awesome!! You will not regret making the purchase!!</li>
    <li> Perfect set! Brushes are very soft. Applies make-up smoothly without leaving a cakey feeling. You can wash them without having the hairs falling off the brush. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. Some brushes are better than others.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes! I&#x27;ve only been working at sephora for a little over a year and my opinion on these brushes is that they are great!! Preform well and don&#x27;t suck up product... Disgusting as it is I have yet to wash my brushes due to lack of time but they don&#x27;t clump and get hard after using lots of product! Love love love!</li>
    <li> I just got my brush set in the mail and already used them and instantly fell in love with the brushes!  They blend everything very well and feel great when on the face! I will definitely be trying out more products from Shany!</li>
    <li> I just tried my new brushes and they are amazing!  They are also very soft and work perfect for what I need. I love the fact that they give you a guide for all the brushes. The price was great for the amount and quality of the brushes. Normally brushes such as these would cost much, much more. Needless to say, I am extremely impressed, and I will certainly be purchasing more when the need or maybe even want arises. Thanks for the great brushes SHANY. :)&lt;br /&gt;The only CON to this is the smell of the brush holder, but I read that you just let it air for a few days and the smell will go away.</li>
    <li> Got my set today and loved it! Great quality for the price! 5 stars</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews I couldn&#x27;t help but order this set. When I received it, I immediately loved how it was boxed.&lt;br /&gt;People complain about the smell; didn&#x27;t bother me one bit. At that time my friend was with me and said she will be getting one too.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve used the blending eye shadow brush, the foundation brush and I can say that this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on my face. Super soft, great quality and the price is perfect...&lt;br /&gt;Had to nail my set on my bathroom wall because it takes a lot of space :) ... easy access too!</li>
    <li> THESE BRUSHES. I love them!! I&#x27;m buying another set for myself and one for my friend for Christmas. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and needed more brushes and fell in love when I got these in the mail. AMAZING price and just as amazing quality. I&#x27;ve bought expensive brushes before ($20 a piece) and the brushes from Shany are right up there quality wise. And you get 24 for $40?! That&#x27;s unheard of for great quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I love them ! better than my high end brushes.! has every brush you&#x27;ll ever need:D!</li>
    <li> Just got my 24 pc. Brushes. Love them! Would recommend getting them. Best prices ever.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, great quality and amazing price.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive these brushes and as expected, they are soft, gorgeous and luxurious. I love the variety of brushes, and the fact that each has its use written on the back. There is truly one for everything, if not two! My only complaints are that the packaging doesn&#x27;t lend itself to the fragile brushes. When I opened the roll, the XL Fan Brush in the middle was warped into an almost circular shape, and when I went to straighten it out, many bristles fell out. In addition, the leatherette roll has several small imperfections which is disappointing but won&#x27;t affect the brush performance at all, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend these brushes - they&#x27;re a great deal for what you get! So much variety and they&#x27;re all attractive and professional looking. I hope in the future, they&#x27;ll figure out how to package them a bit better, but it&#x27;s not big deal at all.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the brushes.. The brushes are really good and easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes..So different and quality is great..Shipping was great..</li>
    <li> Oh. My. Goodness. These brushes are amazing. I was thorough is scouting for a good set of brushes for a price that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. I finally decided on this set and I absolutely made the right choice in purchasing. They have a complete set of face brushes, which is hard to come by because other sellers do not include a full set of face brushes, or they include others you might not need. You cannot beat the amount and quality of these brushes for the price. It&#x27;s so worth it.The brushes are soft and come in a very nice pouch. Look no further for a set of brushes. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> brushes are soft easy to use the names are on the handle to let you know what each one is for very please with shany pro signature brushes</li>
    <li> The package came right on time !! Love the quality of the brushes . I do make up as freelance . So this would be great for my kit :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also do a review on my YouTube channel on how it applies and how i like them :). Nancygee90</li>
    <li> Very good brushes for the price.  I was impressed.  Packaging excellent!</li>
    <li> Never had a full brush set. But am fully satisfied with this one. I can make use of pretty much all the brushes in the set. The quality is definately great especially for the price. Much better then my Mac brushes that shed pretty bad. Love that they are all different in color which makes it look so unique as if I had purchased each one individually. Definately a great buy!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE...LOVE...LOVE!!! These brushes are amazing, especially for the price.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow! Awesome brushes. These are such good quality, and added to my collection, I have everything I need. The brushes are so soft! The packaging is amazing and so cute! I will be using the box they came in also.</li>
    <li> I have not use them but they are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to start. They look like they are worth every penny compare to want u will pay for other products</li>
    <li> Very good quality and very good price :)  I love it</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought me these brushes for Christmas and I love them! They are so soft and it is a great price for the amount of brushes that come in the set. A side effect of the shipping is that it makes the brushes smell bad when they are first opened. Overall, it is a great product!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. The packaging is very aesthetic but the brush pouch itself smells horribly. I let them air our for about two days and my room and hallway stank! After the smell went away and after washing these brushes I can say that they wash well. They don&#x27;t lose hair or shape after a wash. My only gripe (after the initial smell!) is that the liquid foundation brushes shed about 3 or 4 hairs upon use. I definitely still recommend this set though. Just expect to get higher end brushes for foundation.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife, and she could not be happier. Great brushes, the only reason for 4 stars is the case is plastic and has a heavy chemical smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes I&#x27;ve only had the chance to use the eye shadow brushes E,11,12,17 these shadow brushes are soooooo soft to the face and holds shadows very well. I also used the Oval liquid foundation brush ( I guess its the new micro kind of hair foundation brush) at fist I didn&#x27;t like those brushes till I learned how to use it and tried SHANY I really really love the brush the foundation brush holds a lot of foundation! yea!!! And the slanted mineral blush brush is awesome! So far these brushes give you a flawless finish. I Love how the brushes came in a lovely plu roll pouch and to top it off it came in a gorgeous box. The whole packaging was so expensive lookin. I LOVE THAT! Now the  best part! to me these brushes came with a birth certificate so to speak. I came with the history of the company, the brushes were ALL LABLED!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THAT!!!!!! The handles on the brushes were a Great material!!!! THE BEST!!!!!!!! And I really love how SHANY included in the certificate of the brushes what each brush is used for in order to get the best results! Listen I can honestly say I really love these brushes, I will b ordering more. As I am a makeup artist. I work for a huge company lets just say the company I works for owns all the other upscale makeup  companies. but I love SHANY products! I will order more. Such good quality of Brushes! LOVE YA EXPENSIVE QUALITY BRUSHES SHANY!! CUSTOMER 4 LIFE. WILL USE BRUSHES ON MY CUSTOMERS!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> With the exception of two brushes, this set is amazing!  I&#x27;m not a makeup artist,  and don&#x27;t own any fancy brushes,  so I can&#x27;t give a  comparison with mac or Sigma,  but I can tell you that this brushes are super soft and have worked perfectly for my personal use. The packaging was great, and they are well built,  look elegant and expensive, really pretty.   There are two brushes that I didn&#x27;t like.  The F12  Liquid foundation buffer brush and the F10 oval liquid foundation brush didn&#x27;t work for me and I find them of low quality compared to how good the others are. There was a lot of shedding when I washed them, and then some when I try them out with the foundation,  so I got hair all over my face, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving five stars to this set.  Leaving those brushes behind,  I will say they didn&#x27;t shed, kept their form when I washed them and remained super soft afterwards also the smell of  the box and the faux leather of the storage pack was gone.  Overall its an amazing set for what you pay!</li>
    <li> Love the quality of the brushes. Must have</li>
    <li> Got this brush set as a gift for Xmas. It was exactly what I was looking for! The brushes seem like great quality. I am about to wash them and get them ready for first use! Love the box and bag it came with. Awesome gift!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> good brushes 100% recomended</li>
    <li> I purchased this set as a gift for my daughter and she loves it!  The quality of the brushes is excellent and it cam in a great case with instructions on how to use each brush.</li>
    <li> This was bought for my daughter in law for Christmas and she loved them.  She amazed at how many brushes there were. Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only really had five or six brushes to cover the basics. I&#x27;ve always loved makeup and this was a surprise present from my parents this christmas. I LOVE IT! The brushes are soft and apply make up extremely well, and the price cannot be better (not that I was the one paying). It&#x27;s nice to find great brushes at a reasonable price. I have a couple MAC brushes and honestly I can&#x27;t even tell a difference in quality. This is a really great set for every level of makeup applier, and I&#x27;m excited to broaden my own knowledge.</li>
    <li> Best value and best brushes. Best gift!</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes!! I agree with the other reviewers, wash before use, but I love love love how plush and easily blending they are! The collection has absolutely everything you need to create different looks-and they are very easy for a beginner who hasn&#x27;t used many brushes to play around with. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I adore this set. I have A LOT of makeup brushes to begin with and I demand high quality brushes and this set did not disappoint. The quality is comparable to my Crownbrush, Sephora or MAC brushes at a fraction of the price. The case has kind of a funky smell but it&#x27;s not really a big deal. I plan on buying two more for gifts.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set and have great value of money</li>
    <li> This brush set is better than the Mac brushes that I have. After looking at the reviews I decided to purchase and I couldnt be happier knowing that all the reviews were correct and these brushes are very professional and apply make up better than ever. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my Shany brush set!</li>
    <li> This  set  have  every  brush  you  would  ever  need  there  soft  good  quality so  glad  I  gave  them  a  try  love  them</li>
    <li> This set was actually more (# of brushes) than I need, but decided to get it because of the price value and previous reviews.  It has proven to be a really great set.  Bristles seem to be secure in all except the Oval Liquid Foundation brush. Otherwise, I have been pleased.</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes today, and i was so excited when i opened the package.  They were protected very well, and none lost their shape during shipping.  As for the brushes themselves, i spent a few hours playing with them and none a single one shredded which is impressive.  At first when i opened them it seemed like some of the bigger brushes were a little small, but once i held them up to my face n tried them ut they were actually pretty darn perfect.  I&#x27;m so happy that they&#x27;re such great quality at such a low price too.  Will definitely be returning to this company in the future.</li>
    <li> Great quality!!! awesome brushes!</li>
    <li> great set and soft:) good quality Brush.</li>
    <li> I bought the brush set to start wearing make up. Initially I did not expect much as the price of the brush set was on the friendly side. I was very impressed however, with the product from packaging to the quality of the brushes. The brushes are very soft and do look cute too with different colored tips. I bought two brushes from MAC before and I think I like these better!  Beginners, do not be overwhelmed by all the brushes you have now. The set comes with instruction and it kindly tells you what each individual brush is used for : ) Some reviewers have complained that it smells like plastic, yes it does but I didn&#x27;t mind at all because once you air it for a while it&#x27;s gone. The case and brushes just smelled new. Overall I am happy with what I ordered and do not need to look at MAC or other brand name brushes because in the end they all are produced in the same country as this brush set.</li>
    <li> I would prefer to give this brush set a 3½ stars, but there was no option. Some quality control issues notwithstanding, I&#x27;d say this is a very good makeup brush set for the original price point I bought it for. I will talk about the quality control issues and one of the claims further down... I bought these brushes over a month ago and have been using and washing them consistently, so I feel I have a good sense now of the quality of these brushes.    But first the good: the brushes do their job very well and are better than drug store quality for sure. Some of them are even coming close to high-end brush quality. The brushes in this quality category are specifically: the F71 XL fan brush (made of sable hair), the F19 slanted contour brush, the F14 medium powder brush, the F13 rounded foundation brush (excellent!), M33 mineral powder brush, F17 buffed bronzer brush (goat hair) and M22 mineral bronze buffer brush. The regular foundation brush is ok too, but not so dense. Also, all the eye brushes are outstanding - though I use the one labelled \\&quot;E11 eyeshadow brush\\&quot; for concealer and the \\&quot;F70 concealer brush\\&quot; for eyeshadow instead (both good). If you take care of them, they should last for years. Very soft, but good density overall for these brushes. A comparable set to these are the coastal scents 22-piece brush set, but this one&#x27;s way better. If you&#x27;re on the fence between that one and this, get this for sure. This one is what I wished the coastal scents was going to be (I was very disappointed by the 22 piece set, that everyone seemed to rave about).    Now onto the bad, or at least the \\&quot;not so good\\&quot;: some of the brushes shed - I&#x27;m disappointed for example with the duo-fibre brushes (F10 oval liquid foundation brush, and F12 liquid foundation buffer brush). These ones are duo-fibre synthetic and sable hair, and the F10 can&#x27;t stop shedding it seems. Very sad - because I wanted a brush like this one and I don&#x27;t seem to have any luck with these kind of brushes. The equivalent brush in the 22 piece coastal scents kit was also very disappointing for the lack of bristle density, so I was hoping this one would be a great replacement, but no such luck - if it keeps shedding, it&#x27;ll also lose density. Also the goat hair F17 buffed bronzer brush shed a bit, but it seems more manageable than the F10 or F12. Additionally, the medium powder brush (F14) hasn&#x27;t been finished properly - it lacks the crimps on the ferrule (metal part of the brush) that would normally secure it to the wooden handle. I noticed one other customer complained that two of her brushes came apart within a short time, so I really hope that doesn&#x27;t happen to this one, or any of mine. And although the brush roll is great overall, it seems a part of it also hasn&#x27;t been finished properly - the seam for the F12 brush pouch doesn&#x27;t go all the way up to the top of the pouch as the others do. If I could fix it, I would, but one would need an industrial sewing machine to fix it, which I don&#x27;t have. Some of the other brushes such as the M21 slanted mineral blush brush, F22 slanted finishing brush and E25 slanted eyeliner brush also seem to have minor defects. The M21 and F22 seem not to have been trimmed properly and both have a slight to moderate concave dips within the centre where it should be straight across in a diagonal cut. And the E25 seems to have the bottom part of the bristles on one side, kind of \\&quot;dented\\&quot; if that makes any sense. It basically looks like whatever was used to trim this brush (laser or whatever) was first accidentally aimed at the bottom part of the brush. But so far it seems to work fine, so perhaps it&#x27;s just a cosmetic issue.    I think if you&#x27;re in the US, you should get this set directly from the Shany website, because there they&#x27;re selling it for only $30.00, and not $69.95, which is what I see today here on amazon. It&#x27;s overall quite good, if you want better quality than E.L.F. or other drugstore brands. But do be aware that there seems to be somequality control issues - from reading other reviews, it seems other customers have had similar, but not the exact same issues relating to the finishing of the brushes and case. Finally to address the claim that Shany is cruelty free - that very well may be true as far as the makeup is concerned, but if you really care about cruelty free makeup brushes - get synthetic taklon brushes such as ecotools and real techniques. That&#x27;s the only way to be sure. I have both these brands and they are excellent, and especially real techniques is as close to pro quality as you&#x27;ll get given the price. Take it with a grain of salt when a business claims they have cruelty-free natural animal hair brushes in the mix. This brush set is made in China after all.</li>
    <li> I am over 60 and just learning to put on makeup properly.  I had my droopy eyelids fixed and got excited to actually see my eyelids and am trying to improve my look.  I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of youtube videos about makeup and they all talk about using good brushes.  So after buying and returning a couple of brushes at Sephora, I found this set of brushes on amazon.com for about the same price as 2 brushes.  I LOVE  these brushes...they are soft and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out.  They work well...I am hopeful that I can improve my ability to apply makeup that looks natural and lovely with practice.  They say &amp;#34;you are never too old to learn&amp;#34;.  The brushes I bought at Sephora when I used them the bristles were all over my face and I had a hard time picking them out.  This brush set has every brush I could possibly need.  Thank you Shany...you have done a great job with carefully choosing all these brushes.  They also include a descriptive list so that a newbie to makeup can figure out what each brush is suppose to do.  That is very helpful.  Also the brushes are marked with a corresponding name and number.</li>
    <li> well so far my review on the set. The packaging had an odd smell, but was expected from what I read on previous reviews. As far as the set itself, the fan brush came bent and the hair was not even. One side is very thick while the right side had tangled hair which was stuck in the clamp and it was thin. I have already done my first wash and only a few shed, bUT they&#x27;ve dried and have not held their shape very well. I also expected the brushes to be more dense. They are flimsy and don&#x27;t buff as well as I expected. The eyeshadow brushes are all nice and usable. But I&#x27;m so disappointed with the face brushes. And I honestly only ordered the set for the face brushes... wanting to try newer and affordable ones. Over all I would have to give the set 2 out of 5. Only because I like the eyeshadow brushes, but I really don&#x27;t need any more eyeshadow brushes. I have tons. Definitely let down especially after all the wonderful reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and very durable the reason I only give three stars was due to the fact that after owning these brushes for a few weeks, the head with bristles completely fell off several brushes! Leaving my to reglue them all. I paid a decent price and wish they hadn&#x27;t been so cheaply put together.</li>
    <li> Theses are the best quality brushes I own! I will definitely be checking out some more Shany cosmetics. The only thing its that they do have a chemical smell when they arrive but who doesn&#x27;t wash their brushes before they use them? The packaging its very expensive looking and the roll is a good faux leather material and its longer and bigger than I expected. The brushes were all very soft and I like that it has what the brush is used for on the handle. They are all of very good quality. I like that it has every single brush I use for my eyes and face. You can do a whole complete makeup look with just this one brush set. For the quality and how many different types of brushes, the price is great. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of brush sets in the past that looked great online, but didn&#x27;t perform well, nor did they last very long.  Thankfully, this was not the case with the Shany brush set. The brushes are soft, have good integrity, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  There&#x27;s a wide variety- several foundation brushes, concealer, multiple shadow brushes, and even a couple that are great for contouring and high lighting.  I&#x27;m happy to say I won&#x27;t need to buy another set for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Best set of makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Easy to use and I add it to my makeup kit. After several washes the glue on the handle and metal piece starts to get loose. So I&#x27;m not too sure how long it will last after more washes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to doing make up &amp; I needed good brushes. I had a friend tell me about the shany brushes &amp; they were a good price for me &amp; when I recieved them I was amazed on how good quality they are. I love these brushes they are amazing. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Purchased these brushes after doing a ton of research. Brushes come beautifully packaged. Like the fact that the brushes are numbered and have a description written on the brushes and on a seperate sheet of paper. Brushes are soft, easy to clean, and work wonderfully! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes defenetly worth the price!!</li>
    <li> You get so much for your money. The brushes are soooooo soft. i washed them when i got them and no shedding noted so far. Did i say they are so soft. I love them. It is very well made. It came in fast and was packaged beautifully. I have nothing but great things to say about them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best! No shedding , no smell, very sturdy. I&#x27;m totally impressed with these brushes for this very low price. Definitely a great investment!</li>
    <li> After years of buying brushes separately and the costs racking up I decided to buy a full set. I researched the crap out of it and came to the conclusion the spending an arm and leg on a set was just ridiculous. I&#x27;m not a makeup artist so I&#x27;m the only one using these brushes. With that being said I absolutely love these brushes. They are by far the best I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve purchased Bare Minerals brushes, Sephora brushes and E.L.F. I&#x27;ve also used MAC brushes in the past. My mother-in-law swears by MAC brushes but when I had her use these she fell in love. I&#x27;ve already cleaned them twice and have had no issues with bristles falling out. I do use a good cleanser though and I recommend that everyone use a reputable cleanser with any brand of brushes you may have. I will be referring this product to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Love these. Bought them for my friend and sister. Truly an awesome set.  A bit overpriced seeing that so many others have brush sets for lower. But overall awesome set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and for the price, how could u go wrong?! great quality! I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> As someone who owns many, many brushes. These are by far some of the most reasonably priced. If you travel or move around with your brushes a lot, the case that it comes in is sturdy, compact, and all around great! When first opening them I noticed how soft they were! This specific bundle is great for new-bees because you get such a great variety of brushes and a little taste of all the different uses you can use them for! overall good product &amp; very happy</li>
    <li> The quality of the brush bristles was great - They were soft on my skin and there&#x27;s a great variety. Unfortunately, after owning them for not even 3 months, the metal that attaches the brush to the handle and the wooden handle have come unglued on almost all of the brushes. I don&#x27;t get them wet and I don&#x27;t bang them around all over the places, so I&#x27;m really disappointed with the product quality. They just don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Good set of brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> The brushes are fine but they&#x27;re a lot larger than I expected them to be. The eyeliner brushes are impossible to do eyeliner with unless you wanted an extremely bold look.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> I love the set. The variety of brushes is perfect for trying new looks with lots of makeup. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m im love with my brushes. They are all very soft. I love how neatly it&#x27;s package. I give these brushes a thums up. They are not MAC but it&#x27;s very close to it. It really gets the good done.</li>
    <li> Got this as a lightning deal and I am sooooo happy I purchased them. This set is awesome! It has basically all necessary brushes. I have a ton of other brushes as well but this is a great addition to my collection. The handles of the brushes are light weight and may feel cheap to some but I like it. Also a GREAT feature is that each brush is labeled with its purpose. That helps when you have brushes that you have no idea what they are used for.</li>
    <li> These are amazing, great quality brushes and a great price!</li>
    <li> My wife was overwhelmed when she saw all those brushes. Great price and delivered on time. Definitely would buy from this provider again</li>
    <li> Awsome brushes !  great prices... I love love the brushes !</li>
    <li> I bought this brush set around a month ago and have finally had a chance to use all brushes, which I wanted to do before posting a review. This set is reasonably priced for the quality of brushes. I have no complaints about the brushes - they all work great! I&#x27;ve been doing my makeup for years with brushes that should have been replaced a long time ago. I would definitely recommend this brush set to anyone that&#x27;s interested in a high quality set without the large sticker price. So glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> I received this earlier today and at first glance the packaging was very nice. It came in a nice purple box inside was the faux leather case tucked neatly inside. As everyone else has stated the case does have a plastic/gasoline type of smell but its really not that bad as people are making it out to be. Each brush was individually wrapped and protected. However the large fan brush is in the crease of the bag causing the hairs to bend but its nothing too drastic. I immediately washed each individual brush which was very easy and there was very little shedding. Some wrote that there was a lot of dirt and what not in the brushes but that wasn&#x27;t the case in my opinion. After I washed them I set them out to dry and just happened to check on them about 2 hours later and they were pretty much dried which was nice because my previous brushes took the whole night. This is my first actual brush set. Over the years I&#x27;ve collected many different brands (e.l.f., ulta, bare minerals, japonesque, etc.) that I thought were soft at the time but I guess I never knew what soft was until I touched these brushes. I&#x27;m not a beginner to makeup but I am a beginner to using the right brushes in the right way. I looked for a couple months for a large brush set and read countless reviews and weighed the pros and cons before buying this product. I debated buying this or coastal scents 32 pc., or one that was 36 pc. but i forgot what the companys name was.  I am very glad I purchased this. I think that even though this had only 24 pc. compared to 36 its much higher quality. While researching some MUA&#x27;s compared them to MAC brushes which really helped my decision and it paid off. I like how some have different color tips its just more attractive looking. I also love that on each brush the number and type of brush is printed which seemed to be rare in brush sets of this quantity. The black handles make them look very expensive, feel good in your hand, and they seem very durable. I&#x27;ve used a fewso far and they&#x27;re uhh-maze-zing! I also like that it comes with a pamphlet that shows each number and explains what each brush does which was very helpful. Shany is also a cruelty free company. The only brush I might not use as much is the eyeliner brush. I have one from real techniques and its very thin and straight which I&#x27;m used to while Shany&#x27;s brush is a little wider and fluffier but then again I haven&#x27;t used it so maybe once I get some gel on it it&#x27;ll be thinner. I highly recommend this product. Amazon&#x27;s price is better than on the Shany website but it seems to be out of stock more often. I just happened to see that they were getting it in stock and it shipped earlier than quoted which was nice. This set is great for the price and can make a great gift.    PROS:  Colorful  Expensive looking  Very soft  Quality and Quantity  Has both # and name of brush on each handle  Barely sheds  CRUELTY FREE  Dries fast    CONS:  Eyeliner brush a little big    Edit: I just went on the Shany site and they&#x27;ve lowered the price to $40 which is much better than the original so both amazon and shany have good prices.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Also love the fact that they explain what brush is used for what!</li>
    <li> ***Purchased these a year and half ago!***  Pros -They are still holding up very well.  -Have been washed MANY times. -The brushes are SUPER soft and dense.  -Has all the basic brushes you will need. -Applies everything beautifully   Cons -The handle of my spoolie brush came off but nothing a little hot glue couldn&#x27;t fix. Please keep in mind that I&#x27;ve had these for longer than a year and this has recently occurred.  -There is a some, not much, but some shedding.    For the price of all the brushes I have never been this satisfied!!! Would I recommend this product ABSOLUTELY yes!  Plus shipping was very prompt and packaging was beyond my expectations!  As I stated before I have had these brushes with me for longer than a year and I am so impressed with everything!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!! I was a bit skeptical about it because the price did seem super low but after reading reviews I gave them a chance. I love the fact that they&#x27;re cruelty free, probably one of the biggest reasons that made me buy them. They&#x27;re super soft, and just great! Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price, and they even come in a super nice box, look very top notch set that&#x27;s for sure!!! I hope they last me a long time :)</li>
    <li> Really nice brushes, soft just like my IT Cosmetics Bukhi brushes!!! at an affordable price. I can&#x27;t wait to use them ALL...:) &amp;#60;3...&lt;br /&gt; I will buy again, and I will be going to the website to see what other products they have,,,,my new favorite is SHANY products!!!</li>
    <li> I received these brushes as a gift. I&#x27;m not a MUA, but I did want to get more professional-looking results for my daily and social looks, and I find that this kit delivers. I played with them the moment they arrived, and put on a full face before picking up a family member from work, who saw the results and said, &amp;#34;wow, brushes do make a difference!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a generous number of brushes with this set, a great value for the price. They are soft, hold product well, and apply products smoothly and easily. If I recall correctly, the brush bristles vary between natural and synthetic fibers. I&#x27;ve used roughly half the brushes in the kit so far, and generally didn&#x27;t have trouble with shedding - only two, the foundation buffer brush and the round foundation brush, have shed, and it was minimal. Also, I was a bit sad that there were no lip brushes with this kit. That and the shedding are the only things keeping me from giving this kit a 5-star review. If that&#x27;s not a problem for you, I say get the kit, for the price, the kit can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! This is my first Shany purchase but most likely not the last. Only bummed that the travel case wasn&#x27;t included and I was too impatient to wait to send them back and order again.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes today and I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use them yet.&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed so far is that the set looks really nice and they also come in a very nice looking case. The case also has a couple really small pockets on the inside. The brushes are incredibly soft and the case is nice and sturdy. The one issue I do have with it is the placement of the XL Fan Brush (F71). The brush is spaced away from the rest of the brushes so that its bristles have enough room but the slot assigned to it happens to be found at one of the case&#x27;s fold so the brush &#x27;s bristles were fanning out in the shape of the crease. Besides the issue with the fan brush this collections looks great! I can&#x27;t wait to try it and I will give an update when I do.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality!!! Im able to use them for more than one purpose. I will deginitely recomend it.</li>
    <li> Brushes are super soft and I love the combination of brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are alright. Definitely does NOT compare to sigma at all. Sigma is way better quality brushes that last much longer than these. Washed all my brushes before using them and almost all of them shedded so much. You definitely get what you pay for</li>
    <li> For the price it self it is a great deal, I would give some brushes 4 starts and some 3 because they are not all equal in quality. They come packages really nicely but the bag it comes in has a really strong oder when you first receive them. But if you are looking for a brush set and you don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune this one is pretty great for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist, but I want to get better at applying makeup and these brushes are beautiful! The bulk of them are for eye makeup application with a few for powder or concealer. Really great deal and really high quality brushes.</li>
    <li> they are high quality brushes. I&#x27;m glad I bought them. go Shany!!! and the price is unbeatable</li>
    <li> These are the hands down best brushes ever! I say it&#x27;s worth it and better then Sigma! Sigma are overprice! For the price and how much brushes you get these are a steal!!!! The brushes are so soft and I wash them right away they do no shed and is very good! I love it!</li>
    <li> This brushes are great I love it great quality and cute. I Do recommend them!</li>
    <li> WOW WOW WOW  WOW  ............WORTH  IT  ....LOVE  IT.......HUGE  AND  SOFT  AND  GORGEOUS!  I  RECOMMEND HIGHLY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally a MAC brush girl, well I still am.  I like the quality of these brushes.  I use them along with my MAC brushes.  It&#x27;s great for someone just starting off.</li>
    <li> So I love these. I bought them on the Black Friday Week deals for what I would consider to be a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;Each brush has it&#x27;s use marked on the handle and in the guide that accompanies it. And all brushes are in a leather-like case and most with bristle covers. The box they arrived in is incredibly good quality. I kept it to cover and use for Christmas gifts! Its very sturdy and well made which speaks to the quality for the product.&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint so far is the incredibly strong smell when you open the box. I believe maybe it is the leather case but it smells of a strong plastic chemical odor. My husband says it is from the finish. That they didn&#x27;t allow the materials to cure before they packaged them together and that the smell would go away if it was set out to air for a day or so. He was right, sort of. The majority of the smell went away in a day leaving only a lingering of it if you held the brush roll close to your nose.&lt;br /&gt;My coloring has never looked so good. Yes, I am guilty of using junk brushes way longer than I should have. The mineral makeup I use looks great but can be hard to blend without quality tools. These brushes are a great compliment to the quality mineral makeup I use. The brushes are incredibly soft. They work well for each of their intended uses. I don&#x27;t always use them for their labeled use but they serve me well.&lt;br /&gt;There are SO many brushes, and they span from liquid to mineral makeups. I currently wear no liquid makeup making those brushes more or less obsolete, at least until I get into wearing those again which I will do more in the summer. It just seemed important to note that you might not have a use for each brush. Take the time to look at each one and make sure you aren&#x27;t buying a kit that is beyond your needs.&lt;br /&gt;Because there are so many brushes they take up a lot of space. the roll with all of the brushes in it is very bulky. I appreciate that they gave up a case for them but I have taken them out of the roll and placed the brushes in my vanity drawer. there they can lay flat, and take up much less space. The large fan brush gets a little crushed in the roll, so I would suggest to anyone not traveling with their brushes often that you consider taking them out of the roll for storage. And if you do travel I suggest a different carrier. If not for the entire set at the very least for the fan brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again the smell, the bulky roll, and brushes I don&#x27;t have a use for yet are but small potatoes compared to how wonderful my makeup goes on now. I find myself using less product and it goes on faster. Overall, a great set!</li>
    <li> Alright I give this 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t  tried them out yet but I just received them today and I have to say I am blown away!  It comes with instructions for each brush in a very nice little box.  24 piece set for such a cheap price. I totally recommend.</li>
    <li> So, just got my SHANY brushes in the mail and they are so great!!!! I&#x27;m super excited they are super soft and look like they&#x27;re really good quality. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look amazing! I will update after I use them. The only reason I took off a star is because the leatherette cover smells very strong of chemicals, but hopefully that will go away soon.</li>
    <li> So great for the price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got my brushes today and used for the first time.. LOVE IT... very good quality and has everything I need. I recommend 100%.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing set for the price. Great quality brushes and there are so many! I had fun when I received this. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. This is a great purchase for someone wishing to start off with high quality on a budget. They do a great job at what they&#x27;re designed for. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this brush set! Very good quality, long handles, soft brush heads. Just what I was looking for. Love the handy leatherette too that makes it easy to keep it all together and store. My favorite brush is the foundation brush. Love how smooth and natural my makeup looks using this brush!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my girlfriend and she loves them. She compares them to MAC brushes with a cheaper price tag. The set comes with every brush you&#x27;d ever need.</li>
    <li> Amazing soft brushes! These brushes have really changed my makeup applying game. I just love the way I look after using these brushes. Shany OBSESSED!!</li>
    <li> This brush set is so amazing. Now I have a brush for everything. Definatly recommend this especially for the price because it will be love at first use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the quality and versatility of the brushes I unwrapped each brush the second I got them delivered; unbelievable!!!! I loveeee them!!  Great product amazing price!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I used these &amp; washed them several  times before writing my review.  Before deciding to finally purchase these,  I did extensive research on them and compared them with many other sets offered on Amazon. I like to get the absolute most for my money &amp;, as a former teacher, I like to share what I&#x27;ve learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As I researched I learned that the highest quality brushes are handcrafted and made of natural hair.  Natural hair is good for applying powders as they distribute the powder more evenly,  Synthetic bristles are non-porous and don&#x27;t absorb as much liquid or cream as the natural bristles, thus not wasting product.  Because they are non-porous, they are also easier to wash &amp; some say more hygienic.  The bristles should be laser- cut for easy/even application,The ferrules (metal attached to the handle &amp; bristles) should be well-crimped two or three times to be sure the bristles are firmly attached to the handle.  The handle should be solid wood with a good weight and easy to hold.  I also found a  website (sorry I can&#x27;t find that link anymore) that listed the 10  best inexpensive brush sets to buy and this set was at the top with the Coastal Scents 22 piece set.  I can&#x27;t remember which was first and second, but I think this may have been the set that came in 2nd.  The Coastal Scents brushes did not list a lot of information and, personally, these look so much more luxurious compared to the Coastal Scents set.  It&#x27;s  very well worth the extra few dollars and you get 2 extra brushes. I also like the variety of the brushes offered in the Shany set better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Shany brushes are just one of the few I found on Amazon with all of those attributes,  and the ONLY ones that have been through a process that treats the brushes and makes them all anti-bacterial.  On top of that they had great reviews and are a great price!  (This set is $70 or more on other websites) If you&#x27;d rather not spend $40 on this set,  even Shany&#x27;s  less expensive brushes have most of the same attributes.  Another great &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; is a detailed picture with a number and description of each brush in the set,  and each brush is also labeled with that number and description.  Many brush sets make you guess which brush does what. Even better, they are shipped by Amazon and come with the Amazon guarantee, and member of PETA so they don&#x27;t harm animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my personal experience with these brushes.  They arrived within 3-4 days  of ordering and in perfect condition. Not one of the handles was broken or loose.  They came enclosed in a very sturdy cardboard box that is perfect to wrap if giving as a gift.  The black brush case  was enclosed inside the box  with each brush wrapped in cellophane. The  larger brushes also came with nice,sturdy plastic brush protectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case:  Is very well made of thick, black  faux leather material with wrap around strings that reach around, more than enough, to tie it closed. The individual brush compartments in mine were sewn a bit crooked, but the brushes are held in place just right.  It has four extra slots that are not as expanded as the other slots, but I am able to fit two thin brushes in each (eyeliner/lip/spoolie). There is one open mesh pocket and a zippered. mesh pocket on each side of the case that can store small items like brush guards, thin sponges, small tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes:  They are so soft and well made!  I had only minimal shedding from one or two of the brushes when  I washed them before use.  One was the fan brush and another was one of the Kabuki brushes F-10 or F-12. which are the only brushes in the set I don&#x27;t like because my foundation came out streaky. I&#x27;m not a cosmetologist so I may not have used the proper technique. However, I will probably try them again.  All the rest of the brushes have worked beautifully for me. They have washed well without too much effort.  I&#x27;ve had no chipping paint or wood, and do additional shedding. They do call the brush &amp; comb brush a &amp;#34;spoolie&amp;#34;, but you will notice in the photo there isn&#x27;t a true spoolie.  I took one from another set to put in one of the extra slots as well as lip liner brush, lipstick brush, and a very thin eyeliner brush.  I have t o say that the eye brushes are absolutely phenomenal! There are 9 of them. Those and the fan brush are my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful hints:  I didn&#x27;t pay attention to what  order the brushes arrrived in and there are so may all I could remember was the fan brush went in the middle.  One thing I wish they would have done to make it easier to find the brushes on the chart, is to have the brushes in the same order they are on the photo description paper that was included.  I found a way, though,  to organize the brushes the best of my ability so I learn where they are without having to look at the paper all the time to find what I need.  I&#x27;m a homemaker now, so I don&#x27;t wear makeup as much as I used to, so it&#x27;s going to take a few more times for me to get it down pat.  The instructions don&#x27;t  mention this, but I noticed a correlation between the letters and what each brush was used for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F- all of these brushes have to deal with the face (11 brushes)  All of these are large, except the concealer brush.&lt;br /&gt;E- these brushes are for the eyes (8 brushes) These are all small.&lt;br /&gt;M- Mineral (powders, bronzer, blush) 3 brushes- large&lt;br /&gt;B- Brows (2 brushes)-small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only exception is the blending brush that I use for shadow has the letter F, but I guess it could also be used for the face, too.&lt;br /&gt;I grouped them together by letter and numerical sequence as best as I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put all the eye shadow brushes &amp; blending brush in the small slots on the left side,  The concealer, eyeliner &amp; brow brushes I put in the last slots on the right.  The fan brush is exactly in the middle and slightly falls between the folds of the case.  I haven&#x27;t  had trouble with the bristles being bent, but the outer plastic brush guard does fold over on each side.  I tried the fan brush in a different spot, but it just didn&#x27;t look right, so I just deal with it because the brush isn&#x27;t being damaged. I keep the extra flat slots on each side of it open so there us plenty of room beside it.  The rest of the larger brushes are spread out on the left and the right of the fan brush.  I was able to group the 3 &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; brushes together on the left of the fan brush and put F10 &amp; F12 the furthest to the left with mesh brush guards on them to remind me I don&#x27;t like those ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a photo of  the order in which I  arranged the brushes , along with their descriptions, to help me find them much easier than the chart they came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you in making your decision, &amp; if you choose to buy these, I hope you love them as much as I do, :).

    <li> I received the brushes today and was so excited to open the package. The box  the brushes came in was really nice and the brushes are beautiful and feel great . I cannot wait to use them tomorrow when I do my makeup. I was so surprised of the great quality of the brushes especially for the price. I&#x27;m throwing all my other brushes away and starting fresh with the beautiful new ones I received</li>
    <li> My wife loved her Valentine&#x27;s gift! She says they are of great quality for its price! She definitely recommends them to others!</li>
    <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had and for an amazing price</li>
    <li> The tipple brushes were the worst they were not good at all and they also have black stuff that dripping from the brushes and it never goes away when u wash them but other than that I love them</li>
    <li> This brush set is truly amazing! I swear it came from Brush Heaven! The bristles are sooo smooth and their functionality are great! This is great for a make up artist or even a make up enthusiast! Good job SHANY!</li>
    <li> Based on how inexpensive the brush set was, I assumed it would only last a few weeks. However, I&#x27;ve been using these for six months now, and they are fabulous. The range of shapes of brushes are impressive; there really is a brush for anything you might want to try. I especially like that there are several different foundation brushes depending on the shape and type of makeup used and to make it easy, each brush has its purpose on the side.The quality is great, they&#x27;re durable, AND they are cruelty-free. I will not go back to those ridiculously expensive brushes--whenever these do start to wear out.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  I&#x27;m not somebody who is super knowledgable about makeup, so even buying the brushes felt out of my comfort zone.  When they came, they were in very lovely packaging and again I thought &amp;#34;why did I even buy these? Who am I kidding?&amp;#34;. And they sat on my vanity for a few months.  Then I decided to suck it up and use them - I wasn&#x27;t overwhelmed at all!  There&#x27;s an amazing card that tells you what every brush is and gives you instructions! It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. They also say on them what they are for in case you lose the sheet. So far the brushes are holding up pretty well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do smell pretty bad when you first get them, but it airs out quickly.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting these to be as great as they are considering the price.  But they are such good quality, and were recommended to me.  I am kinda a makeup snob and usually buy the more expensive stuff but I cannot stress enough how great these are!! I would say they are just as good as Sigma brushes and anything you would get a sephora. LOVE LOVE LOVE you literally have every brush you will ever need, the fan brush is so big and fluffy the pictures do not do this product justice.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing another set from Amazon but when I got this set in the mail I was in awe.  The brushes are the perfect length for me to use when applying makeup to my clients.  The texture of the brushes are phenomenal and I am really excited about using these brushes for the first time.  I love the box that the brushes came in and I am looking forward to trying other products out by SHANY!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are great quality and you cannot beat the price. I just use them for myself (read: I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, so I can&#x27;t speak to &amp;#34;professional quality&amp;#34;), but I have loved playing around with them and trying out new things. There&#x27;s almost too many brushes as I am not sure what all of them need to be used for, but it comes with an instruction sheet so I&#x27;m just trying it all out.</li>
    <li> Loved my new brushes. Very soft. They look very professional.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I haven&#x27;t had enough time to use all the brushes, however the brushes look great and are of great quality. ;)</li>
    <li> At first I was really impressed with how soft they were and how well they worked. But then after 2 times of using them, they were stained and shedding. I went to go wash them and they started to stink really bad. Their shape didnt go back well at all. I really hated how this turned out the way it did. I dont recommend</li>
    <li> This is quite possibly the best set of brushes I could have ever gotten for the price. It comes with every single kind of brush you could need! I&#x27;ve always bought high quality makeup but applied it incorrectly with cheap brushes that come in the package or just the wrong brush in general.... Since purchasing, my makeup finally looks professionally done, every day. One of the brushes shed slightly a few times, but I think that was my own fault for not washing them first, and it has not shed since. Hope this helps everyone! Loved the brushes and the awesome leatherette.</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever!  I use them for my kids during dance competitions and daily for myself.  Such a great price!</li>
    <li> Great for the price you pay for it. The smell goes away the next day if washed.</li>
    <li> First I will say that I couldn’t wait to receive these brushes!!!  They arrived in a timely manner, within a week.  The brushes come beautifully packaged with a pamphlet explaining what exactly each brush is used for.  I also like the leather pouch it comes in for easy travel. As a newbie to make up, I’ve tried e.l.f. brushes and other drug store brands with no luck.  Either the brushes were flimsy, losing hair, or just absorbed the entire product.  Since I’ve gotten serious with make-up application recently, I was looking for makeup brushes that would last for the looks I’m attempting.  I like how soft the brushes are and the fact that it applies so smoothly.  I definitely recommend buying these brushes no matter how high or low your make up expertise is.  And for the price, it can’t get any better!</li>
    <li> Amazing set of brushes. I wish I bought them sooner!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking to replace all my Mac Makeup Brushes and I was initially going to head back to  Mac to replace the ones I use the most. However, the price of the brushes were holding me back. I have had Mac Brushes for years and to be 100% honest, I did not take care of my brushes. They held up beautifully considering but I washed them maybe twice a month out of fear they would shed tremendously. That was not only stupid, it was poor hygiene. So I decided to trash them and replace them with Drug Store &amp; Sephora Brands, they were nice but slacked in comparison. So back in the hunt, I found Shany! It was a toss up between this and another listing. I am so very happy I went with Shany. After the first use, my NARS Makeup glided on with ease and it actually gave me full coverage. It made me realise that my other brushes were absorbing more makeup then it was actually going on my face, making me use more then necessary. If anyone ever heard or used NARS they know its slightly more expensive then MAC ($48 Liquid Foundation &amp; $32 Blush) &amp; using too much too fast can be very expensive. Okay, back to the product. The brushes were beautifully packaged and each were wrapped individually with writting on each handle to inform the user what each brush is meant for. I did not see a Blush Brush but pick one, I am sure anyone you choose would be a good choice! The price is amazing for the quality. After The first wash my brushes havent shed one bit. They are incredibly soft and sorry to sound redundant, but the packaging!! Ah! I am in love. Thanks Amazon for the incredible find and thanks Shany for the incredibly fast delivery and amazing brushes!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE my Shany brush set! I use them everyday</li>
    <li> These brushes a great deal for the average make up application. I&#x27;m not a make up artist by any stretch, but I bought these for my mother who wears plenty of high quality make up and used to apply it with crappy dollar store brushes and tissues. She loves the set and has tried a lot of new application techniques.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked through them and they seem to be great quality.</li>
    <li> best cheap brushes i have ever bought, very soft!</li>
    <li> These are excellent quality makeup brushes! The set is beautiful and has everything you could need for a flawless look. Will be purchasing more SHANY products soon!</li>
    <li> Luv them they are super soft and great quality for the cheap price. Would recommend they to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not super knowledgeable about makeup products, but I love these brushes!!! They are amazingly soft and I can use them for all of my makeup products. I have sensitive skin and these brushes did not irritate my skin which is a major plus! Very happy!!</li>
    <li> Just got these brushes and I am incredibly pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this brush set since I&#x27;d never used their products personally, but after reading lots of great reviews I took the plunge and ordered. I&#x27;m so happy I did, these brushes are amazing! I am a professional who works in a salon and use brushes by MAC and MUFE, so I was skeptical about the low price of the Shany brushes. I ordered these because I wanted a decent brush set for training and traveling but I didn&#x27;t want to invest in another set of expensive brushes. These truly rival the quality of my other brushes that cost almost the price of this full set for just one brush.</li>
    <li> Just received my SHANY brush set in the mail and I can not wait to try the brushes out! I can&#x27;t believe how fast my order was shipped to me! The brushes came in a really nice storage box and they look professional &#x3D;) I am very very very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> the product came as they said ! the ONLY bad thing about this product is : odor ! as soon as you open the package it has a weird funky smell , but as soon as you was the brushes it goes away ! the bag still has it , but oh well ! worth every penny . has many brushes &amp; labeling on each brush ! easy to travel with &amp; easy to organize ! the bristles are extremely SOFT &amp; hold well ! definitely take my word for it !!! #PickiestPersonEver lol</li>
    <li> This brush set is soooooooo amazing! Beautiful and sturdy packaging.  The leather case is also beautiful and will be great for traveling.  The brushes themselves are resilient and gorgeous (So gorgeous that I don&#x27;t even want to use them)! Each one has the name of the brush written on it and a beautiful black finish.  The hairs of the brush are very soft.  I just wish the set came with an actual spoolie, an extra large powder brush and a flat contour brush!  Other than that this set has literally every brush you will ever need. For only 40 buck this is a STEAL! Great job SHANY COSMETICS! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love these brushes I ordered them and used them today. They are great quality for the price. The packaging was awesome and the bad to store them all in is perfect. I definitely recommend these brushes</li>
    <li> Great value for the price!&lt;br /&gt;True, it&#x27;s not MAC nor Sigma, but it is very close and buyinh a 24pc set for the price of one-to-two MAC/Sigma brushes is a great plus.&lt;br /&gt;The liquid makeup brush does shed a little bit, but other than that I haven&#x27;t notice any shedding.&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes are very precise and applicate a large anount of pigment to the skin so your eyeshadows&#x27; colors look even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this as an early Christmas Gift from my Boyfriend and I love it. The brushes were very soft and applies on well. I&#x27;m glad this is so affordable that I am anticipating other xmas gifts.. haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in need of good make up brush, look no further. Give this a try and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Great Brushes .Incredibly soft and the brushes are very strong . Their also great for travel with leatherette. I totally love it</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery. Be sure to clean the brushes first before use. Brushes are individually labelled for easy usage. Great quality other than the smell of paint when you first open the package. Still a great buy!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved them this Christmas.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas Gift and it was awesome.  Every brush was wonderful and there were so many of them -- all with instructions.  It was wrapped beautifully and was impressive.  I was proud to give it and the recipient was thrilled to accept it.  I would highly recommend this brush set.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the SHANY pro Sig Brush Set (24 pieces).  The bristles are so soft and&lt;br /&gt;the handles are clearly marked to show what each type of brush is used for. I plan on buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> Quick and quality product!</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeeeee this product...looks exactly like the picture shown above, it came with all the pieces n it was packaged professionally...great quality...the brushes are nice n soft....After I ordered it, my friend seen it n feel in luv with it n so she ordered one as well...I recommend it</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! The bristles are so fine and soft, yet so dense they have a nice resistance to them. I cannot believe the quality of brushes, no shedding at all and the makeup application is flawless.  The variety of brushes is great for every day and special occasions. I love that the brushes are also labeled. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying individual brushes, get the full set it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Great brush set except for the contour brush.  Way to wiggly.  Cannot get even lines.  Can not use.  Other brushes are great.  Contour is a stinker.  Would purchase again, but they need to improve the contour brush.  I&#x27;m a huge make up user and if I state the brush is not that great, you can take that to the bank!</li>
    <li> Very soft and sturdy. Highly recommend this brush set!</li>
    <li> Sheds but not too bad. The quality is very soft. I prefer brushes that are little more dense. But they&#x27;re okay I guess especially for the price. Although the face brushes, does have a very strong gasoline or wet paint oder. I tried washing them five times but the smell is still there. But other than that. They&#x27;ve worth it for what you put out.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Super soft and the bag is convenient.</li>
    <li> My public name is Lance Lowry but this is his girlfriend. Amazing makeup brushes. Worth your money. They look just like the picture. I actually got these brushes back in March and used them every day until around 3 weeks ago. I used them to do makeup on friends for a graduation and they ended up getting stolen. I waited for two weeks for them to turn up. Just got my second set in the mail. Just as good as the first. Very happy with them. And yes they do smell like paint when you open them but leave them out of the box for a few days and the smell goes away! The temporary smell should not sway your decision.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes.  They turned out to be better than I expected.  Good price for all the brushes you receive. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Received my 24 piece Pro Signature brush set, and I am in LOVE! Great brush set with a variety of different brushes for all parts of my face. Extra brushes are great for when I&#x27;m in a rush and I need a clean make up brush. I would definitely buy it again. Great quality brushes for a good price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful, soft and the perfect tools to complete my makeup collection! I&#x27;m so happy that i took a chance on these....I&#x27;ve had them for about six months and they remain to be perfection.</li>
    <li> IM IN LOVE with these brushes! The bristles are so soft!! They are real makeup brushes! The price is actually cheap for the kind of brushes these are. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase. They are all labeled and they state what each brush is for, which is wonderful! I def. recommend!</li>
    <li> Best set of brushes ever! I&#x27;ve been using them for almost three months and they are amazing ❤</li>
    <li> Tons of brushes for a great price. Had to supplement with a flat kabuki and larger powder brush. But the quality is great. The case it comes with keeps the brushes organized, as well as protecting them from dust/dirt and protects the bristles from becoming misshapen. The case has a strong smell at first but it went away after a few days.</li>
    <li> After searching and searching for the perfect brush set for myself I stumbled upon this set, and am I glad! For close to the price of a typical Prestige brand brush, the price for ONE brush, you get 24 fabulous brushes from this set! Once they arrived I began playing with them. I will say as soon as I saw some of the brushes, I could tell some would shed. The oval foundation brush was the only brush I had a lot pf problems with, it sheds like crazy. Also, my contour brush came with hairs that stick out of the brush in a way they should not, and my concealer brush came with some sort of stuff stuck on its hairs also. This is my reasoning for 4 and not 5 starts. I use these brushes daily, and I am pretty satisfied. I usually use MAC brushes, which cost much more. Bottom line- for $40 its a no brainer.   UPDATE-  I hate to say this but my kind has changed about this brush set. My contour brush,liquid foundation brush (both), and other brushes shed like crazy :(. I went back to using my Clinique and MAC brushes...I only use the large powder brush and the eye shadow brushes.</li>
    <li> I am missing 3 of the brushes, but other than that, it is decent.</li>
    <li> Love the soft feel but the brushes shed a lot!</li>
    <li> this is a very impressive set of brushes. very nice quality and good looking. got his for my teen&#x27;s birthday</li>
    <li> I love this set!  Received it a couple of weeks ago.  Have not had the joy to use it yet, but they feel amazing.  I love the colors of the bristles and the hair has just the perfect amount of tension (I think that is what it is called; soft yet firm).  I must admit one of the reasons I purchased them was because of the red bristle brush and the other duo tone hairs.  It will really set off the decorating I&#x27;m doing in my bedroom and this set (believe it or not) is a part of the idea I had for the decor,</li>
    <li> Brushes are good, and there are plenty of them. Not really sure how to use them all. The case is made out of a fairly stiff vinyl/plastic, but I&#x27;m not really using the case. I took out a handful of brushes for the ones that I use regularly and keep them in a holder by my mirror. The other brushes are backups to the ones I&#x27;m using every day. I have a separate smaller set for traveling.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my girlfriend to give on Valentine&#x27;s Day in addition to Shany&#x27;s 7 layers masterpiece set... She has been using the products for a couple of weeks and absolutely loves them. I will let her say more as far as the brushes are concerned:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the brushes is outstanding (better than MAC)&lt;br /&gt;Hairs do not fall out&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are soft&lt;br /&gt;Picks up make-up well&lt;br /&gt;Can be easily cleaned&lt;br /&gt;Handles and black metallic part look way more professional than the metal colored portion that most brushes have&lt;br /&gt;Each brush has its use labeled on it in addition to a paper with all the brushes names and uses&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty free (YAY!)&lt;br /&gt;Great Quality overall for great price&lt;br /&gt;Brush roll is very good quality, looks sturdy and professional&lt;br /&gt;Overall good price, great quality! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased these brushes on Thursday, got them on Friday so I was super happy about that (Thanks to one day shipping) But I would never recommend these brushes to anyone! First off, the bag has a horrible stench of paint and it will not go away! Next, When I opened them, the bristles were not &#x27;contained&#x27; Each brush was wrapped with plastic but whoever put the plastic on them did not do it gently because all of the face brushes&#x27; bristles were very damaged. Annoying, but I got over it. I used them for the first time today and the only one that did not shed is the Mineral Powder Brush. I do my eye make up first and picking out bristles out of it was not fun.. However, out of all the crappy shedding ones, the worst one was the Liquid Foundation Buffer Brush. I did 3 &#x27;circles&#x27; with it and I kid you not at least 30 bristles had fallen out. I had to take off my make up and redo it with my Real Techniques Brushes. I used 8 of the brushes today and each one shed, except the Mineral Powder Brush. They come out to be about $1.66 each, which sounds great and I see a lot of people saying, 24 brushes for only $40.00, you can&#x27; t beat that price! Yes, Yes you can and please do. Even if they were given to me by a friend, I would never use them again. After reading some other people&#x27;s reviews maybe I just got &amp;#34;a bad set&amp;#34; but I highly doubt it.</li>
    <li> So far so good for the price, I do get some loose brush hairs now and then.</li>
    <li> Great product. Don&#x27;t let the reasonable price fool you. Just as good, if not better than the ridiculously priced brushes that I own as well. I prefer these now.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t yet used these brushes but I have to say I am very impressed with the quality. I also like that each style of brush has been imprinted on the handle for those that are fairly new to makeup world which is WONDERFUL!!!!! Shany is a Proud member of PETA and against animal cruelty, and with that being said I know I&#x27;ve made a smart choice!</li>
    <li> Love this set, feels great on my skin, the brushes barley  shed at all. Over all great set</li>
    <li> Fake item! I am so disappointed that I ordered this and it is fake. I can tell by the spelling errors on the back of the box.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles, blends makeup well and probably more brushes than I will ever use. I like that it came with picture list of that each is used for and each brush is labeled as well. I didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars on makeup brushes. These so far have been great and quality has been good. The case they come in has a been of a strong smell when you open the box but I took my brushes out and have them in brush holders in my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Great quality sooooo soft</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them</li>
    <li> I love that I can get a great brush set without payin MAC prices. I greatly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love my new brushes !!!</li>
    <li> I love love this brush set! The oval liquid foundation brush makes me look flawless! So many brushes and love that they have numbers and descriptions on them. They did have a paint smell but just wash them and you will be fine.</li>
    <li> Great brush set for the price! Very high quality and sooooooo many brushes! The brushes are super soft and put the make-up on perfectly.</li>
    <li> So beautiful and amazing. I&#x27;ve already got all my cosmetology friends ordering their sets. Love love love so much I didn&#x27;t even wanna get them dirty.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES! I searched through many sets to find the right combination of brushes made with quality material. These are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you though, other customers aren&#x27;t lying when they say these things smell when you first open them. I suggest opening the box outside and leaving them out there for a day. Clean them once you bring them in and they are fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update*: I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a year and a half and they are still just as amazing as when I bought them! I have not had any shedding from them, even after all this time. Makeup, cleaning, traveling, they hold up to it all. I go to these over any others I&#x27;ve purchased. Quality is A++)</li>
    <li> Some of the best brushes I&#x27;ve purchased, well worth the buy and outstanding price!</li>
    <li> While I am not a professional by any means, I have certainly fallen in love with these brushes. Like many have commented, there was certainly a strong odor accompanying the case and brushes but that has dissipated with airing and washing. As far as shedding, I did not notice any shedding with the initial washing, since then very few hairs have fallen out so it has not been an issue. I absolutely love how soft these brushes are. I have a face powder brush from Bare Minerals that is far too rough on my face and I haven&#x27;t encountered  this issue with any of these brushes. The eye shadow brushes pick up color well and they blend so beautifully. This was definitely a wonderful find.</li>
    <li> These are high quality brushes for the price, and an informative guide for using each brush is handily included. The only additional thing I&#x27;d like is a cleaning guide for girls who are just learning to use makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> This product is must have for all the beautiful girls out there..I am really impressed with the product quality. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love THIS BLUSHES.&lt;br /&gt;It is not only cheap but also high quality&lt;br /&gt; Very soft and easy to use</li>
    <li> I love all the brushes, they are very steady, soft and good quality.  There&#x27;s about 3 that shed a bit while cleaning then but nothing too hectic. I am very impressed,  might get another set</li>
    <li> Love this brushes. Lately I&#x27;ve been obsessedwith make up. Decided to try this after reading reviews. I love the quality of all brushes. And the effects that I can create with then. Alsp bougth the eyeshadows pallette and the blush. Colors are amazing. Very happy</li>
    <li> Ordered two sets of these brushes, the quality is great for the price!</li>
    <li> The whole set was packaged nicely all the brushes and even the makeup brush bag it comes with looks &amp; feel like makeup luxury items. I bought this as a gift for my mom; she&#x27;s hard to please, deserves only the best, and only likes extremely expensive &amp; things of great quality so when she asked me to buy her a few &amp;#34;simple brushes&amp;#34; I made sure to order her a set. After browsing for a couple hours this set seemed perfect. Came on time, the brushes are colored in a fun but elegant way, definitely does not feel synthetic, after 4 months they still haven&#x27;t changed and she&#x27;s a happy gal. For $40 this is an amazing set, makes a great impression as a gift, and I will be buying myself this set as well. I was extremely impressed myself by the softness &amp; gentle application of these brushes. I usually buy all my brushes from bareminerals or mac but I want this set.</li>
    <li> The best brushes for the best price</li>
    <li> Love love love! Awesome brushes. The smell that everyone is talking about is coming from the leatherette pouch not the actual brushes. Great brushes and Amazing price!</li>
    <li> The brushes are super soft I like how the brushes have the name of them on them. Like I said I just got them but I&#x27;m loving them already . I love the packaging too</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! I have been looking for reasonably priced makeup brushes for quite some time and am so happy to have found these! Any brush you can think of is in this set. Really enjoy them.</li>
    <li> This brush set is fantastic! I don&#x27;t use every single brush, every single day, but the ones I do use, work phenomenally. The other brushes are good to have on hand for other things. The brushes lose a few bristles with the first couple of uses but after that, they are perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my first big brush purchase. I am so thrilled with the outcome alongside the price! I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of $$. These brushes work like a charm and they cover every brush need I have!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!  I have several of the it cosmetics brushes and these brushes are just as good if not better.  They look and feel expensive.  They are super soft and have a great weight to them which I love.  Their is nothing I despise more than flimsy brushes that don&#x27;t feel good in the hands (ie bh cosmetics brushes) Buy this set and your good to go!  Great Set!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!  The brushes are incredibly soft and great for application.  I&#x27;m very happy with them!</li>
    <li> I have tried these brushes and find the foundation brushes are great! I use less liquid foundation when I use the brush. And it came out greater Concealer than before.</li>
    <li> First impression is everything , this product came a day earlier than expected which is a plus. The wrapping was very neat and as soon as I opened it , I fell in love . It looks exactly like it is displayed on Amazon containing a 24 pc set . I love the leatherette that contains the brushes , although it does have a paint smell .. The brushes does not have a stench they are very clean and soft and each brush has its own cover. Inside includes a guide for the brushes which is very informative. Honestly , I would give this product 5 stars but I just got them today &amp; have not used them. They seem to be great quality , not to mention the set was not too expensive. I&#x27;m very excited to use them, I will be back to let you guys know how well they work :)</li>
    <li> Great quality. Im a beginner and this is great for a first starter makeup brush kit...love love</li>
    <li> When i opened the package i was just amazed it was wayy more then what i expected! They work amazing!! i love it!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with these brushes! The make applying makeup incredibly easy. They pick up the perfect amount of product and leave a perfect finish without leaving bush strokes. I would definitely recommend to a friend (and I already have) and I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I am honestly blown away by how amazing these brushes are. I didn&#x27;t expect much when I was purchasing them because of the price. But when they came I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Just the box packaging itself is so luxurious! They are super soft and easy to work with. Great for freelance work (which is what I bought them for, cause you could never have enough). I have had mine only for a few weeks now, so I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of these, but I can say that I have high hopes for them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice, however, the F12 – liquid foundation buffer brush and F10 oval liquid foundation brush shed black hairs all over my face. Those were the only two brushes that I simply just cannot use. All the other brushes are wonderful. Since I am unable to use all brushes, I gave 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Loved this brush-set! I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of brushes online and this has to be my favorite one. The brushes are so soft &amp; are high-quality!</li>
    <li> The price was good for the amount of brushes received. The brushes have helped improve the look of my everyday make up into something more professional</li>
    <li> MY GOD! These brushes are absolutely amazing. First of all i never give reviews for any products, but i just had to come back and give a shout out to SHANY cosmetics for their products specially for this beautiful set of brush, they are good quality brushes, you really get your moneys worth. From now own i have faith in you SHANY products. I highly recommend this set o brushes. Comes in a beautiful leather case and cute little box, with details on the brushes and products and you can even sing up for a free make up brush cleanser. im in love with these brushes. will def look into purchasing more of their products</li>
    <li> the brushes feel really nice the problem is that once i opened it from the leather packaging most of the brushes were bended the fan brush that i was really looking forward to is bended the bristles are bended!!!! this sucks! i was really exited once i received it but very disappointed once opened buyers beware they will be bended!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing. Not only do you get 24 but they are top notch. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for exquisite make kit!</li>
    <li> Great product! Would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this set. I bought it for my coworkers birthday and I was so impressed by the great quality of these brushes. The entire office wants to buy them now!</li>
    <li> I like this is more for beginners. But any one really can use the. I had have mine for a while now and I&#x27;m  very much in shock on how good they are for the price I paid. They still feel awesome specially because  I keep them clean and out of the pouch  unless I am traveling, otherwise  I have them in base next to my other name brands ones. Would I recommend  this brushes  Yes, yes I will.</li>
    <li> I received my brushes and am so pleased with the quality.  They definitely have a smell as others stated, but I&#x27;m sure they will be perfect after I clean them.  I may even wear makeup more often just to use this set of brushes!</li>
    <li> extremely soft and durable</li>
    <li> Love the quality and feel of these brushes.</li>
    <li> They are very professional looking,  I love how well they stay soft and I love love love them!</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes just seem... Odd? The angle brushes are very small and dense. The fan brush is way to thick. But the other face brushes and eyeshadow brushes are not bad.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, especially for the price</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my wife and she was very very happy with the set! What more could I ask for!</li>
    <li> So I just got these brushes in the mail today, so far I am really pleased with them. They are really dense and very high quality feeling. There is a very strong smell of paint when you open the brushes but that seems to have gone away alreay, also the rounded foundation brush was already shedding when I pulled it out to look at it. Otherwise none of the other brushes were shedding they are really soft and work well I would definitely recommend buying these because they are so Much more inexpensive then any of the other high quality brushes that you will find.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes. They pick up makeup great but the concealer brushes seem to lose a lot of strands everytime I use them.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes as a gift and I love it. The brushes are very soft on the face. All the brushes came with the name and number on each brush which I love, I don&#x27;t have to be guessing if I am using the right brush for my face and eyes. No single brushes are the same. I would recommend these brushes. Shiny products are the best</li>
    <li> This set is great for me.  Each brush is label for the specific use.  More brushes than I will ever need!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes they are amazing I will never buy from anywhere else but Shany love love love there pro signature collection</li>
    <li> Great Value &amp; Material :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. I&#x27;m so happy I bought these. Their perfect for beginners and pros. Bottom line BUY THESE</li>
    <li> Just Received the brushes, they are very great just as many as the review stated. They are very soft and the only flaw that I found was the scent that immediately popped up as soon as the box was opened, but overall the brushes are a great deal.</li>
    <li> I love the quality to the hairs on the brushes. They are great! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush set!!!  I love that you can choose the particular brush that best suits your needs:)</li>
    <li> I love that the product and its quality its money and time saving</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical to order this brush set because it was such a great price for so many pieces. After reading the reviews, I decided to order it. I am very pleased with my purchase! The set is very high quality and comes with every brush I would ever need (and then some!). The case is a bit large (only because it contains so many brushes), so it isn&#x27;t something that I would pack with me for traveling; however, I can easily take the essential brushes with me in a travel case. Awesome quality and awesome price!</li>
    <li> So, I typically don&#x27;t write product reviews but I must say I was influenced to buy this brush set based off of other reviews and because my Mac brushes were &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; in baggage claim at JFK. Yeah right...I was in a bind and needed brushes so that I could do my cousin&#x27;s bridal party makeup. Because I&#x27;m a makeup artist I have a tendency to dog my brushes out, they never get a break, so needless to say I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these brushes compared to my now long gone Mac brushes and how well they withstood a bridal party of 10. I would definitely have to agree with the other reviews and say this is a go to brush set, I&#x27;ll still be replacing my Mac&#x27;s but in a pinch these did a phenomenal job.</li>
    <li> My mom bought me these brushes for my birthday after i saw a girl on youtube get them. I was afraid they would be cheap and fall apart but they are amazing. Ive had them for about 9 months and theyve held up so amazingly. Im so happy with them. They are affordable and great quality!</li>
    <li> Great set.  Very comprehensive~!</li>
    <li> Omg!!  They are here , and im already in love with my new set of shanycosmetics  brush set .... I was so crazy About them that i apply for the 2 days shipping ,  los amo ya quiero comprar más brushes de esta brand , im in loveeee..... I can do a 10 stars .</li>
    <li> Amazing I really really love it i&#x27;m makeup artist and I use all brushes in this set there no useless brushes. it shed a little bit the first time I used specially the F12 but im in love I really recomend it. another con is the smell is so strong I think is the glue they use, but I don know, I washed my brushes and still have that smell. a pro is that these brushes come in a really nice and elegant packaging I love it too. I also buy the &amp;#34;SHANY Super Professional Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 32 Count &amp;#34; and I put a pic comparing both sets..</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes! I was looking for a good collection of brushes, and I can say that I did the best choise buying those. They are beautiful, soft and high quality. I am absolutely happy with my choise.</li>
    <li> My firt time with Shany, and definitely not the last. I really thought that these brushes would be of a medium-low quality, but I was wrong. At first the smell of glue was strong, but I think it is something with the box (which is lovely) remove the case from the box for a while, and the smell low enough and then washing them completely disappeared. No hairs fall. They are incredible for the price.</li>
    <li> After adding these to my amazon wishlist, I began to read some of the horror stories in many of the reviews about the quality of this brush set. I added a different brush set to my wishlist and thought I had deleted this one. However, my husband surprised me with this set after seeing it appear on the wishlist, not knowing I had meant to delete it.    When the set arrived, I was wary of opening it - let alone trying the brushes out. I decided to give &#x27;em a go, and opened the packaging and was slammed in the face with the over-powering odor of paint. The smell of the leatherette travel case was extremely - ridiculously - strong. There must be SOMETHING Shany can do about the odor because it was fierce. I washed the brushes and had zero problems with the brushes shedding or bleeding, all of them keeping their shape well after drying.    Today was the first time I used them after washing them and I gotta say, I was very pleasantly surprised. They blend decently and are soft but not too soft, and don&#x27;t hold excess makeup. Off of one try I did not use them all.    Pros:  -Good beginner set (I really like that each is marked for their use)  -Soft bristles (no shedding during application)  -Convenient carrying case  -Applies makeup well    Cons:  -Stanky leather case (seriously there is no exaggerating this, it is rough)  -Over-powering smell can leave a lingering odor on brushes  -The eyeliner brush is cut slightly at a strange angle    I know a lot of people have had some bad luck with this set, but it seems I am one of the lucky few. Based off my own experience, I would recommend the brush set but I am still wary of purchasing from Shany in the future.    ****REVIEW UPDATE****    So after having these brushes for almost a year I am ready to come back and write another review! They have been used daily, washed regularly and stored with care. That nasty pleather smell is long gone, and doesn&#x27;t remain on the brushes at all. In fact, the case itself is pretty easy to cleanbecause of the material it is made out of.    None of the brushes shed (all except for the fan brush on occasion, which I do not use very often.) They are still soft and hold/apply pigment well and I am very happy. After having had these for a year, I would change my previous conclusion and say I would buy from Shany again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely hands down the best buy ever. I saw the listing while buying make-up shades, and was hesitant to buy until I saw the ratings. have never gotten a more finished, flawless look from any other makeup brushes. In addition to makeup brushes are very soft and easy to use. Love them!</li>
    <li> Great quality, my mother loved it.</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;m so happy for the purchase of these brushes,and it&#x27;s great that each brush say what it&#x27;s for. So they are a really great set for me.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! And for the money?! You&#x27;d be silly NOT to buy these! I&#x27;m a makeup artist and use all kinds of brushes. These are great!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Perfect for my daughter! We were excited with the quality of the brushes the price was right and brushes were higher quality than expected. One thing I would say is that if you have dogs,store the brushes away from pets.The brushes are made with sable hair and our dog was very eager to play with the brushes. Sable is a very expensive fur, high in quality. This was also a surprise with such an economic price. We can&#x27;t say a bad thing about these brushes. I am very picky about what I put on my face as well as on my 13 year old daughter. I am more than pleased with these brushes. There is more brushes than we can use. GREAT VALUE!</li>
    <li> has a lot to choose from and they are great they come in a great packaging for a very reasonable price. Loved the brushes good for professional make-up artist.</li>
    <li> Super surprised no one mentioned the shedding especially the liquid foundation brush and buffer</li>
    <li> Good brush and good price</li>
    <li> the budding brush definitely sheds but otherwise I love the other brushes</li>
    <li> Was very very skeptical.  In fact, I almost cancelled the order, but I&#x27;m sooooooo glad I didn&#x27;t!  Just buy it!  I&#x27;ve been an artist for 8 years now certified and I&#x27;m telling you these brushes are amazing!  Soft, durable, long handles, evenly distributes product, basically everything you need.  They seriously could charge more!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes after having worn out the set I had and felt I was &amp;#34;armed&amp;#34; with knowledge after searching the internet to learn what to shop for and what to avoid in regards to quality make and durability. I read reviews on this product and decided it was what I was looking for, and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes, they&#x27;re thick and dont shed, they&#x27;re high quality and I am having a ball trying each brush style out!!&lt;br /&gt;Only con: There was a strong smell of chemical or glue when you first open the brushes - but I suspect the smell was on the carrying roll up. After a couple of days this smell went away.:-)</li>
    <li> Love this brushes. Lately I&#x27;ve been obsessed with make up. Decided to try this after reading reviews. I love the quality of all brushes. And the effects that I can create with then. Very happy</li>
    <li> These brushes are great ! Love them! they pick up pigments well and they don&#x27;t shed !</li>
    <li> Very good brushes for the money. I would definitely recommend these to others.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, decently priced and works like a charm with my makeup without the fall out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a bit nervous ordering brushes online since I can&#x27;t actually see/feel their quality. I had the opportunity to sit in as a model for my friend while she took a professional makeup class. The brushes in the set they sold with her class fee were beautiful, but there&#x27;s no way I could have afforded the $350 price tag that came along with them. I took a leap of faith in ordering this set as the description was similar to the materials used in the set in that makeup class.&lt;br /&gt;Boy, am I impressed! These brushes are super high quality and an excellent value! My expectations were far beyond exceeded. As soon as I received them I had to go play with my makeup to try them out, of course. The eyeshadow brushes pick up the pigments and transfer them beautifully. I love the way the face brushes feel against my skin and my makeup has never looked more flawless! I also like that the bristles didn&#x27;t come out all over my face like with a lot of new brushes! I highly recommend these brushes to anyone looking for a great brush set!&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that the leatherette bag the brushes come in had a strong chemical smell when I opened the package. I&#x27;m sure this will dissipate with time and is definitely not a huge deal. It doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the brushes at all.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with these brushes!!! Awesome quality for an awesome price. The packaging was super cute too</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes.  They come in a  box nicely packaged and an instruction pamphlet describing what each brush is used for. Great for someone who is learning how to apply make up with brushes, or for someone who is skilled and wants a great make up brush kit</li>
    <li> These brushes are great.  I am a novice with using make-up brushes and they were so easy to start with.  I would recommend these highly.</li>
    <li> These are awesome brushes. I love my set.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging. Great detailed instructions. Great price for number of brushes. Brushes seem to be sturdy and soft.</li>
    <li> Nice set of brushes , the smell is from the leather package , once exposed to the air you can hardly smell it. Good choice for a starter in makeup artistry.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for a week now and they are really good brushes. I love the set and the pouch it comes in. I washed my brushes before usuing and there were no fallouts or hair thinning. There was a dye that was rinsed out, but the brushes all look fine after washing. I would definitely recomend these.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think the quality will be so good until I received them. Oh lord it is amazing! I really wish I bought more than just one set. The brushes are sooooo soft, and for the price I paid for(it was a promotional price), I can only buy one or two brushes at Sephora, but yet, the set comes with 24 studio quality PC, what else can you ask for? Originally I bought this for a gift, but now I think I&#x27;m gonna keep it for myself &amp;#62;.^</li>
    <li> UPDATE The brushes have held up OK, but I&#x27;ve had some bristle loss with some of the larger ones. The case/holder that came with them fell apart after a couple of months, though, which was irritating. I still like them and think they&#x27;re a good deal, but I&#x27;ve taken off a star. ----------------------------- I&#x27;m impressed with these brushes. There&#x27;s a good selection, and the choices in terms of which ones are synthetic and which are natural are right on. Yes, there&#x27;s a strong vinyl smell from the case when you first open the box, but I expect new vinyl products to give off a smell until they get aired out. Like any sensible person, I washed all the brushes when I got them. I used lukewarm water and moisturizing liquid soap. I was fairly vigorous, dried them on a towel and then laid them flat to finish drying, and I didn&#x27;t see a single--not one--hair fall out of any these brushes during this process. I&#x27;ll update if the hairs start to fall out later, but I expect that, with proper care (i.e., not drying them upright in a cup, not drenching the barrel of the brushes in water when washing, not using hot water to wash them), they will serve me well.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some great brushes but i did not want to spend a whole lot of money. I did my research and a lot of people use so many different brands. Finally came a ocuple of reviews that were pointing towards Shany. I decided to try and boy I was not wrong. As soon as i got them I took them for a spin. Both synthetic and natural ones feels great. make up sticks really well adn does not fall off like other brushes that I&#x27;ve used. I have yet to see how long they last but as of now they are amazing.</li>
    <li> I like how the brushes tell you what they are for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this items for my girlfriend, she was immediately in love with the quality and how fast it was shipped.</li>
    <li> I just typed a really long review for this and it got deleted, so i will just recap what was initially in my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-Great quality and quantity&lt;br /&gt;-This would be a wonderful gift for anyone who enjoys or uses makeup. I know if someone gave me this, I would be really impressed and think they spent at least $150.&lt;br /&gt;-All brushes are marked with a number and what is for&lt;br /&gt;-Great packaging, loved the purple box that it came in&lt;br /&gt;-Great price. Comes out to $1.66 per brush, cheaper than Elf&#x27;s black line which runs about $3 a brush&lt;br /&gt;-Very soft, especially the large fan brush&lt;br /&gt;-Came in a week from the day I ordered to the time of arrival, even with a Holiday in between&lt;br /&gt;-So many face brushes compared to other sets which usually have 20 eyeshadow brushes &amp; just 3 (if you&#x27;re lucky) face brushes&lt;br /&gt;-Great little directional booklet included, with how to use each brush&lt;br /&gt;-Very little to no shedding, even when pulled on aggressively&lt;br /&gt;-I usually always get damaged/broken items when I order online (my luck) even when reviews are positive, and that did not happen with this, so super happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-Leatherette smelled like plastic/permanent marker (Not a big deal, but still embarrassing if this is being gifted to someone)&lt;br /&gt;-Majority of brushes were synthetic fibers and very few were natural or partially natural ( I assumed it would be 50/50 or more)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still gets a 5/5. Will most likely buy a few more as gifts, and know how impressed and excited the recipient will be</li>
    <li> I was ready for a new more diverse brush set so i purchased these. I love the leather case they come in and they are all very soft and do not shed!! These are great brushes and i would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> June 17,2015&lt;br /&gt;I love!! the brushes high quality your getting for a cheap price!! It comes with all the brushes you need. Also the shipping came fast to me it only took 3 days.</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing!! It includes every brush you could need and all of them are super soft and great quality. I haven&#x27;t had any bristle shedding with these like I do with some other brands. The brush holder is well made, a perfect size for traveling, and I love the extra pockets in it. This whole set is super affordable and definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I love how most of these are face brushes, that&#x27;s so rare to find in a brush set. These brushes are really good quality at an affordable cost. They are so soft and sturdy. This is such a great set, unlike others i actually use mostly all of them.. I just LOVE them ! I can&#x27;t wait to try more Shany products.</li>
    <li> After my dog got to my old ECO make up brushes and shredded them, I started looking into buying a new set. There are quiet some reasonably prices sets on amazon, but I chose SHANY becouse even though it was not the largest set, but the most complete. Other sets focused either on powders or liquids, but this set had brushes for both which is exactly what I was looking for. You can find a brush for basically anything in this set and you won&#x27;t need another brush. Brushes are nice, soft and full, easy to hold and work with. I do not even mind a chemical smell they had, the only concern is that the big fan brush in the middle was deformed as well as bristles of some other brushes were sticking out a tiny bit from improperly put on plastic protective caps. Bottom line it&#x27;s a nice set of brushes which is worth the price, but quality control could be a little better.</li>
    <li> They are so soft and they case they come in seems nice and sterdy. So glad I found these babies! Way better than buy every single brush separately.  Awesome!! Can&#x27;t wait to try their 7 layer masterpiece makeup set :)   UPDATE: these brushes are still in good condition after about 5 months and I just ordered another set for clients!</li>
    <li> AWESOME, AWESOME, great buy!! The brushes or soft enough, dense enough and such great quality, and at a steal since the are regularly 98 bucks on the Shany website. I would still pay the full 98 dollars because they are that great!!</li>
    <li> I received these brushes very recently and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase. The quality of the brushes are great and the price is unbeatable! I would recomend this purchase to anyone!</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect from these brushes considering the price.  I was pleasantly surprised since this is a really nice set and they hold up well to daily use.  I have also washed most of the brushes and they look as good as new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super excited about my new brushes. I am a professional makeup artist and always looking for new affordable products to add to my collection. I was nervous about buying a whole new set of bushes from a company I did not know, but I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. I was very impressed with the beautiful packaging. Not only were the brushes laid out in a leatherette pouch within a nice box but each brush was individually wrapped with a disposable plastic as well as a harder plastic protector. the brushes are super soft to the touch and carry the makeup very well. I cannot wait to continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes, so I have nothing to compare them to.  They are very soft, and seem to work nicely.  I love that they came with a nice case, but the case is a little smelly.  Hopefully the smell will dissipate with time.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love these they seemed like a good value for the price (I had a 10 dollar off coupon) so I went for it boy do I regret that I opened them and sure the packaging looks high end and awesome but the paint/chemical fumes on these brushes made me so dizzy I thought I was going to pass out! I tried to figure out if it was the brushes the box or the case that had this smell permeating it and it turned out that it was all three.... I&#x27;m giving them a couple of days hoping they air out but it does not seem promising at this point Save your money and get a different set of Brushes I wouldn&#x27;t use these if you paid me to i&#x27;d be afraid that whatever is causing that harsh smell would mess up my skin/eyes!!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get these brushes!  When I opened the box I was smacked in the face with such a horrible paint/chemical smell I immediately put them back in the box.  I haven&#x27;t decided if I will try to open them again or just send them back.  So very disappointed with these the moment I opened that box.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received my package to only find out it was missing brushes. I called customer service and the sent me a replacement immediately. Received the replacement the next day and I was sure that it would be great. NOT! The second package was also missing a couple brushes, but I figured I could get the missing one&#x27;s out of the first package. So, I got them all out to clean them and this is where I was so disappointed by them. As soon as the water hit them the hairs started coming off by the bunches.  I would not recommend these brushes. I did my homework before ordering and I heard wonderful things about this set, but unfortunately they were no good.</li>
    <li> I got the brushes today. Quick delivery. I absolutely love the brushes. I love the different colors and they are so soft~ one of the best investments i ve made in cosmetics. the smell is bad but im sure i can air it out</li>
    <li> The quality and texture of these brushes make them stand out from the rest of the brushes I have tried before.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great affordable brush set for a while now. I tried some of the higher end names, and I have been let down!!!!!! This set is awesome. It contains synthetic as well as natural brush hairs. The brushes are very soft and made of great materials. I love the details of what each brush is used for engraved on each handle and they also have a numbering system. The leather case they come in does have a strong smell but does air out. I washed the brushes in mild baby shampoo before I used them and for the most part I did not have a lot of shedding. I did see minimal shedding out of the natural hair brushes which is expected, but absolutely none from the synthetic. I absolutely recommend this product to everyday makeup wearers or an MUA like myself.</li>
    <li> I just received  brushes. These brushes are amazing... They are so soft and firm to ensure great coverage and comfort. I love it..</li>
    <li> My husband bought this set for me because he wanted me to have a decent set and the reviews were great. When we received them, I opened them and on the first usage of the liquid foundation brush it was shedding. The buffer brush was shedding worst than it. I was completely disappointed and so was my husband. We called Amazon and they sent a replacement and we sent the old one back. When I received the new one, it too had the same exact problem with shedding. So, I washed them with MAC brush cleaner. I washed and washed and washed. My thoughts were either I&#x27;ll wash it until it stops shedding loose bristles, or it&#x27;ll completely fall out. I washed and rinsed the two of them (4) times. When I started washing the fifth time, I noticed the hairs weren&#x27;t really coming out; one here and there. The brush was still very full. So I washed the other brushes after I got those two to stop shedding. None of the other brushes did shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let them air dry until they were dry. This took about 48 hours for the entire brush, including the bristles deep in the center. I got a little rough with each of them to see if they would shed. The liquid foundation brush and the buffer brush shed a couple of small black bristles at first but then none. I decided to keep the set. I still have a shedding bristle here and there, but nothing like when I first got them. I really do like the set. The different brushes are great. I love the blush brush, bronzer brush and blender. I do wish there was another blender brush, but like I said I do like the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of reviews complained about the strong paint smell of the case. When I opened it I knew exactly what they were talking about. There is a strong paint smell. However, I think the smell is part of the glue that adheres the paper to the box the set comes in because once I took the case out of the box it doesn&#x27;t really have that grand of an odor anymore. I&#x27;d suggest getting the set, but only if you&#x27;re willing to wash the brushesuntil all loose bristles are out.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes hoping they were decent quality. I was blown away with the quality! I have spent a lot of money on expensive brushes and these are just as good or better. The bristles are ultra soft and I have had NO shedding in any of the brushes. I highly recommend these brushes! Save your money.....buy these!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I am a professional makeup artist, and these are a great addition to my kit. The leatherette they come in is also very nice. All the brushes are so soft and they function as well, some better than a lot of my high end brushes do. I am very happy</li>
    <li> Such a large variety for a reasonable price... love the brushes no shedding great quality... will definitely repurchase and introduce to my family and friends... everyone should have this set of brushes... anyone can use this brushes even beginners...</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes a lil over two months ago and i am in love with them. They do not shed. You will love them. You wont regret your purchase. They are like mac quality or better i think.</li>
    <li> Wow. Just wow.  I can&#x27;t believe the quality of these brushes for the price.  I just can&#x27;t believe it.  There are so many types for all of your makeup application needs.  The only brush lacking is a large powder brush, but there is a medium sized one that works just fine and the large fan brush is very versatile.  I love makeup and do a lot of contouring and highlighting and there is a brush for anything and everything you might need to create a professional look.  The weight of the handles are perfect and the bristles on them are high quality.  Some people mentioned a chemical smell to them, but I just equate that to a &amp;#34;new car smell&amp;#34; and it goes away once they are all opened and exposed to the air for awhile.  Again, I can&#x27;t believe what you get for the money.  Forget, Walmart, Target, Ulta, and Sephora.  Get this collection of brushes before someone figures out they need to ask a lot more money for them.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister. I have the entire set of MAC brushes and I can honestly say that these are comparable. The amount of brushes you get and the quantity is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love this. Amazing deal. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Fabulous like in the picture!</li>
    <li> I just got my 24 piece brush set, and i&#x27;m in love with them. At first I was thrown off with the smell, but it ors away when  you wash them with warm water. They are so soft! I love the quality of the brushes and the variety of them. It&#x27;s a great deal for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on aug 31 2014  and i am soo happy with my purchase. The brushes i normally use are MAC, estee or shopper&#x27;s drugmart Quo brushes. Shany brushes are comparable to the brushes i am currently using for fraction of its prixe. The product came really quick-- in 5 days. The brushes were great quality. I washed all the brushes prior to using it and amazed that barely any brush hair fell off.&lt;br /&gt;This is a real good value and a great product. go for it!!</li>
    <li> After hours of research, I finally decided to purchase this brush set. When I received my package, I was very surprised how sturdy the brushes are. As a certified makeup artist, finding a great quality brush set without hurting my pocket seemed nearly impossible until I came across shany pro signature 24 brush set. It really gets the work done! I am most impressed by their face brushes. The package does come with a distinct smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much since I don&#x27;t keep them in the original case. Just make sure you wash the brushes! what I really like about this brush set is that it comes with this little guide on how to use each individual brush. Overall, the brushes are amazing and I might even consider purchasing their red ombre set as well. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this company so far. Many of my friends have spoken of these brushes for some time and now, I can certainly see why. These brushes are extremely soft and durable. All of the brushes are well trimmed and densely packed which are a very good sign and, NO SHEDDING which is VERY important. With each brush being hand made, you can certainly see and feel the great build each brush has to it, assuring the buyer that all of them will last for quite a while. As someone who has purchased quite a few make-up application sets, these brushes are very comparable to MAC and Sigma (better the Sigma in my opinion), and can stand up with high end brands while offering a break on your wallet. Being a set of 24 of the most utilized brushes in make up, it helps give a beginner in makeup the fundamentals with a solid start in their brush collection. Also, the set comes in a wonderful carrying case for easy storage and instructions that indicate the use of each brush; something very helpful for someone new to the world of makeup application. Very inexpensive for the quality you receive and that is something not to pass up. As a woman, this is an extremely good buy and would be a wonderful gift to give. As a stage actor, finding a good set of application tools can be a large investment and this company has been a revelation. Very much in love with this set…I have no doubt you will be too.</li>
    <li> For $75, I didn&#x27;t expect such great quality brushes. They&#x27;re very densely packed (lack of density is usually a problem in inexpensive brushes) , don&#x27;t shed, and there weren&#x27;t stray odd-length hairs sticking out everywhere. The brushes were all well trimmed and even. Even the fan brush was surprisingly dense. My only complaint there was that it is placed in the part of the pouch that folds over, so the brush hairs get bent a bit. Anyway. The handles feel sturdy, and I really love that they&#x27;re all labeled with a brush number and are individually named. The pouch is really nice and plenty large. Even the box the set came in was heavy and nice! Ha. I&#x27;m so happy with my new brushes! If you&#x27;re a professional or serious enthusiast looking at this set, I&#x27;m professionally trained and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> These brushes has exceeded my expectations. I absolutely love this set of brushes. They are extremely soft and great quality. I most definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING!!! Amazing quality, super soft, and so professional. The smell of the material of the case is pretty strong but nothing too crazy, if you leave it out for a day it&#x27;ll fade. Other than that, AMAZING product! And fast shipping. thanks!</li>
    <li> Love them. Have not used all of them, because i&#x27;m not a big make up person. But the brushes I do use I LOVE.</li>
    <li> I prefer these over MAC brushes!!  The quality in them are so much better!  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The bag does smell like chemicals, as many have mentioned, but the smell didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are fantastic quality, and the case equally so too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be gifting this for upcoming birthdays!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the brushes! They came in a nice leatherette and helps me keep them organized. All the brushes I have purchased previously were not made as nicely, but these have a great feel to them. I will definitely purchasing all my makeup brushes from this company from now on.</li>
    <li> Just received my SHANY Pro Signature Brushes and I absolutely love them!!  Best $40 spent so far I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Based on previous reviews, I thought these brushes would be nice.  They&#x27;re not just nice, they&#x27;re fabulous!  I didn&#x27;t expect such a high quality product for the bargain price I paid.  They&#x27;re well-constructed, luxuriously soft on the skin, and aesthetically pleasing, and they do not shed!  The only downside, (and I suspect it&#x27;ll fade over time), is the smell of the case.</li>
    <li> Shockingly good quality for the price. Would make an excellent gift.</li>
    <li> The best brush set ever! I would totally buy them again</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this brush kit! My husband got them for me and I love them. They get the job done, do not shed and they are easy to clean too. I particularly liked that they came with a brochure that explains what each brush is for and each pencil brush is also marked with a name and number. Very convenient. The only caveat is that they can be rather smelly at first. I think it&#x27;s because of the faux leather case they come in. After a few days, however, this strong odor fades and the brushes are good to go!.</li>
    <li> I Loveee my shany pro signature brush set the quality of it is amazing so soft and pleasant in your face i definitely recommend for those who have not purchased it yettt</li>
    <li> Absolutely a wonderful set of brushes! Sooo super soft, well made and a brush for every purpose!  The case is amazing too! Will recommend to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my set.  I&#x27;ve had it 5 months now and I can say that through time and use of them I think they are a great investment and comparable to many of the other high end brushes.  One of the best things I love about it is because I am new to makeup application, it has the brush guide in it which helped me tremendously. There&#x27;s only one caveat which is because they are animal hair, when wet they may smell a bit foul but after a few good thorough washes it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The &amp;#34;faux leather&amp;#34; purse in which the brushes came in did smell really bad upon opening! I have read reviews before mentioning the smell of paint and plastic and they were not exaggerating. After about 24 hours the smell was gone though.&lt;br /&gt;- After receiving the brush set I washed all of the pieces with mild soap. The brushes themselves did not smell like paint/plastic, however, I did notice that a few of them shed a little bit. It was nothing major but more noticeable in the long haired face brushes than the short haired eye brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- The price! You can&#x27;t beat the price! Even on Shany&#x27;s own homepage this set goes for approximately $70, which would still be a fair price for the quality and quantity you&#x27;re receiving.&lt;br /&gt;- Good variety of face and eye brushes. Most brush sets either focus on either the face or the eyes, however, the sizes ranged from tiny eyeliner brush over stippling brushes to a large, fluffy fan brush. (Some complained about them not looking all the same which is due to the fact that the Pro Signature Set includes the best brushes of all collections to date).&lt;br /&gt;- Shany is a cruelty free company! While the brushes are made from natural as well as synthetic hair/fibers, Shany is cruelty free certified by PETA, does not test on or harm animals in the development and manufacturing of their product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: Would definitely recommend these brushes and purchase again if mine got stolen or I lost them ;-) I use them daily and they hold up very well.</li>
    <li> Beautiful professional affordable brushes</li>
    <li> Excellent quality!  No bristles falling out everywhere, they release the makeup beautifully, and they&#x27;re nice and full.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. They came in the mail yesterday and I&#x27;ve already used them twice.. I love doing make up jsut cant afford to pay 30 dollars for just one brush so these are for sure a steal. The little carrying case they come in is very handy to. I would recommend these brushes to anyone who wants good brushes but doesn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars.</li>
    <li> Softest brushes I have come across. HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased these brushes. I was on the fence from the reviews and debating between another roll, but went with these. Some of my favorite brushes come for  this brush roll. There is a bit of a paint smell, but if you open the roll for a couple of days the smell will go away. Always wash your new brushes before use anyways. Baby shampoo works great and is inexpensive. The fan brush came out of shape so washing it  will help regain it&#x27;s shape. Also, I haven&#x27;t notice any shedding so far.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes!! Apply makeup beautifully!</li>
    <li> Came on time. Beautifully packaged and all. They have a weird smell, but I just washed them and its all taken care of.</li>
    <li> These brushes really work and do what they are supposed to do, my makeup goes on perfectly! Love them.</li>
    <li> I love my professional brush set from Shany Cosmetics. They look so sophisticated. The shipping came fast . The best buy all year !!!</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the box and the pamphlet that comes with them describing each brush and their uses.  I kind of already had somewhat of a grasp of what each brush was for but it was really helpful to go though and read them all.  The brushes are really soft and easy to use and I am absolutely in love with them. :) I would definitely recommend anyone questioning whether or not they should buy these to get them.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Very soft, no shedding thus far and I have been using them and washing them weekly for over a month now. This collection has a wide variety of brushes for face and eyes. I just love them all.</li>
    <li> This brush set is great. I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and I love these brushes and this brand. I highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Some of brush hair loose leave hair on my face every time I use it. This is supposed to be professional and good bursh</li>
    <li> i was very excited when i opened the box, and so far, am impressed.It works good and the brush does not shed.</li>
    <li> Wow! I must say I am VERY impressed with this brush set! It is so affordable and high quality!! The brushes are so soft and do their job perfectly. I love the leatherette that comes with this item, as well as the handout that describes what each brush does - I am pretty simple with my make-up application, but now that I have a little detail on what each brush does can transform me on a night out! Will definitely continue my business with SHANY!</li>
    <li> I absolutely  love them!</li>
    <li> I love this Signature Brush Set.  I got amazing brushes for a reasonable price.  Shipping was fast as well.  These brushes are the best and are better than other company brushes.  Shany got my business and I will stay loyal!</li>
    <li> Everyone knows how expensive brushes can get, so this here was a definite steal! The quality and variety of brushes was a plus! I know a lot of people were ranting about the hairs of the brushes coming off, but this was not the case for me. I literally tried pulling the hairs of the brushes to see if they shed, and for the most part they don&#x27;t. I also liked that they included instructions for each brush cause I mean there&#x27;s A LOT of them. Overall, pretty pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The brushes are wonderfully made; they&#x27;re the softest I&#x27;ve ever used. I also love how each brush is labeled with its correct name. The one thing that I was upset about with this purchase is that my package was left at my front door-- Living in an apartment complex anyone could have easily grabbed the box and walked away, but luckily that did not happen. Other than that its a good buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set from the actual SHANY cosmetics site but it is AMAZING! The brushes are so soft and they do not shed at all! I recommend these to anyone. It is very affordable as well for all that you get! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush set for myself for Christmas and I love it! I love the case and the assortment of brushes in the case. This brush set looks like an expensive/professional brush set. I would definitely recommend these brushes. I purchased my daughter a different makeup brush set and she loves my Shany brush set so much better. I really love it!</li>
    <li> I have never bought make you brushes online before and I was very skeptical at first. After reading the Shany reviews I decided to go ahead with the purchase and hoped for the best. I received my brushes about a week earlier than the estimated delivery date, which I was very excited about. Then, I opened the package and I was blown away. The brushes were inside of a beautiful box and then wrapped in a protective black carrying case.One of the many things I like about these brushes is that they are numbered and have a pamphlet with a description of what each brushed is used for.  The absolute best part are the brushes! They are extremely soft and easy to handle. Overall I am very pleased with these brushes and I would recommend them to all my friends.  The pricing is amazing, especially for the packaging and quality of these brushes. If you&#x27;re having doubts about buying brushes online, look no further because you can not go wrong with these Shany brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are a GREAT deal for the price. They are extremely soft and pick up a lot of product. I have tried so many brush sets and this one is by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! There were even some in here that I never knew I needed and now can&#x27;t live without!! And they&#x27;re so soft, OMG  for the price, I couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
    <li> Great Set! My daughter is using them to do make up for a wedding will let you know how this goes! Arrived on time, no issues with transaction, just as pictured!</li>
    <li> First off I have to say I was really impressed by the packaging of the brushes, I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice package. Inside was the real surprised. They quality and the diversity of the brushes is amazing given the price point. You really can&#x27;t beat the price or quality of this set. If you&#x27;re looking for a new set of brushes to update your current set, this is the set for you! Besides the quality they really did a beautiful job with the finish, all matte black and extremely sturdy! This was my first purchase but after this buy, I will most likely buy from Shany again!</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING and you cant beat the price. They are just as nice quality as the expensive brushes where 1 brush costs more than this whole set all together. There is every brush you could ever need in here. Great buy!</li>
    <li> They were good. But they were missing one brush and got 2 of the same one. Overall they worked fine.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing. DEFINITELY worth the price. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a week now and my makeup looks flawless every single day. My favorite brush is the big white bronzer brush. It blends so amazingly and so effortlessly. all of the brushes are fantastic. I&#x27;m definitely more experienced with makeup and makeup brushes, but this is an amazing kit for even a beginner. Super awesome quality and they shipped very quickly! I would DEFINITELY recommend!</li>
    <li> Words cannot explain how much I love these makeup brushes. The price is AMAZING and the quality is top notch! These brushes are so soft (feel like high quality brushes). I can&#x27;t believe I would pay $18 + for a makeup brush at Sephora, Ulta, or MAC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover the brushes come in does smell when you first open the box, but it did not bother me and within a day the smell was gone. I have notice a difference in my makeup application (it goes on flawless and I have a flawless look too). I cannot not stress enough how good these brushes are and the price is even better. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with these brushes!</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my wife, she was very happy when she open the box.&lt;br /&gt;She said she doesn&#x27;t want anymore brush for the next 2-3 years but I don&#x27;t believe her ;-)</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes  a lot..</li>
    <li> AWESOME, I am from another country so I can say that I  love these  brushes  great quality,  soft enough, and  they are that great!!</li>
    <li> Loved the brushes high quality at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> These brushes were a bit larger than I was expecting, but I love them just the same.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for a Christmas Grab bag where you can steal each others presents and this item was stolen the most!  The quality of the brushes was great and the person who ended up with the gift says that she and her teenage daughter fight over them!</li>
    <li> I totally love the Brushes their are so soft</li>
    <li> Brushes are wonderful! Soft and gentle and so far makeup application looks satisfying with these brushes! The only thing I was kind of unsatisfied with was that when I opened the brush set, the buffed bronzer brush F17 had this yellowish glue on the brush tip. It glued some of the brush hair together so that was kind of a bummer for me. I&#x27;m going to try to lightly remove the tough glue, but I think it should be okay. I don&#x27;t know what the glue was from, but overall brushes are great besides that little oopsie I had!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product. I have used cheap brushes in the past so if you are looking for high quality brushes at a very affordable price, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> LOVE this set!  I love doing makeup, but don&#x27;t have excessive funds for a fancy brush set.  These brushes are well worth the cost, so glad I made the purchase!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say ive had these brushes for about two weeks and I love how amazing they make my makeup look on my face. I love how each brush tells you exactly what it is supposed to be used for and if you use them right you hvw amazing results! I would highly recomend these brushes to anyone, especially for the price they are at, you can&#x27;t beat great brushes for a great price!</li>
    <li> You get a lot of brushes, true, but two of mine that I use every day have broken.  The metal part with the brush attached comes apart from the wooden handle too easily.</li>
    <li> Very dissapointed that some brushes shed on my clients face.... I do not recommend this brushes , of all the pack i probably only use 2.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my first purchase of Shany brushes; however they by far are my favorite. I&#x27;m a product junkie and buy makeup, tools and products constantly. That said, these brushes are comparable to EVERY designer brush that I have! I couldn&#x27;t believe that the set was so inexpensive for such soft, luxurious brushes. I bought two sets, one for me and one for my sister, she thinks I spent hundreds on the set! Each eye brush is useful - MANY times when purchasing sets only half the brushes are useful, with this set every brush will absolutely be useful for every artist. I do wish there was a tighter/thinner eyeliner brush (I have many but wanted one with this set). Overall I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase, I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends when discussion my new \\&quot;go to\\&quot; gift. I will be purchasing additional sets for friends and family - before I finish I have to say this set is not necessarily for makeup artists only...it&#x27;s actually perfect for anyone who wears makeup. I&#x27;m going to by my mom a set as her travel kit because of the way it&#x27;s packaged (perfect in a makeup brush roll) excellent for travel, and practical because you don&#x27;t need additional brushes!    Bottom line: Useful, Soft, Luxurious, Quality, BEAUTIFULLY packaged</li>
    <li> This is an amazing pack of brushes! I haven&#x27;t even used all of them yet but the ones I did use are so soft and makes me look effortlessly beautiful! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> My go to new favorite brushes! I love them all.</li>
    <li> I tried these brushes as soon as I got them in the mail and I Have to say I am in love with them!  The bristles don&#x27;t  fall as easy as other ones I have used.  I would really recommend these brushes to friends and family. There&#x27;s not one day that I go out without using these brushes. Absolutely would by more of shany products.</li>
    <li> Just got my brushes in the mail today fast shipping can&#x27;t wait to start using them very excited</li>
    <li> THIS BRUSHES ARE THE BEST I&#x27;VE EVER GOT! This item is just everything a girl needs! Is PERFECT! it has every brush i need!</li>
    <li> They are ok, when I washed them blue ink was coming off 4 of the big brushes.....</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with these brushes. I have quite a large MAC brush collection, but I was in need of some more face brushes in particular. Each brush is so different and unique, and extremely dense. I&#x27;ve never seen such great quality brushes for such a low price. No chemical smell, and no broken bristles. I&#x27;ve used these for about two weeks now and I&#x27;ve fallen in love!! The all black handle gives it such a sleek look, and each brush has found it&#x27;s place in my collection. If you&#x27;ve become addicted to contouring like I have, you&#x27;ll die for the contour brushes included in the set. Thank you so much for a high quality, beautiful brush set! If you&#x27;re having second thoughts, these will not disappoint. I had my eye on them for months and I&#x27;m so glad I finally invested in them. :)</li>
    <li> The makeup brushes were a gift for my wife who loves anything make up related. She does extensive research before buying - the only thing that held her back on buying the brushes herself was the question if she really needs the all set. Well I still could saw her peeking on the product wondering if the price matching this great product or should she go for the sigma one.. Well That made them the prefect anniversary gift. Luckily she loved them! They were just what she wanted. They lived up to her expectations and more. I would highly recommend them. She will use them for many years.</li>
    <li> This brush set is great quality, and not too expensive. I just started learning how to apply make up and this set is a great start. It explains the use for each brush, and comes with a carrying case. So far, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I lost a bunch of my makeup brushes on a recent trip, and I didn&#x27;t have the money on hand to replace all of them. I decided to look for a high quality set that would be lower in price than some of my MAC, Sigma, and Sephora Pro brushes, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting to find something this nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was considering buying a 24 piece Sonia Kashuk brush set which was comparable in price, but my friend bought that set and I felt that they quality was sub-par; her brushes shed and some of them look like they just weren&#x27;t made properly. I found this set after a lot of looking and comparing, because it has all of the brushes (and more!) that I would ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I  got the package in the mail, I was really impressed with the brushes. I couldn&#x27;t stop petting and feeling them; they are so soft! The quality is really nice, and I love that they are packaged in a brush roll. The brush roll keeps me organized and keeps all of my makeup brushes in one place. When I took them with me on a girl&#x27;s weekend, my friends thought that they looked super professional when I opened my brush roll. The box that the whole set comes in is also really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these brushes is better than expected. I&#x27;m happier with these than I was with some of my Sigma brushes; especially the eyeshadow brushes. My sigma brushes used to shed and get a bit ratty after washing. When I washed my Shany brushes for the first time, they held up perfectly. There was no shedding after, and they are in the same condition that they were in when I first received them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my favorite brushes are the liquid foundation buffer brush, the slanted contour brush, the rounded foundation brush, the mineral powder brush, and pretty much all of the eyeshadow brushes. The Liquid foundation brush is a super high quality duo-fiber brush, and I honestly like it just as much as the MAC one I had for several years. I am serious about makeup, and am THRILLED that I found a quality brushset at such a great price. I feel like this set is an absolute steal and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using these for years to come.</li>
    <li> As a professional makeup artist I go through brushes all the time. They get lost at jobs or break.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are great so far. I will say that the chemical smell was so terrible I had to set them outside to air out for 3 days before I brought them in to clean them before using them. Other then that they are a great and lovely set.</li>
    <li> I am in love wit these brushes. I am going to order another set just to have....</li>
    <li> Received these brushes today and i have to say I&#x27;m in luv!! They feel so soft yet so sturdy! I&#x27;m so excited to use these brushes! as a Certified MUA i can honestly say it was a great purchase... ( they do have a strong chemically smell but besides that perfection).. They come in a sturdy Faux leather case wrap and a fancy box. No complaints :)!!</li>
    <li> I was SO SUPRISED when I got these brushes. I am 23 and just now starting to get into this whole make up thing so I was afraid that spending so little on a brush set that I would be getting crap brushes. THAT IS NOT THE SITUATION HERE! These are amazing! They are super soft and sturdy. I just bought ONE brand name, high end brush today from a local beauty store for $25 and this set is just a few bucks more and you get 24 brushes! I think that maybe the quality here is even better than the brush I bought this morning. The only down side I would say is, like other reviewers, they have a strong plastic smell when you open the package. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be the brushes themselves, but maybe the case. If you are hesitant to buy these brushes, I say BUY THEM!!! Totally worth more than they charged for them. I will be purchasing a few more of these to use as gifts for this holiday season because I love them so much!!!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with these brushes!!! Great price for great quality brushes.. they are super soft and well made. I love that there are so many different types of brushes in this set to create any look you can imagine. The set comes with a great travel roll that you can store your brushes in. I needed to change from my Sigma brushes (which cost more than twice as much for only 12 brushes), because they were shedding and lost their softness after several washes. I love this set and would recommend it to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. All the brushes fit everyone of my application needs. They seem to be made well. The only issue is the leather case has a slight smell of paint or something along those lines. But it&#x27;s tolerable and no big deal. Outstanding product.</li>
    <li> Really love the product!!! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> great value for the price  the brushes have a very strong smell when u first open them and it doesnt go away until about the fifth wash&lt;br /&gt;some bruses shed but for the most part i got what i payed for and a huge variety of brushes</li>
    <li> I recieved my Shany 24 piece kit today and I am very impressed with the quality of the brushs. Very soft and plush. I love the look and feel of these brushs. My favorite part is that the brushs are labelled and come with a manual that tells you what each brush is used for,  very friendly for beginners so you don&#x27;t feel confused or overwhelmed by the amount of brushes and can use them properly!  Only rating four stars because one brush came with a small clump of glue on the end of the brisles but they quickly offered to replace the entire kit or do a partial refund.  I did the partial refund and it was a great amount for just one brush.  Very happy with my purchase!!  This is my first brush kit purchase and I made the right choice!</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Very affordable. I was worried about the smell people were talking about in the other reviews but the smell is faint. I love the case and the packaging. Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and are worth the price. I&#x27;m glad I purchased these brushes. They are well made and they apply product the way it should be applied.</li>
    <li> I got these so I could keep my current brushes at home while I go to college. They got here super quick and they feel like literal heaven on my face. I have every brush I could ever need and it cost a fraction of what my current brush collection did. I honestly can&#x27;t think of another brush I would ever need. They do have a slight smell at first, I believe that&#x27;s mostly from the brush roll they came in. I would compare it to the smell of a sharpie. They&#x27;ve been out for several hours now and the smell has completely faded from the brushes. I got them today and have just been rubbing them all against my face because they feel so good. I would definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re debating between these and other random sets.</li>
    <li> these brushes are amazing!! good quality and good price</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! I haven&#x27;t gotten around to using each one of them but so far the brushes I have used work beautifully. Great purchase for makek up enthusiasts! The brushed are very soft and the quality seems to be very good. The packaging did smell when I opened the box however after letting it sit out for a few hours the smell is gone. I would buy these again and again.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. And let me tell you something, she LOVED IT!. Great set of brushes and great price, i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Been using it for over a year now!! Love it and cannot wish for more!!</li>
    <li> Brushes are great, no bristle shedding as I&#x27;ve seen with many.  A great deal.</li>
    <li> Loved them, feel great on my skin and don&#x27;t make me itch, however the handles are starting to come loose</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing.  Even better than expected! The price is unbeatable too.  I will definitely recommend these to all of my friends..</li>
    <li> These came &amp; they were awesome! Love them!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! The perfect combination - lots and lots of face brushes, which you don&#x27;t normally get in the same set, for an AMAZING price! They clean up really easily, and the quality is AMAZING as well! I totally recommend them 😊</li>
    <li> These brushes are such high quality. None of the bristles fall out and they are so incredibly soft it&#x27;s ridiculous. When these brushes were delivered, they did have a slight odor to them but I just laid them out in the case for a day or two and the smell went away. I would highly recommend these brushes. The price is definitely worth the quality of these brushes.</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes! These are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. Soft, affordable, and a lot of brushes for a great price. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a good set.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time.  Very nice case.  Brushes work great for contouring. They had a weird smell to them at first, make sure to clean before using.  Bought to use for my makeup for wedding.</li>
    <li> This brush set is awesome! It has everything you need and more, and the brushes are great quality. Even better, they are cruelty free and Shany is a PETA member; Can&#x27;t go wrong with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: after less than a year, these brushes have FALLEN APART! The black coating on the handles is cracking off, the brush heads have detached from the handles, and I had to superglue them back on. Investing in a pricier set hoping I get what I pay for. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> Better than expected! They arrived in a very nice box and a travel container I wasn&#x27;t expecting. They are great quality and work really well.  I am not a professional but these were recommended by one and I am very pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I have ever owned or tried! You get so many for a decent price too!</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! No shedding. They are soft and absolutely perfect! I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Brushes came packaged and fullfilled by Amazon.. because I&#x27;m a prime member I recieved Free 2 day shipping on this set. Brushes were delivered today on a Sunday. Very convinent. Upon initial unboxing of these brushes I am very impressed. The brushes are very soft and well made. None of the brushes lost any bristles when I ran them against my skin.  They came very well packaged. Very professional set of brushes.  Each brush is numbered and labeled showing what to use it for. Faux leather carrying case is very handy and nice.  Brushes do have a slight smell when first opened, I believe from the plastic protection wrapping of each individual brush. After cleaning each brush the smell goes away. Thanks for the perfect set of inexpensive professional brushes I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
    <li> These are so very soft and no hair fallout considering the price for all of these, im very happy with these! Amazing to receive as my first brush set on my birthday &amp; them work splendidly!</li>
    <li> Large fan brush was loosing hair from the beginning, face brushes are OK. Also, not happy with the eye brushes (hard to apply products).</li>
    <li> Love the way it looks feels and but most of all this starts my journey of becoming a makeup artist</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them. As a makeup enthusiast and beginner I appreciate the description and the purpose of every brush. They are so soft to the touch, come in a useful faux leather casing and you can immediately recognize the quality when you see one. The satisfaction also made me purchase the 7 layer makeup set from Shany which just arrived today, and I can&#x27;t wait to start using both.</li>
    <li> Love it! The feel of these brushes is amazing. The brushes were all trimmed nicely (really, really bothers me when there are random, stray long hairs on my make-up brushes) and the handles were very sturdy. Definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a nice set of make-up brushes.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for over a week now and they are simply amazing! I am a makeup artist and usually skeptical of inexpensive brushes, but after trying these out I will never go back to paying crazy prices for brushes again! You could literally buy this set with everything you need in it for the price of one MAC brush. Not only do you get a huge variety of face, eye and eyeliner brushes, you get a great case and instructions to go with it. The brushes themselves are extremely soft, full, and don&#x27;t shed hairs. They are easy to wash and great to apply any product with! I would definitely recommend these to anyone interested in buying makeup brushes without spending a huge amount of money. I would say these are a great option for someone looking to buy their first brushes because it has everything you need including instructions and at a great price! It is even great for professionals looking to get a greater variety of brushes to add to their kit!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the brushes once &amp; haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them all but they seem like they are good quality. the carrying case that they come in has a very strong, bad odor. also, after reading the individual descriptions, several of them say the same thing. overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase thus far.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are soft and great !!!! I am so happy i got them!!!</li>
    <li> I bought theses for my daughter for Christmas....&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how soft they would be, but I figured I&#x27;d give them a chance. My daughters are always getting into my brushes and what I spent on mine makes me cringe when I can find mine bc they have wondered out of my bathroom.....&lt;br /&gt;I liked the look of these &amp; I hoped it would fool my daughter enough to stay out of mine. Now these are a Christmas gift but I couldn&#x27;t wait so I opened them (no I didn&#x27;t used them) but they were nice enough &amp; soft enough that I ordered 2&lt;br /&gt;more sets for my other 2 daughters.... (So now I can raid their brushes!) maybe I should have ordered a 4 th set for myself!</li>
    <li> Let me first start off by saying this: I&#x27;m a 28, and new to the concept of makeup brushes with specific purpose and quality. Yes, its quite shameless that I never gave much thought to makeup or proper technique. I can say this is now changed, and I did not want to drop a crap load of money while I was learning on MAC brushes. So if you are mom with a teen daughter whose begging you for expensive brushes, or cosmetically challenged like myself heres my non-professional review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;They tell you what brushes are what on them (as well as instructions inside).&lt;br /&gt;They are soft, and much better quality than the brushes you can grab at any store.&lt;br /&gt;Dry quickly&lt;br /&gt;My makeup looks 1000 times better, so they are functional if you are learning like I am.&lt;br /&gt;There a variety to use and play with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A few fibers did come off during application, but this was limited to a few brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation brush was hard to clean (but this could be my fault)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like that I am learning how to properly use brushes and this set is a perfect starter set (at the very least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag it comes in does have a smell when you first open the package.</li>
    <li> I am a beginner and these brushes are absolutely perfect. They are so soft and pick up powder perfectly! Each brush is labeled so there is no guessing what each brush is for. I have recommended these brushes to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes!!! I read multiple reviews on these before purchase and knew I had to add these to my growing collection (in which these have become my new favorite). I am beyond pleased with the quality, especially for the great price Amazon if offering them for. Before usage, I washed them with a mild shampoo and was ecstatic when I saw that only two hairs *in total* came out. The packaging really impressed me and it even came with a little pamphlet for how to use each brush. I think this is a nice treat for beginners who need that extra guidance and it also helps that they labeled each of them on the handles. They are super soft to the touch which is a huge plus to me because I have very sensitive skin. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a quality product without having to empty your bank account for. I would repurchase these and I think they would make a great gift for that makeup fiend in your life. I&#x27;ve already recommended them to my mom and sister. :)</li>
    <li> Great brush set for a very reasonable price!  I love it! Shany Pro Signature Brush Set is what ive been waiting for.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this brush set as a gift for my teenage daughter.  She was so excited when she opened them.  They had everything she could ever need.  She loves the case that they came in along with the description of each brush.  I would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great and I would definitely recommend them. The case and brushes in general are larger than expected (folded up, the case is about 9x8 inches...unfolded the case is 30x8inches). However, it can still be used to travel with. The description on the website explains that the brushes are made from natural and synthetic hairs, and the brush handles are made from rosewood and other types of real wood...I have no way of knowing this 100% but if its true, then its a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;price&lt;br /&gt;All brushes are soft&lt;br /&gt;Handles are lightweight, but not cheap feeling&lt;br /&gt;Mesh extra pockets inside the case (two with zippers, two without) for extra storage for tweezers, qtips etc.&lt;br /&gt;Larger brushes come with brush covers to protect them&lt;br /&gt;Plastic brush guard to protect brushes when the case is folded up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;VERY strong plastic smell. I aired the case out for 24 hours, then washed all the brushes, and wiped down the case. The plastic smell still lingers, but not enough to bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Brushes hold a light-medium amount of product. I had to go back to my eye shadow a few more times to get the color I usually get from my other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;This is my first brush set, so I cant compare it to high end brushes like sigma, but for everyday use, these brushes do the job for a good price.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes for myself. I was desperately in need of new ones because I left my bag of brushes somewhere when I was on vacation earlier this month. I loved my brushes and was very disappointed that they were gone. They were Sigma brushes that my parents had gotten me for Christmas. Unfortunately I was not willing to spend that much on brushes and decide to do some searching on Amazon for a highly quality brushes to replace them. I searched through a bunch of different types and read through all of the reviews before deciding to go with this Shany Pro Signature set. Most of those who purchased this brush set were very happy and I was willing to take the risk. I received the brushes in a timely manner (which says something positive about this specific seller) and did not wait long because they arrived on my doorstep. I was so excited! I opened the Amazon box to find that these brushes come in extremely elegant packaging, which I didn’t expect for such an inexpensive set of brushes. This made me even more excited to use the product. Before I used the brushes I also found that the set came with storage and instructions. All of these extras were making this brush set look better and better. I was worried at this point that the company was making everything look super nice and threw in extras to make up for the fact that the actual brushes were not great. This was definitely not the case! I used them for the first time yesterday to do my makeup for the day and I was so impressed. I then used them again today to do my own makeup and my younger sister’s makeup. After three intense uses of these brushes I can honestly say that they are better than my Sigma brushes. With such an affordable price I am shocked at how awesome this set is. I was not expecting such a high quality set, but am so thankful that I made this purchase! This Shany Pro Signature brush set is perfect for a gift and I am thinking about sending my sister a set of these for her birthday in a few months. I love this product and I highly recommend purchasing these brushes; you won’t be disappointed.months. I love this product and I highly recommend purchasing these brushes; you won’t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> awesome brushes fast delivery</li>
    <li> Superb brushes for a steal!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality !  Literally every brush you could need!  And talk about an amazing price !! 💃🏽</li>
    <li> I just received these in the mail and I must say WOW. I have a few high end and a few &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; type makeup brushes and these brushes are just beautiful and SO soft! They also arrived quickly and in a sleek box in a beautiful brush roll. A+ for packaging! I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> Boy! This set came with a bunch of brushes, I don&#x27;t know what to use all of them for lol! The enormous blush brush has worked amazingly in evenly applying brush to all the facial regions with no spotting, blotching or streaking. Some of the more diminutive brushes have solid yet supple qualities which make them perfect for applying more sensitive and multifaceted forms of makeup in a non irritating, exact style. I&#x27;ve own many brushes in the past like Sigma, XCSOURCE, any many other non brand brushes and they all shed hair when I wash them but SHANY brushes don&#x27;t. You can easily wash them without worrying about it shedding. The brushes are like inexpensive MAC brushes great quality, fluffy and so versatile! The carrying case feels and looks high quality and has a leather look which feels very premium given the affordable cost. I rate this item overall an A+ for its usability, sophisticated design and large array of brushes which I haven&#x27;t been able to find somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. They seem to be high quality but reasonable in price. I am not a professional makeup artist so I don&#x27;t know how these compare to more expensive brushes. However, compared to cheap drugstore brushes these are definitely higher quality. No complaints about the seller, item came as expected and on time.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice collection of brushes, so many different kinds I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a year and I have to replace them already. These brushes shed SO MUCH! I spend more time picking brush hairs off my face than actually applying make-up. Some brushes are completely useless or ruined after a single cleaning (I use Sephora brush shampoo on my brushes, which never ruined any of my Sephora or MAC brushes). They also absorb a lot of product. I find I have to use almost twice as much product when using these brushes because the make-up get trapped. The reason I gave these two stars instead of one it because there is a variety of brushes in the set.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this brush set. The brushes are great quality and really work well with any product. They feel so good on my skin, handles are smooth and they are super easy to clean. My favorites, so far, are the Slanted Contour brush and the Mineral Powder Brush. I will definitely be buying more products from Shany in the future!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes they were delivered quickly and are very soft. Exactly what i expected.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blown away by the variety of brushes that are available in this selection, because there&#x27;s a brush for every different makeup process that you could imagine. The bristles on each brush are smooth and they allow makeup to be applied almost effortlessly. These brushes are much more successful than any other types of brushes that I&#x27;ve tried using, because it only takes one application to apply makeup thoroughly and flawlessly. This kit has enabled me to save more than 10 minutes a day when applying makeup. I&#x27;m definitely recommending this kit to my friends and family because I want everyone I know to take advantage of this product while it is so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how great these brushes are! For the price, I would have thought I would see some major shedding and quality issues. The only brushes that shed after initial washing were the synthetic ones. They haven&#x27;t shed since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are very few legit brush sets that offer so many face brushes. I have enough eyeshadow brushes to last me a lifetime, but the ones in this kit are very nice and it looks more professional when everything matches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes work better than most of my M.A.C. and sigma brushes. The only one I was disappointed in were the stippling/duo fiber brushes. Nothing will ever top my M.A.C. 187!</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes and they ate amazingly soft it dose come with a smell but I believe its the box after airing out the holder the smell went away, im so surprise how good the quality is considering the price. definitely going to recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Absolutely STUNNING set of brushes!! I was honestly shocked, especially for the amazing price! They are the softest bristles of any brush I&#x27;ve ever had. Also, it comes with an entire guide including the title, description and use of each brush. I am so beyond excited for this product!! Would definitely recommend to a friend, and will now 100% be a returning customer. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> This is really a surprise! I better learn how to use these brushes! Good value</li>
    <li> This is one of the best brush sets Ive purchased for this price, I love it!</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived in the time they said it would. At first I was skeptical in making the purchase of these brushes, but I figured I could just return them if I really did not like them. These brushes are much more than what I expected! I love them so much! They are such high quality brushes for a very affordable price, compared to other high end/top brand brush sets. This set has all the essentials for anyone starting to experiment with makeup, or for anyone who just wants to add to their brush collection! I would definitely recommend purchasing this brush set, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> So many brushed I don&#x27;t know where to start.  I paid $50 for a large foundation brush just like the one in this kit of 24 brushes.  I also bought one for my makeup artist and he said it is a great set and he loves his set also.</li>
    <li> excellent product meets its specification and arrived at the stipulated time</li>
    <li> The shany pro signtuare brush is amazing for the price! You receive 24 strong and beautiful brushes. The brushes are made with quality with goat hair,sable, and microfibers. The handles are made out of oak and rosewood. I pulled the brushes to see if any hair fell out and nothing comes out even when I am applying to face. The brushes are pigmented and pick up a good amount. I love these brushes! You cant go wrong with the price either. Next time will try rhr vegan set brushes!</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft and well made. I love the fact that i have a lot of brushes for a really good price.</li>
    <li> Thanks. For. The. Gift. I&#x27;m so haapy..  and I will. Trying. Buy. Again. Thaaaaaaaaaanks</li>
    <li> I recently got these brushes, and i LOVE them. I don&#x27;t haven&#x27;t used all of them but the price was so convincing so i decided to buy them anyway.  I am so glad i did they are soft</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetology student and I have been through my fair share of makeup brushes and applicators. I own several other shany products and stand by them one hundred percent. Their makeup is beautiful and pigmented and their brushes are durable, beautifully crafted, soft to the skin, easily transportable with the leather case, and best of all cruelty free. This brush set sets itself aside from other professional signature sets with its variety of brushes crafted for an array of uses. I love the fact that is versatile with many products such as mineral powders, creams, and liquid foundations. I seriously cannot rave enough about this set. Just so glad I found this set!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought my own set of makeup brushes, and so I looked online for a few days before deciding these were the ones. When they showed up i was super excited about the box, and then about the pouch they came in, and then EXTREMELY excited when i finally got to use them the next morning. I read reviews that they would shed, or that they smelled, but none were true in my case. They smelled like nothing, and the only hairs i found anywhere were the ones that fell off my head. I highly recommend these, if it&#x27;s a gift or if its for yourself you won&#x27;t be disappointed in these.</li>
    <li> Great brush set! I have used sigma and other high end brushes and these are comparable! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love love love them. This is the first good set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. So far so good they seem to be good quality and for the price I feel I am getting a steal. I use mineral makeup and I can already see a difference on the way my makeup looks. My husband even made a comment on how clear and airbrushed my face looked after using these brushes and he doesn&#x27;t usually comment about stuff like that</li>
    <li> This is a BIG set of brushes, more large brushes than I was expecting or hoping for, my first time ordering a set. However the set is awesome, I love it, I&#x27;m not a big makeup person, I have very long and naturally curly red hair with a med to light complexion and no freckles on my face, I am 55 years old and no wrinkles as of yet:) I was going to return only because I didn&#x27;t think I would use all these, BUT!! I like them so much I&#x27;m keeping them and I am going to have a blast learning how to use each and everyone...</li>
    <li> I got them so fast and they are so awesome! Really recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> Just got my Shany Brush Set in and I am SO impressed with the diversity! Can&#x27;t wait to use these for work!</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes for the price is pretty great. The packaging is excellent. They feel good; they deposit color well. I only noticed shedding on 2 or 3 of the brushes. However I will be giving them away because, although SHANY is &amp;#34;cruelty-free&amp;#34;, these brushes contain natural animal hairs. I am replacing all of my cosmetics with non-animal products. I am sure someone will love these.</li>
    <li> This is my first brush set ever &amp; I am in love! They are so extremely soft &amp; every brush I&#x27;ve used, does its job flawlessly! I washed them very well before I used them &amp; there was minimal to zero shedding. Other reviewers are right about the smell they have to them, but it&#x27;s not THAT bad &amp; I feel like it&#x27;s just because they&#x27;re new &amp; the leatherette probably contributes to the smell. I just let them air dry after washing them, as well as laid the leatherette to air out &amp; it helped a lot. The instructions that come with it &amp; numbers on the brushes themselves are a big plus also since I am still very new to using brushes. So, again, I love love LOVEEE this set &amp; am so glad I purchased them!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. This is a great set with many useful brushes. Best of all, they have what the brush is used for imprinted on the side. There was a slight odor to the box upon opening but after washing and using, there is no smell and no shedding. I use these brushes everyday!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Works great!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing steal! I love how this brush set has a lot of face brushes compared to others in its price range, and the brushes are so soft! The handles and the construction of the brushes themselves are well made and feel expensive, and the brushes themselves are very dense. The variety of brushes is great, I did a full face on someone and i had a brush to suit almost every need right within this set! the carrying case is good quality, and yes the packaging does have a plastic/paint smell at first but who cares? the smell i believe lies in the plastic wrapping of the product, once i discarded it the smell wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad. I recommend this to anyone who wants a complete brush set, I bought this to add to my kit because i wanted an extra set of  brushes without having to go into the specifics of particular ones I prefer. Only wish they had a thinner eyeliner brush as sometimes i need to work with fine lines, but heck thats just me.&lt;br /&gt;This looks high-end and performs as such, definitely will look more into the brand!</li>
    <li> OMG! Love it! love it!  I received today at work and I cannot wait to get home to use.  They look and feel like very good quality and for the price it is just that much more awesome product.  When I opened it did have a strange smell but I read on other reviews that its goes away after one day so its is no problem for me.</li>
    <li> It came in super fast!! This is the perfect brush set for anyone who is interested in makeup. The case is perfect for traveling and has zippers, its the perfect size for my other brushes so they can all be in one spot.  All my brushes so far are from SHANY and I love them all! I did notice a slight smell of paint on these but I washed them right away and that smell went away. Definitely will be buying these for my friends birthday!</li>
    <li> I liked the brushes, I am eager to use my makeup course, are great. The case is convenient to carry in the bag</li>
    <li> Love love love! Hairs don&#x27;t come off like other brushes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the brushes. You can&#x27;t beat the price! Nice product!</li>
    <li> Awesome variety of brushes! Came in nice box and case!</li>
    <li> I concerned about quality of brushes before I received the package. However, couple of my friends highly recommended me this product and I&#x27;m totally happy with my decision. These brushes are perfect size for daily uses, mine doesn&#x27;t smell or shed so far. If you need to get good quality of brushes with reasonable budget, I highly recommend this. You wouldn&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush set after hearing great things about the Shany brand. I was simply elated once they arrived.They were everything I thought they would be and more! The packaging is elegant and sturdy. There&#x27;s a leatherette rollup bag for travel. Each brush has its own plastic bag to protect it, and there&#x27;s a brush guide that tells you what each brush is for. Even though I&#x27;m not new to makeup or brushes this is my first real full fledged name brand brush set. The hairs are soft, smooth and helps makeup and eye-shadow glide on smoothly. When I clean them they wash and dry nicely and retain their original shape with ease. This set can easily rival its competitors ( Sigma, MAC, etc) .  I&#x27;m so happy I made this choice and plan to order another.</li>
    <li> Fabulous brushes for the makeup enthusiast. Has a great selection and variety of brushes! It comes with a set of instructions, so its very helpful and for someone who has never owned a brush set (like me). Its great quality and a lot of the brushes are surprisingly dense and super soft. The handles are very sturdy. The packaging was great! I&#x27;m not even going to throw out the box it came in, and I love the fact it comes in a carry bag too, which makes it convenient for travel. It does smell a little like acrylic paint when you first get it, but after its been hanging around, it will eventually air out, and I personally didn&#x27;t have a problem with the smell anyway. I don&#x27;t doubt the quality of these brushes. This brush set is definitely worth the price, and Im happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes a few days ago and I am in LOVE!!! These are some of the best brushes I have ever used. I highly recommend these. I normally have all this fall out from bristles on my chest and wasting make up because the brush doesn&#x27;t hold it. Not with Shany brushes. Complete life changer. My make up doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy on my face nor do I have a bunch of left over product on my brush. I have recommended these brushes to friends and family members already. I also have the bamboo set and those are equally amazing. Thank you Shany for making these.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Set of Brushes. I was worried that it was overhyped or that the quality was not going to be as good as pictured. But this set of brushes are clearly good quality. I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I received my brush set in the mail today and it is fantastic! After visiting retail stores in search of a few single brushes, I decided to check the internet because each brush was about $26. After finding this set of 24 for such a great price I am so glad I did. The brushes are extremely soft and the set is very professional looking. The leather pouch it comes in is great too. I think this set has every brush I could ever imagine needing, and I plan on buying some for my friends as gifts for the holidays!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and apply your makeup very smoothly. I have purchased several makeup brush sets and this is my far my favorite set. This set includes all of the makeup brushes that anyone could ever need. I was hesitant to buy, but so glad I did, because they are well worth the price!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best quality of brushes I have ever tried. Such a variety.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes all though because some of them are real hair they do have a smell of real animal hair just saying other than that they worked excellent and have minimal shedding if any on most😍👍</li>
    <li> I just received these and fell in love!! I ordered a set from China and they arrived a few days ago... but without instructions.. those were nice but not learned how to use them. These on the other hand look rich and tasteful! They are a set of 24 and for us beginners numbered.. also has a list of what they are used for. I am so very happy to of ordered them and it goes well with the makeup kit I ordered for Shanty as well. I will look for more of their items in the future, I&#x27;m very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Great set of brushes for the price, this saved me a lot of money not having to buy brushes individually at the mall or Sephora, and they all wrap neatly in a travel pouch which is really convenient.</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful and were lovely to use, up until a few hours later and the next day my whole face was swollen! Looks like I had an allergic faction to something on these brushes as all make used was ones I had used before really disappointed. Will appreciate it if someone from the compant could contact me.</li>
    <li> I just got it, I still haven&#x27;t used, but it seems to be very good quality. Ill update my review after I use it.</li>
    <li> I totally love this brushes! I applied my foundation with it and it looked flawless. They are so professional and at a great price! The leather pouch is really nice too! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I chose this set. I love these brushes! Very satisfied!! Great job Shany!</li>
    <li> These are hands down a GREAT product, wonderful brushes for the price,  I definitely recommend them to anyone new to makeup that wants a variety of brushes.  they have not shed at all since I purchased them. I use them almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;VERY soft, easy to hold.</li>
    <li> I received my delivery on time and was so excited to open the package! After trying single brushes alone before purchasing the kit, I knew it was a great first brush kit to try. After reading the other reviews I purchased the kit and am so thankfully for doing so. I can&#x27;t wait to try them all out individually!</li>
    <li> This brush set is awesome. The brushes are so soft and my makeup looks flawless all day long. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes about a week ago and they are amazing! So far I have used the medium powder brush and the eye shadow blender brush and they work great. They are also very soft. The price was great for the amount and quality of the brushes. Normally brushes such as these would cost much, much more. Needless to say, I am extremely impressed, and I will certainly be purchasing more when the need or maybe even want arises. Thanks for the great brushes SHANY.  :)</li>
    <li> Im absolutely in love with this brushes!!! They worth every penny..  not only the quality and package are good but every brush has a description of what you can use it for... I&#x27;ll definitely recommend this brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are by far the best brushes I have ever purchased. The price is really good for what you get. I will defiantly be making another purchase. Thanks so much Shany !</li>
    <li> Ok ... I bought 2 sets of these brush set. After used for months. It is ok for its price. Over half of it is useless. both set of F12 has a black streak. So whenever i use it, make face has black streak on. Fan brush USELESS, Brow brush USELESS ( i like something small and solid to actually create a nice brow NOT so soft and go everywhere), Mineral Bronzer USELESS , Mineral blush USELESS, Most eye brush USELESS , Round foundation USELESS, Spoolie USELESS ( i meant it sharp as knife lol hate it so much). What i like the most is F17.   Its a price of 1 brush at MAC. So it worth the price. But i encourage to look at royal or bd before buy this set. You may end up spend little bit more but get something that you actually can use rather many brush that have no use.</li>
    <li> This brush set deserves 10 stars!!&lt;br /&gt;Every brush in the set is special lol theres a brush for every need blending,eye shadow,bronzer,etc i love it. It was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I actually love these brushes. I was super worried about spending a ton on brushes, but these brushes were reasonable and fantastic. Love them!</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes - very soft and every size and shape you could ever need! Really love the quality and shapes.</li>
    <li> Just got this as a Christmas Gift! it looks great! i love the variety and the price ! the bag is pretty nice also!</li>
    <li> I have purchaces these set of brushes for my wife and she is extremly happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says that these brushes are really great with perfect quality and wonderful price. They are very soft and awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She most definitely recommend this set.</li>
    <li> I received mine yesterday and found them to be carefully packaged. The quality of the leather casing is awesome though it does have a slight smell (kind of like paint) as do the brushes but I expected that as most brushes have a smell when they&#x27;re delivered. The brushes were a little out of shape (due to packaging) but once I washed them they sprang back into tip top shape and the smell was much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far there has been no shedding. As for performance these brushes are really amazing. I used the M22 mineral bronzer buffer brush to apply my liquid foundation and it was AWESOME. It left no streaks and gave me great coverage. I used the E11, E20, E12, E19, and E25 to do a brown smoky eye with a sharp wing and they worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I would change would be the F71 fan brush and the B14 spoolie. I would like a smaller fan brush seeing as I don&#x27;t do a lot of body contouring and the brush is a little too big to highlight my face. Now the spoolie is more of a personal choice but I really don&#x27;t ever use this brush. I do wish that I could have gotten a different brush in place of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is an AMAZING brush set not only for the price but for the AMOUNT, VARIETY, and QUALITY of the brushes you receive. They really are worth paying for and I would honestly pay way more than 40 dollars if I had to. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Super!!!! I love this prush set. WOW!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this brush set.  I bought in November and have been using most of the brushes every day and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with the bristles or any smells. I&#x27;m not an expert when it comes to cosmetics but I have gotten compliments on the application of my makeup.  My favorite brushes are the mineral powder brush, mineral buffer brush, brow brush, finishing brush and concealer brush.  I do try to keep my brushes clean after every use.  The shipping was horrible.  It took almost 3 weeks or longer to get to me.</li>
    <li> Love it the bristles are soft and it was well packaged</li>
    <li> After USPS losing my package, I was sent the replacement quickly, no questions asked. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use them! These are literally the best brushes I have ever had! I have had everything from dollar store brushes to Mary Kay brushes and these beat all. There is such a huge selection and the leatherette helps keep them in one place. I had debated buying brushes from sephora, but just couldn&#x27;t see spending $100 on 4 brushes. I would recommend these to everyone looking for a Big Bang for your buck! I will also be reviewing these on my YouTube channel to get the word out further!</li>
    <li> The package looks high quality and professiona. it did smell from the plastic but it aired out and didn&#x27;t bother me. The bristles / hair are very soft and seem long-lasting. The black handles look very sophisticated. comes with a guide on what the brushes are used for. It even says so in the brushes. This brush set meets all my expectations and just LOVE it. Can&#x27;t wait to play with them! Great deal on the price.</li>
    <li> Im so happy with this brushes they are very good to work is a excellent choice. Im new in this makeup world and Im so happy with this choice...LOV IT!!!!! SHANY VERY GOOD BRAND AND VERY NICE PRODUCTS 100% RECOMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> i was nervous about buying these brushes at first, but they came and they are amazing. they come in a cute lil bag to hold them, the bag smells like new paint but the brushes them selves dont smell, i like that the brushes are marked for what they are used for, they are nice and soft and i would highly recommend them, im even thinking of buying a second set!</li>
    <li> UPDATE!!!!!!! Almost two years later my brushes are still holding up and are in great condition. I don&#x27;t have a single complaint at all. I&#x27;ve washed them after every use and they aren&#x27;t falling apart, shedding, loosing shape, or anything else that could happen.   I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m saying this but for those of you who don&#x27;t know YOU&#x27;RE SUPPOSE TO WASH YOUR BRUSHES BEFORE PUTTING THEM IN YOUR MAKEUP THEN ON YOUR FACE!!!!! These are being shipped to you which means they go from place to place with dust, allergens, and all kinds of things that irritate your skin, eyes, mouth, etc.   When i bought this brush set it was around 50 bucks. I received my package the next day considering that I am a prime member. I washed the brushes asap and realized that the duo fiber brushes shed as soon as a began to wash them. I used the brushes after they had dried and haven&#x27;t seen any bristles on my face yet. Everyone is always comparing brushes to MAC, Sigma, Sedona Lace, etc. but if that&#x27;s the case how about go out and just buy them instead of trying to get a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; alternative. If the drop off wasn&#x27;t off my porch then 5 stars would of be rewarded without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I JUST RECEIVED MY SHANY BRUSH SET IM IN LOVE♡I WOULD TRULY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES DOIN MAKE UP AS MUCH AS ME:) THERE EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED ON THE TITLE</li>
    <li> Great quality ! Received in nice packaging! I&#x27;ve been using them for over 2 weeks now and have worked great.</li>
    <li> hermosas  recomendadas</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this brush set! I love how organized they came and the pamphlet with the explanation as to what each one is individual used for , As for the performance I have to give 5 stars ! I am so happy with set and my boyfriend who bought them for me is also happy with how well priced they were. I definitively recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these sets.  The second set I purchased on February 25, 2015. Money well spent!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loved it...Awesome xmas present</li>
    <li> Loved The brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING! Absoultely loved it!</li>
    <li> I am more than pleased with this brush set. The brushes are so soft, handles are so sturdy and the quality is exceptional. I have Sigma brushes and I&#x27;m loving these brushes even more. This brush set is an awesome buy and worth way more than what they are selling them for. I&#x27;m going to purchase another set for my personal use.</li>
    <li> Such a great gift! By the far the best brush set I have bought at a very reasonable price. I highly suggest you invest in them!</li>
    <li> My daughter had been looking for make-up brushes and everything we found in stores were either really poor quality or outrageously expensive.  After reading the many positive reviews of the SHANY brushes and having been very pleased with a previous order of SHANY lipsticks, I ordered these for my daughter for Christmas.  To say we were impressed is an understatement.  Everything was fantastic.  They come in a very substantial box so everything was well protected.  The brushes are laid out in a very nice folding case so they have a place to be stored and are easy to travel with.  The brushes themselves are beautiful and just what I was hoping for...high end brushes without the high end price tag.  There are also instructions for using the various types of brushes which is great for my teenager.  When she unwrapped her gift, she was thrilled!  Thank you SHANY for a great product!</li>
    <li> My husband bought me these brushes for Christmas and I love them !!!!! I fell in love with them since I saw a few reviews on YouTube and decided to ask him for it, best purchase ever the hair doesn&#x27;t fall off there a soft but firm perfect for applying make up. I would recommend this to anyone. The packaging and the design are beautiful extremely happy wth them .</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes is better than expected. I&#x27;m happy with these especially the eyeshadow brushes. I love it..</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!!! No shedding, great for beginners looking to learn how to use each brush.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter-in law and she loves it</li>
    <li> I am not new to make-up or it&#x27;s products. I purchased these brushes for the price and thought I would give them a try. I&#x27;ve used majority of the brushes and I&#x27;m not super impressed. A couple of the brushes have hairs falling out already after minimal and gentle use. They are good for someone who is starting out or on a budget. The smell is a bit much, but it fades over time.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. No bad scent, they wash well with no shedding so far and they hold and distribute product well. I will definitely buy again as soon as I find an identical  set without mineral brushes.</li>
    <li> I am on love with these brushes! The case has a funky smell but other than that, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the brushes!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Very soft!&lt;br /&gt;Received in less than a week!</li>
    <li> so excited to receive these from my mother for Christmas. They smelt of paint slightly when they came out but within an hour it was gone. They are so soft and I tested the eye and mineral foundation brushes and they worked wonderfully . Huge variety perfect for enthusiasists or pro makeup artists looking for a personal or work set. No issues with shedding as some people had said. Great value great brushes.</li>
    <li> I am a very financially conscious shopper and I had a few crap brushes but what I really wanted a set. However, I didn&#x27;t want to give up quality for an inexpensive brush set. But I thought, what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it out. I am in love with these brushes! I did not believe it was possible to get good quality brushes that were soft without paying a hefty price but this brush set is the proof that you can have your cake and eat it too!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, who is a cosmetology student, and she loved them!  She was impressed with the quality of the brushes and the number of them as well. I would recommend this product to anyone who knows about make-up accessories.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely fantastic!! I have found them to be equal or better quality than some high-priced department store brands, for a fraction of the cost! I love the feel of these, and my friends were so jealous that I had to buy them a set for their birthday!</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes as a gift to myself.  I love these brushes.  I am extremely pleased with the quality of these brushes as well.  This set has every brush you need and there will be no need to look further, not to mention that the price is great as well.</li>
    <li> I have fun with them!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a set of brushes for a while. These brushes are great. I am so happy I bought them!</li>
    <li> I was uneasy about ordering it at first but Omg, it is awesome and I love it! Great quality, satisfied customer!!</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes and they work great so soft and I did not get any fall outs from any brushes I would have gave it five stars but as I was reading the brushes name on the brushes there was two of them that had the same name but lucky I had the papers to see which brushes was the right one but good thing it came with a paper to show us what these brushes are for I will order from Shany again ! And ones you open it you up get a plastic smell but that was fine it was the leather which I let the leather air out it went away. Soon I&#x27;ll be ordering again(:!!!!</li>
    <li> An amazing collection of brushes. The black faux leatherette is so chic and is a perfect match to the sleek black brushes. The brushes are super soft &amp; very pretty. A great set of brushes for everyday or professional use.</li>
    <li> these where the worst brushes ever i got them and at the beginning i was inlove with them but then after they were shedding and also when i washed them they didnt dry as fast as my other ones and they started to smell really bad and i ushed the brush guards to dry them</li>
    <li> awesome... found later for a lot less than what I paid but oh well I still like them... now if only I can figure out where I put them we will be great</li>
    <li> I still can&#x27;t believe how amazing this brushes are! I&#x27;m a makeup artist in the progress! I started building my collection a while ago and even though I had a good amount of brushes, I wanted a brush set that looked professional for makeup that has to be done on people other than myself. These babies look professional and high end! So honestly if you&#x27;re looking for good quality and a good amount of brushes for a decent price this is it!!! Also, I want to add that this set has all the right brushes for face makeup which is hard to find on a set, but it does not have a big variety of eye brushes like it does for the face but you still get more than what you paying for!</li>
    <li> Best quality and the brushes are well build so they won&#x27;t come apart. Im very satisfied with this purchase and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more SHANY products. First time buying from SHANY and I&#x27;m impressed! Its worth buying and I got my brushes on the day assigned.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this brush set for A LOT of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY - These are high quality brushes. Over the years I&#x27;ve purchased brushes from MAC, Maybelline, True Colors, Sephora,  Bare Minerals and more, and these compare to just a few MAC and Sephora brushes I&#x27;ve found, but two of those brushes always cost the price of this entire set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE - I&#x27;m shocked Shany is able to make a 24 piece set this good, with natural and synthetic fibers (that are CRUELTY FREE and PETA approved) for this price.  I&#x27;ve found natural brushes for $60 a piece, so a 24 piece set is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed all of these brushes out of the box and had VERY LITTLE shedding. I&#x27;m talking like maybe 12-16 hairs total for the entire set, and I&#x27;m not very gentle when I wash my brushes.  And I even used the brow/lash comb to comb the fan and a foundation brushe out while they were wet.&lt;br /&gt;So what if the fan brush had a few hairs on the edges that weren&#x27;t perfectly straight upon immediately unwrapping - these things happen and they relax after you wash them, so relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any handles popping off or any chunks of hairs falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 2 brushes that bled and those were the Oval Liquid Foundation and the Liquid Foundation Buffer Brush.  They bled a little, turning the water in the bowl grayish, but the water was clear in the bowl while rinsing and the water stayed clear when I put them in a 50-50 water rubbing alcohol solution that was intended to make them bleed if they were going to, to get it all out.  I had a very similar MAC brush that came in a travel set that bled every time I washed it for years, so the fact that these white-tip liquid foundation brushes quit bleeding after the first wash was very impressive. And the red-tipped brush I expected to bleed the most didn&#x27;t bleed at all - shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more pleased with this set.  Okay maybe I could if there was a bent tip liquid eye liner brush, but besides that I am so beyond happy I caved and purchased this set.  If you love makeup and you want amazing brushes, this IS an amazing set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism (which isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve experienced this with brushes), is these brushes smell like chemicals upon opening.  Suggest opening these in a fairly well ventilated area, or in the bathroom with the fan on.  The paint they use on the handles gives off fumes (airing out) while they are trapped in the little box, so they smell of chemicals when you open them.  After one wash, the smell goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy and pleased with this set, I will definitely be purchasing this set as a gift for friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLCat I am so beyond happy I caved and purchased this set.

The paint they use on the handles gives off fumes (airing out) while they are trapped in the little box, so they smell of chemicals when you open them.  After one wash, the smell goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy and pleased with this set, I will definitely be purchasing this set as a gift for friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC</li>
    <li> I am a beginner in using make up, I did a lot of research on what is the best brush set at an affordable price. I found that this pro signature brush set by Shany, is the best I&#x27;ve found. I have washed them and used some of the brushes already. They dry quick and they also do not shed that much either. They are also super soft.</li>
    <li> Really great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Pros:  These brushes are super soft and full size!  They feel great, well balanced in the hand and fabulous on the face!  The roll up pouch is vinyl and smells like  --- vinyl. A quick wash and airing take care of that.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I haven&#x27;t found any!  Jo</li>
    <li> So beautiful set. They are soft and must have. My first set of brush was their bamboo set and I love them so much and decided to buy this Pro Signature brush. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Nice brush set except that they begin to shed after a few uses.</li>
    <li> They came in great conditions ! And came before the date that was given Really happy, they function perfectly and no hairs come off ! giving them 5 star</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this set! It was most definitely worth the money. The brushes are made very well and the quality is amazing. I did so much research trying to find a good set and I&#x27;m so glad i decided to go with this one. I also like the fact that it comes with a description of what each brush could be used for. I highly recommend this brush set!</li>
    <li> I must say I&#x27;m very impressed by this brush set from the packaging to each brush . I&#x27;ve always used brushes but never purchased a full set , I admit I love the decricption guide and uses for each brush possible to help me learn all the different types and there uses .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> I love this set!! Good quality and so many pieces!!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes, good quality.</li>
    <li> Absolutely outstanding product! Cannot believe the price too! It came very well packed, and all brushes were in beautiful condition. I use the brushes for the first time in a make up client, who told me they were very supersoft</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so far...they are soft and such a selection.  There is a brush fro everything you could think of.  quick delivery and prompt and on time!</li>
    <li> i LOVE MY NEW BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> Loves this set. Just have to learn a little more what brush to use where..</li>
    <li> The best brush set ever!! I love them.</li>
    <li> Great set. Was looking into purchasing Sephoras&#x27; brush set for $125 dollars. Glad I found these. Look forward to using these brushes, you can tell they are high quality.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 of this product, arrived today after just under a week, from the USA to IRELAND, super fast delivery, i am so happy with my brushes, they are super soft and they are made so well i know i will have them for many a year to come, i even ordered a set for my sister as a gift for christmas coming up soon, they come in a leather pouch which is so handy for storing, there is an instruction leaflet inside explaining which brush is for what purpose, overall i would rate these brushes 10/10, i love my makeup and never really had proper brushes but now i have every single brush i could ever want, cant say enough about these other than i am extremely happy and would order from Shany again as i was super impressed with the delivery and the quality of the product,</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! I gave them a wash to get rid of the smell... it&#x27;s really weird.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using MAC brushes, I came across this and I did some research and they are totally amazing they are incredibly soft I couldn&#x27;t believe I got such great brushes for an incredibly accessible price I would buy them again!</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived yesterday and they did not disappoint. The brush set case had a fake plastic smell when I first opened the box. The brushes themselves don&#x27;t smell though! The smell is more of the plastic within the case set rather than the brushes themselves. I let the case and brushes air out for a day and I don&#x27;t notice a smell any longer. Now, the brushes themselves are of surprisingly good quality. I&#x27;m astonished that I paid relatively so little compared to the quality that you get. I tried out the liquid foundation brush today and am thoroughly pleased with the performance. I love these brushes! You definitely get a deal with these brushes, go ahead and try them out! I have yet to try out the other brushes but will update if anything goes wrong once I do and how they hold up after a wash.</li>
    <li> Well, I thought I was setting myself up to be disappointed because a price like this for this much product and variety had to mean I was going to be picking off brush bristles stuck in makeup all over my face.  But, I loved the look of this set and hoping for better results I got them anyway (after lots of comparing to similar sets) and I am so happy I did. The selection of brushes: all you would ever need - and more. I am the kind of person that sticks to the makeup looks that I love and know how to pull off perfectly - but this set is an invitation, or a dare even, to get creative and try new makeup styles you haven&#x27;t really thought of playing with just so you can use all of the brushes. They look like a couple of hundred dollars well spent - sleek, elegant and beautiful. Yes, the bag has a very strong plastic smell - not a deal breaker, it fades away quickly, and the brushes don&#x27;t carry the smell. The bag is a plus, so I don&#x27;t find this to be a problem - left it open overnight and it was barely there the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bristles - SO SOFT! As soon as I received the package, I played around with them for a while to see if any of them shed, trying to put my worrying to rest, and only one bristle fell out of the Buffed Bronzer Brush during my ridiculously skeptic experiment - thats it. Then I washed them, starting with the Buffed Bronzer Brush (I was looking for the catch to this set, because there HAD to be one) - no shedding at all, right back to perfect form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for long-term use, well, I&#x27;ll make sure to update this review after the brushes have had their fair share of use and washes, I&#x27;m going traveling for a bit soon, so lets see how the set holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they arrived a couple days early, which is always a fantastic thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I feel pretty idiotic for lusting after sets that cost the equivalent of a plane ticket to paradise for so long. Whatever, MAC. I&#x27;m in love with my brush set.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes. The smell everyone is complaining about is the fumes from the glue that&#x27;s used to keep the hairs in the brisk handle. It&#x27;s a strong smell because it&#x27;s packaged tightly after they&#x27;ve been glued.&lt;br /&gt;once you open them, lay them out to air out for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;smell will go away.&lt;br /&gt;brushes are great quality and I&#x27;m pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I ordered these.</li>
    <li> This is a great set for the price. I was actually impressed. I have been using cheaper brushes from the drug stores. I was considering buying a set but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the Sigma price. Sedona Lace is a bit cheaper but, if you compare the prices you get more for your money with this set. I checked out some reviews on YouTube and decided to give them a try. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The pros are the bristles are really soft. Usually the cheaper brand brushes are very stiff and coarse and you don&#x27;t want this in an eye brush. Nobody wants to be poked in the eye! The eye brushes applied my makeup smoothly and painlessly! Another pro is the variety of different brushes in the set. A lot of times you have to buy an eye brush set and then a face brush set. You get pretty much all of it in this set. A few of the eye brushes are similar, but that isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I like that so I&#x27;m not always using a dirty brush within the week. The cons are for one the fan brush sheds. Wasn&#x27;t too big of a deal for me, I don&#x27;t really use it. I didn&#x27;t like that there were not more blending/tapered blending brushes. For my eye shape I prefer the tapered, but everyone is different. However, I would still highly recommend this set for those that didn&#x27;t want to pay the higher price tag. It still isn&#x27;t cheap but compared to others it is a great deal for the price and quantity that you get! Great Job SHANY!</li>
    <li> Love this brush set. So many brushes and great quality. I just ordered a second set for my best friend for her graduation</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how great the quality of these brushes! The set includes every brush you could need, and each brush has the name located on the handle for beginners that may not know which is which. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> Good price. Good brush quality. Different style of brushes. Best and fastest shipping.</li>
    <li> Great item,  quality brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes pleasantly surprised me. I thought for the price (which can be the price of just one high end brush) that these brushes would be low quality, however they are very sturdy and the hairs are extremely soft. I have tried almost all of the brushes at this point and of all the ones I tried I only disliked one brush (the &amp;#34;brow&amp;#34; brush is a bit too soft to work well with pomades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought these with the &amp;#34;Fusion Eyeshadow Palette&amp;#34; and the eyeshadow brushes apply color very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this set of brushes for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved them! She said they were the best brushes she&#x27;s ever tried for their price. Very comparable to real techniques. Thank you shany!</li>
    <li> Very Large Collection and Nice!</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised with how much I like these brushes. I&#x27;m a former makeup artist and pretty picky with my brushes.</li>
    <li> Great value! Brushes deposit color wonderfully. I specifically love the red tip contour brush! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY SHANY BRUSHES! Great value for such a decent price. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They come in a nice box and roll up brush holder. Love love love!</li>
    <li> I have been in need of a new makeup brush set for years now! I have been using mostly E.L.F brushes , so I was amazed when I received this package. The brushes are so soft, but definitely hold enough product to get the job done. The handles are very nice and super durable, my cheaper brushed always felt like the head was going to pop off the wooden handle. You do not feel that at all with these. I love how diverse they are. There is a brush for every makeup need! The leatherette case is a huge plus, now my brushes aren&#x27;t exposed to any and everything they go near. This is an absolute wonderful brush kit. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I just recived my set! It&#x27;s so lovely. The brushes are so soft and sturdy. I&#x27;m in love with the fact that they all don&#x27;t look that same. Adds personality to it all! I absolutely adore the fact they it comes with an instruction packet as to what brushes are in the collection and the what they&#x27;re used for. I was going to do a YOUTUBE review of how amazing this brush set was until I discovered by reading the back that these brushes ARENT vegan because of the goat and sable hair. I was very disappointed because of the fact that when I looked up &amp;#34;vegan makeup brushes&amp;#34; these beauties showed up. I guess I should have read a bit more but I was just so blown away by the price and quality I purchased them in a heartbeat. I&#x27;m still content with my purchase but a little but sad over the fact they&#x27;re not vegan.</li>
    <li> For the price they are definatly worth it, such great brushes! Such a great purchase!!</li>
    <li> This set is much larger than expected, which was a very pleasant surprise. All of the brushes are fantastic and have very thick bristles, which is perfect for application. I am thoroughly ecstatic with my purchase and will buy again should i need another set.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality brushes for the price; very soft; holds make up well; fast shipping; quality packaging; and ea brush is labeled which is really helpful for a beginner. I am really satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Brushes are FAB! I love the leatherette it comes in. I used it in a makeup seminar they work very well. Amazing quality for such a low price, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it!! I had my doubts but when I opened looks very good brush, well at least better than I expected. no regrets</li>
    <li> Some of the best makeup brushes I&#x27;ve owned. These are high quality and hold the makeup to your skin perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the softnes of the brushed great quality!</li>
    <li> Wow!! I am so impressed, by far some of the best quality brushes I own! Great variety of  brushes and they are all extremely soft and feel like expensive brushes. I would say to me they could even outcomoete sigma brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the best makeup brush set regarding quality and pricing I have ever found on amazon!!</li>
    <li> Great brush set for a very reasonable price! I love it! Shany Pro Signature Brush Set is what ive been waiting for.</li>
    <li> Amazing set of brushes !</li>
    <li> amazing, soft, work great.</li>
    <li> Love this brush set! It&#x27;s a lot of bang for your buck and as a makeup enthusiast looking to expand my knowledge it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. The labels on each brush are super useful and the brushes while being very soft are still effective and precise. I spent a long time debating between different beginner sets and comparing prices/reviews/amount of brushes and I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase- I&#x27;m liking them better than my Sephora brushes!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE this brush collection from SHANY! I&#x27;ve always used Chanel brushes that were previously purchased for me. The time came for me to purchase my very own first set of brushes on my own and I quickly discovered that I just didn&#x27;t have the Chanel money for an entire collection like what SHANY is offering . After tons of researching this collection turned out to be the Highest quality at the most reasonable price point. SHANY really delivered an amazing collection that I plan on using for a very long time!!!!! Thanks SHANY</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I found Shany products online via Amazon originally when I was looking for Nail Art sets but now I&#x27;ve discovered their makeup and brushes and have become an absolute ADDICT. They&#x27;re very affordable and reasonably priced without sacrificing quality. This brush set is every brush you&#x27;ll need in your set - both basic and advanced. It comes with instructions about each individual brush, a leatherette for storage/travel and additional plastic covers for the larger brushes in the set. On top of it all they&#x27;re cruelty-free too. Love it, totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> I Recieved my brush set yesterday and I loved it. the bristles on the brush are so soft. To be honest I have never felt brushes so soft before. I&#x27;m beyond happy with my brushes. Thanks to amazon and shany!!!!</li>
    <li> love this brush set! awesome deal for the price! great value!</li>
    <li> Although the case does have a very strong &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell, the quality of the brushes is great for the price.  This kit has absolutely everything I need, great variety of brushes!  I love that the brushes are labled with what they are used for, plus the instruction sheet that came with the set.  Perfect for anyone who is a beginner or just learning how to use additional makeup products. I&#x27;m experienced with eye brushes, but not with foundation brushes, and this is the perfect set for me to get into using foundation brushes, powder brushes, buffers, etc.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! they will work perfectly for my stage makeup class and beyond! Sold on Shany products now!</li>
    <li> Wow! Amazing for price a must... Received today and impressed with quality would buy again in heart beat.  I own super expensive rare, name brand( Mac, Smashbox,Stila) , to cheapies (Sonia,E.l.f.) and was amazed at quality.</li>
    <li> Amazon did an amazing job in having these delivered when they said they would but these have to be some of the worst makeup brushes. They are better than some but for their price and how they are suppose to be a better brand and quality they shed like it the cool thing to do its unbearable. ELF brushes are better quality.</li>
    <li> I wanted to put these brushes to use before providing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course all that is new looks good and performs well, but I really expected a longer life out of these brushes.  I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m adamant about keeping my brushes clean.  I clean the brushes well every 2 weeks and in between I use a damp soft cloth with mild brush cleaner and sway my brushes back and forth to keep them clean after each use.  I am always careful not to wet the brush to much so that the metal base doesn&#x27;t come un glued.  So far all the smaller brushes are holding up well, I can&#x27;t say the same for the bigger brushes (blush, contour, foundation, etc) they have all come loose from the base and I&#x27;ve had to glue them back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My MAC brushes that go thru the same regimen and I&#x27;ve had way longer than these are still in superior shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for.  :-)</li>
    <li> Good quality, funky smell at first nothing a little airing out wont take care of. Soft bristles love the all black handles.</li>
    <li> Good value for price, bought 4 sets for gifts</li>
    <li> I love my shany brush set. All the brushes are great quality the packaging is nice. And they are great brushes to use. I would gladly recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes have been great. They are high quality and well made. I also like that they say what each brush is intended for on the handle. I would recommend them, they are great for the price too!</li>
    <li> Just received my brush set I have got to say I am in love with this product!!! It arrived in like 2 days which was so awesome! Once o received it I was so impressed by the packaging it arrived shrink wrapped and so tightly packaged to avoid any damages! I loved the fact that it has its own guide and tells you what brush is for what! I definitely recommend these! They did not shed at all!!! So in love !</li>
    <li> I own expensive and cheap brushes. These are relatively cheap but the quality of some of these are as good as expensive ones. I use 70% of these brushes. The other 30% are not dense enough en some of the eye brushes are a little harsh on my eyes. I own Mac brushes of which some are not that soft either. Also, they claim to be cruelty free which is great.</li>
    <li> I am always very worried about buying makeup brushes. The ones everyone claim to be great cost an arm and a leg and I am always skeptical about cheaper brands. I discovered this brand while searching Amazon and something about it called my name. I was very nervous and excited about what I had just bought but decided not to second guess myself. My brush set arrived today and I was so anxious to try them out I went straight to my bathroom, after staring at them for so long, to test them out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason I was drawn to this set was in part to the amount of brushes you received for the price. There is a wide variety of brushes and if you are a makeup geek, like myself, you know your brushes are a huge asset to any collection. These brushes come in this very nice faux leather case, which has a very strong leather smell when you first open it. I already expected this, as I have had other things that give off the smell due to being in-cased in the packaging for so long. To get rid of this smell you simply open the case and let it air out for a few hours, if it bothers you to much. The first think I noticed when I opened my package was the weight of the brushes. They were heavy and made of good quality wood, unlike others I have tried (light and break easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then opened up each brush an felt it as I went. I was very impressed with the feel of the bristles which were very soft and luxurious feeling! Next it was time to actually put them to the test. I was so impressed with my makeup application after using these brushes! Now understand before buying this set I worked with what I had here and there from different brands (no luxurious brands) and my make was just OK but not where I wanted it to be. Thanks to this brush set I was able to achieve the flawless look I have been trying for, for months with no success. There was a little shedding from a couple of the bigger brushes but when I say little I really mean VERY little, not much to note for me as this is expected with any new brush BUT just wanted to note that in this review. Since this set was so massive I finally had a brush for each technique I needed a certain brush for, which was not what I had before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I would like to note that I clean my brushes semi regularly (probably not as often as I should). Cleaning brushes is time consuming and some weeks I just can&#x27;t fit it into my schedule. I always try to rub my brushes on a rag as to wipe off excessive makeup and help extend the time in between washing. These brushes wiped off very easily with no water or brush cleaner. I used a darker brown color on one of the eye brushes, which was white, and when I wiped it with my rag it wiped completely off. The bristles were back to white as if that dark brown color had never been used! If you are in the market for a new brush set and do not want to waste your money these brushes are worth ever penny and more! You will not be disappointed with the quality or the results!his is expected with any new brush BUT just wanted to note that in this review.

    <li> These are amazing for the price point ! The brush hairs a very soft!  Came with great packing and brush case perfect for travel !</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the quality and versatility of the brushes for the money I spent.. I feel like I robbed the company! I unwrapped each brush the second I got them delivered; unbelievable. I don&#x27;t understand why people go and pay $30-45 a brush when they can have all of this for even less! As a makeup enthusiast and artist, I highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> The packaging has the most obnoxious odor it made me sick. Trying to air it out because the brushes are actually really nice. More stars would have been given if it wasn&#x27;t for this horrid smell</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful brushes!  Fantastic quality and very classy set.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, mine came without the eyeliner brush (E15). Will write to make sure I get that. Otherwise, excellent quality and very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Love this brushes. They are absolutely amazing and soft.  They make such a difference.</li>
    <li> I thought the brushes are pretty good. Lots of shedding which is normal with brushes. The smell of them I can get over it. I just washed them and they smell much better. Over all i like them. You get your money worth for them.</li>
    <li> Shany brushes rock! First thing I did was unwrap each brush from its plastic and began to examine the quality. I even tugged at the hairs to see if they would fall out. They did not. I&#x27;m so impressed with the quality of the brushes and the colors. Very cool. Makes a perfect gift. The packaging is cool too!</li>
    <li> I am a MUA WHO LOVES HER BRUSHES!! These are soft, full and feel great in the hand! Well made! Can&#x27;t wait to use them on my clients!! Thanks Shany and Amazon for great products!!</li>
    <li> these brushes that I received are amazing the packaging is awesome in the brushes are great quality I receive my package today and I cannot wait to start utilizing them on my clients the instruction guide is very helpful to let customers know which brush is which and what its function is for the Signature Collection my favorite and I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Good brushes at a good price</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them !!!!! very soft and the bag it comes in is great ! Overall great buy</li>
    <li> I love the range of different brushes. Looks professional and is very impressive when used with a client. Great product !!!!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical in making the purchase of these brushes, but I figured I could just return them if I didn&#x27;t like them for whatever reason. This set has all the essentials for anyone starting to experiment with makeup, it looks just like the picture. However, the smell isn&#x27;t so great!! I had to wash all of them a few time, but the smell is still there. It&#x27;s not as strong after each wash, so I&#x27;m hoping the smell will eventually go away as I continue to wash them every week. As far as shedding, some of the brushes does shed a little. But for the price, you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. It came how I was expecting and the delivery was on time. This is my first Shany product, and I had a good first impression. I will definitely purchase more products from Shany cosmetics in the near future.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush set as my current set is a mix of random brands, some professional brands, some drug store brands.  I just wanted a decent full set consisting of brushes I would actually use.  I am very happy with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite some of the mixed reviews, I have to say, the strong chemical scent is gone after the first wash (I wash all new brushes anyway, so washing them was not a problem).  I put the faux leather case outside to air it out, and the smell was gone after a day.  I did not have heavy shedding like some reviews stated, maybe 5 hairs total fell out of the 24 brushes combined.  I feel like the brushes are dense and work well when applying all types of make up, cream, powder, liquid, etc.  They are solid and well assembled, I feel like these brushes will last me quite a while, and for under $40, that&#x27;s a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included in the case was a card offering a free brush cleanser for reviewing the brushes on their website!  All around, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very well made. I am so pleased with this product. I love these more than I thought I would. I am very excited about these new brushes.</li>
    <li> I received this brush set today and am in love with them, they are so soft and thick. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but have no doubt that I will be impressed. And for this price!!?! Amazing. The packaging was perfect too. All around I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> wouldve gave them a 5 but one broke after a few uses</li>
    <li> Love it!! The smell is really strong, but after a while it dissapears, so no biggie. Great quality, feels comfortable and high quality for price.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they came in a big packaging the letter inside the box said it would come with a free brush clenser which I did no receive but I really love thes brushes</li>
    <li> I am a pro makeup artist and hairstylist and I do a lot of weddings. I needed a second  set of brushes to basically kick around that weren&#x27;t as nice as my $150-200 set. I have to say, I&#x27;m VERY impressed with these. I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but I have to say for the value these are great.</li>
    <li> They are Wonderful and exactly as the pic NEW.</li>
    <li> Just received it in the mail. The packaging is very secure and wonderful. The brushes don&#x27;t shed they are very well made. I&#x27;m so happy that I ordered from Shany</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift - to myself.  I love it.  The product is high quality at an excellent price.  I&#x27;ve had so much fun playing with my new brush set!  The brushes do not shed and are well made.</li>
    <li> I loved this brushes. They look like professionals, so soft and elegant. I don&#x27;t wash them already but for a first impression and for the price, they are amazing.</li>
    <li> When I received the brushes I washed them all before using. None of the brushes lost any bristles when I washed them, which was a good sign. They&#x27;re good quality, very soft and overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel like there is a lack of variety. But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s mostly preference. There are a lot of face brushes, which I don&#x27;t use all that much. Overall, great price for good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING .. You get great quality, better than you&#x27;d expect for the price.. the only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is because the packaging had the weirdest scent. Everything from the box right down to the brushes smelled like a (very) strong scented glue .. I left the brushes rolled out and open in the air for a few days to get the scent to go away. Warning: if you leave it wrapped up the scent will stay. Besides that, they are absolutely fabulous!</li>
    <li> So far so good. They are well built. I have used them just a few times and no problems at all. I hope they last longer. Buy them.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife. she liked it so much we bought another set for my sister.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my shany brushes and when they arrived I was not disappointed. They are beautiful and are amazingly soft. Completely in love with them!</li>
    <li> Omgggggggggggggggggggggg! I LOVED my SHANY Pro Signature Set. First off before i even opened them up, I felt so V.I.P. The packaging was so awesome,and elegant,then once I stopped marveling over the box and actually opened it, the leather pouch made me feel like I was a professional makeup artist. Once I opened the pouch I was done for. I don&#x27;t know who launched this line of brushes, but they should get their feet rubbed for the rest of their lives for FREE. These brushes are better than so Top brand brushes that I have purchased,and yes MAC is one of them, might I add are over-rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that the packaging itself alone lets you know that you are valued as a customer. The thank you card had me a little mushy... I&#x27;ve used and washed my brushes twice since I&#x27;ve purchased them and every-time they dry they return to their original form, no shedding, THANK YOU LORD,and the texture is still the same...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these brushes to everyone no artist and artist alike.. Most certainly worth it,if you ask me their under priced compared to all these other hot head brand with less the quality.. I am an Official SHANY fanatic.. Thank you so much for all your hard work and dedication..</li>
    <li> Omg I love it is the best brush the I see it ever y very soft soft soft the best.😉💋💋💋👏👏</li>
    <li> Not a bad price at all for 24 makeup brushes. The only two brushes I don&#x27;t particularly like are the F-10 and F-11. These brushes do make applying makeup simpler, and I would highly suggest them to a novice, or experienced makeup artist.</li>
    <li> obviously I washed the brushes before use, packaging is great to have It upside down to dry them to refrain from damaging the wooden handles, love the labels. Minimal shedding- oddly enough, its all around the buffing foundation brushes. Very soft. Dense. Good handle length. glad that SHANY is a part of PETA! great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M IN LOVE! QUALITY SET!</li>
    <li> the best brushes i&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
    <li> I was hesitant  about purchasing these brushes, but I am very pleased with how professional they look and feel! I use them everyday without trouble, and they are made with great quality! I also appreciate how they included a description of each makeup brush in a chart like way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! From all that I&#x27;ve learned about make up brushes is that you want them super soft. These are the softest brushes I have ever had. Make up applies very easily and the brush handles are very heavy duty and durable. I would recommend buying these brushes. Great brushes for a great price!</li>
    <li> I love my set of brush.  They are high quality.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my brushes! So soft and beautiful!</li>
    <li> These are the most incredible makeup brushes! They are extremely good quality without the fancy price tag. The bristles rarely come out. Which is a huge plus!! I&#x27;m so excited to put makeup on just so I can play with my brushes. I highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. They don&#x27;t shed as I thought they would..they stink pretty bad at first but once I washed them the smell went away.</li>
    <li> i got these brushes couple of days ago and they&#x27;re amazzzing. the variety and the angles of the brushes help u do ur makeup easier , faster and really enjoy it . i just wish i got them sooner : )</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price</li>
    <li> Love my shanty brushes!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SET , I would highly recommend it for begginers or even pros !! It&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon then on the regular site .</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a year and I love it.</li>
    <li> The brush set has an excellent quality.  I love the brush set, it has all the brushes that I was looking for</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Very happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a birthday gift for my stepdaughter and was in the market for a make-up brush set with natural hair. I had a budget in mind but was willing to spend a little more to get a good quality set. Bought this at a steal price and hoped for the best. It arrived the day before the party. Whew! It nicely packaged and well-padded. Yes it comes in a purple box as pictured and the box was shrink wrapped. Definitely no dings or scratches. I did not get to see the brushes until my daughter opened it all up. Once you remove the plastic and opened the box, the brushes are in a man-made leather bag/organizer. It is quite a size so if you are in the market for a beauty box/case, get a big one. The one I got measured  12\\&quot; x 8.75\\&quot; x 10.5\\&quot; and the bag fit nicely. At first I did not notice the alpha numeric code on each brush but I saw the diagram that tells you what each brush is for. Went back to the set after seeing on the Shany website that each brush is coded. Yes it is on the brush. But keep your diagram because these letters may fade in time. Anyone in the market for brushes must consider this. If you&#x27;ve got enough eyeshadow brushes and looking more to use on your face, this is the set for you. It is probably one of my best bargain buys.</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever! Work just as well as sephora and Mac brushes. I am a make-up artist and highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> This set is an amazing deal for the price. Particularly if you are beginning to build a brush set, I would recommend to buy this set. Then, if you find there are certain brushes you love but wish they were softer or wider or denser or shaped in some different way, you can compare the few you like best to a high end brush at Mac or the sets put out for experimentation at Sephora or Ulta. You might just find you like these better. This entire set is the cost of maybe 2 high end brushes. And while I believe in good quality, I have not found any brush in this set to be poor quality. I use all but a few of them. And i have purchased high end brushes only when it&#x27;s a brush I use all the tiem and want a softer or fuller texture. The case they come with is good quality, too.</li>
    <li> After reading all the rave reviews i was anticipating awesome brushes. I was sadly dissatisfied when i opened them and began inspecting them. The brushes come with a very STRONG scent after washing them twice the smell was still present.  I could have overlooked the smell if these brushes weren&#x27;t so. ...... blah. Yes they are soft yes they look nice but they are not dense whatsoever! They much resemble coastal scents brushes and some even elf. If you are a beginner in makeup and don&#x27;t know much about brushes and have never used a mac or sigma brush then these brushes are for you. Other than that i do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Very pleased! The only thing it doesn&#x27;t come with is a lip brush!! So I used the cream eyeshadow brush instead.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! In my opinion they&#x27;re the runner up with Mac and Sigma! But definitely a much better price! (:</li>
    <li> I am new to this makeup business and decided recently to to start my own makeup collection. After visiting a few makeup stores and testing out different productions and brushes I was ready to give up because of the cost of the equipment. I was looking for quality brushes and ones that will last a long time without having to spend $40-50 on a single brush. I spoke to friend of mines and she recommended me to this brand, after doing some research I decide to go ahead and try it out. Not only was the price something I can afford but it the brushes were beauty. I love that they are not all black or brown but that they came in white, red and many other colors. They are of high quality, I can make this statement because  know what the mac and other national brand brushes feel and look like. These brushes can stand among them. I am so glad that I made this purchase and i recommend them to anyone looking for quality and long lasting brush without a crazy price attached.</li>
    <li> Great buy!! This set is perfect and comes with everything you not but not having to spend hundreds. Very comparable to the expensive brand. Glad I read reviews. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> This collection of brushes are amazing. Each brush is individually placed in its own soft plastic sleeve and has its own slot in an elegant leather roll up case. They include a booklet explaining the use for each brush and the brushes have gold letters with the chart code and use for each brush. I have used the foundation brush, contouring brush, eyeshadow and blending brush.They are soft and it is amazing the difference they make. I thought make up sponges couldn&#x27;t be beat but I was wrong. I don&#x27;t know how they can sell quality like this for such a reasonable price. I can&#x27;t wait to try the rest of the brushes With the name of the brushes purpose on the handle they are mistake proof. I&#x27;ll never need to buy makeup brushes again. Wooden handles and the luxurious leather case make this something you can be proud to own or gift. They come in beautifully boxed with full, carefully explained instructions for each brush. I am thrilled!!</li>
    <li> Just received these brushes....and please BELIEVE the hype!! These brushes are amazing in price and quality. I will never spend on expensive brushes again!</li>
    <li> Very good quality brushes!! Love that it has many face brushes. Shipping was fast, got it after 5 working days. I would have rated it for 5 except I got two of the E25 slanted eyeliner brush and no F70 concealer brush which sucks but I guess I could use a lot of other brushes for my concealer.</li>
    <li> The Shany Pro Signature Brush set is a very affordable and professional product.  I absolutely love the large variety of brush options, from blending brushes to angled eye brushes, there is always a brush to fit your needs. My favorite brushes are they eye brushes, as they make any eye shadow palette come to life.  I typically dip my brush into water to allow for a wet brush application.  These brushes give you so much control.  I would buy this set again.</li>
    <li> Love the soft brussels easily cleaned great quality.</li>
    <li> AWESOME QUALITY BRUSHES! GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deal on a affordable good quality brush set not to mention the variety is impeccable.</li>
    <li> I love my new set!! I have always purchased MAC brushes and wanted to try something new with out breaking my bank, after many many reviews I found SHANY!!! Their Pro signature set is not there cheapest but with the variety on natural fibers as well as synthetics for my liquids, HOW COULD I SAY NO! I am so glad I did not pass these beauties by, I am so happy to add this set to my collection!!</li>
    <li> I have been a cosmetologist for 10 years, and have strictly used MAC brushes. I&#x27;m so impressed with the cost and quality of these brushes!!  They are so soft, well made and feel wonderful in my hand.  I also love the case they come with.  I will definitely look into trying more products from Shany!</li>
    <li> Received the brushes as a gift, they are soft to touch but firm enough to blend the colors, no loose bristles, love them!</li>
    <li> Love these! Every brush you&#x27;d possibly need! Great quality with great quality bag!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered these brushes. They came a day early. The day before Christmas Eve. They&#x27;re for my sister and she loves mine so I ordered her some! They&#x27;re a great Christmas gift and the price is perfect because these really are good quality brushes. I recommend these to everyone who is already into makeup or someone who is just starting out!</li>
    <li> I have a 5 piece brush set from mary kay that costed the same as this 24 piece. I did alot of research and happy I chose this Shany set. Its awesome and applies my makeup flawlessly. I didn&#x27;t think I needed so many brushes but they all do so many different things that you will use more then you think. Also the packaging was very nice and elegant. Just to add these brushes quality is way better then the mary kay brushes I used. Im in LOVE with my Shany brushes.</li>
    <li> I am by no means a make up guru or professional. I just recently became interested in expanding my make up arsenal and i decided to give these brushes a try based on the positive feedback I read. This is the second time I have used the brushes, (specifically the F11 Foundation Brush, F13 Rounded Foundation Brush, M33 Mineral Powder Brush, E12 Eyeshadow Brush, and E15 Eyeliner Brush), and I am very pleased with my purchase. The brushes are soft, easy to use, beginner friendly, and easy to clean. I look forward to looking up new and creative ways to use my SHANY brushes. This set was an excellent investment and my make up skills can expand and grow with this kit. The only real critique that I have with this product is not with the brushes, but rather with the instruction sheet that was included with the brush set. The description of some of the brushes is very similar to one another and so it makes it seem as though one brush is interchangeable with another, which is not necessarily the case. I had to look up online specific applications with some of the brushes because I am so new to make up techniques, so I would have liked to have had a little more information on the brushes included with the kit. Other than that, awesome product!!</li>
    <li> Same as picture.. loved them...</li>
    <li> Definitely a must get. With instructions on what each brush is used for the and the high quality of this inexpensive brush set im extremely satisfied &amp; obsessed. Money well spent!</li>
    <li> Aaaamszing, good quality brushes! Don&#x27;t let the price fool you! They&#x27;re an absolute steal!!</li>
