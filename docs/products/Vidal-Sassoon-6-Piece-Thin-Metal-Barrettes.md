      <li>Good grip, easy closure, discreet shades.</li>
      <li>She swears by this kind of barrette and hasn&#x27;t been able to find them in stores.</li>
      <li>I love the colors and the slimness of the metal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I was able to get her these.</li>
      <li>am in my 50&#x27;s and don&#x27;t feel appropriate wearing the shiny&lt;br</li>
      <li>These barrettes are attractive, and hold the hair very well.</li>
      <li>I bent a couple of them and now they hold more hair and are easier to close.</li>
      <li>These hold my hair for more styles.</li>
      <li>but it was nice to get them right to my mailbox.</li>

      <li>These barrettes slid right out of my ponytail.  </li>
      <li>Sure enough, amazon has everything</li>

      <li>Sad to me, why change a perfectly good product.  </li>
      <li>Up your price and go back to the old ones</li>
      <li>I remembered using these when I was young, but I haven&#x27;t seen this style in quite a long time.</li>
      <li>These barrettes are large enough to hold half my hair.</li>
      <li>but, I have fine, thin hair.  </li>

    <li> These are very small; not what I expected.  Not the nice, large or &#x27;full size&#x27; ones I was expecting for thick hair.  They work...but they&#x27;re small.</li>
    <li> need to be a little longer about two inches</li>
    <li> Very attractive, but, I have fine, thin hair.  These barrettes slid right out of my ponytail.  Totally useless for hair like mine.  Gave them to a neighbor with much thicker hair and she loved them.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my grandmother. She swears by this kind of barrette and hasn&#x27;t been able to find them in stores. She was down to her very last one and was heart broken by it! Sure enough, amazon has everything and I was able to get her these. She was so happy!</li>

    <li> So far so good.  I love the colors and the slimness of the metal.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 50&#x27;s and don&#x27;t feel appropriate wearing the shiny&lt;br /&gt;decorative barrretts the girls are wearing nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;These look nice and keep my hair out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> These hold my hair for more styles. You can buy stores these at stores but it was nice to get them right to my mailbox.</li>
    <li> I remembered using these when I was young, but I haven&#x27;t seen this style in quite a long time. Good grip, easy closure, discreet shades.</li>
    <li> Perfect! These barrettes are large enough to hold half my hair. They are also no the French style. They are close to your heard. Single loop.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a barrette that could hold a lot of my hair.  These are stiff and hard to close.  I bent a couple of them and now they hold more hair and are easier to close.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my sheepdogs to keep the hair from their eyes.  Worked Great</li>
    <li> I bought these when I was looking for the Goody brand that I can no longer find in stores. These are nice quality, smooth and pretty for a plain barrette, and though the size was given, are a bit smaller than I had expected.</li>
    <li> Great product--hard to find these in stores.</li>
    <li> not what I expected.  Small, tight, and difficult to use but not work returning.  Lesson learned.</li>
