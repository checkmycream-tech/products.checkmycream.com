      <li>Loved by my entire family.</li>
      <li>it don&#x27;t look to much like the real thing, or the ink would work a lot better than what it did, and not spell and all that stuff.</li>
      <li>I got my tattoo done last week and the color looks the same as it did when he did it read alot of great reviews about it staying in the skin</li>
      <li>first u could be allergic..</li>
      <li>I have seen work done with this ink 9 years ago just last week and the red really looks good even after all that time.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>decent price on name brand tattoo ink. will pay for itself as soon as you line them up for tat&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok, it leaks everywhere if its not standing up, and some colors don&#x27;t stick or work well with deferent people, and plus this is probably not the real ink, because the tops of the ink bottles are black, and the bottles look a little funny.</li>
      <li>I was even surprised at how well the colors blend.</li>
      <li>so hopefully it does so far</li>
      <li>Too much for such tiny ink bottles.</li>
