      <li>, PERFECT FIT.</li>
      <li>they fit perfectly in my shoes.</li>
      <li>I was so happy when I found this insole because it&#x27;s so cheap!   </li>
      <li>VERY SATISFIED WITH INSOLE</li>
      <li>I love these!</li>
      <li>These are great for that purpose, and comfortable.</li>
      <li>Great fit in my Ugg boots</li>
      <li>I really liked them, height was just what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Perfect also for the shoes that slip too much.</li>
      <li>I loved them, but they are kind of spendy and still looked just fine.  </li>
      <li>But the quality looks ok.</li>
      <li>Need to buy more.</li>
      <li>A heel lift maybe a better option.</li>
      <li>And trust me I have many.</li>
      <li>These might fit those women who have manly feet or planning on wearing clown shoes!</li>
      <li>I guess they would be ok if you just stand around all day.</li>
      <li>I bought these Elevator Shoe Soles and love them.</li>
      <li>so most shoes don&#x27;t have the room in the instep to work with the lifts.</li>
      <li>These are easy to cut to size.  </li>
      <li>Some nice shoes are too flat and this gives the foot a good protection against the ground when walking, making it easier to walk longer distances.</li>
      <li>I had to trim them to get them to fit</li>
      <li>Per the description it can fit 5.5-8 shoe size but I am size 9</li>
      <li>Though the product description says the insoles are for women, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll fit into any women shoes in any size.</li>
      <li>I liked that it was the lenght of my shoes and not just for my heels much easier on the legs and calf muscles.</li>
      <li>Yes you an cut to fit for length</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really comfortable because the air cushion.</li>
      <li>The only thing I was able to use the attached additional height elevator which has a 0.5in measure, good thing it worked</li>
      <li>I love them so much, I bought 2 more.</li>
      <li>It is a good product because it adds height and much better comfort for my flat shoes.</li>
      <li>These risers are by far better than any of the others !</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this product is that I received the package promptly.</li>
      <li>Bonus was that it was just the right size for my shoe so no cutting and trying to custom fit them for me.</li>
      <li>good material soft and fresh, really confortable</li>
      <li>because of the price and the nice enough quality, I will keep it though.</li>
      <li>These kind of insoles are so useful in your UGGs, rain boots, or low heel boots for showing your legs longer and your hips smaller and better shape.  </li>
      <li>quality feels quite good so far, I ended up not using the extra layer because then my heel would be sticking out of my sneaker.</li>
      <li>May work better for men or women with bigger feet.</li>
      <li>These are pretty neat because they are in two layers, and can be popped apart to make them lower.  </li>
      <li>Sadly I have not been able to find the same AWESOME product I bought the first time, looked everywhere else and bought those describing &amp;#34;small insoles&amp;#34; but all were disappointments.</li>
      <li>It is not so easy to trim the width on these unfortunately so its best if the shoes you are purchasing these inserts for are a little bigger than your own feet.</li>
      <li>However, to use the extra 1/2\\&quot; addition to this you would really have to wear them in a high top shoe.</li>
      <li>item was just as described, very comfy.</li>
      <li>To fast delivery.</li>
      <li>They only fit in boots not shoes.  </li>
      <li>One important thing, it&#x27;s only suit fot</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>tops and boots work very well for these shoes.</li>
      <li>If you have some flat boots that are way too big, these will work nicely.</li>
      <li>For an affordable price and no shipping cost (or very little), you can create your own elevator shoes.</li>
      <li>They did arrive on time, but were not narrow enough to fit into her shoes.  </li>
      <li>Bought this product and was completely satisfied because the insoles were ACTUALLY small enough that they fit in to all of my shoes.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect them to work in shoes or in tight fitting boots.</li>
      <li>The lifts are high</li>
      <li>but the width is so wide that they did&#x27;nt fit in any of my shoes or boots.</li>
      <li>I guess this will fit if the shoes is wide.</li>
      <li>Unless you have lots of room between the instep and the top of the shoes your feet will not fit.  </li>
      <li>The size is really not the same.i wear 6.5 shoes and bought 6.5 this shoes insole , but it&#x27;s more big than my shoes, look like the size 9</li>
      <li>because They do exactly what I need them for  orthopedicly since I can not afford a lift to be installed on the outside of the shoe</li>
      <li>Typical cheap product from china.</li>
      <li>it is too big and raises the foot too high.</li>
      <li>I tried to trim it to fit but did not help and since the 1.5 height not appropriate for my boots</li>
      <li>Size 40 is definitely NOT for women of normal sized feet.</li>
      <li>Only trouble is finding a shoe they will fit inside.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a pair of shoes that fit these into.</li>
      <li>I mean not only did the package came ripped, but the insole is way to wide my feat won&#x27;t fit in the shoe!!</li>
      <li>Came a couple of days before the expected arrival date, which was a nice surprise~&lt;br /&gt;a lot of reviews said that men&#x27;s size was provided instead of female, which I was half hoping for as I occasionally do wear men&#x27;s shoes [and stuff the front with socks-- men&#x27;s shoes just look nicer], but I was disappointed by the good service ..</li>
      <li>This is completely understandable, low tops aren&#x27;t known as a deep shoe.</li>
      <li>cut down the sides to make them fit and my foot did not fit in my boot with them.</li>
      <li>I got these because I have an older pair of Skechers+3 that I&#x27;ve worn until the innersole had squashed down quite a bit.  </li>

<li> I got these because I have an older pair of Skechers+3 that I&#x27;ve worn until the innersole had squashed down quite a bit.  </li>
<li> I was going to use this inside my flat boots.</li>
<li> They came a little wide but you can trim them down to make them just the right size</li>
<li> They are way too big (wide and too thick to trim) for normal women&#x27;s boots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I wear a size 8 in women&#x27;s shoes and bought these for a size 8.5 pair of flat &#x27;military&#x27; style boots.</li>
<li> I can no longer wear flat shoes and need a little incline to keep my back and legs from hurting.  </li>
<li> Also, these are very uncomfortable, and although I de-attached the extra heightener and am wearing the main padding by itself, they do not adapt to the foot much and my heal keeps falling out of my shoe.</li>
<li> DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND: not worth sending back, i.e. shipping-n-handling...</li>
<li> I would send back but not worth the price of return shipping.</li>
<li> BUT I tired to buy a second pair of the same product from the same seller, but unfortunately what I received was not the same insoles that I purchased the first time.</li>
<li> Total waste of money...</li>
<li> Way too wide.</li>
<li> These insoles are way to wide.</li>
<li> This is not appropriate for women shoes probably not unless the shoes is big and wide.</li>
<li> i just cut the heel part and tried to shape the other part</li>
<li> You will have to let them air dry out a little.  </li>
<li> I have boots in size 7, even if I manually trimmed and cut down the insole size, the width of the insole is still to wide for my boots.</li>
<li> The smaller layer is not really meant to be used by itself because it&#x27;s short and has wholes in it which would be uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> I wear women size 6 shoes and these insoles are too big and too thick.  </li>
<li> After, I trimmed down the toes</li>
<li> You may have to go up a half of a shoe size.</li>
<li> and I still had to cut them in half for it to work.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What a great choice! It&#x27;s really comfortable because the air cushion. One important thing, it&#x27;s only suit fot \\&quot;boots\\&quot; not regular shoes!!</li>
    <li> These are the best insole I used.I used these for all day.but it would&#x27;t make my feet painful.  FIY: the number on the insole is larger than the fact.</li>
    <li> good material soft and fresh, really confortable&lt;br /&gt;the air cushion made a paradise under your feet</li>
    <li> These push your foot forward in the shoe and makes walking uncomfortable I guess they would be ok if you just stand around all day.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the inserts weren&#x27;t half bad at all. However, the reviews seem to be spot on regarding the largeness of the product. I wear a size 8 in women&#x27;s shoes and bought these for a size 8.5 pair of flat &#x27;military&#x27; style boots. I had to trim them to get them to fit but the inserts feel like they&#x27;re on the wider side of the feet spectrum. It is not so easy to trim the width on these unfortunately so its best if the shoes you are purchasing these inserts for are a little bigger than your own feet. Otherwise the apparent &#x27;smell&#x27; some people commented about isn&#x27;t as bad as I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I found this insole because it&#x27;s so cheap!   These kind of insoles are so useful in your UGGs, rain boots, or low heel boots for showing your legs longer and your hips smaller and better shape.  BUT, when I got these I immediately felt something absolutely wrong.....stinky!!! smell like chemical, or more like horrible B.O.... because of the price and the nice enough quality, I will keep it though.</li>
    <li> to big an unconfortable</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too big for woman shoes. It can not fit in all of my boots and sneakers. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> These must have been made for men.Way too wide.Yes you an cut to fit for length but the width is so wide that they did&#x27;nt fit in any of my shoes or boots.And trust me I have many.I would send back but not worth the price of return shipping.</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this product is that I received the package promptly. Unfortunately, they sent me a SMALL when I ordered a Large. This is very frustrating for me considering I wear a size 12 shoe. Also, these are very uncomfortable, and although I de-attached the extra heightener and am wearing the main padding by itself, they do not adapt to the foot much and my heal keeps falling out of my shoe. I feel like I wasted my money on this product.</li>
    <li> this insert will not fit into any shoes or boots. it is too big and raises the foot too high. these will not work unless you wear clown shoes</li>
    <li> Very good. To fast delivery. Thanks.</li>
    <li> For an affordable price and no shipping cost (or very little), you can create your own elevator shoes. I bought these Elevator Shoe Soles and love them. I love them so much, I bought 2 more. After, I trimmed down the toes( Yes, you may need to trim them) they fit perfectly in my shoes. I plan to bring these when I go shoe shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of your shoes may not work well with this soles, which are low tops. This is completely understandable, low tops aren&#x27;t known as a deep shoe. Any height Increase Shoe Soles will not work for low tops, so don&#x27;t buy these and give a bad review. If you want low tops with height go buy elevator shoe low tops. http://www.amazon.com/CALDEN-K217202-Increasing-Elevator-Lace-up/dp/B00CHU6LW2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_28?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426215750&amp;sr&#x3D;8-28&amp;keywords&#x3D;elevator+shoes+casual&amp;tag&#x3D;donations09-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High tops and boots work very well for these shoes. You may have to go up a half of a shoe size.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter.  They did arrive on time, but were not narrow enough to fit into her shoes.  May work better for men or women with bigger feet.</li>
    <li> I love these! They are perfect for making me look taller! They came a little wide but you can trim them down to make them just the right size</li>
    <li> item was just as described, very comfy. However, to use the extra 1/2\\&quot; addition to this you would really have to wear them in a high top shoe. Bonus was that it was just the right size for my shoe so no cutting and trying to custom fit them for me.</li>
    <li> because They do exactly what I need them for  orthopedicly since I can not afford a lift to be installed on the outside of the shoe</li>
    <li> The size is really not the same.i wear 6.5 shoes and bought 6.5 this shoes insole , but it&#x27;s more big than my shoes, look like the size 9</li>
    <li> Height elevator, Still not received this item. Where is it? Hope my credit card has not been charged. Everything else was great.</li>
    <li> It is a good product because it adds height and much better comfort for my flat shoes. Some nice shoes are too flat and this gives the foot a good protection against the ground when walking, making it easier to walk longer distances.</li>
    <li> I got these because I have an older pair of Skechers+3 that I&#x27;ve worn until the innersole had squashed down quite a bit.  I loved them, but they are kind of spendy and still looked just fine.  These are pretty neat because they are in two layers, and can be popped apart to make them lower.  The smaller layer is not really meant to be used by itself because it&#x27;s short and has wholes in it which would be uncomfortable.  I took out the smaller layer and used the bigger one and my Skechers are back to 3&amp;#34; and then some.  Delivery took a little while, but I knew that when I bought them.</li>
    <li> I really liked them, height was just what I was looking for.  I liked that it was the lenght of my shoes and not just for my heels much easier on the legs and calf muscles.</li>
    <li> These are not women&#x27;s size at all not as described, which I believe is ill-advertisement! These might fit those women who have manly feet or planning on wearing clown shoes! I purchased these for my boots since I needed to lift my legs up a little and a little padding but they do not fit inside my boots. They are way too big (wide and too thick to trim) for normal women&#x27;s boots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the back of the insoles there are lines for you to trim based on the size of your feet. The ones shipped to me showed European shoe size 40 as the smallest up to 47. From my experiences of purchasing A LOT of shoes....normal European shoe size for women starts at 35 which correlates to US size 5. Size 40 is definitely NOT for women of normal sized feet. Like I said, anyone women liking this item  have man feet or that of an elephant!!! I hate the false description of the seller which is such dishonesty and had wasted my money on something to me seemed like trickery from the seller.</li>
    <li> I have a similar shoes insole like this which make my feet pain a lot.</li>
    <li> VERY SATISFIED WITH INSOLE, PERFECT FIT. NOW I CAN GO DANCING AND I REGAINED MY FORMER HEIGHT.  YAHOO BUCKAROO, WHERE IS MY HORSE?</li>
    <li> I just received the item yesterday and very disappointed, it&#x27;s too big I guess this will fit if the shoes is wide. Per the description it can fit 5.5-8 shoe size but I am size 9 still it didn&#x27;t help. I tried to trim it to fit but did not help and since the 1.5 height not appropriate for my boots i just cut the heel part and tried to shape the other part still cannot use it. The only thing I was able to use the attached additional height elevator which has a 0.5in measure, good thing it worked but still it&#x27;s a waste of money. This is not appropriate for women shoes probably not unless the shoes is big and wide.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND: not worth sending back, i.e. shipping-n-handling...THIS WUZ SIMPLY HORRIBLE SINCE THEY&#x27;RE WAY TOO BIG FOR ANY ONE PAIR OF SHOES!!</li>
    <li> Though the product description says the insoles are for women, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll fit into any women shoes in any size. I have boots in size 7, even if I manually trimmed and cut down the insole size, the width of the insole is still to wide for my boots.</li>
    <li> I wear women size 6 shoes and these insoles are too big and too thick.  The only shoes they work are my rain boots and I still had to cut them in half for it to work.  Unless you have lots of room between the instep and the top of the shoes your feet will not fit.  A heel lift maybe a better option.</li>
    <li> These insoles are way to wide. They did not fit in my work boots that are wides. cut down the sides to make them fit and my foot did not fit in my boot with them.</li>
    <li> These risers are by far better than any of the others ! There are only 2 pieces to spare or wear 4 in all, no jigsaw puzzle. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I was going to use this inside my flat boots. Once I put these in the boots, there was no room for my feet. Total waste of money... I guess I should have thought about it prior to purchasing these.. my bad...</li>
    <li> I reccommend it for people who don&#x27;t have feet problem like I do, everything hurts my feet, But it does increase your height. Good item!! A must if u wanna feel taller.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I did have too trim them as they run big.  They only fit in boots not shoes.  You will have to let them air dry out a little.  They have a bad chemical smell.</li>
    <li> Came a couple of days before the expected arrival date, which was a nice surprise~&lt;br /&gt;a lot of reviews said that men&#x27;s size was provided instead of female, which I was half hoping for as I occasionally do wear men&#x27;s shoes [and stuff the front with socks-- men&#x27;s shoes just look nicer], but I was disappointed by the good service .. lol does that make sense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality feels quite good so far, I ended up not using the extra layer because then my heel would be sticking out of my sneaker. Good for boots!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a pair of shoes that fit these into. So I haven&#x27;t used them yet. But the quality looks ok.</li>
    <li> Great fit in my Ugg boots and it gives me a little height</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money buying this. It&#x27;s impossible to put in the shoes is really too wide.</li>
    <li> As an aging woman, my foot needs changed.  I can no longer wear flat shoes and need a little incline to keep my back and legs from hurting.  These are great for that purpose, and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Poor quality product, material of low densidade.I could not use. Don&#x27;t spend your money for it.Typical cheap product from china.</li>
    <li> If you have some flat boots that are way too big, these will work nicely. Don&#x27;t expect them to work in shoes or in tight fitting boots.</li>
    <li> Need to buy more. Perfect also for the shoes that slip too much.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and was completely satisfied because the insoles were ACTUALLY small enough that they fit in to all of my shoes. BUT I tired to buy a second pair of the same product from the same seller, but unfortunately what I received was not the same insoles that I purchased the first time. Sadly I have not been able to find the same AWESOME product I bought the first time, looked everywhere else and bought those describing &amp;#34;small insoles&amp;#34; but all were disappointments.</li>
    <li> These are easy to cut to size.  Only trouble is finding a shoe they will fit inside. The lifts are high so most shoes don&#x27;t have the room in the instep to work with the lifts.</li>
    <li> Very hard in the heel and hurts my knees.</li>
    <li> Worst product I have ever bought!! I mean not only did the package came ripped, but the insole is way to wide my feat won&#x27;t fit in the shoe!! I advise if your planing on buying it, to think twice before you do!!</li>
