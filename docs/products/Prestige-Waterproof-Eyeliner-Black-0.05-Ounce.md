<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for a few weeks now but tonight it&#x27;s waterproof ability was really tested. Tonight I watched the newest episode of Grey&#x27;s anatomy, the one where...&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler alert....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They kill off Derek!&lt;br /&gt;I sat sobbing,  unable to believe they could do something so terrible, for probably a good 20 or so minutes, and to my supprise when I looked in the mirror I didn&#x27;t have black smears running down my face.&lt;br /&gt;So good news, eyeliner is waterproof,  bad news, Derek is still dead, unless by some miracle he pulls a Jake(scandal) and comes back to life, but the previews make that seem doubtful.</li>
    <li> this smudges on hot days at the beach if i dunk my head underwater. so its not like insane great but it does the job on most days :)</li>
    <li> Works very nicely, non irritating, comes off with soap and water.</li>
    <li> Works good. Stays on well</li>
    <li> I collect eyeliner and have been trying to find the right one for years. I find this one and it is great. It stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge. If it does smudge it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve rubbed my eyes by accident. Gives me a nice dark line like I like. Definitely will be buying more</li>
    <li> I love it I had it for about 3 days so far and am in love as it says is waterproof. I have oily eyelids and it stays for about 4-5 hrs but I usually use it in my waterline and I have cried while wearind this eyeliner and it doesn&#x27;t run. :D</li>
    <li> I love it, I went back to buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Arab and we as girls adore the look of the blackest black lined eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of good stuff about it. so i was just having great time shopping and i came across it.&lt;br /&gt;I remembered all the good reviews so i bought it to try myself. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to try. OMG it was a dream came TRUE! Extremely black, no smudging and no fading!&lt;br /&gt;this is by far (what i consider) the dream of any girl who would love to have the sexy Arabian eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> Broke the first use and the color wasn&#x27;t as dark as i like</li>
    <li> i love dark liner! and this is a great product. would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very soft and durable</li>
    <li> I have worn eyeliner  for many, many years &amp; have tried numerous  brands. Prestige waterproof eyeliner is absolutely  best on the market. It&#x27;s not  totally  waterproof but stays on very well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this product. Goes on smoothy, almost like liquid but without all the hassle. I recommend it to everyone who asks about my eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I love my waterproof  eye pencil, and my sisters i go to college with are going to order one as well</li>
    <li> this is the best waterproof eye liner ever! i have allergies and make-up can smear when your eyes water, and this one does not. plus, i live in Texas, and we do not perspire here, we sweat like all get outs, so this is THE eyeliner for hotttttt climates!!</li>
    <li> I got this as eye liners tend to dissolve on me after a few hours.  I am very impressed with this pencil which glides on easily and stays on for the duration of my work hours!</li>
    <li> Lasts all day.  Even  on my greasy eyeballs.  Love this.</li>
    <li> tis eye pencil is ok and would be fantasia if it would a little deeper or darker; what ever its called when you don&#x27;t have to go over the eye so many times.</li>
    <li> Great pencil eyeliner. I love it. It does smudge but it lasts all day and is very easy to apply. Very dark black</li>
    <li> I am brunette with dark brown eyes and medium skin. I like really dark eyeliner to help my eyes stand out. I generally use gel liner but I like the ease of use of a pencil and I was looking for something waterproof. This pencil is a bit disappointing. I expected it to be a deeper black color. It&#x27;s black just not super black like gel liner. It applies OK but skips a bit. The biggest issue is that it isn&#x27;t truly waterproof. It does hang in there if I am out in the heat or even if I get my face splashed a bit at the pool or lake but it comes off if I submerge my face in water and it wears off after about six hours. For me, this pencil is average. I was so hoping for a good waterproof pencil but this one is gone if I get my face wet. I also would love it to be a deeper black hue. I guess I will keep searching and will use this when I want a more subtle and non-waterproof liner.</li>
    <li> I am really picky with eyemakeup and black eyeliner is a daily! This stays SO WELL and I love how the product is animal cruelty free. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price, this is great!</li>
    <li> Leaves a good thick black line for my eyes with just one gentle glide on my water line.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t absolutely 100% waterproof and budgproof, but it is very long lasting and very black. This is one of the best eyeliner pencils I have found in this price range. It&#x27;s very creamy when applied and while not waterproof, it does set pretty well and it is nicely pigmented. Try setting with black eyeshadow for added staying power (I do this with all eyeliners, waterproof or not)</li>
    <li> So glad I trusted the reviews on this one!  It&#x27;s definitely waterproof!  I no longer need any other eye liner - this one rocks!  No smudging or smearing - it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Not totally waterproof but pretty good. It glides on pretty smooth and sets pretty fast. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an eyeliner thought this one was good. WRONG! first off, it doesn&#x27;t paint anything, I have to line my bottom line like 10 times for some black to show. Second of all it is not waterproof and it smears and smudges after 1hour I wasted my money I got so angry. Don&#x27;t get it unless you want it in your trash after 2 days.</li>
    <li> Messy and hard to sharpen. That it all.</li>
    <li> My search for a waterproof eyeliner has, yet again, failed.  I was excited about all the good reviews and received it yesterday.  I put it on this morning just on the top eyelids and an hour later I had smudges beneath my eyes.  My eyes don&#x27;t water and I don&#x27;t rub them and it STILL smudged.  I&#x27;m pretty sure a waterproof/smudgeproof eyeliner doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
    <li> I am latino, of Cuban and Puerto Rican descent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes on very sticky and clumpy, and extremely light. More of a smoky grey, because it&#x27;s struggling to apply itself. With every stroke the applied eyeliner smudges in whatever direction you&#x27;re applying instead of darkening, and pushes into clumps into my lashes. This is after washing my face thoroughly as well. I bought it straight from a convenience store so it&#x27;s not like it was ruined during shipment or hanging out somewhere.</li>
    <li> Great Waterproof Eye Pencil.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Glides on smooth and stays where you put it.  I would recommend this product to those who use Eye Pencils.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This is okay, but not waterproof, which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> So glad I found my favorite eyeliner!  Love the quality and performance of this product.  Glides on easily, good consistency, stays put.  I bought 6 so I won&#x27;t run out for a while.  I like the strong pigment of the new eyeliner from Prestige called &amp;#34;Intensity&amp;#34; but its kind of messy.</li>
    <li> Love this, it smudges effortlessly (when you smudge it on purpose)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last like I think a waterproof product should.  I was hoping this product was as great as their lipliner, however I am a bit disappointed.  It wears just like the regular liner.  It&#x27;s ok, I was just hoping for a great liner to wear at the pool/beach.</li>
    <li> Like any other liner, usually have to retouch it a couple times through out the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this waterproof liner for a while and it always stayed put; now it comes off the upper lid leaving you with &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes if you use eyedrops.  It did not do this before. The color is rich, the texture is great - it does not drap or pull. I will keep using it and see if it stays on like before - if I do not use any eye drops (contact lens rewetting solution).</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner. Applies easily, does not run during the day, but easily washes off at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> It stays on for quite a while. It is actually a little bit difficult to fix mistakes if done more than 5-10 seconds after application, but that&#x27;s what makes it stay on so long.</li>
    <li> dont even try to shapen it, its a pain in the ass. not waterproof at all. just a normal eyeliner pencil. meh</li>
    <li> Very hard &amp;driex quickly</li>
    <li> It is difficult to get off! and smears just like the non waterproof ones</li>
    <li> It its so easy to apply and quick too.  I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner. It came highly recommended as a replacement for a much more expensive brand. It&#x27;s cheap enough that I was willing to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did. It goes on smoothly and stays on.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner:). Its stays on long as expected.  I will buy more after this rams out:). I would recommend it to anyone looking for a water proof eyeliner.</li>
    <li> It does not last. Period.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a different brand, so I went with this. It gets the job done, but it was too dull to use after a few uses. Sharpening it involved the lead breaking repeatedly, which was frustrating. If you&#x27;re experimenting with eyeliner, go ahead and try it, but if you have a type you like already, I wouldn&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s easy to put on and last whole day. I have very sensitive eyes, this doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and doesn&#x27;t make a mess with my watery eyes. Will def buy again.</li>
    <li> The eye pencil goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t smudge. I wish that there were more of a color selection available.</li>
    <li> Not waterproof. It&#x27;s gone in one hour, smudgy but not in a good way.</li>
    <li> worst eyeiner ever. sucks and it gets smudged don&#x27;t recommend it mad cheap looking too</li>
    <li> love it so much ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> Real waterproof ones don&#x27;t smear off as this does but I still gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Stays long but smudges a bit.</li>
    <li> smears like most eyeliners - recently discovered Revlon is the best - still smudges but not as much</li>
    <li> It says waterproof but it does smudge, I have normal to oily combination skin so I need to use waterproof eyeliner. However a few hours into wearing the eyeliner it starts to fade and smudge.</li>
    <li> Another Christmas gift...but should be just fine</li>
    <li> Goes on really smooth!!  It was really easy to be precise and I was able to easily line my water line. I usually like the retractable eyeliners, but after hearing so many good reviews I had to try it. Glad I did</li>
    <li> This might be the best pencil eyeliner I have ever used! Does not run, goes on smoothly, very black. I won&#x27;t buy another brand of eyeliner pencil ever again lol Im being so serious it&#x27;s that good!</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner except that it is hard to sharpen.  You might want to buy the sharpener that comes with it.  I didn&#x27;t and trying to use one that I had.</li>
    <li> You need to apply it like 10 times and still doesn&#x27;t show at all. I bought black colore but it so light as gray colore</li>
    <li> Stays on water line. Does not smudge.</li>
    <li> As soon as I took the cap off, the lead broke off, not usable.  I can&#x27;t get the remaining pencil to come up, so for me this was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> This eye pencil is not very effective. If you put it on your lower lid it smears and smudges and after a few hours you will have &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes.</li>
    <li> I wear my eyeliner on my waterline and it works pretty well. I&#x27;ve also sharpened it and it also sharpens well.</li>
    <li> I tried a few others waterproof eyeliners and this is the only type I found that does not run...my skin is a little oily. I am so happy that I can wear eyeliner now because I went without for years since I do not like to look like a raccoon. You do need to buy the sharpener that they sell for this (it is very good quality with two size holes) because the pencil is thicker than a standard sharpener opening.  And recap the pencil after each use so it does not dry out.  I love these so much that I have 2 per month added to my subscribe and save account because I worry they may stop making these one day.  I also plan to give some to my mom and sister for Christmas.</li>
    <li> BEST EYELINER EVER! This is definitely a good purchase I have made and I am loving the looks of it. I personally like the smoky look and this eye liner gives it to me very easily. It makes smudging it out easier than a lot of eye line brands I tried in the past. This stuff goes on well. I strongly recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> Works as expected, love color, will order more in future!</li>
    <li> This did not go on smoothly at all. I dont know if it is an old pencil or what. Too dry to work well.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Goes on smooth. Stays on.  And, I like the color.  It&#x27;s black, but not really, really black.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.  It goes on easy and last through everything.  Best liner I ever bought.  People alway ask if I use liquid liner when I use this product.</li>
    <li> It fades once applied, I personally didn&#x27;t like it..</li>
    <li> I had this eyeliner for years, idk where I got it, &amp; it had been sharpened down to a nub so the only letters left on the side were &amp;#34;PR&amp;#34; and they had rubbed off so the letters themselves weren&#x27;t even visible, but there was a slight indentation of where they&#x27;d once been. Based on just the first two letters that I could barely see, and the little plastic capping on the bottom, I did some serious searching to find this stuff. It is the BEST I have ever used, way better than MAC, which just smears everywhere. Once in a while you just find what you love, you know? I&#x27;ll never in my life buy another brand.</li>
    <li> been wearing this one for 10+ years. it&#x27;s matte and it stays on. I will never use another black eye liner ever.</li>
    <li> ok,  not happy with this product.  It sharpens horribly,  loose have of it, or the product falls out after sharpening... and I tried several sharpners.  Just was not crazy about this product at all,  Will not purchase again.  and I kept trying it...hoping I would eventually like it...but nope, didn&#x27;t at all</li>
    <li> Not waterproof. Tried to use for water line and smudged immediately. Makes eyes water and red.</li>
    <li> Very good quality eyeliner, stays on for long periods of time &amp; stays on neatly. Planning on buying many more of these, surely do not want to run out! Saids a lot about this eyeliner considering my eyes are always watery &amp; have mild oily skin. I recommend it.</li>
