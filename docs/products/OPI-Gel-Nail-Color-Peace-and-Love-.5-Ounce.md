      <li>Very unique color!  </li>
      <li>The color is amazing</li>
      <li>Nice gel color by O.P.I.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this color!!</li>
      <li>Very nice unique color</li>
      <li>/&gt;The stores were great and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>This color is pretty and the polish went on well and looks great.</li>
      <li>Shellac for me works better than acrylic.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not office appropriate in my opinion, and it looks like I&#x27;m going to a rave.</li>
      <li>Goes with many colors of polishes.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re into that, then you will love this Peace and Love piece of blah gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
      <li>OPI is just way more holographic which is what I wanted to see between the two.  </li>
      <li>Very sophisticated, cool color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used OPI&#x27;s and Essie&#x27;s, and I love both.</li>
      <li>I have received many compliments with this polish.</li>
      <li>and I really am glad that I purchased it.  </li>
      <li>perfectly until I re-did my nails 2 weeks later.  </li>
      <li>I love both and would not hesitate to recommend either brand.</li>
      <li>Then, you need a bonder (I love OPI&#x27;s), and smooth, buffed nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to remove.</li>
      <li>Applies nicely and wears great- just as expected of OPI.</li>
      <li>Very pretty!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic color for when I want something</li>
      <li>Plus--the wear is simply fantastic.</li>
      <li>So you need to have an LED/UV light to cure this polish.</li>
      <li>Simply beautiful with the greens, purples and grey hues.</li>
      <li>Color glides on easily and provides full coverage in two coats.</li>
      <li>You need this step for the full coverage and extended wear that you get from OPI.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I will use it a lot, but its cool.</li>
      <li>But still, its a cool polish</li>
      <li>Definitely different, probably not one of my favorite shades, looks more like something that should be on a car.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly versatile, and can look great for formal occasions as well as casual looks.</li>
      <li>A very pretty gray tone and purple tone.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite OPI color...</li>
      <li>Fun color</li>
      <li>dark purple/grey in most lights and at most angles.  </li>
      <li>this is a pretty grey color, kind of like a metal.</li>
      <li>This may be the first polish I&#x27;ve bought online</li>
      <li>First: this is a GEL shade.</li>
      <li>but its so pretty on</li>
      <li>The polish is exactly like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like the color of oil that leaked onto a parking lot.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use the one by [[ASIN:B00662Z24A Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 Starter Kit]], but make sure you get the one that plugs into the wall</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s different and unique!</li>
      <li>It is so neat to see the many different looks you&#x27;ll get with this polish by only changing the light.</li>
      <li>Many compliments every single day I wear it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unusual to see on your hands.</li>
      <li>it shifts between purple, teal, and a deep silver depending on the light and the angle at which you&#x27;re looking at your nails.  </li>
      <li>Different but cool color</li>
      <li>This gel polish is gorgeous and funky: it changes color between shades of grey, green, blue, and purple depending on how the light hits it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, it is super similar to my Gelish Midnight Caller.  </li>
      <li>It lasts well, about 10 days on my natural nails--and much, much longer on my toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I got a normal one.</li>
      <li>The green isn&#x27;t as noticeable in most lights; the polish looks  </li>
      <li>While it looks like it might go on green from the label, it really is more of a gray-tone, in my book, with hints of iridescent green, purple and magenta (for peace, love and OPI).</li>
      <li>This color is so pretty its actually a duochrome in gel!</li>
      <li>and you can do so much to bring out the different facets</li>
      <li>(This is a shimmering gel, which makes it extra lovely in my book--super small shimmer, not glitter.)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s medium, not dark.</li>
      <li>This color is a true duochrome that flashes from a pale grey-green to a pinkish-purple.</li>
      <li>I found that this shade didn&#x27;t have much shrinkage, either--unlike some of the other shimmering shades.</li>
      <li>Stays on for at least a week or more depending on how active you are.</li>
      <li>which is rare and hard to find it does take 2-3 coats to get a soild color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wonderful winter color. Polish applied evenly and opaquely. Long lasting wear. Easy to remove.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colors!</li>
    <li> Nice gel color by O.P.I.</li>
    <li> This gel polish is gorgeous and funky: it changes color between shades of grey, green, blue, and purple depending on how the light hits it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic color for when I want something a little &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; but it can still masquerade as somewhat conservative.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful!!! It exceeded my expectations. My new favorite OPI color...cant wait to go to the nail salon and use it again and again and again!</li>
    <li> Love this color! Its a grayish purple that has an iridescent greenish look to it. Great quality gel polish from OPI.</li>
    <li> This color is a true duochrome that flashes from a pale grey-green to a pinkish-purple. There are hints of blue in it as well. It is an opi gelcolor, but it&#x27;s completely compatible with the gelish base coat/top coat which is what I use. I&#x27;ll try to check back in two weeks and report about how well it&#x27;s holding up. I absolutely love this color!</li>
    <li> Very pretty!  Easy application and great &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;.  However, it is super similar to my Gelish Midnight Caller.  OPI is just way more holographic which is what I wanted to see between the two.  I love both and would not hesitate to recommend either brand.</li>
    <li> The polish is exactly like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like the color of oil that leaked onto a parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re into that, then you will love this Peace and Love piece of blah gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;there may come a time when I need a color like this (Halloween maybe?) so I&#x27;ll hang onto it&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not office appropriate in my opinion, and it looks like I&#x27;m going to a rave.</li>
    <li> Very sophisticated, cool color. Many compliments every single day I wear it.</li>
    <li> Great color but I did not see a lot of the green.</li>
    <li> This may be the first polish I&#x27;ve bought online that looks like it did in the picture.  The green isn&#x27;t as noticeable in most lights; the polish looks  dark purple/grey in most lights and at most angles.  But still, its a cool polish and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very nice unique color</li>
    <li> Matches the regular OPI polish.  Shellac for me works better than acrylic.  Not as stiff and brittle.</li>
    <li> Wonderful nail polish.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical with ordering a new color online and went everywhere I could to read reviews about this color.  I loved it!  The color depends on the lighting.  In my office it appeared grey with an iridescent shade of green.  Outside it has a greenish/grey base with an iridescent pink shimmer.  The color is amazing and I really am glad that I purchased it.  The polish itself never chipped and wore perfectly until I re-did my nails 2 weeks later.  OPI has an excellent gel color line and the quality is superb!</li>
    <li> This is a great color- it shifts between purple, teal, and a deep silver depending on the light and the angle at which you&#x27;re looking at your nails.  It has the quality I expect from O.P.I.</li>
    <li> Simply beautiful with the greens, purples and grey hues. It is so neat to see the many different looks you&#x27;ll get with this polish by only changing the light. Applies nicely and wears great- just as expected of OPI.</li>
    <li> beautiful color and it changes with the different lighting. A very pretty gray tone and purple tone.  I have received many compliments with this polish.</li>
    <li> This color is pretty and the polish went on well and looks great. I would recommend OPI gel polish to anyone, it is great!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this color!! Stays on for at least a week or more depending on how active you are.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! Color glides on easily and provides full coverage in two coats.</li>
    <li> I have been using RCM and very happy except the &amp;#34;pooling&amp;#34;.  I love OPI polish and was happy to see them doing gel now.  I may have done something wrong but followed instructions, read reviews and did research on other sites and the 2 colors I tried peeled off within hours.  too expensive and very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stores were great and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This color is so pretty its actually a duochrome in gel! which is rare and hard to find it does take 2-3 coats to get a soild color. but its so pretty on</li>
    <li> The color is gorgeous, but I have ordered a gel color and I got a normal one. However, I paid the price for a gel color. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> this is a pretty grey color, kind of like a metal. It&#x27;s different and unique! Goes with many colors of polishes.</li>
    <li> Fun color and you can do so much to bring out the different facets</li>
    <li> This versatile shade, surprisingly goes with everything. While it looks like it might go on green from the label, it really is more of a gray-tone, in my book, with hints of iridescent green, purple and magenta (for peace, love and OPI). It&#x27;s surprisingly versatile, and can look great for formal occasions as well as casual looks. Plus--the wear is simply fantastic. I found that this shade didn&#x27;t have much shrinkage, either--unlike some of the other shimmering shades. (This is a shimmering gel, which makes it extra lovely in my book--super small shimmer, not glitter.) It lasts well, about 10 days on my natural nails--and much, much longer on my toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to add a few things since my last review. First: this is a GEL shade. So you need to have an LED/UV light to cure this polish. I use the one by [[ASIN:B00662Z24A Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 Starter Kit]], but make sure you get the one that plugs into the wall (battery operated ones just don&#x27;t seem to work as well. (You don&#x27;t have to spend a million bucks, though. Plus, you need a top and base coat. I&#x27;ve used OPI&#x27;s and Essie&#x27;s, and I love both. (Red Carpet&#x27;s is a little rough on my nails, I have to admit.) Then, you need a bonder (I love OPI&#x27;s), and smooth, buffed nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next--this is a shade that may not be for everyone. It&#x27;s medium, not dark. And it is a little goth when you start getting extra coverage. And mixing these colors together does look a little like an oil slick. It&#x27;s unusual to see on your hands. If you don&#x27;t wear black or grey, purple, green or blue on your nails, you may not love this shade. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then--shake the bottle for 2 minutes. You need this step for the full coverage and extended wear that you get from OPI. Trust me--just don&#x27;t skip this step. If you don&#x27;t have time to shake for 2 minutes, do your nails another time.</li>
    <li> Very unique color!  Like an eggplant.  Sometimes green, sometimes purple, sometimes in between.  I don&#x27;t think I will use it a lot, but its cool.</li>
    <li> Well wrapping for shipping.  Wearing it now -- Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a color changing shade, varies from pewter to green to purple.  Definitely different, probably not one of my favorite shades, looks more like something that should be on a car.  Goes on well, lasts well.</li>
    <li> Different but cool color</li>
