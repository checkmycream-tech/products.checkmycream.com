      <li>This is an freakin awesome scent!!!!..</li>

      <li>This is great for my body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>friend of ours shared this great smelling cologne with us.</li>
      <li>Its a great product.</li>
      <li>The smell is great and have already received comments on it.</li>
      <li>So if you want something that&#x27;s going to make women come up to you and say \\&quot;mmmm, what are you wearing\\&quot; but don&#x27;t want to spend $75/bottle, Baldessarini is a great bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>Great Body Scent for Men.</li>
      <li>but I do love it!!</li>
      <li>nice price!</li>
      <li>Not alot of people wear it which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>it price was good</li>
      <li>Hugo Boss Baldessarini works for me.. and best of all, the Amazon price is the CHEAPEST (paid about 30.00 and free shipping)</li>
      <li>This is a great, very unique smell.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>but I think this is at the top!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Now, to be honest...</li>
      <li>If one could own just one fragrance, this would be it IMHO.</li>
      <li>Easy ordering, quick delivery, and good packaging make online purchasing an attractive alternative to shopping at the Mall.</li>
      <li>Great ingredient combo, not too strong, not too light..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine!  </li>
      <li>and I love smelling</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years.</li>
      <li>Surely the \\&quot;By Hugo Boss\\&quot; part couldn&#x27;t have been part of the brand</li>
      <li>Love love love the smell.</li>
      <li>I like Baldessarinin better.</li>
      <li>My husband and I love this scent.  </li>
      <li>The ladies love it.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
      <li>Boss is great for summer, the other three are great for the rest of the season or in the evening.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the original love</li>
      <li>and it has quickly become his favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy the compliments.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with the whole transaction.</li>
      <li>It has the nice tobacco (fresh tobacco, not cigarette smoke), fresh mint, touch of pine and leather which provide the manly frame for this winner.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on this cologne by some incredibly hot ladies.</li>
      <li>I fell in love the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>Although I think that this cologne can be in almost any situation, I would tend to save this for special occasions with formal attire.</li>
      <li>I wear it for special occasions</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Baldessarini Colognes and this particular one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Hugo Boss has a few very very good choices to choose from</li>
      <li>it becomes sweet after some minutes...</li>
      <li>It has a hint of tobacco yet a sweet smell.</li>
      <li>Cool bottle too.</li>
      <li>The smell is masculine and intriguing, exellent!!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
      <li>Shipping is quick &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>He calls it &amp;#34;my &#x27;get lucky&#x27; cologne&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>But my problem has been either the smell is too strong in the first spray or the smell somehow changes after the first spray.  </li>
      <li>I agree that colognes are kind of personal..</li>
      <li>It would be appropriate for the man who is mature; 30+ not teenagers.  </li>
      <li>Kind of pissed about my recent purchase.</li>
      <li>Very nice masculine cologne, dry and strong at first but combined with skin ph</li>
      <li>After many and many kinds of other types of Eau de toilettes that I  used, this one is #1 for me.</li>
      <li>You can wear it year round, it&#x27;s sure to be appropriate for any occasion.</li>
      <li>All I can say is that over the years I have used tons of cologne,  first smelled Baldessarini in 2002 in Tulsa, Ok.   </li>
      <li>Most recently from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>and I definitely was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>When they transport the fragrance it gets warm and ruins the smell.</li>
      <li>WOULD CERTAINLY SUGGEST  TO OTHERS TO BUY THIS PERFUME.</li>
      <li>Some time after the drydown, the scent warms up with sandalwood, musk and ambergris for that romantic night with that special woman ;-)  </li>
      <li>Very distinctive and enduring fragrance.</li>
      <li>really like this cologne</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to get things heated up.</li>
      <li>It smells nice but does not last very long at all.</li>
      <li>I have used this fragrance for decades and feel fortunate to still find it online long after it has disappeared from the shelves.</li>
      <li>My only regret is that your site does not carry the full line on Baldessarini fragrances as I would purchase them all if I could.</li>
      <li>I own an entire shelf full of fine cologne (sad, I know), and there are three brand names that have never dissapointed me</li>
      <li>A classic.</li>
      <li>I highly discourage purchasing this item.</li>
      <li>Wow, the araomas of rosemarry and mint are wonderfully refreshing, lasting natural scents that are manly but not gender specific!</li>
      <li>It has a fantastic scent that stays with you all day where other colognes tend to dwindle within a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>Very masculine.</li>
      <li>Was sent to be carefully packaged and quickly.</li>
      <li>old son for Christmas</li>
      <li>Besides wondering if old</li>
      <li>I instantly knew this was my husband&#x27;s new cologne.</li>
      <li>Baldessarini has been my personal favorite lately.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that I was surprised at this time , the ones I ordered from Amazon ,they are MADE IN GERMANY.Before they were MADE IN UK ( at MACY*S ).</li>
      <li>Baldessarini is in the upper echelon of cologne, yet costs about 50-70% as much as anything made by the other two.</li>
      <li>This is counterbalanced with a slight freshness of citrus and juniper, but not to the extent of today&#x27;s metrosexual/aquatic/unisex fragrances out on the modern market.  </li>

<li> so this at LEAST 8 years old??</li>
<li> Cologne arrived as expected.</li>

<li> The smell is subtle and last long.</li>
<li> I would compare it to Vera Wang for Men or Black Orchid by Tom Ford.</li>
<li> I HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH IT</li>
<li> Overpriced but not available elsewhere</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Terrific mens fragrance. Shipping is quick &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on this cologne by some incredibly hot ladies. This stuff works and smells great! I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to get things heated up.</li>
    <li> Very nice masculine cologne, dry and strong at first but combined with skin ph it becomes sweet after some minutes... nice price! the only problem: it lasts only 2 hours then it loses its smell!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 28 yr. old son for Christmas and it has quickly become his favorite cologne. I bought it after reading several of the reviews on Amazon and selected it based on all the favorable comments. Couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with the whole transaction. Easy ordering, quick delivery, and good packaging make online purchasing an attractive alternative to shopping at the Mall. Baldessarini by Hugo Boss is a must have for the man with discriminating taste. Very distinctive and enduring fragrance. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to make a statement. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tough to buy cologne online if you haven&#x27;t tested it, this was the case for this and I am not impressed. It smells nice but does not last very long at all.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C230GW Baldessarini By Hugo Boss For Men. Eau De Cologne Spray 2.5 Oz.]]  All I can say is that over the years I have used tons of cologne,  first smelled Baldessarini in 2002 in Tulsa, Ok.   And to this day it is still my favorite !!!  Will continue to order it from Amazon.com.....</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for decades and feel fortunate to still find it online long after it has disappeared from the shelves.</li>
    <li> I fell in love the first time I used it.  The smell is masculine and intriguing, exellent!!!  Lasts a long time too.  What&#x27;s not to like.  You can&#x27;t buy it in Hugo&#x27;s botiques.  Msr.  Baldessarini and Hugo have parted ways.  You have to buy it online.  And do so.......</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying fragrances online. When they transport the fragrance it gets warm and ruins the smell. Kind of pissed about my recent purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Just like the item I purchased locally but at half the cost.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Overpriced but not available elsewhere</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne in Canada two years ago for twice the price it is being offered currently. It has a hint of tobacco yet a sweet smell. I would compare it to Vera Wang for Men or Black Orchid by Tom Ford. I like Baldessarinin better. Not alot of people wear it which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I own an entire shelf full of fine cologne (sad, I know), and there are three brand names that have never dissapointed me once- Versace, Georgio Armani, and Hugo Boss. Baldessarini is in the upper echelon of cologne, yet costs about 50-70% as much as anything made by the other two. So if you want something that&#x27;s going to make women come up to you and say \\&quot;mmmm, what are you wearing\\&quot; but don&#x27;t want to spend $75/bottle, Baldessarini is a great bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> I agree that colognes are kind of personal.. each one to his (or her)own.. Hugo Boss Baldessarini works for me.. and best of all, the Amazon price is the CHEAPEST (paid about 30.00 and free shipping) I could find. Even the \\&quot;sale\\&quot; prices at the big department stores were about 48.00 dollars (reg 60.00).</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites Hugo Boss&#x27; cologne. A classic. The sandalwood, pine and tobacco notes are perfectly mixed to create this well rounded fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a great, very unique smell.  You can wear it year round, it&#x27;s sure to be appropriate for any occasion.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Baldessarini Colognes and this particular one is my favorite. It has a fantastic scent that stays with you all day where other colognes tend to dwindle within a couple of hours. My only regret is that your site does not carry the full line on Baldessarini fragrances as I would purchase them all if I could.</li>
    <li> I hate the current trend of making men&#x27;s cologne smell unisex. A man should smell like a MAN! After numerous product samples at a department store with my husband, we landed on this. It smells AWESOME! Very masculine. Lots of sandalwood and a hint of musk. No one could mistake this scent for a women&#x27;s product. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My favorites are Hugo Baldessarini, Gucci Envy and Gucci Rush and Hugo Boss.  I have tried others such as CK Eternity, Lacoste, Giorgio Armani Acqua di Gio, Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male, Estee Lauder Pleasure, Polo etc. But my problem has been either the smell is too strong in the first spray or the smell somehow changes after the first spray.  But not with those four.  Boss is great for summer, the other three are great for the rest of the season or in the evening. Baldessarini has been my personal favorite lately.  The smell is subtle and last long.</li>
    <li> Its a great product. I am using this almost 3 years now.. I am not able to change from this..</li>
    <li> I have purchased Baldessarini by Hugo Boss for years.  Most recently from Amazon.  According to the official Hugo Boss website under FAQ&#x27;s, the Baldessarini brand was sold by Hugo Boss in 2006.  Amazon is still selling &amp;#34;Baldessarini by Hugo Boss&amp;#34; online.  Since it is unlikely that &amp;#34;Baldessarini by Hugo Boss&amp;#34; would be manufactured after the brand was sold in 2006, does that imply that the product Amazon is selling is potentially 8 years old or older?  Something to ponder before you buy.</li>
    <li> really like this cologne</li>
    <li> I orderd baldessarini by Hugo Boss. But I got the baldessarini by baldessarini.&lt;br /&gt;I am so dissatisfied  The quality of the product is not the same</li>
    <li> ...wearing this because it smells too good!  I wear it for special occasions and I enjoy the compliments.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This one has it all!  It has the nice tobacco (fresh tobacco, not cigarette smoke), fresh mint, touch of pine and leather which provide the manly frame for this winner.  This is counterbalanced with a slight freshness of citrus and juniper, but not to the extent of today&#x27;s metrosexual/aquatic/unisex fragrances out on the modern market.  Some time after the drydown, the scent warms up with sandalwood, musk and ambergris for that romantic night with that special woman ;-)  My wife loves this fragrance and women have complimented me on my cologne.  Although I think that this cologne can be in almost any situation, I would tend to save this for special occasions with formal attire. It would be appropriate for the man who is mature; 30+ not teenagers.  I think that this scent has the possibility to be a signature scent as it is not that ubiquitous nor hyped by media/mass marketing.  Therefore, not many people know about this cologne.  Finally, I think that it can be used anytime of the year, cold or warm weather.  If one could own just one fragrance, this would be it IMHO.</li>
    <li> After many and many kinds of other types of Eau de toilettes that I  used, this one is #1 for me.Each time  when I am using this and going  to work the people always asking me about the name  of this product.The only thing that I was surprised at this time , the ones I ordered from Amazon ,they are MADE IN GERMANY.Before they were MADE IN UK ( at MACY*S ).</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this scent.  Great Body Scent for Men.</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product based on its reviews and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best scent I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s pretty strong and I love smelling&lt;br /&gt;myself. This is it!</li>
    <li> This is great for my body chemistry.  The ladies love it.  I met my wife and I owe it to my suave nature and this cologne.</li>
    <li> I see Hugo Boss sold the Baldessarini brand in 2006: [...]    Surely the \\&quot;By Hugo Boss\\&quot; part couldn&#x27;t have been part of the brand so this at LEAST 8 years old?? Does cologne have a shelf life? Anyone?    Some comments say fake but bought the concentrate from amazon last time and smelled like previous bottles to me. This is an freakin awesome scent!!!!.. Great ingredient combo, not too strong, not too light.. I highly discourage purchasing this item. My secret, stay away!    Besides wondering if old</li>
    <li> He calls it &amp;#34;my &#x27;get lucky&#x27; cologne&amp;#34;.  Now, to be honest... it doesn&#x27;t work every time... but I do love it!!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PERFUME. I HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH IT AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS PERFECT.I WOULD CERTAINLY SUGGEST  TO OTHERS TO BUY THIS PERFUME.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C230GW Baldessarini By Hugo Boss For Men. Eau De Cologne Spray 2.5 Oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of ours shared this great smelling cologne with us. I instantly knew this was my husband&#x27;s new cologne. It is one of the best smelling colognes I have had had the pleasure of smelling. Cool bottle too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine!  I&#x27;ve used it for many years.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes. Hugo Boss has a few very very good choices to choose from but I think this is at the top!</li>
    <li> LO MEJOR EN COLONIAS  DE HOMBRE, ES FRESCA Y SUAVE, HACE QUE QUIERAS ESTAR CERCA DE TU PAREJA NO LEJOS DE EL.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne based on feedback from Amazon and I definitely was not disappointed! The smell is great and have already received comments on it. Definitely a manly cologne but not overpowering. Lasts throughout the day. Was sent to be carefully packaged and quickly. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Wow, the araomas of rosemarry and mint are wonderfully refreshing, lasting natural scents that are manly but not gender specific!</li>
    <li> Second purchase from a amazon  and it&#x27;s the original love it price was good</li>
    <li> Cologne arrived as expected. Will use seller again in the future.</li>
