      <li>and they work great.</li>
      <li>quality of the brush isn&#x27;t that great, either.</li>
      <li>LOL</li>

      <li>Very good teethbrush, thanks Jesus</li>
      <li>They are the perfect size for a toddler to use and have soft bristles.</li>
      <li>But, again its fine for once a week at Grandma&#x27;s house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice because the suction cups allow them to stand on their own without having to buy a toothbrush holder for Grandma&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
      <li>But it went just fine in a cup and everyone is happy and teeth are  clean.</li>
      <li>and they love it</li>

      <li>My nephew loved his present.</li>
      <li>The suction cup doesn&#x27;t stay stuck very well and the toothbrush gets knocked over easily.</li>
      <li>He has so much fun brushing his teeth.</li>
      <li>The front image is actually a smooth piece of plastic embedded into the handles and not just a sticker, which is nice because it wont wear off in time or when you get it wet.</li>
      <li>This makes brushing fun.</li>
      <li>Childs like it very much.</li>
      <li>They have a smaller head and thinner grip than I was expecting, but ok for my 4-year-olds.</li>
      <li>The suction cup feature is really a plus!  </li>
      <li>We have better sized toothbrushes for daily use at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The toothbrushes are great, the only problem was they sent the pink Stella set instead of the red/green/blue set shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>Thanks so very much.</li>
      <li>They will dry better too.</li>
      <li>My boys are 2 and 4, the brushes are large for their mouths.</li>

      <li>Everyone wants one.</li>

      <li>Now he wants to brush his teeth all the time and he loves it that his toothbrush sticks to the mirror.</li>
      <li>He really loves to brush his teeth</li>
      <li>Kids love the angry birds and love how you can suction it to the sink, so the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t roll around and get toothpaste all over the sink.</li>

    <li> My boys love them. I ordered 2 sets the last time just to have backups encase they stop making them. It&#x27;s perfect for my 3 boys to keep their brushes separate. They are huge Angry Birds fans.</li>
    <li> Nice product and great service.</li>
    <li> My boys LOVE these brushes. They have a smaller head and thinner grip than I was expecting, but ok for my 4-year-olds. Just wish it was a 4 pack!</li>
    <li> Angry bird is the rave right now.  My nephew loved his present. quite a conversation piece.  Everyone wants one. LOL</li>
    <li> My mom gave this to my son as a bday gift and he absolutely loved it. He has so much fun brushing his teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 5 year old grandson, he loves them.&lt;br /&gt;He keeps one at his house, one at my house and one in his travel bag.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my kids to use at Grandma&#x27;s house. At least once a week we go there for dinner and I like the kids to be ready for bed when we head home. My boys are 2 and 4, the brushes are large for their mouths. We have better sized toothbrushes for daily use at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brush isn&#x27;t that great, either. They are sturdy, but lack the contouring of a nice toothbrush. But, again its fine for once a week at Grandma&#x27;s house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice because the suction cups allow them to stand on their own without having to buy a toothbrush holder for Grandma&#x27;s bathroom. The suction is always gone by the time we come back, but they do stay standing.</li>
    <li> My children are extremely happy with these toothbrushes of Angry Birds. They have a rubber which allows them to be adhered to the wall of the lavatory.</li>
    <li> Got for my 5 year old nephew obsessed with angry birds.  He will just love them.  They are so colorful and cute.</li>
    <li> Kids love the brightly colored tooth brushes and I love the suction cups...  they dont fall into the sink as much anymore!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as I expected!</li>
    <li> I actually got these for my dog and they work great. I love the suction cup at the bottem. And they are soft on there teeth.</li>
    <li> was a great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> Brush is taught, causes bleeding gums some time.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with your product. My 5 year old son loves the toothbrushes. They were in excellent condition. Will definitely consider ordering through you again in the future.</li>
    <li> My boy loves it cuz it is soft and colorful</li>
    <li> We could not find any Angry Birds toothbrushes in any of local stores this year, which shocked me because I have seen these little guys on just about everything.  They are ADA accepted so that&#x27;s a plus. There were no reviews for me to go off of when I ordered so I just took a chance. The toothbrush handles are a mix of hard plastic and a soft gel grip with contours on the back side for your fingers. The front image is actually a smooth piece of plastic embedded into the handles and not just a sticker, which is nice because it wont wear off in time or when you get it wet. The bristles are soft as described and it does have tongue scrapper on the back side. The suction cups really stick. If this is something you are looking for, they work. We hang ours so it wasn&#x27;t an issue but they do stick and stay stuck over time. For the price I think they are great and will get the job done as well, which is the most important part. Great stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> My son is crazy for Angry Birds!  These really and truly encourage brushing his teeth.  Thanks so very much. Bye</li>
    <li> Very cute toothbrushes.  my son always looks forward to brush his teeth because of his Angry Birds toothbrushes</li>
    <li> I was on a small shopping spree for my grandson and so I purchased these.  Besides adorable, they&#x27;re good quality for the price.  The suction cup feature is really a plus!  I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when the time comes for new toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old grandson loves to brush his teeth now because he has a choice of which Angry Birds toothbrush he gets to use.  They are the perfect size for a toddler to use and have soft bristles.</li>
    <li> This was for my great nephews and they love it, their mom loves the suction to stick on the sink!</li>
    <li> I bought these for our 3 year old grandson along with a couple of other gifts.  (These were an add-on.)  Turns out that this was his FAVORITE gift.</li>
    <li> They actually want to brush several times a day. The suction cup bottom prevents it from getting icky on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> These are fun toothbrushes especially for any kid who is an avid fan of angry birds. This makes brushing fun.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush,  fun colors! Exactly what my little guy wanted.</li>
    <li> My grandson just turned three and I bought these Angry Birds toothbrushes because he always plays the angry bird game he really likes them, so between them &amp; the avenger toothbrushes. He really loves to brush his teeth</li>
    <li> These are really colorful and cute! I like the shape also. Any angry birds fan would want to brush more with these, so I know my Grandkids will be using them. Fast shipping, and great price. They are a gift, so I cant check to see how well they stick to the sink, but the concept of a stand up toothbrush that adheres at the base is a great idea. No more toothbrushes laying all over. They will dry better too.</li>
    <li> These are great, out son LOVES angry bird and now he loves to brush&lt;br /&gt;his teeth. The suction cups work good for keeping them in place and the&lt;br /&gt;price was great.</li>
    <li> very good, excellent, vivid images, beautiful design, fun toothbrushes, child brushes his teeth with pleasure&lt;br /&gt;angry birds encouraging my child every day</li>
    <li> The kid loves them. And they have the little suction cup on the bottom. He is a fan of that too.</li>
    <li> My son is Obsessed with angry birds so this was the perfect Christmas present. The only thing is they don&#x27;t stick to the counter very well. It might just be the material mine is made from. But it went just fine in a cup and everyone is happy and teeth are  clean. Very satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely recommend these, they weren&#x27;t that pricey.</li>
    <li> Got these for my grandson. Will be three in August. He loves anything angry birds. Now he wants to brush his teeth all the time and he loves it that his toothbrush sticks to the mirror.</li>
    <li> Kids love the angry birds and love how you can suction it to the sink, so the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t roll around and get toothpaste all over the sink.</li>
    <li> The suction cup doesn&#x27;t stay stuck very well and the toothbrush gets knocked over easily. My son loves it, though.</li>
    <li> Not for children under 5</li>
    <li> My grandson wants all &amp;#34;angry bird stuff&amp;#34; for his birthday into weeks. I assure he will love this. Shopping made easy for a grandma.</li>
    <li> I like the Angry Bird style, but my son has chewed off the suction cups and I was afraid of choking hazard. So I would caution to use these only for kids who don&#x27;t chew things ...</li>
