      <li>I did not like this product, very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I use them the more I will like them.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping the more</li>
      <li>so you aren&#x27;t able to grab a hair to tweeze.</li>
      <li>I like the light, the tweezer part is ok.  </li>
      <li>These are ok for what they are nothing fancy but they light up the area</li>
      <li>These are so cool!</li>
      <li>very good light and focusses properly on hair to be removed.</li>
      <li>These are awesome, worth the money and the batteries seem to last FOREVER!!!</li>
      <li>But for the price, it was fine...</li>
      <li>There are clearly a cheap knock-off made out of the country.</li>
      <li>These tweezers are a cheap piece of junk.</li>
      <li>One didn&#x27;t light at all.  </li>
      <li>And its not like the cheap tweezers you buy at walmart that sometimes dont work with finer hair.</li>
      <li>but i dont like the quality ((( i like light</li>
      <li>The LED light is just the added touch I need.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t help to have a LED light and tweezers</li>
      <li>I took it apart and threw away the tweezers and keep the light in case i need.</li>
      <li>The price is cheap, and you get what you paid for.  </li>
      <li>Bet it will be a hit and the price was good for giving a little extra &#x27;happy&#x27;!</li>
      <li>Very precise grip and comfort as well, very precise tips,very good at getting to short cut facial hair</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and was neatly package.  </li>
      <li>The first time I pressed the button for the light, it stayed stuck</li>
      <li>Other than that, It does a good job.</li>
      <li>AS consumers we have the right to share our product experiences without seller interference.</li>
      <li>PRETTY NEAT TOOL. .</li>
      <li>The sellers refunded my money after I lodged a complaint which I believe was fair and the right thing to do.</li>
      <li>Tweezer doesn&#x27;t grab very well.  </li>
      <li>Before using this, I was always blinding myself trying to get as much light as possible to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>The idea is really neat</li>
      <li>I was excited to see these because I recently lost a similar pair of tweezers which were fantastic.</li>
      <li>I bought theses to get a decent tweezers for splinters but they wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>You might be lucky and get one that actually works, but I did not.</li>
      <li>Just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to grip tightly for some reason.  </li>
      <li>The center light is so wide that you can&#x27;t properly tweeze I do not recommend these.</li>
      <li>The design is nice, but the tweezer levers just simply do not line up, hence rendering it completely useless.  </li>
      <li>Tweezers are no good, with or without the light.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These tweezers are a cheap piece of junk. The light works great but the tweezers are so cheap the tips do not line up. I tried over and over to remove a hair and it couldn&#x27;t do it. I was excited to see these because I recently lost a similar pair of tweezers which were fantastic. There are clearly a cheap knock-off made out of the country. Do Not buy these! A complete waste of money and time. The sellers refunded my money after I lodged a complaint which I believe was fair and the right thing to do. However,they have emailed me several times asking me to remove the negative feedback which I find insulting. AS consumers we have the right to share our product experiences without seller interference.</li>
    <li> It works great and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product when you cannot see the bright light illuminates the area that you need to work on. recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> These are so cool! We love that they came with three batteries! Perfect for our puppy who seems to get stuck stuck in her all the time.</li>
    <li> Have trouble seeing those pesky whiskers and facial hair this your answer.  It grabs even the thinnest hair closely and plucks it with ease.</li>
    <li> PRETTY NEAT TOOL. . .ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT. ..</li>
    <li> Awful quality! I am sorry that such a defective item  bought!! :(( I hope in the future I will not allow such an error</li>
    <li> Falls apart when you use them. The center light is so wide that you can&#x27;t properly tweeze I do not recommend these.</li>
    <li> These are ok for what they are nothing fancy but they light up the area well that you need to while tweezing or pulling splinters</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these.  One didn&#x27;t light at all.  The other has fallen apart in a few months.  I definitely do not recommend these cheapo Chinese tweezers.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help to have a LED light and tweezers don&#x27;t work well. I took it apart and threw away the tweezers and keep the light in case i need.</li>
    <li> 1 of the 2 batteries was dead.</li>
    <li> llego a timepo dentro de los paramentros&lt;br /&gt;valio la pena en especial con el gift que eh conseguido&lt;br /&gt;me gusta</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the batteries. One battery pack was dead on arrival. The spare is weak. Other than that, It does a good job.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product, very cheaply made. I bought theses to get a decent tweezers for splinters but they wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The idea is really neat and I am still trying to get used to them. I&#x27;m hoping the more I use them the more I will like them. Its a bit of a wider grip than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> LIFE SAVER for those pesky little chin hairs. I have found my preference for the attack. The LED light is just the added touch I need.</li>
    <li> The first time I pressed the button for the light, it stayed stuck and I was unable to fix it.  Also, unable to attach the light to the tweezers.  Tweezers are no good, with or without the light.  Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> I like the light, the tweezer part is ok.  Just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to grip tightly for some reason.  But for the price, it was fine...</li>
    <li> very good light and focusses properly on hair to be removed. however it needs some time to acquire skill to pluck hair</li>
    <li> Before using this, I was always blinding myself trying to get as much light as possible to pluck my eyebrows. I might have to order new ones for my boyfriend as he uses them to pull out small screws and stuff from electronics. These are awesome, worth the money and the batteries seem to last FOREVER!!!</li>
    <li> This will be a stocking stuffer.  It arrived quickly and was neatly package.  Bet it will be a hit and the price was good for giving a little extra &#x27;happy&#x27;!</li>
    <li> The ends of the tweezer do not line up well so you aren&#x27;t able to grab a hair to tweeze.</li>
    <li> This item was great.  The light on it is great and helpful.  I love it.  And its not like the cheap tweezers you buy at walmart that sometimes dont work with finer hair.</li>
    <li> i have this item almost 1 year and it works still but i dont like the quality ((( i like light but it is  bad for eyelash, but its ok in price</li>
    <li> Work good would buy again</li>
    <li> Very precise grip and comfort as well, very precise tips,very good at getting to short cut facial hair, fingers have good grip areas</li>
    <li> Batteries in product were dead.  Attempted to replace batteries with additional recieved with item, and they were also dead.  would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Still difficult to see whether in light or dark lit rooms.  Tweezer doesn&#x27;t grab very well.  Wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this product.  Took a very long time to receive product.</li>
    <li> The price is cheap, and you get what you paid for.  The design is nice, but the tweezer levers just simply do not line up, hence rendering it completely useless.  You might be lucky and get one that actually works, but I did not.</li>
