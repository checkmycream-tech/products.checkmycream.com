    <li> So pleasantly surprised how offordable and awesome this works on my skin. Smooth matte finish that lasts. I use Giorgio Armani but I swear I use this gem more! Def reccoment</li>
    <li> Good value. My adult daughter and I like this a lot.  It really lasts, according to my daughter, at least 25 hours (she&#x27;s slept with it on and says wakes up still looking &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34; (in a good way).  It&#x27;s a little thicker than the liquid foundations we were more used to but I&#x27;ve resolved this by blending/finishing with a makeup sponge. It&#x27;s also at first a little tricky to avoid getting more than needed distributed from the tube but with a little practice I&#x27;ve resolved this too. We paid a little over $7 for 1oz and, at that price, excellent value; has lasted me a couple of months (tho&#x27; I don&#x27;t wear foundation EVERY day). I haven&#x27;t researched to get more info about ingredients or to find out if they use animal testing or not and they don&#x27;t make any &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; claims.</li>
    <li> it small dont have wear alot  goes on smooth good pricegood deal for what get might buy more more for light  skin color</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation. It&#x27;s affordable and lasts all day long. A little bit goes a long ways. I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit oily so I need my tissue paper to even it out on my skin...  Otherwise, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;DM</li>
    <li> My wife is satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product it evens out my skin color nicely. The only issue I have with it is that it does not have sunscreen. Also I would love it if they made a powder in the same color.</li>
    <li> Love this product. So sad it isn&#x27;t at the store anymore. I don&#x27;t know what to do when they run out. I tried 3 other brands before ordering online</li>
    <li> only thing i use now. great coverage and long lasting</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re ordering online you may have to resort to buying it &amp;#34;blind&amp;#34;  since - and this applies to most makeup - you can&#x27;t actually see it on your own skin.  Still,  the sellers are usually really good about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that,  no complaints here.  The packaging is fine,  but be careful because you only need a little bit and it&#x27;s easy to spill.  I used my fingers to apply,  after moisturizing,  and then buffed it out with a foundation brush.  I use MUFE&#x27;s High Def. Powder on top,  then ELF&#x27;s Mist &amp; Set and Bingo!  You get a really long-lasting look with no cakiness or patchy bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this,  once you&#x27;ve found the right shade !</li>
    <li> I love this make-up. I buy it at walmart usually but found a deal with amazon so I ordered it</li>
    <li> This lasts all day and he price is right. It actually matches my skin color perfectly and is not drying at all.  I want to buy it in a shade darker too. Excellent coverage.</li>
    <li> Great foundation very happy to find it used it for years and then found out the stores quit carrying it .</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation.  It is easy to apply and truly does stay on all day.  Great coverage, as good or better as more expensive foundations.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product</li>
    <li> Best foundation EVER!  So easy to apply and covers beautifully!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a product that you can use and with this you can squeeze in your cream to make a nice creamy foundation to put on everyday.  I just use a little with my face cream in the morning and it works.  You can actually use any creamy liquid foundation to meet your color and texture.</li>
    <li> DID NOT STAY WITH MY OILY SKIN.  JUST SEEMED TO MELT OFF.  BEST FOR EXTREMELY DRY SKIN</li>
    <li> It makes my skin oily.</li>
    <li> Works great. Just feels a little too mask-like</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast! Product came just as expected. Great coverage!</li>
