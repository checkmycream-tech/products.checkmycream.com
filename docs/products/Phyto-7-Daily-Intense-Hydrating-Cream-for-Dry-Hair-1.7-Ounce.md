      <li>This is nice to tousle through your hair if your hair feels dry.  </li>
      <li>I am able to use this over all of my hair without it becoming oily or weighed down.</li>
      <li>About 6 years ago, I was first introduced to this product by the Hair Dr. in Sacramento.</li>
      <li>This is quite different from conditioner or even most leave in products.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>

      <li>The shampoo in that set is very drying.</li>
      <li>but I have so much hair</li>
      <li>Having very frizz prone hair does not help either....</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice everyday leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is the best leave-in conditioner I have every used--it doesn&#x27;t go very far, because I have thick, coarse hair, and it takes a lot, but if you are looking for something to help dry, overprocessed hair, this is it.</li>
      <li>Now it it soft and manageable thanks to Phyto 7.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Phyto hydrating cream to anyone with true dry hair.</li>
      <li>Helped tremendously with dry scalp</li>
      <li>I live in Texas with naturally curly hair and lots of humidity</li>
      <li>The ends of my hair are chronically dry, but the rest of my hair is pretty normal.</li>
      <li>My hair is extremely dry and damaged right now.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using the complete package.</li>
      <li>I really does go a long way, however I found it did not help detangle my hair, and did not feel &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; at all.</li>
      <li>this product actually make my hair feel almost normal again.</li>
      <li>My thin fine hair responded very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a bit expensive, but a little goes a long way and it gives great results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m over 70 and live in a dry area of northern California, so my hair needs a little extra help. I use Phyto 7 when I don&#x27;t have time for conditioning. It&#x27;s my on-the-run hair treatment. It adds softness and shine without sacrificing body.  Yummy stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the complete package. The shampoo and conditioner for dry hair and the oil application for thinning hair. I have noticed a great difference in softness and manageability of my hair</li>
    <li> Just recently I visited a friend in Colorado. She moved there permanently and although the area is beautiful, she mentioned that she really struggles with dry and flying hair. I remembered years ago my hairdresser recommended \\&quot;Phyto Daily Cream\\&quot; to me. Since then I am a big fan of this product. My hair isn&#x27;t dry any longer and doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all. Just perfect! What can I say - my friend loves it. And I&#x27;ve got another invitation to visit Colorado soon! :-)</li>
    <li> Makes hair really smooth and is great. Really Really like it. Does wonders on my hair. Always use this product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is for ethnic hair</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those who have medium to very thick hair. My hair practically drinks it! This product gives great moisture, and shine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this when I ordered the Phytocyane system to treat hair loss. The shampoo in that set is very drying. This is quite different from conditioner or even most leave in products. You apply a very small amount and rub it through the hair. I really does go a long way, however I found it did not help detangle my hair, and did not feel &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; at all. For my fine, straight hair type I needed to use argan to get a comb through it. Might work well for certain hair types, but I will not buy it again for mine.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this. I put some on my hair after I towel drying, then blow-dry my hair. Doesn&#x27;t leave a feel able residue, which I really like. Buying on Amazon means that the price is better than at the hair dresser to.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  My hair gets very frizzy on the ends and this smooths it out without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I currently live in the New Orleans area, and frankly for most of the year the weather is dreadful: is there a word to describe \\&quot;beyond humid\\&quot;?? Having very frizz prone hair does not help either.... I use this in conjunction with the Phytodefrisant when I blow my hair out, and it helps keep my hair smooth. Quite often I will forgo conditioning in the shower and just use the Phyto 7 as a leave in conditioner. It is a bit expensive, but a little goes a long way and it gives great results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and phyto products had been excellent in the past.  Me thinks that the quality of ingredients has changed. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice everyday leave in conditioner. you have to be careful with the amount or your hair can end up looking greasy.</li>
    <li> This works great. You can wake up with flat hair,put this in and it looks like you just did your hair,but it doesn&#x27;t give you a wet look. Also godd during the day.</li>
    <li> The ends of my hair are chronically dry, but the rest of my hair is pretty normal. I am able to use this over all of my hair without it becoming oily or weighed down. It doesn&#x27;t give super shine but it does make my hair feel and look healthy.</li>
    <li> Since moving to Arizona -- where there is NO moisturee in the air -- my hair was extremely dry. Now it it soft and manageable thanks to Phyto 7.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair protection at the gym and continues to do so for the rest of the day. Non greasy, light, good fragrance. Not sure why Phyto are ending this line only to repackage and hike up the price by 100% .....</li>
    <li> I was told about this product by a friend and it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. My hair is too thick and unruly I had to use a lot product for it to work on my hair</li>
    <li> Did not work for my hair type...</li>
    <li> Aftering using Phyto Straightening Balm I had hoped that this would be as good a product as that is but I was disappointed. It didn&#x27;t hydrate my hair as well as other products I have used--namely the Morocan Oil hydrating cream. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Phyto hydrating cream to anyone with true dry hair. Save your money and/or use the Morocan oil cream.</li>
    <li> About 6 years ago, I was first introduced to this product by the Hair Dr. in Sacramento. My hair is difficult to deal with due to being of mixed races - Black and Korean. I have very curly hair and I tend to use a lot of product in it to maintain a wet look through out the day. Phyto seems to repair my damaged hair with each use. This leave-in conditioner is absolutely amazing for my hair because I&#x27;ve noticed that it leaves my hair so soft and bouncy. I especially like the results I get when I utilize it while my hair is wet. After I shower at night I use this product. I will sometimes braid my air in a bunch of little braids and then go to sleep. When I wake up and remove the braids, my hair feels so smooth and silky. Overtime, it appears to have added an extra shine and luster. When I am not in a mood to braid my hair, I make put my hair in a bun, and I get the same effect. Whenever I blow dry my hair, I will use this product for the added protection to save my hair from the heat. It&#x27;s also good to use to detangle your lovely locks after a shower. This product never feels greasy or heavy and the scent is not harsh or over bearing. The product loses one star due to in being a bit pricey. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Phyto is worth it but I have so much hair and I tend to go through a bottle at least one a month.</li>
    <li> Received this hair treatment in my salon!  It was wonderful.  My thin fine hair responded very well.&lt;br /&gt;It was fuller and the styling lasted for days.  Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> GOOD NON GREASY PRODUCT BUT NO MIRACLE</li>
    <li> This is a staple for me.  I put a dollop in my hand and rub my palms together, then run my hair through my hands, concentrating on the ends.  It&#x27;s also great to do on long flights, where the air is so dry!</li>
    <li> Phyto products are generally good.  This is nice to tousle through your hair if your hair feels dry.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is useful for wavy or curly hair - less frizz, more curl. also great after swimming in chlorinated pools.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave-in conditioner I have every used--it doesn&#x27;t go very far, because I have thick, coarse hair, and it takes a lot, but if you are looking for something to help dry, overprocessed hair, this is it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hairs smooth and frizz-free.  I will definitely buy this again when I run out. Does not leave hair greasy or weighed down.</li>
    <li> Fixes and manages your hair, but instead of stiff, your hair is pliable and lustrous.  I now use it daily.</li>
    <li> I used to use this all the time and I thought I would try it again. Unfortunatley it doesnt seem to be as hydrating as argon oil so I will not be reordering.</li>
    <li> Helped tremendously with dry scalp</li>
    <li> I live in Texas with naturally curly hair and lots of humidity and this is the best product to keep it tame!</li>
    <li> Looked, felt and smelled like cooking oil. And of course my hair smelt like fries. Did not like this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure of the difference between Ultra and Intense , but I love them both.  I apply to wet and dry hair. My hair is extremely dry and damaged right now.  this product actually make my hair feel almost normal again.</li>
