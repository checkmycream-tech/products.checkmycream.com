      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>The quantity is great and It&#x27;s not thick at all like other top coat/base coat nail polishes!</li>

      <li>My nails are brittle, and tend to break below the quick.  </li>
      <li>I have tried all the high end products when it comes to top/base coat nail paints, but Sally Hansen is THE BEST, hands down!</li>
      <li>they are that strong and a great top coat also it will have that nail polish that takes forever to dry touchable dry in min worth the $</li>
      <li>So, by that I&#x27;m sure you can all tell I really enjoy this strength instant nail hardener.</li>
      <li>I think the results look better than gel with this clearcoat, and its easier to apply by far.</li>
      <li>No more peeling, breaking, and it works great as a basecoat.</li>
      <li>This product absolutely delivered as it said it would - Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use many strength products for my nails but this one helps when I feel my nails are starting to crack much more or bend or are more flexible than they usually are.</li>
      <li>This product absolutely delivered as it said it would!</li>
      <li>I also like to wear it alone as a light clear coat that protects my nails.</li>
      <li>My nails are much healthier thanks to this polish!</li>
      <li>now have more confidence that my nails will not unexpectedly break from splits or from being fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My nails are already &amp;#34;maltreated&amp;#34;, if I may say, and this nail hardener really works.</li>
      <li>How to use:   -Shake gently.</li>
      <li>Its fast drying as well.</li>
      <li>My nails were much stronger after about two weeks of using it.  </li>
      <li>The polish begins to peel very unnatractively and pull the nail off with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had for about three months straight.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It really works well on my nails.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very affordable compared to other hyped brands but is more functional.</li>
      <li>It keeps is nails strong and  long</li>
      <li>I then cut my nail so that I would prevent hurting it more due to the length of my nail</li>
      <li>My nails are getting back to its original condition.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ll start using it more carefully, not using as much on my smaller nails.</li>
      <li>I have this really cool white polish that I can never get to cover evenly and with one coat of this underneath</li>
      <li>Great base I love it my polish never chips, diamond strength is lie silicone for my polish &amp; my polish</li>
      <li>My nails usually break very easily</li>
      <li>My other nails seem fine though.</li>
      <li>It dries in an instant, and saves me sooo much time!</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does--strengthens nails instantly.</li>
      <li>It has a shine which is distinct to it as the coat dries up and the shine lasts long!</li>
      <li>Apply one coat to clean, dry, bare nails.</li>
      <li>I really like products that have multiple uses, and this one can do triple-duty.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>I paint my nails frequently</li>
      <li>My nails do feel stronger the day the polish is applied, but it quickly goes down hill from there.  </li>
      <li>the ends of my nails get a little rough, I file (uni-directionally) with a very fine file, then paint just the tips of my nails with a coat of this product.</li>
      <li>My nails had been peeling and breaking a lot recently (which I&#x27;ve attributed to a minor B-vitamin deficiency, the product of 5 years as a vegan) and this helped right away.</li>
      <li>You can wear alone, which looks clean, clear and natural, with a polished look (great for summer), or you can wear as a base coat, underneath colored polish!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived leaking/used nail polish dried on side of bootle- disgraceful!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this nail strengthener he had me search for this one. It keeps is nails strong and  long</li>
    <li> I love this product. This product hardens your nails instantly.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  It seems hard to find in stores lately!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My nails usually break very easily but 1 coat of this stuff does the trick. No more peeling, breaking, and it works great as a basecoat. I also like to wear it alone as a light clear coat that protects my nails.</li>
    <li> My nails bend very easily, so I started using this. It works miracles for bendy nails. But you need to be careful with not putting a thick layer on. The white part of my pinky nail just crumbled off last night. It&#x27;s a stub now. I think the problem is I start with my pinky nails so I have a lot of the product on those nails compared to the larger nails. I have heard on numerous occasions that using this product CAN cause brittle crumbly nails. So I&#x27;ll start using it more carefully, not using as much on my smaller nails. My other nails seem fine though. They still bend some and are not brittle. So overall I think this is a very good product if you have very bendable thin weak nails.  Here is how you are supposed to use it (from the Sally Hansen UK website as the US version of the site does not give directions)...  How to use:   -Shake gently. Apply one coat to clean, dry, bare nails. Let dry.  -For extra protection apply a second coat, or use as a strengthening base coat.   -Try using it as a 7 day treatment:   -Day 1:   -Apply 1-2 thin coats to dry, clean, bare nails, apply nail polish if desired.   -Day 3:   -Apply a further thin coat over the existing nail treatment / colour.   -Day 6:   -Remove all products from nails (using Acetone Free Nail Polish Remover - as this will dry out your nails the least) and leave bare for 24 hours.   -Day 7:   -You may begin the treatment again. Repeat usage will give you the results you desire so make sure you stick at it.</li>
    <li> Made my nails super strong and shiny. It looked like I had my nails done, but just used the nail strengthener. Helped me to grow my nails out longer!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic. Add long as you keep it on your entire nail,  they won&#x27;t break or peal.  I even apply some under the tip of my nails  if they&#x27;re long enough.  Which they will be as long as I keep this polish on my nails! Great stuff.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!!  Application was easy.  It&#x27;s odorless, which I appreciate because many products have a scent.  It dries really quickly, which is great!  My nails are truly protected; within days there was a visible difference in growth.  Also, my nails are stronger and are no longer chipping and peeling off in layers.  You can wear alone, which looks clean, natural &amp; clear with a polished look (great for summer), or you can wear as a base coat, underneath colored polish!  My girls are now using this also!  This product absolutely delivered as it said it would!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Saving Money By Doing My Own Medi.</li>
    <li> Works great! My nails are so flimsy from fake nails, but this adds so much strength to my nails. Its fast drying as well.</li>
    <li> After trying this nail hardener, I am pleased to give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to bond instantly to nails as it ends splitting, cracking, and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails were splitting, cracking, and fragile before using the hardener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying it to my splitting nails, the hardener filled in the weak spots and gave the nails a glossy finish; they indeed feel stronger and less fragile after using the hardener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have more confidence that my nails will not unexpectedly break from splits or from being fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the product lived up to its claims, I think it deserves 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell strong,  provides a good shield.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT.  WOULD RECOMMEND  IT TO EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> My nails do feel stronger the day the polish is applied, but it quickly goes down hill from there.  It immediately begins to peel and flake off.  I have had no reduction in chipped, cracked, or back bent nails.  It just doesn&#x27;t last long enough, and I don&#x27;t have time to remove and reapply this daily!</li>
    <li> My nails are brittle, and tend to break below the quick.  But not if I remember to use this product!  I have tried everything under the sun, and this is the ONLY one that prevents breaking and splitting.  If they stop making it, I&#x27;ll be in trouble.</li>
    <li> This is very strong. Although I have still have some splits in my nails since using it, I haven&#x27;t had any broken nails.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!!  Application was easy.  It&#x27;s odorless, which I appreciate because many products have a scent.  It dries really quickly, which is great!  My nails are truly protected; within days there was a visible difference in growth.  Also, my nails are stronger and are no longer chipping, breaking, and peeling off in layers.  You can wear alone, which looks clean, clear and natural, with a polished look (great for summer), or you can wear as a base coat, underneath colored polish!  My girls are now using this also!  This product absolutely delivered as it said it would - Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> My polish took just three days to get here! I was waiting for it to get here so that I could take off my acrylic nails I&#x27;ve had for about three months straight. I was scared I would have to cut my real nails since they are always weak &amp; brittle. Sally Hansen&#x27;s Diamond Strength polish saved my nails! I recommend to everyone with brittle weak nails looking to grow out they&#x27;re nails! It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great product. I really like products that have multiple uses, and this one can do triple-duty.&lt;br /&gt;1) It does exactly what it says it does--strengthens nails instantly. My nails had been peeling and breaking a lot recently (which I&#x27;ve attributed to a minor B-vitamin deficiency, the product of 5 years as a vegan) and this helped right away. 2) The formula is thin and gives a great shine with one coat, although I think two looks best. 3) I was surprised what a great base coat it was. I have this really cool white polish that I can never get to cover evenly and with one coat of this underneath it looks phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is what my nails needed.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Sally Hansen products for many years. This is a product I&#x27;ve bought over the years. So, by that I&#x27;m sure you can all tell I really enjoy this strength instant nail hardener. It&#x27;s a great nail strengthener. I don&#x27;t use many strength products for my nails but this one helps when I feel my nails are starting to crack much more or bend or are more flexible than they usually are. I just use this a few times a month and my nails go back to being what I like for them to be. strong.</li>
    <li> I used this product once or even twice daily for about a week and my nails got weaker! They were more easily bent and chipped than ever before. They chipped for no apparent reason. I had to file my nails way down to hide the cracks and chips. The polish begins to peel very unnatractively and pull the nail off with it. I don&#x27;t recommend this product and I am still searching for something more effective.</li>
    <li> I love this polish! my nails are so strong! they have always been long but would peel break and chip often. story: I hit my nail off the toilet and it broke way down on my actual finger bed but I hit it very hard. I then cut my nail so that I would prevent hurting it more due to the length of my nail it was hard to cut my nail with nail clippers! they are that strong and a great top coat also it will have that nail polish that takes forever to dry touchable dry in min worth the $</li>
    <li> I love this and the Teflon Tuff as I use them both when I do my nails and the polish stays on until I decide to remove it, no chipping or peeling, my nails are gowing longer and faster than I thought they would and have not broken as of yet, I file them a bit just to shape them, a definate yes to recommending this, I&#x27;ll never be without it</li>
    <li> This works great and dries quick!</li>
    <li> Helps me grow out my nails, keeping them hard and protected against chipping and cracking.</li>
    <li> My nails are already &amp;#34;maltreated&amp;#34;, if I may say, and this nail hardener really works. Makes my nails really hard as diamonds! It&#x27;s very affordable compared to other hyped brands but is more functional. I love it!</li>
    <li> Like the original one better.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have nails that peel and split. This product protects and strengthens my fingernails. Best purchase ever. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> got this today in my mailbox and I am super happy with my purchase! The quantity is great and It&#x27;s not thick at all like other top coat/base coat nail polishes! I have tried all the high end products when it comes to top/base coat nail paints, but Sally Hansen is THE BEST, hands down! It dries in an instant, and saves me sooo much time! It has a shine which is distinct to it as the coat dries up and the shine lasts long! I will defintely buy this again in the future! I highly recommend this! Sally hansen rocks! :) Trust me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase! :)</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. It really makes my weak nails much stronger! I would definitely recommend it for anyone with weak nails or nails that peel.</li>
    <li> Perfect to keep near my computer as I am looking for things, I can polish my nails and read.  This dries very fast and is the only thing that my terrible nails can tolerate.</li>
    <li> Being a swimmer i am in the pool about 2 hours a day, and the chlorine would practically shred my nails. This stuff is great because I finally can have longer nails, my nails are super shiny i also use a strengthening top coat and it works great :)</li>
    <li> Great base I love it my polish never chips, diamond strength is lie silicone for my polish &amp; my polish last 2 weeks great buy</li>
    <li> This base coat is amazing! I bought it once I took my fake nails off after prom, and it helped so much!  My nails were much stronger after about two weeks of using it.  If you want to give your nails a break, you can also use this without nail polish, and just wear it alone for a couple of days.  My nails are much healthier thanks to this polish!</li>
    <li> Excellent!! Very strong polish and very reliable!! Nails haven&#x27;t broke or chipped since putting it on 3 weeks ago!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry nails that have deep ridges from end to half-moon. They split, flake and break easily. I&#x27;m constantly having to repair them. Yet, at the same time, I have to use a heavy-duty cuticle and nail cream (that I make up myself). I have them fairly well under control, except when I don&#x27;t. When they start to flake, split and break, I reach for the Sally Hansen Diamond Strength Instant Nail Hardener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the best I have ever found. Even if my nails are breaking, I usually can salvage them with a bit of notebook paper across the break or split or flake, then painting with 3-4 coats of Sally Hansen Diamond Strength Instant Nail Hardener. This stabilizes the defect until it grows out. I repolish several times over the next week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the ends of my nails get a little rough, I file (uni-directionally) with a very fine file, then paint just the tips of my nails with a coat of this product. It smooths the ragged ends better than filing alone so they won&#x27;t snag and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received this nail hardener/polish as a birthday present.  I love it because it dries very hard in only 60 seconds or less!  It is so shiny that my nails look like glass!  Since I work in child care and also do a lot of cooking, cleaning, and gardening, I wanted a polish that would hold up.  This definitely does the job!  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was having trouble with my nails breaking so I tried this. It worked great.  My nails haven&#x27;t broken since.</li>
    <li> Amazingly hard finish -- much better than expected. I think it does help my very thin nails from bending and tearing, too, so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really works well on my nails. I use it as a top coat as well and my nails are nice and strong</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried about 5 different brands.</li>
    <li> For some reason this past month, my nails were chipping and splitting. I paint my nails frequently so I decided to search for a nail strengthener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one last week and after a few days I noticed a big difference.  I used this as a bottom base coat then after it dried I put on nail polish.  My nails are getting back to its original condition. My problem nails were my index fingers and thumbs and I have not seen any chips this past week. This is a definite must have.</li>
    <li> This is the shizz, one coat as a base, your color and a coat or even 2 on top of that and your nails are diamond hard, I mean you can really push on them and they will not bend when you have this stuff on. I think the results look better than gel with this clearcoat, and its easier to apply by far. The ingredient list lists actual diamond powder and titanium. Good stuff, good stuff.</li>
    <li> Love the shine this product gives.My nails are thin,and this product doesn&#x27;t give them diamond strength,but it helps.</li>
