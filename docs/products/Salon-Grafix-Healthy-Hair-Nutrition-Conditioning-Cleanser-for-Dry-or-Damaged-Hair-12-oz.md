      <li>Plus, it smells amazing!</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works great &amp; my hair feels healthy.</li>
      <li>What amazing results.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product.  </li>
      <li>my hair has never been this nice.</li>
      <li>My fingers glide and my hair just looks and feels so nice.</li>
      <li>This product is priced right, has great ingredients and saves me time.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love...</li>
      <li>I love the WEN product line.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase this here (found it WAY cheaper at the store), and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend more than I had to.</li>
      <li>I noticed how much more lift my hair had at the roots and how much better it felt.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to run my fingers through my hair without getting my fingers stuck in knots.</li>
      <li>Wonderful for dry hair.</li>
      <li>I works wonderfully more manageable smooth</li>
      <li>Best part is, it doesn&#x27;t lather so it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair out of the necessary oils and my freshly dyed hair color.</li>
      <li>,they have very oily hair,and first ti,e they used it they said it was great and</li>
      <li>I love this product, it works great for my fine, dry hair.</li>
      <li>I follow instructions and for me a conditioner has too make my hair also tangle free..</li>
      <li>,then i rinse out,since my hair tends to tangle this works the best,i even bought the oil formula for my two teenage boys and it works great</li>
      <li>This stuff was on clearance at Walgreen&#x27;s for super cheap (like $4 or so)</li>
      <li>and it actually smells pleasant.</li>
      <li>As I have very dry, fly away hair I&#x27;ve wanted to try something like this for years but couldn&#x27;t afford the ones advertised on television.  </li>
      <li>But cleansing conditioner seems to keep things nicely balanced; after drying, my hair is incredibly soft and not at all weighed-down.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and had high hopes as a conditioner.</li>
      <li>The first time I loved it as it left my hair sleeker and free of tangles, but I&#x27;ve fallen out of love with it on my subsequent uses.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>My hair is more managable and soft.</li>
      <li>Secondly, it works best if you work it through your hair and wait a few minutes before rinsing it out</li>
      <li>About a year ago when I first saw the WEN hair care commercials, I wanted to try a cleansing conditioner.</li>
      <li>The first time I could feel a difference with my hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s left my hair much more matted, and it also feels much more dry and brittle.</li>
      <li>For me, this has made a positive difference.</li>
      <li>Now I kept seeing WEN commercials again, but I still wasn&#x27;t willing to spend that much money</li>
      <li>Again, the success of this may be all about hair type because if your hair is very fine it may weigh it down too much.  </li>
      <li>I have very long,thick wavy  hair, i have been using the dry hair Salon Grafix for two months now,And I love it,but if you have long hair and its easy to get tangle,you might want to try this</li>
      <li>so I DO have to use quite a bit of this, and so the downside is I go through a bottle much more quickly than I&#x27;m used to, but given the money I wasted trying so many other things</li>
      <li>Really, it doesn&#x27;t even look like a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34;, it looks like a 2-in-1.</li>
      <li>Thanks Mom.</li>
      <li>My hair started breaking a lot and getting much frizzier -</li>
      <li>I decided to go sulfate-free after much research into help for my moody hair.  </li>
      <li>Even then, do so GENTLY at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>,i brush my hair out before using the product,always put the product on your hands thenfrom the top of your head down tom</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve scratched layers of residue off my scalp with my fingernail after using this, which pretty much defeats the purpose of it being a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner.&amp;#34;  I just washed my hair tonight using a different product and immediately after I stepped out of the shower</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using WEN for the past few weeks and LOVE it, but needed to find a more affordable alternative.</li>
      <li>It was very soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>hair was pretty damaged from coloring and after some conditioning to get it back in line, my scalp overcompensated.  </li>
      <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t lather like regular shampoo.  </li>
      <li>My hair is pretty fine and has a tendency to look dry due to styling damage.</li>
      <li>didnt even make my hair soft.</li>
      <li>Obviously, it isn&#x27;t Wen, but it works really well for me at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell at first because its not like other flowery smelling shampoos/conditioners, but I got used to it</li>
      <li>I originally bought it at Walmart because it&#x27;s only a little over $5, but I thought I&#x27;d leave a review here anyway.</li>

<li> Of course like any color-treated and hot tool styled hair, mine is still a little fizzy, but WAY less while I use SG.</li>

<li> Thirdly, it doesn&#x27;t give hair that hyper-conditioned slickness when wet.  </li>
<li> My hair feels softer and not as dry</li>
<li> I cannot believe how this Grafix shampoo allows me to go the distance and not &amp;#34;over&amp;#34; wash my incredibly dry hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little different, but you get used to it.  </li>
<li> a huge disappointment.</li>
<li> My hair feels a little tangled if I try to brush it out wet, so I recommend holding off on combing through it until its dry (or until after blow drying).  </li>
<li> I tried other conditioners that makes my hair untangled &amp; you can put your fingers through it..</li>
<li> I have thick, wavy hair that is also dyed and prone to chemical damage, so I am always trying different brands of hair products to see what works at what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> I have Irish, thick, and medium length hair.</li>
<li> I had oily scalp and dry ends, and the squeaky-cleanness of regular shampoo just made it worse.  </li>
<li> My hair has calmed down,</li>
<li> I wanted to replicate the silky softness I got from the expensive stuff, but got the same results from this as I used to get from regular shampoo/conditioner.</li>
<li> less breakage, the frizz is less, though I always have some.  </li>
<li> I have long, thick, wavy/curly hair</li>
<li> Got very dry and dull, etc.  </li>
<li> (I usually leave it in for five minutes).  </li>
<li> WEN is definitely too expensive</li>
<li> This took at least 30 pumps.</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t post bad reviews, but please, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!</li>
<li> /&gt;But I&#x27;m confused as to why it&#x27;s so expensive when I get mine for almost $6 at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
<li> :(</li>
<li> Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
<li> It was terrible.</li>

    <li> About a year ago when I first saw the WEN hair care commercials, I wanted to try a cleansing conditioner. WEN is definitely too expensive so I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and I bought a cheaper version called Hair One. It was terrible. It made my hair greasy the next day, I felt gross. I gave up on it and went back to traditional shampoo again for a year. Now I kept seeing WEN commercials again, but I still wasn&#x27;t willing to spend that much money so I searched Walmart.com for all the cleansing conditioners they have. I found this one, Salon Graphix. I&#x27;m in love... my hair has never been this nice. Of course like any color-treated and hot tool styled hair, mine is still a little fizzy, but WAY less while I use SG. My hair is more managable and soft. I have wavy/curly hair and I&#x27;ve never been able to run my fingers through my hair without getting my fingers stuck in knots. Not with SG. My fingers glide and my hair just looks and feels so nice. Best part is, it doesn&#x27;t lather so it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair out of the necessary oils and my freshly dyed hair color. I originally bought it at Walmart because it&#x27;s only a little over $5, but I thought I&#x27;d leave a review here anyway. I wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell at first because its not like other flowery smelling shampoos/conditioners, but I got used to it and it actually smells pleasant.</li>
    <li> It works great &amp; my hair feels healthy.</li>
    <li> I have very long,thick wavy  hair, i have been using the dry hair Salon Grafix for two months now,And I love it,but if you have long hair and its easy to get tangle,you might want to try this ,i brush my hair out before using the product,always put the product on your hands thenfrom the top of your head down tom the ends work it in that way ,then i get my shower comb and run it thru ,leave it in for about 5 minutes or however long it takes to wash the rest of me ,then i rinse out,since my hair tends to tangle this works the best,i even bought the oil formula for my two teenage boys and it works great,they have very oily hair,and first ti,e they used it they said it was great and Thanks Mom. hope this helps,P.s its alittle bit cheaper at Kroger grocery stores</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this here (found it WAY cheaper at the store), and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend more than I had to. I&#x27;ve been using WEN for the past few weeks and LOVE it, but needed to find a more affordable alternative. For me, this wasn&#x27;t it. My hair is pretty fine and has a tendency to look dry due to styling damage. I wanted to replicate the silky softness I got from the expensive stuff, but got the same results from this as I used to get from regular shampoo/conditioner. Really, it doesn&#x27;t even look like a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34;, it looks like a 2-in-1. Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! She says it does what it&#x27;s supposed to for her hair and now she buys this brand because it&#x27;s way cheaper than the $40 bottle she used to buy from Ulta, while still giving her the same results!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and had high hopes as a conditioner. I could not put a brush through my hair it was so tangled. I have never had this problem before even with suave (seriously).&lt;br /&gt;What a huge disappointment. Will use to shave my legs with.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works great for my fine, dry hair. I alternate this with an astringent shampoo. This product is priced right, has great ingredients and saves me time.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair that is also dyed and prone to chemical damage, so I am always trying different brands of hair products to see what works at what doesn&#x27;t. This stuff was on clearance at Walgreen&#x27;s for super cheap (like $4 or so) and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. The first time I loved it as it left my hair sleeker and free of tangles, but I&#x27;ve fallen out of love with it on my subsequent uses. It&#x27;s left my hair much more matted, and it also feels much more dry and brittle. I&#x27;ve scratched layers of residue off my scalp with my fingernail after using this, which pretty much defeats the purpose of it being a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner.&amp;#34;  I just washed my hair tonight using a different product and immediately after I stepped out of the shower I noticed how much more lift my hair had at the roots and how much better it felt.  This conditioner may work for someone else, but it didn&#x27;t work for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I works wonderfully more manageable smooth</li>
    <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t like regular shampoo/conditioner, so you have to adjust your expectations when using it.  First, it doesn&#x27;t lather like regular shampoo.  It&#x27;s a little different, but you get used to it.  Secondly, it works best if you work it through your hair and wait a few minutes before rinsing it out (I usually leave it in for five minutes).  Thirdly, it doesn&#x27;t give hair that hyper-conditioned slickness when wet.  My hair feels a little tangled if I try to brush it out wet, so I recommend holding off on combing through it until its dry (or until after blow drying).  Even then, do so GENTLY at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was pretty damaged from coloring and after some conditioning to get it back in line, my scalp overcompensated.  I had oily scalp and dry ends, and the squeaky-cleanness of regular shampoo just made it worse.  But cleansing conditioner seems to keep things nicely balanced; after drying, my hair is incredibly soft and not at all weighed-down.  Obviously, it isn&#x27;t Wen, but it works really well for me at a fraction of the price. Plus, it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this on Monday this week and tried it the same day.  As I have very dry, fly away hair I&#x27;ve wanted to try something like this for years but couldn&#x27;t afford the ones advertised on television.  The first time I could feel a difference with my hair.  It was very soft and manageable.  Today, Thursday I used it for the second time.  What amazing results.  My hair has a bounce to it that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.  It looks and feels fuller.  I have very fine hair.  I have waves in my hair I din&#x27;t even know I had.  My hair feels softer and not as dry but I want to continue using the product before I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Ugh. This makes your hair feel like straw. I usually don&#x27;t post bad reviews, but please, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I decided to go sulfate-free after much research into help for my moody hair.  My hair started breaking a lot and getting much frizzier - all hormone-related!  Got very dry and dull, etc.  Did a lot of research and decided to try a non-lather product to see if it would help.  I also read to try a color-protecting one even if you don&#x27;t color your hair, which I don&#x27;t.  This product has helped A LOT.  My hair has calmed down, less breakage, the frizz is less, though I always have some.  I have long, thick, wavy/curly hair so I DO have to use quite a bit of this, and so the downside is I go through a bottle much more quickly than I&#x27;m used to, but given the money I wasted trying so many other things it&#x27;s worth it.  Again, the success of this may be all about hair type because if your hair is very fine it may weigh it down too much.  For me, this has made a positive difference.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  I cannot believe how this Grafix shampoo allows me to go the distance and not &amp;#34;over&amp;#34; wash my incredibly dry hair.  I use hair color and this product helps preserve the color.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m confused as to why it&#x27;s so expensive when I get mine for almost $6 at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for dry hair.</li>
    <li> Today is when i bought it in Walmart. I follow instructions and for me a conditioner has too make my hair also tangle free.. it made my hair tangled i had to put herbal hessin conditioner to untangle my hair Salon Grafix didnt even make my hair soft. I tried other conditioners that makes my hair untangled &amp; you can put your fingers through it..Not this one.</li>
    <li> I love the WEN product line. The price is steep with WEN, so I figured on trying various others.  :( This took at least 30 pumps. I have Irish, thick, and medium length hair.</li>
