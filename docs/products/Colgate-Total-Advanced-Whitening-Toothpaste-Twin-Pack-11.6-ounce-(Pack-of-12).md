      <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>

      <li>MY FAVORITE TOOTHPASTE.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>love getting this from subscribe and save so that we never run out.</li>
      <li>so this toothpaste must be helping my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>For more information on triclosan, refer to the EPA website.  </li>
      <li>I like it better than the version with whitening products in it.</li>
      <li>Please educate yourselves on the chemical \\&quot;Triclosan\\&quot; found in this product and many others.  </li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t need to use bubblegum any more.  </li>
      <li>Love the price.</li>
      <li>This was OK for the price</li>
      <li>With the subscribe and save, this made for a pretty good price on this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Colgate Total Anticavity Fluouride And Antigingivitis Toothpaste, Clean Mint Paste, here-in being reviewed, is THE best toothpaste -- that I have found, anyway.  </li>
      <li>A very good product that is practically used daily!  </li>
      <li>Nice fresh sent.</li>
      <li>I use this over other products because my dentist recommended it as one of the best available.</li>
      <li>Nothing is better than having a clean, smooth, minty mouth</li>
      <li>The tubes are huge.</li>
      <li>sure the Colgate Total Whitening Toothpastes are good as well --</li>
      <li>it was Colgate Total Advanced Clean, which I greatly prefer.  </li>
      <li>Not too sweet or not too strong minty either.</li>
      <li>It always leaves my teeth clean and minty.</li>
      <li>It has a good flavor, low abrasiveness, and contains flouride.</li>
      <li>Super size tubes.</li>
      <li>But I sure am satisfied with COLGATE TOTAL ANTICAVITY FLOURIDE AND ANTIGINGIVITUS TOOTHPASTE!  </li>
      <li>But I sure am satisfied with COLGATE TOTAL ANTICAVITY FLOURIDE AND ANTIGINGIVITUS TOOTHPASTE!  </li>
      <li>Darticular person -- rarely satisifed with anything.  </li>
      <li>only one that really works best, and to my total satisfaction, is this &amp;#34;clean mint&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>to coalgate: you have an amazing product, please don&#x27;t change products on us periodically; it hurts my head having to always figure out a right product for health only to see it vanish away.</li>
      <li>So, I happily use ONLY Total Clean Mint</li>
      <li>IT was not expensive, Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Great toothpaste I like this much better then crest or Sensodyne as Sensodyne feels chalky and weird to me..</li>
      <li>Good toothpaste that makes your mouth feel clean is hard to find but this colgate is it.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>At first I figured it was from eating salty pumpkin seeds</li>
      <li>It has a nice flavour, (somewhat different from the original flavour when TOTAL toothpaste first came out,  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was happy to receive a free sample of Colgate Total and finally tried it only two weeks ago.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a rather particular person -- rarely satisifed with anything.  </li>
      <li>And non of them guarantee that you will be cavity free, one could only wish!!</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s all the precaution you really need.  </li>
      <li>Somehow, I feel that gel toothpastes, whatever their virtues, add too much water, so one does not get as much value as in a paste.  </li>
      <li>when i wake up the next day morning, my mouth still feels reasonably fresh!  </li>
      <li>As of today, I brushed my teeth about 14 hours ago as I am writing this and, as I run my tongue over my teeth, they feel completely clean.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This product was highly recommended by my hygenisist.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the item.</li>
      <li>toothpaste does contain triclosan that the FDA has found to be effective in reducing gingivitis, though not effective at all for hand soap.</li>
      <li>it gives me a day long, 24 hour really, fresh breath and the feeling of cleanliness.</li>
      <li>When I use any other toothpaste my teeth feel like they don&#x27;t get as clean.  </li>
      <li>I got some Arm and Hammer complete care.  </li>
      <li>I guess this might be because I grew up using the original formula of Colgate&#x27;s toothpaste -- then switched to Total because its ads touted it had a twelve-hour action, due to adding TRICLOSAN, an antibacterial, antigingivitis agent.  </li>
      <li>The commercials are correct when they say you&#x27;ll have a cleaner smile that lasts longer than other toothpastes.</li>
      <li>I am saying it because I can feel the deep clean compared to other toothpastes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it and use it daily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Crest, Spry, Tom&#x27;s, regular Colgate, Aqua Fresh, and now I recently tried Colgate Total.</li>
      <li>Yet, hmmnn,,,, upon using up a tiny bit of the original I still had left from a few years back, I must admit I really do like the new flavour even a bit</li>
      <li>We love Colgate Total but hard to find without whitening.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t change it or give it a new different name for marketing purpose.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does both duties and it appears does them well. Nice amount of toothpaste for amount paid, being the biggest and the baddest for the money! Love nice deals! Colgate kind of edges Crest in my humble, but daily user who likes to keep a fresh mouth instead of shocking unfamiliar noses with unhealthy practices, seems to be a little different than Crest in the overall taste. Colgate 1, Crest (so sory). 4.5 healthy stars!</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a year now and my dental checkups have been great.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I could never use anything except for this now. It always leaves my teeth clean and minty. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> With the subscribe and save, this made for a pretty good price on this toothpaste.  We only use this type of Total as our dentist said the whitening toothpastes were too harsh for my husband&#x27;s gums and mouth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it was Colgate Total Advanced Clean, which I greatly prefer.  This was OK for the price but I won&#x27;t but it again.</li>
    <li> Being a dental hygienist, I personally like to experiment with a variety of toothpastes. I&#x27;ve tried Crest, Spry, Tom&#x27;s, regular Colgate, Aqua Fresh, and now I recently tried Colgate Total. Out of all the toothpastes I have ever used this brand definitely keeps my mouth cleaner for a longer period of time throughout the day. With my other toothpastes, especially Spry brand, I could feel plaque building up on my teeth after only a few hours after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to receive a free sample of Colgate Total and finally tried it only two weeks ago. As of today, I brushed my teeth about 14 hours ago as I am writing this and, as I run my tongue over my teeth, they feel completely clean. There is very little to no plaque on my teeth at the moment 14 hours later. This is amazing. The commercials are correct when they say you&#x27;ll have a cleaner smile that lasts longer than other toothpastes. And no, I am not just saying this because I am a dental hygienist. I am saying it because I can feel the deep clean compared to other toothpastes. This stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want healthier gums then go with this. I recommend it to all my patients now.</li>
    <li> Soooo ,,, toothpaste is toothpaste??  No ... in my opinion, Colgate Toothpaste is the greatest.  This is fairly priced and quick delivery.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Colgate Total Anticavity Fluouride And Antigingivitis Toothpaste, Clean Mint Paste, here-in being reviewed, is THE best toothpaste -- that I have found, anyway.  It has a nice flavour, (somewhat different from the original flavour when TOTAL toothpaste first came out,  Yet, hmmnn,,,, upon using up a tiny bit of the original I still had left from a few years back, I must admit I really do like the new flavour even a bit better!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, I found that this is the ONLY toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried that actually does work for me!  Other toothpastes, (such as Crest or AquaFresh), left my mouth feeling as if it had been scrubbed with sandpaper!  And any freshening that they had left in my mouth disappeared within a half-hour or so!  I guess this might be because I grew up using the original formula of Colgate&#x27;s toothpaste -- then switched to Total because its ads touted it had a twelve-hour action, due to adding TRICLOSAN, an antibacterial, antigingivitis agent.  My dentist said this is the best toothpaste, as well.  So, I happily use ONLY Total Clean Mint Paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the Colgate Total Whitening Toothpastes are good as well -- but I figure that any whitening toothpaste just MAY tempt one to cheat.  With a non-whitening toothpaste, such as is being reviewed here, only continual brushing will eventually whiten teeth.  A \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpaste may whiten teeth with fewer brushings -- leading one to be tempted to skip necessary brushings.  Besides, a whitening toothpaste will probably add extra ingredients, and who knows if these extra ingredients are harrmless or harmful in the long run?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpastes I have tried do not measure up.  I need my triclosan, to stop the gingivitus!  And my TEETH need it even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a PASTE.  Somehow, I feel that gel toothpastes, whatever their virtues, add too much water, so one does not get as much value as in a paste.  I might be wrong in this....but that&#x27;s what my instincts tell me....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a rather particular person -- rarely satisifed with anything.  But I sure am satisfied with COLGATE TOTAL ANTICAVITY FLOURIDE AND ANTIGINGIVITUS TOOTHPASTE!  Would I ever swith????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope!  THIS toothpaste, here-in being reviewed, is MY toothpaste -- and I hope I&#x27;ll be able to use it forever, and that they NEVER stop making it!  Perfection is achieved in so few things -- but in my opinion, perfection in toothpaste has been achieved here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Colgate!  : Darticular person -- rarely satisifed with anything.

    <li> I love this toothpaste.  When I use any other toothpaste my teeth feel like they don&#x27;t get as clean.  I like it better than the version with whitening products in it.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Because is an excelent toothpaste.  Colgate toothpaste will stop your teeth from leaving you.Besides good products deserve recognition.  Good judment is nesesary in order to select a product from many others of their type.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE TOOTHPASTE.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste helps to keep my teeth white and prevent cavities, etc.  I highly recommend it and use it daily.</li>
    <li> I was using another toothpaste and noticed cavities and tartar developing on my teeth. I switched to Colgate Total, hoping my dental health would turn around. My cavities haven&#x27;t got any worse, so I guess that&#x27;s good. And I have much less tartar build-up now. But the top of my mouth and sometimes on my gums the skin is peeling! At first I figured it was from eating salty pumpkin seeds so I avoided them, but the problem kept getting worse. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 months now and avoiding anything that could scratch or irritate my mouth like acidic foods and the peeling is getting worse still. I believe it is the triclosan that is bothering me since it&#x27;s the only ingredient I&#x27;ve never used in a toothpaste before. After I brush my teeth I wake up the next morning with an usually dry mouth and throat. I may use this occasionally to remove tartar build-up but I won&#x27;t be using it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Excellent, it does a great job on your teeth,</li>
    <li> We love Colgate Total but hard to find without whitening. Nice fresh sent. Has Sodium Flouride(0.24%, anti cavity&lt;br /&gt;) and Triclosan(0.03%, Antigingivitis).</li>
    <li> I like the taste of this mint paste out of all other toothpastes and gels! Makes my teeth and mouth feel cleaner!</li>
    <li> Nothing makes your mouth feel cleaner and fresher and its very long lasting. Not too sweet or not too strong minty either. No grittiness unlike Crest Pro-Health. No pain or sensitiviy after use either. Good toothpaste that makes your mouth feel clean is hard to find but this colgate is it.</li>
    <li> I get good dental check ups every year so this toothpaste must be helping my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> What a great deal on a household staple. My husband swears by this paste! We have tried the gel formula, but continue to come back to Total white paste.</li>
    <li> This is the toothpaste we always use and being able to get it in bulk is nice.</li>
    <li> Colgate always my favourite toothpaste</li>
    <li> Its toothpaste, it tastes great and works well on my tooth brush...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste and it&#x27;s great I can get it delivered on a schedule!</li>
    <li> Super size tubes. Great deal. I also use optic white and my dentist advised to switch between optic white and total. I now have enough toothpaste for a year. This is a great buy and super toothpaste. The tubes are huge.</li>
    <li> Our dentist advised us to get toothpaste with triclosan to protect against gingivitis.  The taste and texture of this toothpaste are good.</li>
    <li> A great product ... will be sure to purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste I like this much better then crest or Sensodyne as Sensodyne feels chalky and weird to me.. But Colgate Total feels clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste. Everyone has their own preference of toothpaste, you have to use what works for you! And non of them guarantee that you will be cavity free, one could only wish!! but I maybe only get 1 cavity every few years</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to review this product as a user, except superficially. It has a good flavor, low abrasiveness, and contains flouride. I use this over other products because my dentist recommended it as one of the best available.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IT was not expensive, Definitely worth the price. I highly recommend the item. Na mean, Th</li>
    <li> I tried colgate total and became sick when using it, like poisioned. It was the triclosan since toothpaste without triclosan did not cause this.</li>
    <li> I got some Arm and Hammer complete care.  It dissolved nicely, tasted better, and was best paste I&#x27;ve had.  I might have rated this a 4 before trying Arm and Hammer.</li>
    <li> A very good product that is practically used daily!  I encourage everyone to welcome toothpaste into your lives.  Brush like a champion!</li>
    <li> I had such dry mouth after using this. I read that it&#x27;s caused from an ingredient in the toothpaste. I&#x27;m back to using my neem toothpaste.</li>
    <li> coalgate has several different product models on shelves of department stores. which one do you pick? i have tried them all coalgate toothpaste products - including coalgate&#x27;s  latest &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; toothpaste that is supposedly does &amp;#34;DEEP cleaning&amp;#34; as written on its tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only one that really works best, and to my total satisfaction, is this &amp;#34;clean mint&amp;#34;.  it gives me a day long, 24 hour really, fresh breath and the feeling of cleanliness. when i wake up the next day morning, my mouth still feels reasonably fresh!  i don&#x27;t need to use bubblegum any more.  i avoid sugar in tea or coffee; sugar is the enemy number one that gives you that bad breath. rinse your mouth after eating anything. that&#x27;s all the precaution you really need.  have a good fresh-feeling day.&lt;br /&gt;note to coalgate: you have an amazing product, please don&#x27;t change products on us periodically; it hurts my head having to always figure out a right product for health only to see it vanish away. you have a winner in this one. don&#x27;t change it or give it a new different name for marketing purpose.  thank you, coal gate.</li>
    <li> I like that this toothpaste does not claim to whiten teeth. I use to use Crest Tartar Control, but it would cause my gums to peel. This toothpaste is not as harsh. I like the taste, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste does contain triclosan that the FDA has found to be effective in reducing gingivitis, though not effective at all for hand soap.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shopping experience.  Would recommend this to everyone. Great price and exactly as described.  I would go to this site again.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended by my hygenisist. She was correct. Great reports since I started using it. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve alwasy trusted Colgate products and Total is amongst that list.</li>
    <li> Please educate yourselves on the chemical \\&quot;Triclosan\\&quot; found in this product and many others.  Triclosan is a known endocrine disruptor and is considered toxic.  This chemical is currently being considered for ban in the U.S. and is banned in several other countries.  It may work, but you have no idea what it is doing to your body and it is harmful to the environment.  Some healthier alternatives would be Australian tea tree oil, grapefruit seed extract, and pine oil.  For more information on triclosan, refer to the EPA website.

    <li> My husband is a dentist and recommends either Colgate Total or Crest Pro-Health.  I am allergic to Crest, so this works great.  My teeth feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love getting this from subscribe and save so that we never run out.</li>
    <li> Nothing is better than having a clean, smooth, minty mouth</li>
