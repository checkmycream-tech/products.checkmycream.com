      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>However, it functions better as a concealer than it does as an eye cream moisturizer.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT, OLAY IS NOW</li>
      <li>So appreciate being able to purchase online.</li>
      <li>I love oil of olay products but this product didnt meet my expectations.</li>
      <li>Was hoping for a more improved appearance.</li>
      <li>I guess I was expecting more, I don&#x27;t see a difference in the area around my eyes and</li>
      <li>and I have tried many.</li>
      <li>I receive many compliments on my &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; skin.</li>
      <li>Will need more time to tell if it will help skin under eyes as stated.</li>
      <li>I really love this product</li>
      <li>I have used it for many years.</li>
      <li>glad I tried it.</li>
      <li>I will be getting more of this.</li>
      <li>more.....</li>
      <li>Not quite sure yet as to its efficiency</li>
      <li>Has a nice light, creamy feel (NOT oily, NOT greasy)...and absorbs quite easily into skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have that good of coverage.  </li>
      <li>This eye cream + concealer arrived very quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
      <li>This product does an excellent job of lightening those dark circles beneath the eyes.</li>
      <li>Is it still available as I would like to reorder it?</li>
      <li>It gives a light coverage.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really go on smooth and is drying to the under eye area.</li>
      <li>Product works well...if you are looking for light coverage.</li>
      <li>As light and creamy as this product is, I am surprised it conceals as good as it does.</li>
      <li>good for early morning eye moisturizing if one is not wearing make-up.  </li>
      <li>Soft and smooth to apply, keeps eyelids in good condition and non-drying (not as some serums that tend to dry out the lids) and the touch of concealer is great.  </li>
      <li>Not sure why they discontinued this, it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I love this Olay Regenerist Eye Regenerating Cream Plus a Touch of Concealer as it&#x27;s the first eye cream that I have tried that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn.</li>
      <li>Use this Product For Years, Never disappointed.</li>
      <li>When I applied it on clean skin, the concealer was so transparent that I could not see a difference when wearing it.  </li>
      <li>Just the right amount of concealer with an effective, yet gentle eye moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I have light, not fair, but lighter than medium skin, and it blends perfectly.</li>
      <li>I am very fair-skinned, and I managed to blend it out and mix it with Cover Girl&#x27;s Neutralizer for a concealer that worked better than what I was using before.</li>
      <li>Not only is this a good product for protecting the area around the eye-</li>
      <li>I like this product for its quick absorbency and grease-less texture.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and product is as described.</li>
      <li>QUICK DELIVERY</li>
      <li>but it arrived quickly</li>
      <li>The wrinkles around my eyes have softened and the concealer works great for dark circles.</li>
      <li>It has great slip, which means no tugging, and it&#x27;s so lightweight, I don&#x27;t even need to use a mirror, yet it gives just that little &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; of concealer, just as stated on the tube.  </li>
      <li>This was shipped quickly and it works pretty well</li>
      <li>The price is right &amp; at age 61</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s pretty much it, nothing special.</li>
      <li>Tint is adequate but it did not do much to cover up my under eye circles.  </li>
      <li>I use one product and I&#x27;m ready to face the day!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a definite favorite.</li>
      <li>I found the texture to be quite nice as well, not deeply conditioning, but creamy enough to wear comfortably under makeup.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Olay for this affordable skin care regimen!</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t typically have dark circles, so those who are seeking to cover a lot of discoloration may not agree with this - but for me, it is the perfect thing to put under my eyes.)</li>
      <li>Very light and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>I use this to clean off eye make-up goofs, racoon-eyes from left overs, and as my under eye cream, before I start a fresh application of eye makeup.</li>
      <li>With Olay, I am seeing positive improvements in my skin at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>It has a hint of concealer which is very neutral, but it also did work well to prevent lines.</li>
      <li>I use this with eye serum and both work really well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not sure why they discontinued this, it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing with thin concealer, as described. Doesn&#x27;t really help a lot with the dark circles :(</li>
    <li> This was shipped quickly and it works pretty well</li>
    <li> Tint is adequate but it did not do much to cover up my under eye circles.  Was hoping for a more improved appearance.</li>
    <li> It covers up my dark circles. if i go out with out makeup, i will still put olay regenerating eye cream cause it makes me look more youthful</li>
    <li> Ever wish your eye cream and your undereye concealer were one and the same? Wish no more, for Olay has combined its Regenerist eye cream with a touch of concealer. The concealer will work best on a medium beige complexion, but it is also super-blendable. I am very fair-skinned, and I managed to blend it out and mix it with Cover Girl&#x27;s Neutralizer for a concealer that worked better than what I was using before. It makes my makeup routine a little easier, though I&#x27;d prefer it if Olay would come out with some of these in a broader color palette. I found the texture to be quite nice as well, not deeply conditioning, but creamy enough to wear comfortably under makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this product, it not only works as a firming and moisturizing cream but is a concealer. I use one product and I&#x27;m ready to face the day!</li>
    <li> very light texture the color seems to blend so well on my dark circle it&#x27;s not leave my eyes burn like the other brand i tried before i really like it.</li>
    <li> I like the idea but it only comes in one color and it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for people with brown skin.</li>
    <li> Sorry - I think I bought all the remaining cream</li>
    <li> I love it. I been using it for almost a week. This tube can give you moisture for the eyes but at the same time, it help cover up your dark circle. My under eye is not really dark, but I would say it is moderately like normal girls. Also, I hate to use concealer or any primer because it dry up the skin around the eye and it make me tear up sometime. BUT THIS PRODUCT ROCK!! I can feel the moisture and it doesn&#x27;t make my eye tear up. Plus! MY EYE SHAWDOW STAY LONGER. Love it. I would buy it again when it ran out.</li>
    <li> I like this product for its quick absorbency and grease-less texture. However, it functions better as a concealer than it does as an eye cream moisturizer. For those ladies looking for serious moisture relief, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The product does what it says it is supposed to do!  I have used it&lt;br /&gt;for a year and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try something new.  It doesn&#x27;t really have that good of coverage.  It seems that it is just a regular makeup in a small tube with a big price.</li>
    <li> ive used this product for about a week or so and i already see improvements. great price and great product.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores.  I really love this product</li>
    <li> It did not live up to as advertised and claimed. The difference from before and after applying this product for straight two weeks twice a day was not significant, i.e. the changes were slight if ever so. It acts better as a concealer than all the vitamins it boats of to get rid of dark circles.</li>
    <li> This stuff is alright, I mean it does have coverage but barely any. Really sheer coverage. I  barely ever use it because I have horrible undereye circles and it doesn&#x27;t really do much. What you can do it use this and apply concealer after. Its hydrating which is a plus. But that&#x27;s pretty much it, nothing special.</li>
    <li> Love this product. One tube lasted months. I wish more eye products included tint</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore and I liked how it goes on easily and is my perfect shade.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I use this with eye serum and both work really well. I can not use any other concealers but have no allergy to this. Very good for this price</li>
    <li> I bought this concealer hoping it would reduce the darkness and puffiness under my eyes. I think there is a subtle difference as far as the puffiness is concerned, but the dark circles needs a lot more than a few dots to blend. I would recommend it cause Olay is a good brand.</li>
    <li> I have not had much luck with Olay products in the past but I continue to look for something to help with dark circles so tried this.  Very disappointed, product is a weird color, dries chalky and does not cover.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> While no concealer will take the place of a face lift, this eye cream plus concealer seems to work well for me.  It does not completely take away all of the shadows under my eyes, but nothing will except a plastic surgeon&#x27;s knife.  And, I do like the fact that it moisturizes the thinner skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Its not something I couldn&#x27;t live without when it comes to cosmetics.  But I didn&#x27;t waste my money buying it. I&#x27;ll probably try something else next time just for comparison. However, for the value the product is good and I probably would buy again if I don&#x27;t find a competitive product that does the same thing.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s not good as a concealer and it does not hydrate enough. I would not recommend it</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else. works very well</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m not a fan of foundation or heavy make up, and bought this by accident (wanted the lifting serum), but I&#x60;m glad I tried it. I don&#x60;t have any deep wrinkles, bags, or really dark circles, but when I&#x60;m tired my eyes looked a bit bruised sometimes. Now they don&#x60;t. Once this cream is smoothed out it is completely invisible. Which to me is the point; I don&#x60;t want to look like I&#x60;m concealing dark circles, I want to look like I don&#x60;t have any. It is not a heavy moisturizer, which makes it perfect to keep eye shadow and mascara where they belong. It does not creep into the eyes, nor into the upper-lid crease. I have sensitive skin and eyes, and I don&#x60;t even feel this cream is there. Now I use this during the day and the lifting serum at night.</li>
    <li> I love this Olay Regenerist Eye Regenerating Cream Plus a Touch of Concealer as it&#x27;s the first eye cream that I have tried that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn. An added bonus is that it has a concealer in it so you don&#x27;t have to apply two creams.  I&#x27;m afraid it has been discontinued as some stores no longer carry it.</li>
    <li> Soft and smooth to apply, keeps eyelids in good condition and non-drying (not as some serums that tend to dry out the lids) and the touch of concealer is great.  I hope they never stop making this one!</li>
    <li> This is amazing! The best concealer I have tried and I have tried many. Does not look cakey. Blends perfectly!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t conceal very well but it seems to keep my under eye area moisturized.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a very big reduction in wrinkles yet but it&#x27;s not worse. ;)</li>
    <li> Tried lots of eye creams.  Still like this one the best!</li>
    <li> wish they still made it .</li>
    <li> Difficult to find......love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I love oil of Olay since my Mom bought it many many years ago. This product is just the right amount of concealer and doesn&#x27;t ever dry your skin under your eyes. Covers dark circles well. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a. &amp;#34;Touch&amp;#34; of concealer!&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>
    <li> This is part of my daily skin care. I have used it for many years. It covers brown spots and dark circles</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, OLAY IS NOW AND ALWAYS, MY SKIN CARE RESOURCE. THANK YOU, BETTY  BOMIA, LP MICHIGAN 48146&lt;br /&gt;PS. MY GROWN DAUGHTER USES IT ALSO. ALL OLAY HOUSEHOLD.</li>
    <li> This cream is great because it doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes at all! The tint is very mild, and doesn&#x27;t conceal anything but its a wonderful moisturizer to use around the eye area. What I also like is that it comes in a tube container, which is great for keeping the ingredient stable. (Jar containers allow too much oxygen to penetrate into the cream and affect its contents, making them less potent).</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Use it every day for under eye moisture/wrinkle minimizing/subtle and non-caky color equalization. (I don&#x27;t typically have dark circles, so those who are seeking to cover a lot of discoloration may not agree with this - but for me, it is the perfect thing to put under my eyes.)</li>
    <li> very disappointed in product.  would not buy again.  did not conceal at all.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to product for morning eyes!  I plan to take this with me for extended travel-it eliminates the need for extra products.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer and concealer all in one.  This is a great time saver and I love the way it feels and the bit of coverage.  I have fair skin, so I don&#x27;t know how it works on darker skin tones.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer and cover up for eyes.Brightens up eyes, covers dark circles and they do not get dry looking during the day.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It has a hint of concealer which is very neutral, but it also did work well to prevent lines. I will be getting more of this.</li>
    <li> This product does an excellent job of lightening those dark circles beneath the eyes. Just a dab will do. I would recommend it to even out the dark spots anywhere on the face but some products under the eyes are too &amp;#34;white-ish&amp;#34; but this one has just enough concealer to look pretty natural.</li>
    <li> THIS CONCEALER WAS ADEQUATE BUT JUST AS GOOD AS, SAY, A MAYBELLINE PRODUCT WOULD BE. NEXT PURCHASE I WILL OPT FOR THE LESS EXPENSIVE BRAND. I AM A REGENERIST BRAND USER OF ALL THEIR PRODUCTS BUT AS FAR AS THE CONCEALER GOES, I&#x27;LL PASS.</li>
    <li> Product works well...if you are looking for light coverage. If you find the product consistency a bit too thick, several users have noted it works really well in combination...I suggest applying Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum by spreading under eye and top lid to moisturize + then add a very small amount of Olay Touch of Concealer and blend for a touch of color and coverage. Has a nice light, creamy feel (NOT oily, NOT greasy)...and absorbs quite easily into skin.</li>
    <li> Not only is this a good product for protecting the area around the eye- it has a concealer cream that makes my whole face look better, without wearing a heavy cosmetic base.  Is it still available as I would like to reorder it?</li>
    <li> I use this to clean off eye make-up goofs, racoon-eyes from left overs, and as my under eye cream, before I start a fresh application of eye makeup. It is a wonder product, and sadly, disappearing off of store shelves in my area, without any apparent replacement product. So, once again, amazing Amazon to the rescue.</li>
    <li> I carry this with me in my purse.  I&#x27;m 57 with typical aging around my eyes. Throughout the day, I find I need to fix a bit of darkening caused by my traveling eye make-up, or my BB cream has worn off from the morning&#x27;s application.  A little dab takes care of the problem, and doesn&#x27;t settle into lines like most concealers do. It has great slip, which means no tugging, and it&#x27;s so lightweight, I don&#x27;t even need to use a mirror, yet it gives just that little &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; of concealer, just as stated on the tube.  I have light, not fair, but lighter than medium skin, and it blends perfectly. A tube lasts a long time, even with repeated daily use. It&#x27;s a definite favorite.</li>
    <li> VERY SATISFIED...QUICK DELIVERY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been siffering from the darkness under my eyes. after I use this product it makes a diffrence.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product but seems to be out of production, at least locally. So appreciate being able to purchase online.</li>
    <li> Best under eye concealer  I have ever used. Brightens under my eyes hide dark circles , hydrates and does not cake in the wrinkles under my eyes. Hard to find in stores now I bought six less time on Amazon so I didn&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> This stuff has a tint to it which SO MUCH gets rid of dark under eye circles.  I extended to upper eye and contouring nose.  Absolutely amazing product.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores.  Need....need....need.... more..... Please!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;&#x27;m a guy.....guessing it works.</li>
    <li> Really like the product but is expensive where ever you buy it.  Would buy again from this company.  Cheapest I could find anywhere.</li>
    <li> This product is one of my favorites...good for early morning eye moisturizing if one is not wearing make-up.  Sadly, Olay does not make it any longer.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and product is as described. I found this at Ulta a few years ago, bought it on a whim, and have used it ever since. It provides good coverage without looking like one is wearing concealer. Very light and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I mix this in with my  overpriced, high-end department store skin care line.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this until I actually used it.  It is way too thick and cakey.  I tried applying different types of ways and it made no difference.  It feels like a heavy concealer (that doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my undereye circles) with no other benefit.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the eyes.  Moisturizing with just a little bit of color to help smooth out the skin.  Great to use every morning before applying makeup.  Keeps the area around the eyes moisturized without being shiny.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure yet as to its efficiency but it arrived quickly andthe price was very good.  Had some problems with eyes tearing up so not sure I can wear it due to allergic problems.  Will need more time to tell if it will help skin under eyes as stated.</li>
    <li> This product works alright for a concealer but not great. Doesn&#x27;t really go on smooth and is drying to the under eye area.</li>
    <li> I use Olay regenerist eye lifting serum and really like it so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  It was a bit to thick for me and I couldn&#x27;t get it to &amp;#34;lay&amp;#34; well around my eye.  I use the touch of foundation facial moisturizer from Olay (really love this), so I simply pat a little of this around my eye.</li>
    <li> I love oil of olay products but this product didnt meet my expectations. Ive been using it for over a month already and  dont see any difference.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Once a day for under eye shadow cover up.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this cream for a few years and love it because I am a senior with vertical wrinkles on my upper eyelids, and deep circles under my eyes.  This cream really helps hide both problems, plus it is slightly tinted in flesh color, so your skin around your eyes don&#x27;t appear washed out and/or whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find this cream at our local drug stores anymore, so thankfully Amazon offers this.</li>
    <li> Love this product and can&#x27;t find in stores.</li>
    <li> not alot of coverage, not seeing skin improvement yet but will continue to use daily.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream with concealer. It gives a light coverage.  I was unable to find in stores.  Thanks Amazon for having it</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!!! Just the right amount of concealer with an effective, yet gentle eye moisturizer. I&#x27;m becoming a big fan of Olay, after years of trying a range of different brands, some very expensive with supposedly magical powers.  With Olay, I am seeing positive improvements in my skin at a reasonable price.  This eye cream + concealer arrived very quickly and was well packaged.  I will purchase this product from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Use this Product For Years, Never disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes and this product does as much as it can to cover the problem.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this when I show heavy bags under my eyes because it brings out my eyes more.</li>
    <li> The only concealer cream for me. Tinted slightly, and very blendable, and better yet, so affordable.  The only concealer that covers my dark circles. PleaseDO NOT discontinue this product, as so often happens with a product that I like.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  When I applied it on clean skin, the concealer was so transparent that I could not see a difference when wearing it.  It also made my eyes water.  I&#x27;ve used more irritating products, but for the $$$ I paid for an eye cream, I would expect it to be &#x27;tear free.&#x27;  It was not particularly moisturizing, either.</li>
    <li> Just love this, very sad it was discontinued.....</li>
    <li> I just tried this new product and have not used it long enough to say whether is is working for me.</li>
    <li> So, I have been using this for about a few months now. I know that products like these usually take a while to work (when they really should work within the first few uses) so I decided to wait before waiting to post a review. So I use this every day as an under eye concealer. I have really dark circles, and I used to use foundation to cover them up. I decided to go with an dark circle serum and after reading reviews, I decided to get this. Though it covers dark circles, sweating a little or even wearing it for a while makes your dark circles visible again. I still use it to get a little coverage, but it isn&#x27;t entirely worth buying. Still looking for a dark circle serum that actually works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay for years. The price is right &amp; at age 61 I receive many compliments on my &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; skin. Thanks, Olay for this affordable skin care regimen!</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting more, I don&#x27;t see a difference in the area around my eyes and the touch of concealer doesn&#x27;t do anything for the dark circles</li>
    <li> Excellent for under eyes. I have used it for years and would be lost without it</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I keep a back up supply on hand, because as usual the products I love always seem be discontinued. It&#x27;s the only eye cream/concealer I found I can put on, that conceals without creating that caked on, creases on the wrinkles around my eyes. I doesn&#x27;t rub or roll off when applying foundation. I rarely need foundation, but I have a big fat vein under my right eye, that gives that dark circle look. Most of the time, I dab a little under the eye and run out the door. As light and creamy as this product is, I am surprised it conceals as good as it does. I love it and I just bought 3 tubes on Amazon, to store away. I used to get it at Walmart and can&#x27;t find it anymore. So my guess is, they discontinued it. :-( BRING it BACK!</li>
    <li> I have been using this concealer and eye cream for 6 months and love it.  The wrinkles around my eyes have softened and the concealer works great for dark circles.</li>
