### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a great product!  </li>
      <li>This has done beautifully.</li>
      <li>And it also works great as a spot treatment for breakouts.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>Between the two, the rosacea has greatly lessened.</li>
      <li>love eminence products!!</li>
      <li>just feels so good on your skin.</li>
      <li>Always a good product and brand.</li>
      <li>What a FANTASTIC product!!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>Luckily for me, my sister shares this obsession and often finds great product lines I had not heard of, like this one.  </li>
      <li>Love love love this brand and the serum</li>
      <li>It took about 3 weeks of every day use, but my skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>My skin at 36 has never looked better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it as a light moisturizer/barrier under my sunscreen, which seems to be working ok.</li>
      <li>I will say that I seem to be going through it quickly, but I am using it habitually and eagerly (because its WORKING!)</li>
      <li>I use several Eminence products and have loved them.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, fair skin, and am always looking for gentle, organic products to calm and maybe moisturize.  </li>
      <li>I am pretty amazed!</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product in a resort spa.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, it doesn&#x27;t sting at all, and there is a slight reduction in redness (I don&#x27;t have rosacea, just red-prone, sunburn-prone, flush-prone skin).  </li>
      <li>The fluid has a really strong chemical/kerosine-like odor.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the bottle I received was sold by GENCO, and this is NOT an Eminence product, although the bottle looks like the real thing.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, prone to breakouts when trying new products, and have Mild rosacea and KP.</li>
      <li>I use it and the Yellow Sweet Clover Anti-Redness Masque to combat my rosacea-prone skin.  </li>
      <li>The bottle I am using now, which I purchased earlier this year from a local spa, has virtually NO odor - just a very mild herbal smell.  </li>
      <li>No more red blotchy spots and my blemishes are clearing and taking only a day or so to heal, instead of a full week.</li>

<li> This one seems like a waste of money.</li>
<li> The aestheticism used it during a facial for calming the redness and broken capillaries on my cheeks.</li>
<li> Seriously.  </li>
<li> My skin looks visibly healthier, however I do not notice improvement in redness, subtle, if any.  </li>

    <li> Wife loves it. I can see it works.</li>
    <li> I use several Eminence products and have loved them. This one seems like a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference when I use this product</li>
    <li> Love love love this brand and the serum just feels so good on your skin. My skin at 36 has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, fair skin, and am always looking for gentle, organic products to calm and maybe moisturize.

    <li> I was first introduced to this product in a resort spa. The aestheticism used it during a facial for calming the redness and broken capillaries on my cheeks. I have been using it for 2 weeks and it does make a marked difference in redness and seems to diminish the broken  capillaries.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it works, but it does! I was told to try this product when I got a facial and was skeptical, but after a few weeks it has greatly diminished the broken capillaries around my nose.</li>
    <li> Seriously.  This stuff is great.  The arnica tames red areas, keeping them from breaking out.  And it also works great as a spot treatment for breakouts.  I give this a five because if I could only use three &amp;#34;face potions&amp;#34;, this would be one of them.</li>
    <li> I was a stanch Philosophy user until the spa I go to turned me on to Eminence.  What a FANTASTIC product!!  I use it every day and it is never greasy on my skin.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!!  This item was supposed to be sold by Beautytime.  HOWEVER, the bottle I received was sold by GENCO, and this is NOT an Eminence product, although the bottle looks like the real thing.  The fluid has a really strong chemical/kerosine-like odor.  The bottle I am using now, which I purchased earlier this year from a local spa, has virtually NO odor - just a very mild herbal smell.  I am vexed beyond words - I have NEVER had a problem like this from Amazon - a company we have supported with our business for years.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Skin feels tight and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My skin looks visibly healthier, however I do not notice improvement in redness, subtle, if any.  I have very sensitive skin, prone to breakouts when trying new products, and have Mild rosacea and KP. This has done beautifully. I use the stone crop moisturizer and chamomile face wash by eminence as well.</li>
    <li> love eminence products!! this is one of my faves!</li>
    <li> Always a good product and brand. I&#x27;ve never been let down by any of these products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I use it and the Yellow Sweet Clover Anti-Redness Masque to combat my rosacea-prone skin.  This product I use every day; the other I use about 2x per week.  Between the two, the rosacea has greatly lessened.</li>
    <li> Be patient!!!! It took about 3 weeks of every day use, but my skin has never looked better. No more red blotchy spots and my blemishes are clearing and taking only a day or so to heal, instead of a full week. I am pretty amazed! I will say that I seem to be going through it quickly, but I am using it habitually and eagerly (because its WORKING!)</li>
