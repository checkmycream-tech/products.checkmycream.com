      <li>great classic smell that makes Dana for Men colognes stand out&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
      <li>Glad to see it&#x27;s available here.</li>
      <li>Stetson&#x27;s Rich Suede and have ordered more of that.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing this is so cool it smells like a cool breeze in Alaska.</li>
      <li>It then begins to fade and change into a cheap smelling cologne.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it.</li>
      <li>He ended up loving this one probably more than the regular ones.</li>
      <li>English Leather Black is the one I liked the best by far.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this cologne since it only smells good for fifteen minutes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s NOT bad, but</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>It is way better than old spice smells like a UN airconditioned vets office</li>
      <li>, so good coverage with minimal effort.</li>
      <li>English Leather  is a nice manly cologne.</li>
      <li>I like this type of English leather but realized that I like the original better.</li>
      <li>price is right</li>
      <li>This might be suitable for some, but I found it just too heavy and overwhelming.</li>
      <li>This one is better than the original English Leather, which I didn&#x27;t really like.</li>
      <li>It has a sort of classical scent to it, which I love as does my girlfriend.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of all English leather products.</li>
      <li>Good old English Leather (Black) - smells great and is long-lasting and you can&#x27;t beat the really low price!</li>
      <li>Though the fragrance is good it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
      <li>It spays very well</li>
      <li>Absolutely like this product.  </li>
      <li>I am a fan of the original English Leather scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing like the original, but is equally as long-lasting.</li>
      <li>I like it better than the regular English leather.</li>
      <li>but price was to high</li>
      <li>I used this Cologne in high school, and so did a lot of my friends.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a Christmas present for my dad because I knew he really liked the regular English Leather cologne.</li>
      <li>Originally my fiance tried this in a small sample bottle that came in a package with a couple of other colognes, and I fell in love with this one.</li>
      <li>This cologne is like a synthesis of the old and the new.  </li>
      <li>no where near as goog as the old stuff!</li>
      <li>English Leather Black is one of my favorite colognes.</li>
      <li>The old English Leather and the citrus one is much nicer.</li>
      <li>My father is really into english leather products.</li>
      <li>In the past I have only been able to find this as an &amp;#34;exclusive&amp;#34; at Walmart during the Christmas season.</li>
      <li>Even then I can barely smell it 2 hours later.</li>
      <li>kind of compare it to a Guinness Dark to a Bass Pale Ale.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of the typical modern Axe-like smell that all of the &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; colognes seem to possess.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love it. I bought this Polo Green and Nautica Classic all at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;The English Leather Black is the one I liked the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right it smells great you will like it. Just&lt;br /&gt;a great classic smell that makes Dana for Men colognes stand out&lt;br /&gt;from among the rest price wise.</li>
    <li> Received and satisfied.</li>
    <li> This might be suitable for some, but I found it just too heavy and overwhelming. The old English Leather and the citrus one is much nicer.</li>
    <li> This cologne is like a synthesis of the old and the new.  Smells like English Leather mixed with Drakkar Noir.  Nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing this is so cool it smells like a cool breeze in Alaska. It is way better than old spice smells like a UN airconditioned vets office but this is awesome</li>
    <li> Awesome and strong scent. Buy it. It&#x27;s for a real guy and not for a limp wristed politically correct faker like our commander in chief. Man were we taken and lied to. We want out votes back Barry...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like this. It&#x27;s nothing like the regular English Leather, but one&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t expect that. It&#x27;s NOT bad, but not really what I was looking for. I really&lt;br /&gt;like Stetson&#x27;s Rich Suede and have ordered more of that. I guess I&#x27;ll use this once&lt;br /&gt;in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of compare it to a Guinness Dark to a Bass Pale Ale. It&#x27;s dark like the&lt;br /&gt;Guinness if one can picture it. I won&#x27;t buy it again, but will buy the lighter&lt;br /&gt;English Leather colonge. I like that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the way this smells! Originally my fiance tried this in a small sample bottle that came in a package with a couple of other colognes, and I fell in love with this one.</li>
    <li> I used this Cologne in high school, and so did a lot of my friends. This is the close as I can get to being back in those days.</li>
    <li> This item came as it was described. I like it better than the regular English leather. Convenient size spray bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a very interesting scent...and the price is good....and it in a spray bottle...very good bargain and product. I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding this cologne so when I found it I bought 3 my husband LOOOOOOOVES IT so , there you go honey!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my brother and he just loves it.</li>
    <li> back in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s for their christmas gift sets, English leather used to have in them soap on a rope, wind drift and english leather after shave.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s back and now called \\&quot;Black\\&quot;</li>
    <li> English Leather Black is one of my favorite colognes. It was an incredible value. You can&#x27;t beat 10 bucks! This one is better than the original English Leather, which I didn&#x27;t really like. It&#x27;s not for everyone either. It&#x27;s more of an acquired sent that not everyone will like. It has a sort of classical scent to it, which I love as does my girlfriend. Everyone should try this! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my dad because I knew he really liked the regular English Leather cologne. He ended up loving this one probably more than the regular ones. I wish they had this in bigger sizes. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Perfect gift. My father is really into english leather products. So he loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to my fiance&#x27; for Christmas.  Unfortunately, he broke up with me before it arrived.  I have no idea if this is a good product or not.  Since I never even received a \\&quot;thank you\\&quot;, I would have to assume it&#x27;s no good...</li>
    <li> Though the fragrance is good it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long. I end up using a lot and then my kids say that I reek of cologne. Even then I can barely smell it 2 hours later.</li>
    <li> Smells great price is great my wife is happy she loves the smell of this cologne. and for the price i was able to buy two. thank you</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this one. In the past I have only been able to find this as an &amp;#34;exclusive&amp;#34; at Walmart during the Christmas season. Glad to see it&#x27;s available here.</li>

    <li> For the money, this cologne is one if the best. It smells manly and not fruity like so many newer colognes. The scent lasts all day too.</li>

    <li> I am a fan of the original English Leather scent.  This one is WAY different.  Reminds me of the typical modern Axe-like smell that all of the &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; colognes seem to possess.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell, a larger size would be good, for one a month.</li>
