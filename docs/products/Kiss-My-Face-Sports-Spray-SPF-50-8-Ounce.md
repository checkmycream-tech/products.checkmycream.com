      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love kiss my face products</li>
      <li>:) I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena rub-in cream which seemed to work</li>
      <li>For spf50 it should be blocking most of the sun</li>
      <li>no matter how many times you go under water.</li>
      <li>This would have been sooooooo much better as an aerosol, thus alleviating these issues.  </li>
      <li>One tip -- if you are indoors, make sure you are on a bath rug or towel when using this spray, as it does get everywhere</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is just okay.</li>
      <li>The sprayer top does not work.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>and I love that it&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this product -- I&#x27;m really fair skinned and really sensitive to chemicals</li>
      <li>However, the pump gets clogged really easily and makes it a PITA to spray.</li>
      <li>So easy to apply.</li>
      <li>to apply, nice coconut smell, and it worked like a charm at keeping us all from burning to a crisp in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Hands down the BEST sunscreen!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cruelty free (no animals testing, no animal derived ingredients)  2.</li>
      <li>She hates to have sunblock applied, so this stuff really comes in handy.</li>
      <li>Really works and smells so nice.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic spray on sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Paraben free  4.</li>
      <li>I just really enjoy kiss my face products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely light weight and not greasy</li>
      <li>I will continue on my quest for a safe, effective, more natural sunscreen spray with a high SPF that is also easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair skinned little ones</li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
      <li>I spend a lot of time in the pool, and I have not had any problems with it washing off too quickly.</li>
      <li>I have used this lightly scented sunscreen many times, as have members of my family; it goes on as a clear spray that dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>It stings a bit if I spray it on my face, but that quickly subsides.</li>
      <li>Quick light spray protects them the whole day!</li>
      <li>Most other spray on sunscreens leave my skin feeling sticky and greasy, but this one sprays on well, and absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, the ingredient list is a friendly one, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting potentially harmful substances on your body.</li>
      <li>We all love the light scent of this sunscreen but just be ready to pay another $2 for a new spray bottle.</li>
      <li>Overall, they make a fantastic line of products and i am a huge supporter both for me and my family!</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth its price.</li>
      <li>No artificial fragrances  5.</li>
      <li>No artificial colors    </li>
      <li>Just as well because at any one time we were lucky to get one to spray consistently.</li>
      <li>buy in future for active sun-protection lifestyle coverages.  :D</li>
      <li>That said, the other reviews are so good, I&#x27;ll have to try it again (and promise to update the review if it works).</li>
      <li>I think it worked for maybe the first eight pumps.</li>
      <li>We could open the top and pour in our handed</li>
      <li>also the pump stopped working the first time we used it.  </li>
      <li>The spray pump broke after one of the first uses.  </li>
      <li>The spray mechanism could be better - its flimsy and stopped working on my 1st bottle (second one still hanging in there).</li>
      <li>I have four little ones and our own pool, so</li>
      <li>My Face line has worked really well for us.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
      <li>but it should be more like their other spray which I really like a lot.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you reapply after about an hour of swimming, as with any other sunscreen.    </li>
      <li>We live in Florida and use tons of this sunscreen!</li>
      <li>Got burnt with this multiple times - have used similar kinds of SPF before, there are others better out there.</li>
      <li>What really brought this home was that this sunscreen is made from natural ingredients, woo hoo!</li>
      <li>But this has a nice coconut smell, it works really well!, and it lasted for an entire week in Costa Rica with reapplication a few times a day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used this lightly scented sunscreen many times, as have members of my family; it goes on as a clear spray that dries quickly.  Most importantly, the ingredient list is a friendly one, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting potentially harmful substances on your body. It works well for out door activities, although I am not a swimmer and have never used it for water sports.  My only quibble is with the pump, which has become harder to use over time.  Otherwise, I recommend this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I like the sunscreen; smells good, works well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle seriously stinks. I think it worked for maybe the first eight pumps.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic spray on sunscreen. Most other spray on sunscreens leave my skin feeling sticky and greasy, but this one sprays on well, and absorbs nicely. It smells like coconut (so if that is not your thing beware). The reasons I like it?     1. It&#x27;s cruelty free (no animals testing, no animal derived ingredients)  2. Biodegradable  3. Paraben free  4. No artificial fragrances  5. No artificial colors    And, it works well in water. I spend a lot of time in the pool, and I have not had any problems with it washing off too quickly. Just make sure you reapply after about an hour of swimming, as with any other sunscreen.    All in all, a 5 star product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This SPF 50 sports spray provided excellent Coverage, was very easy to use and also had a light pleasant tropical scent. What really brought this home was that this sunscreen is made from natural ingredients, woo hoo!</li>
    <li> Got burnt with this multiple times - have used similar kinds of SPF before, there are others better out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunblock because my toddler and I are always on the go. She hates to have sunblock applied, so this stuff really comes in handy. It has a wide spray so I can hit her legs, arms and other exposed areas quickly, and it dries almost instantly. I spray some in my hand for face application. It does not have a greasy feel to it at all, and it smells like coconuts! It feels as if you didn&#x27;t put anything on, but you are protected! It&#x27;s awesome. No sunburns for neither of us (and I&#x27;m very fair)!! Will buy this for now on.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that itis a spray, but I dont think it does what it is supposed to do. For spf50 it should be blocking most of the sun but it is not as effective as a spf30 lotion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Kiss my Face sun screen products; they are paraben free, actually free from all bad stuff; all natural, smell great and work great. I think the orange spray bottle is best sunscreen spray bottle on the market. I bought this sports spray because although i love the other KMF products the sun screen would still disintegrate in the water causing my little daughter&#x27;s eyes to burn. So I bought this spray and I love it! It goes on clear; which feels a little funny at first because you are not entirely sure you are covering all areas, but after a few times you get the hang of it. It goes on clear and stays on clear and doesn&#x27;t run or get into your eyes no matter how many times you go under water. Overall, they make a fantastic line of products and i am a huge supporter both for me and my family!</li>
    <li> Product is very nice but the spray/nozzle is a pain.  It worked well the first few times and now I can only get short small spurts and makes it really inconvenient to use.</li>
    <li> Effective and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This sunblock has a great smell and it is not greasy.  My husband is hard to please when it comes to sunblock and this won him over right away.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a 3-day outdoor festival and it delivered as promised.  My only complaint is that the pump spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work well causing aggravation during application.</li>
    <li> We live in Florida and use tons of this sunscreen! Great coconut smell, never greasy, feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing sunscreen but works well.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much but I have to note that it smells great.  Kinda coconutty and tropical.  Very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have used this sunscreen many times before, though never purchased from Amazon, usually from Specialty stores. Never had a problem with the sprayer. However, I purchased two of these bottle of sunscreen spray on Amazon and we had problems with BOTH spraying mechanisms One of them got completely stuck in the down position. The other is very touchy as to when it will spray. Sometimes it sprays, sometimes it gets stuck. Great sunscreen, bad spray bottle.</li>
    <li> LOVE this. However, the pump gets clogged really easily and makes it a PITA to spray. But the sunscreen itself is EXCELLENT.</li>
    <li> Summer is here and I removed the wrapper for the first time to apply on my 2 little kids only to find the spray completely not working.  Will be calling Amazon to see how to get it replaced.</li>
    <li> The pump spray was really annoying since you have to use it so much to cover your entire body with sunscreen.  It often got stuck or your hands get slippery and it&#x27;s hard to depress repeatedly.  The spray also comes out in a concentrated area, so I felt that I had to use my hand to spread the sunscreen.  This would have been sooooooo much better as an aerosol, thus alleviating these issues.  One tip -- if you are indoors, make sure you are on a bath rug or towel when using this spray, as it does get everywhere and it is slippery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest plus is that this sunscreens smells AMAZING.  If it were aerosol it would be a 5-star review.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much. It moisturizes without being greasy, it smells great, it stays on well, and it&#x27;s mostly if not 100% natural. It doesn&#x27;t require an aerosol spray, which means you waste less product when applying. I am so sad this has been discontinued by kiss my face. It now comes in an aerosol can only, but the formula may be different, and I haven&#x27;t purchased the new one since I don&#x27;t like continuous spray.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is awesome. So easy to apply. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Smells tropical.</li>
    <li> I liked the scent of this and I think it worked okay but two bad things about this.  it&#x27; completely clear so it&#x27;s really hard to tell where you&#x27;ve just sprayed and also the pump stopped working the first time we used it.  you had to press down then manually pull the pump back up and spray again.  it takes forever and since you can&#x27;t tell where you sprayed because it&#x27;s clear and dries fast, we ended up missing spots... not good.  I love kiss my face products but it should be more like their other spray which I really like a lot.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen itself seems a bit greasy, but that&#x27;s a minor matter compared to the fact that you have to pour the liquid (not a cream) into your hand to apply. Very annoying.</li>
    <li> Hard to spray so you may have trouble getting the right amount but the problem can be fixed by just changing the pump with any other house hold pump you may have.</li>
    <li> Hands down the BEST sunscreen! I have four little ones and our own pool, so lotion everyday is a big hassle and doesn&#x27;t always work. Enter KMF! This stuff is the BEST! Quick light spray protects them the whole day! Customer for life! Pllllease never discontinue this!!!!</li>
    <li> The sprayer top does not work.</li>
    <li> Not sticky, smells great and I love that it&#x27;s paraben free. Great product, easy to use and provides the protection i need.</li>
    <li> Our family has used this sunscreen for 2 years due to contact allergies and sensory problems. It works really well (as we found out the hard way when I missed a spot on my arm), is non- greasy, and easy to apply. The only reason I left 4 stars instead of 5 is we find that over time the pump sticks/stops working.</li>
    <li> Daughter and I both have eczema and skin allergies, it&#x27;s been a nightmare to find something we could use that didn&#x27;t end in a rash or hives.  The Kiss My Face line has worked really well for us.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I just really enjoy kiss my face products. This smells so good.</li>
    <li> We purchased two and bought both on our recent Caribbean trip. Just as well because at any one time we were lucky to get one to spray consistently. Overall we liked this sunscreen with its quick absorbing qualities, intriguing coconut smell and effective protection from the sun, but the spray mechanism is terrible. We would buy it again, but not in this spray bottle format.</li>
    <li> Took this on a trip to Costa Rica.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, nice coconut smell, and it worked like a charm at keeping us all from burning to a crisp in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> we love this sunscreen!! We&#x27;ve ben using this for 3 years now and haven&#x27;t had any burns. Even recently when we stayed at the beach for a week, the kids &amp; I had no burns! This is amazing bc I have very fair skinned little ones &amp; I&#x27;m pregnant (my skin is always more sensitive &amp; I usually fry when I&#x27;m pregnant).&lt;br /&gt;My husband also uses when working outside &amp; he does burn or sweat it off.&lt;br /&gt;*fave in our home</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girls and after the second day of putting sunscreen on them, the spray bottle broke.  So I had to buy those empty spray bottles from CVS to use the rest of it.  We all love the light scent of this sunscreen but just be ready to pay another $2 for a new spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Usually I find spray on sunscreen to not be as effective as the lotion, or that it smells awful, and runs out quickly. But this has a nice coconut smell, it works really well!, and it lasted for an entire week in Costa Rica with reapplication a few times a day. Bear in mind, when I was in the sun, I reapplied about every 40 minutes. But I got not a single sunburn! I used a different product on my face, but for my body this stuff saved me a lot of time and wasn&#x27;t too greasy either.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this sunblock. I have ordered it several times. It&#x27;s extremely light weight and not greasy what so ever. It is the only thing I can put on my face that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> Producer&#x27;s promise is kept: the spray is not greasy at all and dries in seconds. This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tested. It is definitely worth its price.</li>
    <li> Took this on vacation and the pump wouldn&#x27;t work. Ended up with speckled sunburn!</li>
    <li> Love the sunscreen feel and smell and natural ingredients, but the pump was totally a bust--never worked. :( Will buy again if I can find it cheaper, just in case the pump come broken again &amp; I end up having to pour it into a pump of my own at home.  Don&#x27;t want to pay for a non-functioning pump.  Very hard to apply straight out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned with a family history of skin cancer and I have tattoos - I am the ideal customer for sunscreen testing. :) I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena rub-in cream which seemed to work okay but stained my clothes. I tired a Walgreen&#x27;s brand, 90 SPF, but the aerosol spray was funky and the sunscreen itself felt greasy. After asking friends for recommendations and reading reviews for this product, I ordered a bottle of Kiss My Face spray. It&#x27;s awesome. Not greasy, not staining, and smells like coconut. Definitely found the sunscreen I&#x27;m sticking with from here on out.</li>
    <li> Just a fancy name to a simple sun screen. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> The only issue is that it&#x27;s hard to apply. My fingers get tired of having to push the nob multiple times. But that&#x27;s just the beginning because the more you use it the more it gets stuck and you have to pull it out after each spray. I&#x27;m gonna try a different bottle as the product itself isn&#x27;t bad at all. Smells like coconut and my toddle has never gotten burned (live in AZ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it&#x27;s actually sprayable (when the spray works). I mean I bought some sunscreens in spray bottles that are useless as you still have rub the sprayed out drops over your body with you hands as they were more of a thick lotion consistency.</li>
    <li> best spray sunscreen. not oily at all. cant even tell you have it on. we love Kiss My Face Sports Spray SPF 50, 8 Ounce</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is just okay. I like that it is SPF 50 and does not contain parabens, however it did not seem to last as long as other sunscreen sprays I have used in the past with the same SPF. I can&#x27;t use it on my face because of the high alcohol content, as it stings my eyes horribly. The spray bottle sprayer is also super hard to push down, so I opt to use other sunscreens as this one is far to annoying and not something I can apply quickly, on the go. I will continue on my quest for a safe, effective, more natural sunscreen spray with a high SPF that is also easy to apply.  Hopefully such a product does exist</li>
    <li> I tried a bunch of natural sunscreen products at once, and this is one of my favorites. The sprayer works well, it goes on clear, and protects well. It stings a bit if I spray it on my face, but that quickly subsides. It does feel a little tacky and looks a bit shiny on the skin, but I don&#x27;t mind that. If you spray it on with enough coverage, you don&#x27;t have to rub it in, but be careful not to miss spots if you use it that way.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural sunscreen I could find in a spray bottle and our family likes it. Works well!</li>
    <li> The spray pump broke after one of the first uses.  We could open the top and pour in our handed but it&#x27;s a mess and the sunscreen dries so fast that you can barely get it on in time.  This was a waste.</li>
    <li> Awesome and safe sunblock!  I order 4 bottles at the beginning of each summer.  I use this for body only.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this product.  I used it for a week on myself and my daughters, it didn&#x27;t protect our skin at all.  Went back to using Neutrogena and Cerave.</li>
    <li> The one major problem i found with this product is that the pump spray was a pain to apply to large areas and both my wife and I ended up having interestingly placed sunburns.</li>
    <li> Bought it for coachella worked great.  We reapplied like at 3pm, when the first initial application was like 11am-12pm.  Don&#x27;t forget to spray your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked great, lightweight.  Paraben-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy in future for active sun-protection lifestyle coverages.  :D</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product -- I&#x27;m really fair skinned and really sensitive to chemicals so I am alwyas looking for a sunscreen that protects but doesn&#x27;t irritate. Well, this one doesn&#x27;t irritate me (plus!) but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to protect me as well from the sun as other products. I&#x27;ve gotten sunburned wearing it (when another product would have prevented it. I seriously doubt the SPF 50... That said, the other reviews are so good, I&#x27;ll have to try it again (and promise to update the review if it works).</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! Really works and smells so nice. My only complaint is that the spray bottle gets a little sticky, like the top doesn&#x27;t pop up again very easily after pressing down to spray. But whatever, still great stuff.</li>
    <li> Kiss my face is my go to brand for personal care products.  Their sunscreen works well for me.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The stuff itself is great - invisible, smells like coconut, stays on, protects well, easy to apply. The spray mechanism could be better - its flimsy and stopped working on my 1st bottle (second one still hanging in there). Since it dries super fast its a challenge to apply it any other way than by spraying, hence -1 star.</li>
    <li> This is easy to apply and it smells nice. My family is very fair and I can spray this on them on their way out the door and decrease their chances of burning.</li>
