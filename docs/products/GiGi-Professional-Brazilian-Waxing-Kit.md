      <li>Amazing!!!</li>
      <li>It may be helpful to practice how to best grab, pull, tighten the skin before you get started.  </li>
      <li>and let me tell you, in about 30 minutes, you can see the wax melting, it worked perfectly, did not leave any residue on my skin, however i could not just wax with the applicator, so i used some clothes strip i had around.</li>

      <li>I am very happy with this product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> unless you use the pre-waxing oil it will tear the skin like mad... I got bruises and it hurt. I am used to pain from waxing, but this wax is unfortunately not worth it. I will keep the warmer though. as far as the mess goes - I didn&#x27;t find it messy more than any other wax. I does wax pretty well, but I think the bruises are not worth it.</li>
    <li> This was the first home waxing product I have purchased, and I found it a little difficult to use.  If you let the wax harden too much, it sticks to your skin and it very difficult (and painful) to remove.  I also thought it was tricky to get a good grip on the wax without strips.  With some practice, I&#x27;m hoping it will get easier and prove to be a good investment!    Update:  After several months of practicing, I&#x27;ve definitely gotten my money&#x27;s worth with this kit.  I&#x27;m still not sure I would recommend it to beginners (at least get a professional wax a couple times before you try doing it yourself), but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s fairly easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to most products so I was a tad hesitant to use it around my bikini area. After much hesitation I gave myself a fairly good bikini wax. It removed most of the hair and I didn&#x27;t burn myself. I do wish I had bought the numbing spray for certain areas but it was relatively painless. I will try what others suggested and take some Tylenol before waxing.    The only thing I will say is to be careful as it can get a tad messy. The warmer heated the wax slowly but its not a big deal. The kit is fairly complete. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> First time i used hard wax. Works great, wax comes off easily. Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin in sensitive spots that much. Definitely is good for underarms and bikini, however for legs i would use soft wax (faster and wax usage is significantly less as you have to apply hard wax in thick layers). It is not even close to as messy as i thought it might be. Once you get used to it, which is very easy, you are fine. Kit comes with DVD that gives you a few good tips. In general, very happy with the purchase, will definitely recommend it to a friend. Will be ordering another can of wax soon.</li>
    <li> This kit is fantastic.  It&#x27;s fast and easy to give yourself a home wax, at a fraction of the cost of a salon visit.  I have zero training in waxing, but the video is very helpful.  I also paid attention to what the technicians were doing when I went to the salon in the past, so I remembered some things.  The hard wax is exponentially less painful than strip wax, because it only sticks to the hair and not the skin-- but it&#x27;s pretty important to remember to use the pre-epilation oil before applying wax, or it will hurt more.  I also had trouble the first time with making a big mess, but by the third time I used this, I got the hang of it and had no more messes.  I now give myself an underarm wax in 5 minutes, without having to schedule it in advance or make a trip to the salon.</li>
    <li> I have used this kit to wax all kind of things! The hard wax really does not hurt! I also use it on my face and under arms too. I also use Gigi muslin strips with it which makes waxing sooo much easier... though you really don&#x27;t need them. Love the warmer too. Makes it so much faster and easier. You can wax at home easily with this kit!</li>
    <li> The warmer is great, so much easier than the microwaveable waxes. The kit is a great way to get started and I really like the hard wax. I was able to wax my eyebrows and my bikini with the same wax. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only way she will use.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product and not a bad price for what you reiceve! I just use this product for me but it doesn&#x27;t hurt and the wax is a lot gentler than the store bought brands. I&#x27;ve using the waxing strips that warm in your hand that leaves sticky resude all over. I&#x27;ve also used the wax that you heat up in the microwave well if you don&#x27;t hurry up and wax fast enough your wax will dry. With this product it doesn&#x27;t take long for the wax to heat up and it stays warm. Also if you using the heat up in microwave type and try to rush you could loose part of an eyebrowl. Ooops I&#x27;ve experience that by accident. You don&#x27;t have to worry about rushing with this waxing kit! I would reccomend this for anyone!</li>
    <li> I am so delighted with this product because I have tried so may in the past that didn&#x27;t remove a &#x27;stitch&#x27; of hair!  It was easy to use and picked up most of my hair. For my first time, it was messy but I was able to remove the rest of my hair and it also unearthed my ingrown hairs so that they can be removed later. It&#x27;s definitely a product that you can master with time and the product video is helpful on how to get an idea on how-to wax yourself, especially if you&#x27;re novice, never done it before or if you just didn&#x27;t play attention to what they do at the salon/spa. There&#x27;s a fair amount of pain and there maybe a bit of overlapping, depending on your desired result, just be careful of yourself, expect a lot of time and messiness your first time and take your time and think of the instructions. Read through the pamphlets and review video to get an idea of what you will be doing and try to relax. Your end result will be well worth it and you will get better with time. DO expect hair growth/re-grwoth to vary, for example, if you&#x27;re in warmer weather then expect quicker re-growth. If your hair is coarse and you suffer from in grown hairs, expect quick re-growth. If you&#x27;ve never waxed, haven&#x27;t waxed for a long time, or you use shaving, creams or other depilatory methods, do expect quick re-growth. The hair will become finer, lessen and have slower re-growth with time. If it it doesn&#x27;t, take heart, you have a product that can now help that in  way you can maintain privately, comfortably (over time) at a fraction of the cost. The product is reviewed well because it works well!</li>
    <li> just got my set last week. So far I used it once and I loved the result. I am used to self waxing, and used to use sally hansen brazilian bikini wax.  Gigi is so much better, you get really professional results. The wax itself is so much gentler and effective in removing hair. The pre-wax oil and post-wax gel are great and make a difference. I am very satisfied with the set itself, with the brazilian wax, with cost savings i am going to get and with much better results! Note, this 14oz wax, if you use just for brazilian, is enough for probably 7-10 applications, maybe more, will see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never waxed the bikini area before -- either at a salon or at home. Decided to get this with the warmer so I wouldn&#x27;t have to be running back &amp; forth to the microwave, &amp; I&#x27;m glad I did. It hurts a TON, but that&#x27;s to be expected. It was pretty easy to use, and I like not having strips but just the wax to pull off. The video and instruction book to help you figure out what you&#x27;re doing aren&#x27;t so helpful, but the product itself is very good.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Will take practice to master self waxing especially in peri area. Great value. If Sharing, I would recommend not to double dip the stick for sanitary reason. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have never done a brazillian or bikini wax at all, either professionally or at home.  The instructions were very clear and precise.  I was pretty freaked out that it was going to be excruciating pain, and it honestly wasn&#x27;t that bad at all.  I&#x27;m sure that was due to this wax.  I used it on my eyebrows and lip and the difference between this and the store bought hard wax was amazing.  It worked so much better, and it just didn&#x27;t hurt.  I am very impressed with the results, as well.</li>
    <li> No one likes to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I bought this kit is because I heard from a friend that the pain is manageable. And its true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one pass for me and its all gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> Ive had one brazilian in the salon, and one at home with this kit about an hour ago, it is amazing. Tried to do the whole thing which gets kind of tricky but it works GREAT. Bikini is def the easiest and most painless, the rest hurts but only for the moment you pull the wax off, crazy good results, SO EXCITED TO SAVE MONEY AND DO MY OWN WAXING AT HOME!!! will be buying this again soon as I run out!</li>
    <li> Watch the DVD. It helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give about 30-40 minutes for the wax to warm up on high, then alternate between low and medium during use. I did my entire bikini area - ALL of it. This kit was so much easier to use than the regular sticky wax that I tried to use before (I gave up on that one). It came with everything I needed (NOTE: You do NOT need mueslin strips as this is a hard wax). Apply the pre epilation oil on the area to be waxed - only a small amount is needed. I made sure to set up in an area with good lighting and just laid a towel on the floor with tissues and a trash can nearby - this helps for easy clean up! I also have a small vanity mirror that lights up around the edges so that helped too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part for me was trying to figure out at what point to pull it off, not wanting it to be too soft (where it won&#x27;t pull off) or too hard (where it would break). I think that will get better with time and experience. Doing the backside is also a little tricky... I found that the easiest way was to lay down and lift my knees to my chest and reach under. The lowest price around here for a decent bikini wax runs around $40 not including tip, so this kit more than paid for itself in just one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve NEVER gotten a bikini wax before - I say pay the money one time to get it professionally done at a salon that uses hard wax. Watch them carefully to observe their style. Then try it again on yourself when you&#x27;re ready to wax again :). Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have only used this a couple of time so far, but I have been very pleased with the results so far! It&#x27;s a little challenging finding good angles to apply and remove the wax, but the product itself is great and I would (and have) recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I just got this kit, quickly read the instructions and plugged it in.  Within 20 minutes, the wax was soft enough to use and I was able to do my upper lip in about 1 minute.  It couldn&#x27;t be easier and you definately don&#x27;t need any cloth strips.  Timing is everything, though.  You have to wait just long enough for the wax to harden so you can peel it without it being brittle.  It all goes pretty quick.  The instructions even mentioned doing your hairline.  What??? I&#x27;ve had an awful widow&#x27;s peak my whole life and now it&#x27;s gone.  This is so much less painful than the sticky Sally Hansen stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past since it really doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin.  I can&#x27;t wait for my \\&quot;other\\&quot; hair to grow back so I can try this down there.  For around $40 including the warmer, there&#x27;s plenty of wax for a number of applications, but you&#x27;ll probably need more applicators (they say no double-dipping).  I imagine popsicle sticks would work just fine. Fantastic stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you need to get started.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the price is great on Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same kit that is sold at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. So, you can buy replacement items there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this a couple times and I feel that this is a great product for anyone who is comfortable doing at home waxing.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have to warn those who are not experienced that it is messy and you have to be careful of hot wax on delicate parts.&lt;br /&gt;I burned myself a couple of times and I got wax stuck on loose skin that would not come off without taking some skin with wax(even with pre-epilation oil). Ouch!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use the warmer with soft wax for other body parts but I will not be using this for Brazilian waxing.&lt;br /&gt;It is too hard to get the wax where I need it and it is way too messy for at home Brazilian waxing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used this for a Brazillian wax, yet, just much needed facial wax. It arrived two days ago so I opened it up today. I&#x27;m blown away by how simple it is. I assumed doing my own waxing would be super messy and more painful than the salon. I was wrong. While I realize the Brazillian will be more arduous, it&#x27;s easily the best $35 I&#x27;ve spent recently.</li>
    <li> Although the wax takes a little bit longer to warm up than I thought, I still think this is a great product. Once I got the hang of it, it was pain free and really easy to do. It even saves me a ton of money every month, since I can do it all myself now!</li>
    <li> I love this.  It worked wonders and was fairly easy to figure out.  I liked that it came with an instructional DVD, but would have liked it better if it came with an instructional manual.  It was a pain to go through the whole DVD just to find out how long the hair should be to wax; but like I said it worked WAY better than expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my wife and she loves it. I recommend you watch the dvd before you begin waxing. This is a hard wax so strips are not needed. Make sure you use the oil that comes with the kit before applying the wax or baby powder works well too.  The wax must be applied thick at least an eight of an inch thick. Another thing you can do is look up hard wax on [...] there are some great videos on hard wax and how to use it correctly.</li>
    <li> The only setback was that it took waayyyyy to long to melt the wax. I set it on high like the instructions called for and it took a good 6hrs for it to completely melt. I do prefer this over the hard wax because it leaves my skin much smoother and lasts a lot longer.</li>
    <li> First of all, i was quite pleased with how promptly the kit arrived and this is even when it is forwarded to me from a US mail forwarding service as i do not live in the US. the cover of the warmer was cracked and i cannot put blame on that on any one set as it had changed hands a lot before getting to me. maybe a little more protection in the packaging would have helped.  but now to the crust of the matter... i have given myself many at home brazillian waxes and i was so excited when i saw this kit as it at least meant that i would not have to be running to keep warming up the wax on the stove while my son looked at me with a perplexed look on his face(i know the sellers and many of u are cringing with how dangerous this is, but again this was my effort to do this safely/conveniently at home). the package is well put together and one can get several uses out of the amount sent as i have done. i did bikini only the 1st time and had some difficulty and i thought it was because i was not famiiar with the hard wax. so i promised myself that i would try harder the next time and as hard as i tried it just does not work for me. the wax has a tendancy to stick to ur fingers and does not effectively remove the hair. i ended up doing my stove top regular honey wax(also from gigi) to do/clean up other areas of the body i tried it on like eyebrows and underarms. and i realise for me i like having the grip of the muslin cloth to work with and there is no painful \\&quot;flicking\\&quot; up the edge of the (hard) wax.   i didnt notice any difference in effect on the skin in terms of pull and irritation. both are about equal to me and the fact that with th hard wax i felt like i had to keep going over an area made me MORE irritated if anything. and honestly my honey wax lasted me several months and the hard wax is already half! (ie the honey wax with muslin cloths is more EFFICIENT)  i am a firm believer in Gigi, but not this wax. note that they do have kits available with the regular wax andmuslin cloths. i am so sorry i didnt get one of those as now i have to purchase those separate.  hope this review helps...:-S</li>
    <li> It takes a few tmes to get the hang of using this system, but it is great!!  It removes more hair than any system I have EVER used!!  Messy or not, I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I like this product to a certain extent.  It can be fairly messy and difficult to pull the hair yourself.  Make sure to get the wax to a cooler temp so it doesn&#x27;t get all over the place.  The bikini area can be tough on your own but I did my underarms and was really happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit to do simple areas, such as upper lip and nose area. I really love it! The instructions are easy and it&#x27;s very simple to put together!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous, I will admit.  I get a brazilian wax in the salon, but my husband bought this kit and I finally let him try it out.  It ended up being less painful than the salon :)</li>
    <li> I have used many different waxing kits, I almost just gave up trying at home waxing until I found this one.  I love this wax! No running back and forth to the microwave wen its not hot enough and no burning myself because the microwave made it a little too hot! Would recommend to any woman that wants to wax but save money at the same time.  Forget going to get waxed do it yourself; get the same great results and for less money!</li>
    <li> I have been getting brazilians for a couple of years now - so the pain does not bother me -- I was trying to lessen the costs associated with the waxing.  It&#x27;s messier than I would like and definitely harder to do by yourself but who would I get to help me??  There are some things that are best done alone or with a professional!  I would recommend getting a friend to help you especially if you are removing the hair on your backside.  The kits works great and I&#x27;m hoping with experience - I will get better at using it!  I&#x27;m just not that flexible.</li>
    <li> I got this kit to wax my underarms and bikini area and maybe eventually a brazilian.     There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve. Watch some videos online, they are very helpful.   The wax needs to be just the right consistency. If it drips easily off of the stick, its too hot/thin. Apply the wax fairly thick. If its too thin, it breaks and then you&#x27;re sitting there yanking little bits off. Not fun on the armpits, even worse on the bikini and beyond.     The underarms are easy and relatively pain-free.     The bikini is more difficult to do, I don&#x27;t know how in the world women manage to do that themselves. And asking your husband to do it doesn&#x27;t really work either.    For now, I&#x27;m going to stick with the armpits and legs. Maybe work up to the bikini.</li>
    <li> Just ordered this kit because I was tired of getting bad waxes - most of the local places use the sticky wax for bikini waxes and I&#x27;ve left the salon more than one with my underwear glued to my butt or worse.  I&#x27;ve had waxes in other cities that were great and the main difference is that they used hard wax.  Don&#x27;t be put off by the \\&quot;brazilian\\&quot; name - you can go as modest as you like or remove everything.  The key is that this kit includes the hard wax - no strips needed - and this product is so much more gentle than the sticky wax!  And FWIW, I&#x27;m 6.5 months pregnant right now so if I was able to pull this off and not be in terrible pain it can&#x27;t be that tough. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll get logistically more difficult towards the end of my pregnancy but I&#x27;m still hoping to wax at home rather than get shaved at the hospital or pay for a crappy and painful job at the salon before I deliver. For me, it was great to do this in the privacy of my own home and get exactly the results I want.  The kit contained everything I needed but I will say it&#x27;s always a good idea to wash hands and the area to be waxed thoroughly with antibacterial soap before you get started (again, something they don&#x27;t generally do at a salon and the cleansers they do use can be really harsh and irritating with all of the alcohol).  Other products may be nice to add to the routine, but this kit certainly has the essentials.</li>
    <li> If your going back and forth on whether this will be a good enough wax pot because its on the inexpensive side...just buy it. This is a great little pot for home use haven&#x27;t been disappointed at all. The wax that comes with it is decent but not my favorite I use a brand from the cosmo store that doesn&#x27;t require oil to be applied first and it works great in this pot so I am super happy with it!!</li>
    <li> (Waxing virgin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because I&#x27;m not sure if my problems are the product or user error. Once I get the hang of it, I&#x27;ll edit this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yesterday it arrives. I normally shave, so I let it grow for a few days. Someone in a review said they leave it on 15m longer than the directions. The directions I read said 30m. So a total of 45m. Way too long. The consistency was runny. I tried lowering the temp to low. Still took forever. Then I turned it off for a while. Still a long time. So I gave up and tried today instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it in for 25m I think on high. Then lowered it to low. Still too runny. I waited, maybe not quite long enough as when I applied it, it was still a bit too thin so I doubled up to make it thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very hairy, my hair grows thick. I knew this wasn&#x27;t going to be perfect. I also have very sensitive skin. When I get my eyebrows waxed or threaded, I always break out a little and have bumps. So, I know this is going to cause some irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I only tried a little today. I did small sections on the front, which is really tricky since the tab to pull of is still on some hair. This sucks. But I&#x27;ll get better. I washed the area, washed my hands, used the pre-oil and the post gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Messy? Yup. Painful? Yup. But I can take the pain. My attempt left about 30% of the hair still there, so I had to use tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a few questions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Do I wait for the pre-oil to dry?&lt;br /&gt;2. Should I get this done professionally? I know the answer is going to be yes, however I am very critical of my body. I&#x27;ve recently gained a bit of weight and have some dark stretch marks on my legs. I&#x27;m really scared that they will be judgmental. Plus, I don&#x27;t know of any good ones.&lt;br /&gt;3. Any extra advice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to reread these tips again and maybe try tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Doing your own brazilian waxing is much easier than I thought. I have been getting it done at salons for over 10 years now.  This kit is easy to use but like what others have commented it can get a little messy.  I am very happy with this product.  I find the end result is even better than the ones I usually get at salons!</li>
    <li> Great hair removal system. Much less painfull than soft wax or epilation. I&#x27;ve used the hard wax on all areas needing hair removal and its worked great on every area. I would say the bikini area was the most difficut/painful but may get better with practice. Great value for those of us on a budget!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  It does everything I wanted it to do.  It has already paid for itself in the money that I have saved from doing waxes at home.  Very convenient for facial waxing - anything else can get a little messy but for small areas it&#x27;s been great.  It could just be that I need more practice with it since there are no cloths involved you have to be sure to leave a little tab at the end to grab on to when pulling it off.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better at that.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ok so my experience goes like this.&lt;br /&gt;I went for a Brazilian wax at my beautician and she did a OK job however it was painful and left over some hair which she said for first time is normal which I didn&amp;iexcl;¦t really like, than she said every 3-4 weeks I have to do it again and pay $50 well that all just sounded too much for me so I went on a mission to find a great product and this is the great product! I did it all by myself in about an hour yes its long time but guess what it was free and with this kit I can get at least 3-4 waxes out of it so its worth it, and pain was 50% less than when she did it, and all the hair was gone!!!! I AM happy I found this product and plan to use it forever. I am actually planning to go and try waxing my legs as well with GiGi&amp;iexcl;¦s muslin strips hope it will work out same. But if you are debating don&amp;iexcl;¦t just get this product and you will save so much money and be pain free and smoooootthhh. One advice is to make sure you put the pre-wax oil that comes with it makes it so much easier to waxº Good luck and get this product don&amp;iexcl;¦t even read those negative reviews they just didn&amp;iexcl;¦t know what they were doing. If I can do it and be pain free you can as well!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this thing and I&#x27;m glad I got it for her. It does the job well and for a good price.</li>
    <li> Its really difficult to use by yourself, but the wax breaks so easily and I have tried putting it on various thicknesses. I have experience in waxing. I like the pot but would like to try gigi&#x27;s soft wax and strips. The hard wax is simply a pain in the booty.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be scared or intimidated like I was.  It&#x27;s not that much fun, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t cost so much at the salons, but you can do it and get great results.  I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; by the hairy fairy.  I might also be a bit OCD.  I used to tweeze every single hair out of the \\&quot;brazilian\\&quot; area, it usually took about 2 hrs. and was literally a pain in the neck and I couldn&#x27;t get all the way to the *ehm* \\&quot;back\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve paid anywhere from $75 to $85 (without tip) for brazilian waxes at salons and the still had to take tweezers to the area when I got home!  Frustrating!!!  The more expensive wax was actually a lot worse than the cheaper one.  Grrrr.  I paid $38.75 for this kit at amazon.com, chose free shipping and after one use, it&#x27;s paid for itself.  I do have a high tolerance for pain.  But I was still shocked that this method hardly hurt at all.  (I was using Sally Hansen microwaveable hard wax on my upper lip regularly and that hurt, I thought I was in for torture.)  I think the trick to less pain is that you pull the skin as tight as you can before yanking the wax off and that you don&#x27;t let the hair get too long.  I&#x27;ve learned this from tweezing too.  It may be helpful to practice how to best grab, pull, tighten the skin before you get started.  I pull the skin tight even when I apply the wax.  It&#x27;s relatively easy on top of the pubic area and might get a little trickier once you get between the legs, especially the lips.  I try to get them as \\&quot;flat\\&quot; as I can, usually pulling up will do the trick.  I&#x27;ve sat on a bar stool, the hamper, opened and closed bathroom cabinet doors and drawers to put my foot on.  LOL  All just to get a good clear view of what I was doing and a good \\&quot;grip\\&quot; on the wax and on the skin.  It does take practice and I&#x27;m sure I will figure out the best positions soon.  I was really pleased with my first attempt, minimal pain, nice and clean result.  It took me about 1.5 hrs. that&#x27;s with running back &amp; forth, getting paper towels, alcohol wipes, fishing out my good tweezers out of my purse, sanitizing them, re-washing my hands, etc.  I know I will get more efficient with practice.  I was still not able to do the \\&quot;back\\&quot; myself.  I think I will attempt that at another time, maybe with a mirror... not sure yet...  Watch the video, it has some good tips.  Read other reviews, they have some good tips too.  Start with the \\&quot;most helpful\\&quot; ones as rated by users.  If you need more tips/techniques watch videos on youtube, they may be helpful too.  Hair cannot be too short; it shouldn&#x27;t be too long either.  With longer nails, you may be able to lift the edge of the wax easier.  Ideally, you would have no hair or at least not much hair on the edge of the wax where you&#x27;re gonna lift it and pull from, but that&#x27;s not always possible.  My hair was too long by the time I got the guts to try to do this myself.  Stupidly, I didn&#x27;t trim it.  If you have too much hair/too long hair on the edge you&#x27;re pulling from, it&#x27;ll be harder to lift off the wax and get it going.  This was actually the only case where I did hurt myself.  Do smaller sections.  It takes longer but it&#x27;s easier.  I started rushing, wanting to get done quicker by doing larger sections at a time, that&#x27;s when I started to leave a lot of hair behind.  I just don&#x27;t have the experience for that yet.  I didn&#x27;t buy any numbing spray or any other prep or after products.  I have to watch my $ and was able to do just fine with what this kit came with.  Getting the wax the about right temperature makes it much easier to work with.  However, I was not able to get a nice soft ball on the end of my spatula like the video showed.  But I was able to work with what I had anyway.  Be careful, use common sense.  Don&#x27;t burn yourself.  You want a nice thick layer of wax.  If it&#x27;s too runny, it&#x27;s too hot and you may not be able to lay it on thick enough, even if you could tolerate the heat.  As the wax cools, the surface will dull.  When it&#x27;s no longer sticky, it&#x27;s ready to be taken off.If any wax residue is left behind, you may be able to lift it off by sticking the \\&quot;not hairy\\&quot; side of the wax patch to it and pulling it off.  Give yourself time and you will do great!</li>
    <li> I really liked this waxing kit, its a good price for everything included. My issues with this are due to my own inexperience and im sure once I get the hang of things I&#x27;ll be able to avoid the mess. I must say self waxing most definetly helps your flexibility!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to do my bikini line on my own. All this needs is a good mirror to access the more difficult zones and this would be the perfect set. It takes a little time to heat up but once it does it&#x27;s so quick and easy. The \\&quot;before\\&quot; lotion really helps the skin not to stick but needs to be applied more than once. This saves so much money on beautician and now I can do a better job at home! This one box of wax lasted me for more than 10 months now including summer. I love it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to be able to wax in the privacy of my own home. This product was the answer. It came with an instruction video and a nice booklet. Super easy to use and great results. So glad I ordered it!</li>
    <li> The instructional video is helpful but anyone that has had a Brazilian wax prior to purchasing this kit will get the gist of how to apply the wax and what to do.  I found that it takes about 45 minutes to get the right consistency despite what the instructions state.  The hard wax is wonderful and does not leave a sticky residue like traditional wax. A great comprehensive kit that has almost everything you need to get going.  One hint, I lay down wax paper on the counter and floor in the bathroom in the event that I lay down an applicator on the counter or wax drips on the floor it is an easy clean up.</li>
    <li> The kit I received was different from what is shown, I had an allergic reaction to the wax included in my kit. The wax did not even remove the hair. I&#x27;m so disappointed. They have more professional grade supplys at Sallys beauty supply. This was a huge waste of money and time!</li>
    <li> Because I go to the salon and get waxed each month, this was an investment worth buying. Not only does it save hundreds of dollars a year, it also works very well. The pain is minimal and the wax is easy to strip without the muslin strips. That was the largest concern when I received it in the mail with no muslin strips included in the box (they aren&#x27;t needed). All in all, I would give it a five star rating!</li>
    <li> This waxing set is very good, it works as it said it would, definitely watch the DVD instructions so u can do it all nicely. Definitely another set of hands for hard to reach areas  unless you are flexible enough then it wouldn&#x27;t be a hassle at all. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I had experience with Gigi microwaveable wax so it was not a new and messy experience when i tried this one. And actually made the waxing proccess a lot more fast, because the wax was constantly melted at a very comfortable temperature, and not getting too liquuid or too hard as it happened with the microwaveable version. GREAT PRODUCTO AND TOTALLY RECOMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Was easy and relatively painless. I used the pre-oil and had great luck with easy removal.  Also, the pot still appears full, so I believe I will be able to use it for at least a year before having to buy more, what a great deal!!</li>
    <li> I love this kit! Has everything you need right in it. I have used it probably a dozen times and works great every time. I have saved so much money, I am kicking myself for not buying this last year when I first thought about it. Get it you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I love this waxing set! It comes with waxing instructions, it is very easy! The wax is very hypoallergenic (i always get bumps and pimples after waxing but not with this one) I just love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for my eye brows and my upper lip and it works great for getting those tough hairs out.</li>
    <li> There is definitely a learning curve to using this kit. I still haven&#x27;t gotten it down completely. But considering the money I&#x27;ve saved by not going to a professional to do this, I would say it&#x27;s worth it. The wax that comes with the kit should last you a long time, 8 months plus even if you&#x27;ve got lots of hair.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick, the warmer works really well and the was is fanstastic, really good for your skin and comes out easy</li>
    <li> works great! still painful as any other wax though! ;) The price we pay for beauty huh? Had to go buy wax strips and numbing spray, this kit includes applicators but not strips to remove the wax..</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my first wax warmer...I don&#x27;t own a microwave. I only use it for my armpits. Works GREAT! I&#x27;ve tried the wax that heats up over the stove and that didn&#x27;t work out too good. This warmer is ideal for someone like me. I just turn it on and about 30 mins later it&#x27;s ready for me to use. I use very little wax. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful kit. I was able to do it myself (no extra hands needed) and even though it took me a long time it&#x27;s worth it. I am sure that once I get more experience I&#x27;ll be able to do it much faster. I recommend you let the wax warm on High for 50 mins and then bring down to medium. At least those settings worked for me. Painful? Yes...but I think it&#x27;s less painful than when I get it done at the salon. Make sure the hair to be removed hair is short (1/2 inch or less), if it&#x27;s too long it will hurt much more. GiGI products are really good! Bikini waxes are usually $45+ and is not as great as what you can do at home with this little kit! I am sold :-)</li>
    <li> Disclaimer I a newbie at waxing at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warmer: Works great I have no issues thus far with it.&lt;br /&gt;Cooling gel: Tingles a bit did not feel soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Pre oil: Makes area silky smooth feels nice on skin.&lt;br /&gt;Hard Wax: Personally I need to get used to it haven&#x27;t went down town with it but I have waxed a friends back and you have to get the wax at the perfect temperature to apply smoothy. Its a a messy wax and if you get it on anything it sticks.&lt;br /&gt;Instructional video: Helpful but I think a little practice goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think with some practice I can get it down but I would suggest to practice on your legs or even a brave volunteer before trying a Brazilian on yourself.</li>
    <li> makes at home waxing so much easier than any other product i have tried! saves me money too!!</li>
    <li> My product did not include any applicators, as stated in the item description and on the box.  It is supposed to include several applicators.  I had to improvise with plastic utensils, which, needless to say, didn&#x27;t work very well.  Additionally, the box did not resemble the one pictured...it appears to be a much older version with ancient instructions.  I don&#x27;t believe I received what I paid for.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Waxing hurts. You are pulling hairs out of the follicle. But! Hard wax makes for a nicer experience. Important things:  -As someone else noted, take some motrin like an hour before you begin. It really helps with the pain level and preventing swelling after.  -REMEMBER the pre-eppilation oil! I cannot stress that enough. Especially on your sensitive lady (or man...) bits. Seriously.  -WATCH the video two or three times and pay attention.  The kit is great, very complete and a high quality product. The wax does take an extraordinarily long time to melt the first time, and until you get the hang of it, it will take you a while to wax yourself. If you are not especially flexible, I can see a self-bikini wax being really difficult to achieve just on the basis of mechanics. A loved one or really good friend may need to help. Be brave!</li>
    <li> The others are right!  I read all the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t buy powder and gauze strips!  They are not needed for this wax.  I wasted money buying extras.&lt;br /&gt;2.  My pre epilation oil arrived half empty... But it is very necessary&lt;br /&gt;3.  I kept forgetting to pull skin tight and having to redo my work... Pull the skin tight!&lt;br /&gt;4.  I did exactly as the others said...&lt;br /&gt;  A.  Apply wax in small strips&lt;br /&gt;  B.  leave a small lip of wax to grab&lt;br /&gt;  C.  Pull wax quickly against how it lays&lt;br /&gt;  D.  I started towards the bottom area where there was less hair so I had an easier grasp od the wax lip&lt;br /&gt;5.  I let the wax heat for a long time (about an hour or so) on high the first time&lt;br /&gt;6.  Then turned it off for about 30 minutes to let it thicken&lt;br /&gt;7.  Then did as one person said and would turn it on low and off again, just long enough to keep it thick like taffy but not runny like syrup&lt;br /&gt;8.  I allowed plenty of time so I could practice and learn&lt;br /&gt;9.  I did my lip and brazilian and it worked GREAT&lt;br /&gt;10.  Just remember to PULL THE SKIN TIGHT&lt;br /&gt;11.  Use the pre epilation oil!&lt;br /&gt;12.  Trim hair close... I Trimmed but had to do more because it was not pulling as well.&lt;br /&gt;I personally had no issues with left over wax ... The oil seemed to keep that reduced and the remaining specs cleaned up quickly and easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can buy it from another seller with a better reputation....do it.&lt;br /&gt;This one still has never responded to my issue of the half empty bottle of oil.</li>
    <li> I love this waxing kit. Since ordering this one I have gone to actually order other waxes and products to go with it. I use this hard wax to wax my eyebrows and under my arms and legs you name it. It can make a bit of a mess if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing. Also with this hard wax I find it is prefect if you watch the video before using and never set it on high. I always set mine on low for about 1.5 hours maybe a little longer if I forget about it, when it all seems melted I don&#x27;t have to wait for the high setting to cool off before I use it. This is a must buy for anyone who is always going to get their eyebrows waxed, legs, brazilian, it is prefect and saves a lot of money!</li>
    <li> Works great !&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ll need some pad,because it will be hard to remove from anywhere)&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s really cheaper comparing to salon and if you practice a bit it gets easy. I used to use epilator, but it was too painful for underarms and bikini...&lt;br /&gt;I found another wax on Amazon,\\&quot;azulene hard wax\\&quot;,and it&#x27;s even cheaper than gigi. So I&#x27;ll buy it next time and will use with gigi warmer..One more good thing with this warmer is that you can actually use your wax twice or more..if you have light thin hair or if wax strip doesn&#x27;t have too much hair on it, you can simply put it in warmer again and reuse!)&lt;br /&gt;I really happy with this product, because using microwaveable wax or wax with strips was such a pain...&lt;br /&gt;one more thing- YOU NEED pre-waxing oil..if you don&#x27;t want to spend a few hours in shower trying to remove wax)</li>
    <li> I love this wax!!! I started waxing myself (brazilian) about a year ago. I have only ever used hard wax on myself. I have had an in salon brazilian wax done with strips before, and I must say that I prefer the hard wax. You definitely feel less sticky afterwards. The only other wax I have used is SurgiCare brazilian hard wax. I must say the GiGi&#x27;s brazilian hard wax is much better than SurgiCare&#x27;s. The reasons I say that is because SurgiCare wax is microwavable, which is nice, except that you have to keep going back to the microwave to heat it. With this kit, you get the wax warmer which keeps the wax at a good consistency once it has heated up. Just put the wax in the warmer for about 40min to an hour on a little past the medium mark. Once it is all heated turn it down to low, and your good to go. Another reason why I like this wax over SurgiCare is because SurgiCare wax tends to get a little sticky and hard to take off if you put it on too thick. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with this wax. Actually, this wax works better when you do have a good layer of wax. You don&#x27;t want to put it on thin because is will dry faster, and you don&#x27;t want it to get too dry because then it will not come off right. The application of the wax is the same. Once you get the hang of it, the time is takes you to complete the waxing will be shorter.</li>
    <li> I was dismayed to find the entire 2oz bottle of oil empty when I received my kit, and the dome cover was cracked. I wanted to send it back but I had waited so long to try a wax at home, I kept it. So with no oil I used a little and I mean tiny amount of olive oil instead. I really wasn&#x27;t sure how this would effect things. It was fine. The kit works great. I watched the dvd and I believe this helped me. I have never waxed anything prior to doing this. I was worried about the pain, forgot to take anything for it like other reviews suggested. All in all it wasn&#x27;t to bad. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was painful at all. Then I got to some more sensitive areas and Yes very tender but I muscled threw. I think with practice it will get better. I learned what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Make sure your hair is short, apply thinner rather than thick, and get the right hardness. To tacky hurts and over hardened wax hurts. I will keep the kit, the results were great!!! I did everything down below and very happy it was just what I wanted. Took me about two hrs, I thought it would be faster at first but a couple times I almost gave up, glad I didn&#x27;t. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to have a smooth soft area.</li>
    <li> I bought this last year and I absolutely love it. I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all, and the wax it came for has lasted me 9 months- so 9 bikini waxes. I still have at least one more in the jar too. I was skeptical about the lack of waxing strips, but this works better than any of the kits with strips I&#x27;ve ever used. Plus it keeps the wax warm, which is way better than trotting out to the microwave if I&#x27;m not fast enough and it starts to cool. Really, I can&#x27;t praise this enough! A++! Definitely 100% worth the price.</li>
    <li> I waited to write my review until I had some practice.  I&#x27;ve been practicing on my tummy and today, I did my armpits.      The first time I used the kit, I let the wax warm for TOO LONG.  The wax ended up too thin and cooled too quickly, and YEOUCH.  Today, I let the wax warm on high for 35 minutes, then turned it to low, as directed.  I set up my other stuff and by the time I was ready to dip in about 10 minutes later, it was perfect.  The wax should be thicker than you might think.  Really, as everyone says, like honey.      I am THRILLED with my smooth pits.  They took no time at all and it hurt less than when I had them done in the salon.    I am not ready to go \\&quot;down south\\&quot; by myself yet, but after I have some more practice with the best thickness of the patches of wax to apply and after I do some more thinking about body and mirror positioning (LOL!) I will absolutely attempt my own Brazilian.    Im going to save SO much money with this kit!  WOOHOOOO!    I wish the video in the kit was more specific about BRAZILIAN waxing and about HARD wax.  The video only shows techniques for the wax with which you must use strips, and only shows a regular bikini wax.  I can&#x27;t imagine who would volunteer to have their Brazilian filmed, but it sure would be helpful!    I purchased the Wax Off product at the suggestion of the other reviewers and Im glad I did.   Picking off the little leftover bits can be irritating to the skin.</li>
    <li> This hard wax product is by far one of the best wax I have used. I use to use soft wax (Nads/Sally soft wax) before and they were painful and sticky. Additionally, the procedure when doing a self wax on yourself is harder because the you have a add the wax and rub and then pull. For the hard wax, the wax lays on top and only pulls the hair; therefore less pain is felt. This item was easy to follow and simple to use. I was able to wax myself, particularly the underarms. Wait time was simple and I love how the wax did not feel sticky and was painless. I would highly recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday 11/15/2011. It was really quick delivery got in within 3days of ordering it, and that included the weekend. I was a little disappointed that the lid had a crack in it...but I will keep it anyway since it just sits on top of the warmer and doesn&#x27;t attach. I tested the machine and it works great! I did a couple of test strips in my legs and the wax works great! It gets the hair and you don&#x27;t need cloth strips to rip off the wax...you can just pull the wax off just like a strip and WALA!!! however I did order strips with it, but havn&#x27;t received them yet. The CD that comes with it is helpful, but if you&#x27;ve had a brilizian wax a few times you pretty much will catch on easy...it was a little sticky but easy to use. I love it and can&#x27;t wait to do a full brizilain wax....but waiting til it&#x27;s closer to my trip in a two weeks. Thinking of buying a nother so that I can have two going at once and can do my face and other sensative parts and use the ahrd wax for bikini area.</li>
    <li> The small bottles of liquid that come with the kit are not properly sealed from the factory. Multiple bottles leaked everywhere inside the box during shipment. Thankfully the return process was quick and simple. I plan on ordering another and reporting on the performance when it arrives.</li>
    <li> I have been going to a salon for waxing for years.  Money is tight, so I really wanted to try waxing myself.  The way the pros do!  I was also questioning just how sanitary it was getting waxed.    That being said I did some research and decided to go with this kit.  It&#x27;s actually easier than you would think.  Make sure you use the oil that comes with it though.  I didn&#x27;t on one test run and I regret it.  The oil helps!  I&#x27;m wondering if regular baby oil would do the same job though.  Also, I paid only $40 for this kit, with free shipping on amazon.  I left it in my shopping cart while I decided and the price fluctuated quite a bit.  Although I have only used this kit once, I love it so far!!!!!  Definitely cheaper than salon prices to buy this kit, even if you use it just once.</li>
    <li> The kit shipped earlier than predicted when I bought it, arrived promptly &amp; though the packaging was a bit beat up, the kit itself was well protected &amp; in perfect condition.  This kit has absolutely everything you need to wax at home from the wax, warmer &amp; applicators to the pre &amp; post oil &amp; gel (which are great products too).  I have been waxed professionally before, but I watched the dvd anyway to make sure this wax was the sort I was accustomed to.  The dvd would be great for someone who hasn&#x27;t been waxed frequently, but I&#x27;d still recommend getting it done professionally a few times before trying it at home.  The instruction booklet that comes with the kit tells you exactly how to heat the wax &amp; apply it also.  The warmer heats the wax really quickly considering the amount of wax you get &amp; it keeps the wax at a nice, even temperature.  Just be sure to test the temp on a small patch of skin, the recommended setting was a bit too hot for me.  I thought the consistency of the wax was perfect!  Not too stringy so it didn&#x27;t get all over &amp; not too thick so it was easy to spread.  Waxing doesn&#x27;t bother me so I can&#x27;t really comment on the pain factor, but it took all the hair off quickly &amp; easily &amp; didn&#x27;t leave any sticky mess behind.  A really great product at an exceptional value if you consider a single wax will cost you more than the entire kit, not to mention a repeat wax every 4-6 weeks!  Plus, I&#x27;m using the warmer with other gigi waxes now to do my legs.  Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this product and the whole line in general.</li>
    <li> I have this product and i love it! its like the professional salon ones,so ya it works good. The warmer is convenient so you don&#x27;t have to go back n forth to the microwave. of course it hurts, your ripping hair out! but after a few rips you get used to it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore!! it takes a while to warm up, but that&#x27;s not a big deal, just turn it on like 1-2 hours before your ready to use it! It removes the hair cleanly.just make sure to have mineral oil or baby oil on hand to remove any left over wax or that sticky feeling. overall, this is a good, money saving product that actually works, with long lasting results! I&#x27;m 100% satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit a couple weeks ago and overall have been very happy with it.  I did buy it to wax my bikini line area, but I first tested it on my brows (maybe not the smartest idea, haha!) and it worked great.  My first attempt to wax my bikini line was NOT good, and here&#x27;s what I did wrong:    1.) Warmed the wax up TOO warm  2.) Let the wax get too hard before removing  3.) Did not exfoliate, shower, take any paid meds beforehand    Let me just say....it HURT SO BAD the first time.  However, I knew that there weren&#x27;t a ton of positive reviews on Amazon in error, so I tried again a couple days later.  Here&#x27;s what I did beforehand:    1.) Turned the wax onto high  2.) Took a warm shower and GENTLY exfoliated my bikini line  3.) When there was a hard center of wax and liquid outside I turned it down to low for about 15 minutes  4.) Drank a couple glasses of wine (some will say this heightens nerve endings making pain worse, but it worked to relax me)  5.) Made sure the wax was thick and not very runny  6.) Applied it in small areas and pulled it off immediately after it was no longer tacky.  (When you tap the wax after applying it should still feel slightly soft but not sticky)    Overall, these methods worked MUCH better.  Don&#x27;t forget to use the Pre-Epilation Oil, it truly does make a difference.  I&#x27;ve read on numerous hair removal sites that exfoliating is good to do both beforehand (helps remove dead skin, which means there&#x27;s less skin to pull) and also after waxing (helps cut down on ingrown hairs).  I&#x27;ve been waxed for almost a week now and it&#x27;s still smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> I made some novice mistakes.. the wax is good because it doesn&#x27;t tear your skin if you use the pre epilation oil. I let it dry too long and ended up tearing our my arm pit hairs one by one. It was awful. You have to make a long enough application to begin the flap on an area with little or no hair. I learned my lesson and will do better next time. It&#x27;s a little messy but I think it was just my beginner&#x27;s nerves kicking in and panicking. I don&#x27;t care what anyone says... waxing hurts but the pain eases and the results are worth it!!! Take a couple Advils before and you&#x27;ll be swell.</li>
    <li> After paying to have my underarms and bikini line waxed for about 10 years now, I thought I&#x27;d like to see if I could do it myself from home to save some money.  After reading through many of these reviews, the manual and watching the DVD, it really was quite simple to do my own waxing.  Perhaps it was a bit easier for me because I used to work in a salon years ago and used to wax eyebrows, AND I also had help from my very wonderful and patient husband, but it worked out great. I was expecting a bit of a disaster for the first time, but we had a washcloth handy nearby to quickly catch any drips, and we only had one small bit of wax to wipe up.  I really like how quickly the wax &#x27;sets&#x27; and my honey was able to get the hang of pulling the strip off really quickly (like a bandaid) so that there would be less pain. As happy as I am with the kit, I wish it had come with 5-10 collars to keep my warmer clean.  But I&#x27;m sure I can get them at Sallys; it just would have been more convenient to have a couple come in the kit.  Overall - very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sooo glad I found this product on Amazon. I don&#x27;t know how I was managing before I started using this. Just a warning: It does take a lot of practice, reading up on tips, and knowledge on how to use it before you are 100% comfortable and can do it quickly. However after you master it, it makes life so much easier, and it&#x27;s wonderful. It saves a lot of $ in the long run. Reading all the reviews on Amazon helped a lot and it probably took me 8-10 different tries to really get the hang of it. It helps to even get the services done professionally a few times to get the idea of the technique.  A few tips:  -Heat it on high for about 10-15 minutes, just so the edges are melted, then turn it to low  -After about 5 more minutes on low you can start using the edges or flip the hard center around so everything melts faster  -Then throughout the whole process, I&#x27;m switching it back n forth between OFF and low to keep the wax consistently thick and gooey  -You want the wax to be thick and gooey or it&#x27;ll be a big mess of dripping wax everywhere  -Use the pre-waxing oil they give you. It helps the wax from sticking to you. I made the mistake of copying what the salons use and used baby powder. It made a big mess and had residual wax stuck everywhere. Very hard to remove!!  -Apply wax going in the direction of the hair and rip going the opposite direction  -Make sure you apply the wax in thick /small strips, then after waiting 10 seconds, flick the edge up so you have a tab to pull from  -After the ripping, use your hand to press down on the surface of the skin, helps the pain go away immediately. Sometimes I&#x27;ll even rip an inch, press down, rip a little more if I can&#x27;t bear the pain in one big motion.  -When you run out, just buy re-fills, and make sure it&#x27;s the hard wax. It makes all the difference!!</li>
    <li> If you yank hair from the roots- it hurts!  No matter what you use -it hurts  That being said hard wax is slightly less painful-slightly  If you keep up with maintainance it is wonderful- if starting from scratch i would suggest going to the salon then just doing upkeep from then on.  It is messy and time consuming!!  It helps to scream your loved ones name while you yank- really keeps you focused on why you are torturing yourself!!</li>
    <li> I have used the product about four times. It works if used properly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the wax get too hot.  It burns and it goes on too thin. If too thin, then you can&#x27;t rip it off in one piece and you have a big mess.  It also gets very drippy.  I like to heat mine on low for about an hour or so.  Use newspaper to protect your floor, chair etc.  Have good light.  Trim the hair if longer than 1/2 inch.  Note the direction of the hair growth if possible.  It makes the difference in a clean rip or broken hairs.  You will have to do some contortions to access some areas. Most importantly, use the pre-wax oil.  It is the difference between ouch and OUCH!!!</li>
    <li> Having gone in for professional waxes through high school then switching to tweezing/epilating in college, I found my way back to waxing with this cheaper body-hair care alternative and I love it. I think I can manage my pain better when I am the one administering it, which is why the wax removal is relatively painless. All in all, highly recommended- but be sure to wear something that you wouldn&#x27;t mind getting wax on the first couple of times, and USE THE GIGI COLLAR! It helps tremendously.     I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the amount of wax strips I would use (and I was disappointed that the kit came with none)- simply waxing my chest area and armpits bore me through about 30 small wax strips, double-sided. Granted, it was my first time, but still- have extra. And happy hair removal!</li>
    <li> I was successful my first try and will never pay $50-$70 for a wax again.  *Tip* The wax is too thin on it&#x27;s lowest setting, so I had to turn it off and let it thicken a bit like on the dvd to get a good pull. Luckly I realized that before I started.  GOOD LUCK!...you don&#x27;t need it:o)</li>
    <li> I think this kit is great for a beginner in DIY waxing in general. The DVD was helpful (although make sure there are no kids around when you watch it since it&#x27;s graphic) and the instructional booklet covers everything from how to wax from your forehead to your feet and everything in between. The warmer is easy to operate and the different sized applicators really help with accuracy in applying the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than my eyebrows and upper lip, I&#x27;ve never waxed any other part of my body myself. I have had professional Brazilian/bikini waxing done before but doing it myself, now that was definitely a memorable first. Make sure you put down a towel under you and/or on the floor around you to avoid a mess. Mirrors, both big and one of those round magnifying ones, really helped when it comes to those hard to reach areas. Or you can always ask a good friend or even your bf/hubby to help. So far, I&#x27;ve done my bf&#x27;s lower back, my armpits, a Brazilian, one of my bf&#x27;s lower legs (ankle to knee, we&#x27;re doing the other tomorrow) and still have about a little more than 1/3 of the can of wax left. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad but considering I&#x27;m a newbie at waxing and all that combined would cost close to $130 (not including tip) at my usual waxing place, I&#x27;d say this kit is a worthy investment for anyone who regularly waxes.</li>
    <li> I tried to get rid of back hair with this, and it worked.  It just left a lot of bumps on my back.</li>
    <li> The kit came very quickly and is of good quality. However, the pre-epilation oil bottle was open when it arrived, so everything in the box was a greasy mess, and the bottle empty. Totally unacceptable!</li>
    <li> This kit contains everything you need. The warmer is much preferable to either the double boiler or microwave method of heating wax. Once melted, the wax stays at a constant temp saving you time from having to stop and reheat. The wax has a pleasant scent and smooth consistency. I much prefer this type of wax to the kind you have to use fabric strips.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use.   And it&#x27;s so convenient to have it in your home whenever you need it.</li>
    <li> This GiGi Brazilian wax kit really does have almost everything you need to do a successful Brazilian on your own. To start with what it comes with:    GiGi Brazilian Hard Wax (this is the same stuff they use at the salon)  GiGi wood sticks for spreading wax (when these run out, I&#x27;ll just by popsicle sticks)  Gigi Pre-epilation oil  Gigi Post-wax cooling gel (this is *not* a wax remover)  Gigi Wax Warmer (the true value of the kit, comes with a warmer, plastic cover, and paper ring to put around the wax container so it doesn&#x27;t drip onto the warmer)  Instructional DVD (meant for professionals and not super helpful to me)    I have gotten Brazilians in salons several times before and I can&#x27;t speak enough to the benefits of hard wax over strip wax for that \\&quot;area.\\&quot; Hard wax adheres to the hair, not the skin, so hurts MUCH less when pulling out (which is not to say it doesn&#x27;t hurt, you&#x27;re still pulling the hair out by the root). I once did a Brazilian to myself with those no-heat strip wax sets you can get at Walmart - OUCH. This is definitely better. I don&#x27;t find the contortion too difficult - I put a towel down on my bed, lie down, put  my knees up and do it that way.    Definitely use the pre-epilation oil which will ready your skin for the wax. The warmer does keep the wax at a good temperature - you set it to high at first and when the wax melts, move the setting to low. Once the wax melts, apply SMALL strips and make sure the wax is THICK -- this make it easier to remove. Also make sure you&#x27;ve trimmed the hair and make sure you work so that where you&#x27;re pulling from (the \\&quot;edge\\&quot; so to speak) is relatively hair free. I found that if I tried to pull from an area where the wax was already sticking to hair (as opposed to bare skin), it would be much harder to get out and ended up breaking a lot of the hairs, rather than pulling them out. It&#x27;s tough finding that perfect instant where the wax has cooled enough to pull off quickly and with little pain, but I did it a coupletimes, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better at it. I tapped the wax with my finger until it was no longer sticky, counted to ten after than, and then pulled. You can get pretty much all the hair this way but it takes a little while - I may get faster once I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of this stuff.    The post-wax cooling gel actually burnt a bit, but afterwards I didn&#x27;t have any redness or soreness. I wish Gigi included the Wax Off wax remover in this kit because that would have been really helpful -- you have to sort of pick the wax off if it cools too much, and wax remover would make things easier.    Overall, a great kit, they really do use it in salons (when I went in to get my eyebrows done, I checked!) and it works well. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> glad i got this, oil works, cooling gel works and actually almost helps to get little bits of left over wax, plenty of sticks of different sizes to last a couple months, and the wax works fine when you know how to heat and use it correctly i would suggest to get extra wax if you plan on using this for your legs</li>
    <li> I ordered the GiGi professional waxing kit  upon a recommendation from a friend. When I got it, I checked inside the box and it looked new and like everything was there. But when I took it all out and opened the wax tin to use it, I found that there were course black hairs embedded in the wax and in the warming collar. I was under the impression that this was a *new* product - there is no way I would pay for a used waxing kit.</li>
    <li> This kit was really good came with everything u need.. the only thing is it takes some getting used to if you&#x27;re doing it yourself... Thank god for my fiance, lol....highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m impressed with this product. Watching the included DVD made the process go much smoother than expected. Very little irritation after waxing. Would recommend this product. On a side note, the after wax cooling gel helps to un-stick any left-over wax.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good wax and warmer, I think this is one.  It does take a while to melt the wax, but I just turned it on, then went back later.  The wax takes all of the hair off, but if you have long legs like I do, it will take a while to do your legs.  Allow plenty of time, make sure and set it on newspapers, because the wax does drip while it is melted and is impossible to remove from fabrics, rugs. Make sure to have it close to the area you are planning to wax, that is one thing that I regret that I did not do.  After shopping around at different places, I feel this was the best price, even better than ebay.</li>
    <li> a few years ago i started getting very bad itching as a result of shaving and i thought i was doomed forever until i thought about waxing as an alternative.  i went to a professional salon to be waxed twice, there is no way i could have done a brazilian to myself the first time, maybe not even the second. the experience was so painful and scary that i doubted after the first time i&#x27;d be able to do it myself but i just did and it was no biggie!!! this kit cost the price of 1 salon brazillian waxing service and i used only about an eighth of the product!  the replacement wax is only $15!!!  cheaper than shaving!!  anyone with a little courage, patience and common sense can easily achieve salon results at home using this kit without much hassle!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to use....so was my wife. The video was helpful. You have to watch the thickness of the wax and not go by the dial on the warmer. Low was way too hot and the wax too thin. After I turned it down and let it thicken up. It was easy to use after that, you just have to go for it,no matter how much the waxee whines and moans. My wife complained alot during the procedure, but that is a daily occurence so I am not sure the waxing had anything to do with that. The results were all pro at a fraction of the price. I would recommend it to husbands everywhere. Like I said get it thick enough like in the vid and go for it.</li>
    <li> I was very irritated and disappointed to find that the &#x27;Prep Epilation Oil&#x27; bottle was completely open, and had leaked all over everything, leaving the bottle -empty-!!! It went through the company packaging as well as the UPS box. I feel I deserve a free bottle of the oil as a replacement for the lost-hope I get it...!!!</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, my bottle of pre-epilation oil came open in transit. You would think they would shrink-wrap the bottles to prevent this, or at LEAST tape the bottle shut before shipping.    On to the kit. This is an amazing value if you are brave enough to wax yourself. I have used it twice and the results were way better the second time, so I have faith that I will get better with practice. I put towels down on the floor and lie down. I have a lighted cosmetic mirror on a stand that I use to make sure I&#x27;m applying the wax correctly. It hurts much less if I lie down and don&#x27;t look at the strip being pulled off. I think it&#x27;s because I pull more quickly if I&#x27;m not looking at it. Here are my tips for success.    If you have never been waxed before, I strongly recommend that you get waxed by a professional at least once before you try it on your own. This way, you can observe the professional&#x27;s proper technique and hopefully emulate it on your own later.    1. Watch the instructional DVD. Note that the DVD is a professional video designed for estheticians, but it is NOT suitable for children.    2. Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature. If you get too hot and start sweating, the waxing results won&#x27;t be as good.    3. TRIM hair to be waxed so it is between 1/4\\&quot; and 1/2\\&quot;. If it is too short, the wax will be unable to pull out the hairs, and if it&#x27;s too long, the wax will get stuck and it will be painful and dang near impossible to remove the wax. :( This is a major sadface, trust me.    4. Rub the pre-epilation oil in an area to be waxed, dab with a paper towel, then apply some baby powder. Dust off the extra baby powder if needed.    5. Don&#x27;t let the wax become too hot. To start, put the heater on high for 15 minutes, then turn it down and keep it on the Low setting until it&#x27;s ready to use. If you can scoop out wax with your wooden stick and spread it, you can start waxing. If it&#x27;s too hot, it becomes very thin, and not only do you run the risk of burning yourself but you will also splatter wax everywhere.    6. Use small wax strips. Yes it takes a little longer, but they hurt far less. Also make sure the \\&quot;tail\\&quot; or end of the wax strip lands on an area without a lot of hair. This makes pulling the strip FAR easier.    7. After waxing, use the post-waxing gel, then LET YOUR SKIN REST FOR 24 HOURS. I refuse to use products with menthol so instead of the post-waxing gel, I use Paula&#x27;s Choice Redness Relief treatment, [...]  Once you have allowed your skin to heal, gently exfoliate each day in the shower to prevent ingrowns (I use a sisal washcloth, but you can use a gentle scrub, loofah, what have you). At least 24 hours after waxing, I use Paula&#x27;s Choice excellent BHA/beta hydroxy acid lotion to help exfoliate the pores to prevent ingrown hairs and bumps.</li>
    <li> I actually got this today in the mail and already use it and i love it. The only problem i had was that pre epilation oil was empty and the oil got all over the stuff, but other then that i really like this.</li>
    <li> WOWZA!  I have never written a review on a product, ever... until now.  This wax kit is everything it claims to be.  I have recieved professional brazilian waxes several times and could not afford the maintenance :(.  I was hesitant to believe that I could do it myself, and that it would look just as good - BUT I DID and IT DOES!  From the time I plugged the warmer in to the time I was HAIR FREE was 2 hours.  Way longer than the salon, but it was my first time waxing myself and findig the right positions is... interesting.  I am sure my time will improve with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact that I can do touchups when ever I want, and that this whole kit cost less than ONE trip to the salon.  SO HAPPY!</li>
    <li> I read ALL 30 of the reviews before I went and purchased this jar of suck ass waxing product today.&lt;br /&gt;For better or worse, I needed my own personal experience. \\&quot;Perhaps those online country bumpkins didn&#x27;t do it right\\&quot;, I thought to myself, and I HAPPILY gave the lady behind the counter $21.97 for the all in one microwavable kit and merrily drove home, eager to get rid of all of my new 1/4 inch hair that was growing from my last professional wax.&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions, showered, just to make sure I was extra clean, and waited about 15 minutes, reading all of the instructions at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I warmed it in the microwave to the \\&quot;carmel\\&quot; consistency and gently slabbed it on my \\&quot;hello kitty\\&quot;, exactly as I have seen the ladies at the salon do.&lt;br /&gt;YOWSERS!! When I tried to pull it off, it was not hard and stiff, allowing for easy removal- it was very taffy-like and stringy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent the last 35 minutes pain-stakingly removing the ONE LINE OF WAX I applied, and felt each.single.hair.being.removed. :(&lt;br /&gt;It felt worse than if I were to tweeze myself down there.&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice, save your money and cough up the $40 to get properly waxed, which is what I&#x27;m going to have to end up doing anyway.... :(</li>
    <li> This is an amazing wax I have ever used. I used to go to salon for bikini wax with strips and it was so painful. And it is expensive at salon 1 visit is 40-50.  This product  is so good and doesn&#x27;t heart as at salon. And inexpensive I guess the hard wax inside this kit will last for 15-20 uses (depends how much wax u will use). I did under armpit for the first time with this waxing LOVE IT. Now I can save money in this bad economy.</li>
    <li> I have always thought that waxing equipment like these were only available to professional salons and licensed estheticians until I stumbled upon this kit on Amazon..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE EXACT warmer and wax my salon lady uses!! &gt;:|&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love her, frankly, I feel a little insulted to think about the prices she&#x27;s been charging me all these years.. though my only regret would be that I wished I had knew about this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after reading many of the reviews here, I felt the need to share some of the tips and techniques that I have picked up along the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, READ the manual! Whether this is your first or five hundredth time waxing, it&#x27;s always good to know what you&#x27;re working with. It also includes some interesting information like the anatomy of the hair/skin, pros and cons of various hair removing techniques and other good stuff. Read it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like to shower before I get a wax to remove any dirt or dead skin which makes for less painful waxing and since the jar is good for up to 50+ uses it&#x27;s also hygienic to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the application of the wax, scoop a good amount of wax on ONE SIDE of the wooden spatula and while it cools for about 7-8 seconds, move it around the stick so it has a nice even, THICK layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you apply the wax to your skin, try to keep the thick layer by grazing (not scraping) the spatula against your skin--think peanut butter jelly sandwich!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, leave a small tab of wax on a non-hairy area if possible. You have to have some sort of grip on the wax to pull it and it hurts like a mother when you \\&quot;flick\\&quot; a hairy corner. Trust me on this one :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fabulous wax kit! My salon lady uses it, I use, you should use it!</li>
    <li> This product is so much better than I expected! I thought it would be a total disaster but it went very well... relatively speaking. It is very difficult to give yourself a bikini/brazillian wax but it can be done with this. I have less redness with this wax rather than soft wax at the salon. The heater is essential. This is a great value seeing as one time at the salon costs more than the entire product! I agree with others that it would be nice to have a post wax cream/shea butter in the kit. One more thing, be sure to let the wax dry completely before trying to remove!</li>
    <li> incomplete \\&quot;kit\\&quot;. Didn&#x27;t come with the strips to pull the wax off.  kind of pointless, so now i have to go buy those too.  Recommend buying a complete kit if you can.</li>
    <li> The kit is complete. The wax is meant to be pulled off without muslin strips, that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t come with them. To be honest, if you are planning on waxing yourself, it is difficult because of the pain and you probably will need help from a friend. My boyfriend helped me, and if he can do it, anyone can. It comes with a video that helps you if you are a novice.     The wax is super thick and pulls off everything. It is pretty easy, but I still believe you need additional hands to do it for yourself. Great value--endless waxes for less than the price of 1 bikini wax.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sally Hansen cold wax for years... I saw all the reviews for this and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot and I&#x27;ll never go back.  This is so much easier on my skin!  It is messy... especially if you&#x27;re doing yourself (which is possible).  But the pre-waxing oil really makes a difference.  I just wish the kit came w/ the post-waxing removal cream too.  For first time users of the hard wax, the video was excellent!</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time to give myself a Brazilian and this hard wax is great! It&#x27;s actually painless; the wax only adheres to your hair and not your skin, so there&#x27;s no burning sensation after pulling off a strip of wax. This is so easy to use. Just make sure everything&#x27;s ready before you begin - the pre-epilation oil, some paper towels, extra applicators and a mirror should all be within reach. Hair on the bikini line and beyond can be removed easily, bit by bit. Just make sure to study the growth of the hair and apply a thick strip of wax in that direction. Wait 30 seconds, tap the wax to make sure it&#x27;s malleable but not extremely sticky, flick a little piece at the end of the wax up, use one hand to pull skin taut, use the other hand to hold the end of the wax tightly and pull swiftly, opposite the direction of hair growth. This shouldn&#x27;t hurt! If it does, try smaller sections. Use extremely small strips of wax for more sensitive regions.</li>
    <li> This is a great waxing kit. The wax takes a while to heat up so plan for time on that, but the wax works very well, comes with application sticks. Wish it came with wax off as well, but it is still worth the money.</li>
    <li> Actually a great item. I have used several types of microwave hard waxing products and figured I would just make the investment to buy a warmer and nice wax. I didn&#x27;t think it would be much different from the microwave, but it was great. I could take my time, and the temperature regulation really helped. Great wax too, got most if not all of the hair on the first time and did not stick to skin.</li>
    <li> Great kit, but the hard wax doesn&#x27;t harden up enough to pull easily. I&#x27;d invest in some good sugar wax and extra muslin strips like [[ASIN:B0002YH3PY GIGI Natural Muslin Roll]] to go with it, and maybe a better hard wax too.     The value you are paying for in this kit is the AWESOME warmer that keeps the wax the right temperature, and many of the wax tubs of this brand and others fit perfectly in the warmer. Really, the kit is worth it for the warmer alone, but the extra bits are a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> love using this product for removing any unwanted hair. it&#x27;s quick and not messy at all. for me, i found that the wax it came with lasted me a long time, about 3 months, until i had to buy another.</li>
    <li> I have had this kit sitting on my Amazon wish list for a while debating whether or not to make the investment.  GO FOR IT!  I used to get my brazilian done professionally with blue hard wax, but at 60 bucks (50 + 10 tip) a pop, it gets pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the advice of the other reviewers who loved the kit... I liked J. Boyd&#x27;s review from April 12, 2012 and Jeanie&#x27;s from April 23, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is so much better than those ready to use waxing strips, which never worked for me as I have dark, coarse hair.  I did my bikini, underarms, and eyebrows and have already paid for the kit by doing it myself!  It took me the duration of a baseball game to get it done, but with practice, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get faster doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of pain, I used to pluck my underarms, so waxing is not painful at all.  I used to get my eyebrows threaded, so no pain there neither.  Now for my bikini area, it is never a picnic in the park, but since I know what to expect, I can manage the pain EXCEPT when the hairs are too long and the wax gets stuck.  UGH... MAKE SURE TO TRIM!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can get messy, so be careful especially on carpet.  Lay newspaper or plastic bags down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on trying out different waxes by Gigi in the future, but I definitely like the hard wax.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. The container with wax was big (not one of those trial sizes), and wax was of really good quality, also has a pretty good smell to it. The heater was very convenient and easy to use. I had to make my own strips though and should have purchased a wax removal gel (there is not one in the package and it would come in real handy for removing excess wax).</li>
    <li> If you do home waxing this kit is SO nice! The warmer makes it so much easier. With microwaveable wax you have to constantly run back and forth to the microwave...then the wax is too hot at first; it stays at the right temperature for all of one minute and then it isn&#x27;t quite hot enough and it&#x27;s back to the microwave. This warmer saves so much time and makes the wax stay at exactly the perfect temperature the entire time. Also the wax is far better than others. Much less painful and comes off very clean. And the price is so good! Considering how much wax you get and the additional products (all of better quality) and you get the warmer on top of it (which also makes it much easier to use all of the wax in the container) it is such a great deal! So happy with this! :)</li>
    <li> I waited over two weeks to get the item LOW and BEHOLD I ended up getting something NASTY and damaged still awaiting replacement.  I can use the warmer that came with it in the mean time and the wax (it was soiled in the epil oil that comes with it) but it&#x27;s NOT pain \\&quot;free\\&quot; or less painfull than soft wax or like these other reviews have mentioned.  So, I rate this a ONE and IF I could go lower I would.  It was supposed to be \\&quot;mini\\&quot; in which case it&#x27;s normal size and it&#x27;s just not what was described or was supposed to be.  I wish over all I would have never bought this.  It&#x27;s also VERY VERY VERY messy.  YOU MUST know what you are doing or this is not beneficial.</li>
    <li> Im super shy, so not only have I  never waxed myself, i&#x27;ve never gone anywhere to get it done, either.  I used this last night on my face and arms and it&#x27;s so easy to do!  Works great.  Looking forward to less tweezing.  Lol</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my package and find that nothing had spilled or exploded inside the box. I waited a week after receiving it to use it because I had to wait for my hair to reach the required length. But when I got everything all set up and turned the warmer on nothing happened. There is a red light and a green light which I assume one of which is supposed to turn on. But no lights turned on. I hoped that maybe just the lights were broken and if I left it in the on position it would warm up. I let it sit for 15 minutes and no heat was produced at all. As a last resort I tried plugging it into different outlets throughout my house. It works in the kitchen and the living room. But, the wax works good and is easy to use. I definitely don&#x27;t recommended it for a beginner though.</li>
    <li> I purchased the GiGi Professional Brazilian Waxing Kit for $31.95 from Beauty Appliances INC. Order shipped free with Prime. The Red cap arrived broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used hard waxing which basically represents applying the wax and removing it without the need for cloth or paper strips. I have used soft wax method which requires the use of cloth or paper strips to remove the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard waxing proved easier than soft waxing. It&#x27;s important to know that I had to wait about half hour with the wax warmer setting on HIGH before the wax was melted entirely, than wait another 15min on low setting for the wax to be ready to use. You don&#x27;t want the wax too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must prepare the skin with some oil when using hard wax (use powder when using soft wax). You may choose to use:&lt;br /&gt;Johnson&#x27;s Baby Oil with Shea and Cocoa, 14 Ounce for about $0.34 / oz or $10 per 2 14oz pack, or you can use&lt;br /&gt;GiGi Pre-Epilation Oil for $5.84 which comes to be about $1.46 / oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the BEST TIP:&lt;br /&gt;After the first strip removed, roll the used strip and use it as a handle to remove the following strips. It will give you a much better grip. The first strip will glue itself to the new strips and make it much easier to remove the wax strips. I used it to wax legs, and it works great. You must be cautious to not spread the wax to thin, or it will become brittle. Go with a thick layer and don&#x27;t let it cool too much. Just enough to not stick to your fingers. After a while the first strip will cool to the point where it becomes to hard. At that point you may use a softer, newly removed wax strip.</li>
    <li> I love this waxing kit it have every thing I need especially the DVD to show you how.&lt;br /&gt;Nice kit and a good price I recommend, fast shipping good seller. PE</li>
    <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to go to salons anymore! This Kit is simply amazing. I didn&#x27;t have any experience with Brazilian Waxing by myself before, but now I have done it, I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this item. The wax completely gets rid of hair (even strongly rooted ones), and I barely felt any pain. This is much better than paying visits to salons every few months. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> ***5 stars for the warmer only*** I purchased this Gigi waxing kit to replace a previous Gigi wax warmer that had been a gift from my daughter, and when she moved, I gave it to her.  I received the new kit in 2 days, extremely fast!  It heats quickly, but the wax that came with the kit is AWFUL!!!  It&#x27;s extremely runny, drips when you spread it and is extremely sticky to remove.  It doesn&#x27;t come off in a strip, it comes off in pieces.  I&#x27;ve always used stripless wax in my warmer in the past and have been very pleased, and was hoping this wax would be the same since it is labeled \\&quot;Brazilian hard body wax\\&quot; , but it&#x27;s not even close.  If you use this to do a Brazilian, you&#x27;re going to be \\&quot;down there\\&quot;  for days trying to remove the wax! (I wouldn&#x27;t even attempt to try a brazilian on my self anyway-that&#x27;s crazy).  In closing, I highly recommend the burner itself,  but steer clear of the wax.  When I get the name of the wax I had been using (from my daughter) I will update this post.  I think it may have also been a Gigi product.  And if you have already purchased this wax and want to try it anyway, I highly recommend having wax remover on hand, because it will be all over your fingers!!!</li>
    <li> The warmer works great!  It&#x27;s a bit bulky to have lying on your bathroom counter, but I store it away under the sink when I&#x27;m not using it.  The kit comes with everything you would need for an initial wax session.  I&#x27;ve only waxed small areas of the bikini area.  You really have to make sure the hair is 1/4 inch, otherwise, OUCH!  I really like how I can remove the hard wax can and warm up the All Purpose Honee for eyebrows/lip.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> They forgot to put the actual wax in the box, as described in the advertisement. Other than that it&#x27;s okay, not exceptional, but okay</li>
    <li> I was unsatisfied with the order. It came on time and everything but after reading some reviews of people getting used sets, i decided to open it and check it out before i gifted it to someone. Turns out the one i had was damaged/used. I didnt try the heater, but the epilator oil bottle was damaged and half empty. No sign of spillage though, so all i can think of is that it was used once before. I returned the package and just bought one for 10 dollars more brand new somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I really found it to work well, painless and the cd of how to use the product was absolutely great!</li>
    <li> I am EXTREMELY happy with this waxing kit. I have saved so much money! This is very easy to use! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wife used this at home with no problem at all.  Fast shipping and great price.    She also picked up these products too:  [[ASIN:B0002YH3PY GIGI Natural Muslin Roll]]  [[ASIN:B0002XI30Y GIGI Brazillian Body Hard Wax]]  [[ASIN:B0018C0H66 Gigi Epilating Wax Treatment Applicators- For Hair Removal- Large 100pk]]  [[ASIN:B0018BT98O Gigi Strip Free Honee Microwave Kit- Hard Wax Epilating/Hair Removal System]]  [[ASIN:B0015NYIRC Gigi All-Purpose All-Natural Honee Wax 14 oz. Jar # Gg-0330]]  [[ASIN:B000BJMBT8 Gigi Wax Off 16 oz.]][[ASIN:B0018BT8DU Gigi Slow Grow Lotion- Reduces Hair Regrowth 8oz]]</li>
    <li> This kit works great but it is absolutely crucial to use the pre-epilation oil, otherwise, the wax will get stuck to you and will be VERY difficult to remove. Also - be sure hair is trimmed to recommended length pre-wax. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The wax is great and the warmer works very well. Consistent temperature. So much nicer than the store-bought kits.</li>
    <li> I have never used hard wax before.  It was different than waxing strips...and in some ways i liked it.  But if you get wax on you and don&#x27;t rip it off right away its impossible to get off the hair.  I like the warmer and other prodcuts ok, but just don&#x27;t think its very reasonable to wax oneself.  If someone could help or do it, then it would be worth it.</li>
    <li> This wax is wonderfull, used it to bikini wax, deffinatly would use a lidocaine cream with it though. This took the hair off great.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide between 1 star and 5 stars, so I went with 3.    As a waxing kit that contains everything you need, this one is 5 stars.  The warmer keep the wax at the perfect tempurature.  The wax is extremely effective at removing hair.  I love hard wax.  For those of you unaware, you should know that Brazilian hard wax actually hurts a lot less than cream waxes because it clings to the hair only and not the skin.  Yes, pulling your hair out from the roots is painful, but it less painful when you don&#x27;t have a layer of skin coming along with it.  It left my legs very smooth and even removed short hairs.    As a hair removal process, this system gets 1 star.  I&#x27;ve done every type of hair removal (professional waxing, shaving, eplilators, depilatory creams, etc.).  I really want to get laser hair removal, but that it not an option for my legs as my hair is blonde.  I had been epilating, but it takes a long time.  I thought wax would be faster.  Boy was I wrong!  I seriously underestimated how difficult it would be to do a home wax.  Of course I missed lots of places.  I had to go over the missed places again, which meant it took the entire thing of wax to just do my lower legs.  I challenge anyone out there to wax the back of your own leg without making an enormous mess.  Sitting on the tile floor in my bathroon for 2 hours made my behind and knees really sore.  I also had an amazing amount of wax left on my legs.  After much scrubbing, my legs look and felt nice, but I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that if you want something waxed, it really is worth paying a professional.  Maybe if I tried this a dozen more times I would get better at it.</li>
    <li> Love the warmer - much better than using the microwave and playing the guessing game.  The wax in this kit is top quality, you do not need any strips.  Wax adheres to your hair and not your skin, it is also very easy to remove without any residue.  I am very pleased with this kit.  It made it very easy for me to do a Brazilian waxing at home.  Money well spent for me and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to wax at home.</li>
    <li> I approached is product with some skcepticism. I mean, c&#x27;mon, a Brazilian at home? It really did work! I love the hard wax method, just hair pull not skin tear. I haven&#x27;t had a Brazilian in 15 years and was pretty sure I didn&#x27;t want to go into a salon and embarrass myself. I accomplished all I needed in a short time. The DVD is explicit in an educational way, helpful but ohmygoodness. Watch it, it makes the process go more smoothly. My only negative (teeny tiny) is that this kit doesn&#x27;t include the other cool accessories shown in the DVD. Would have loved the guideline strip and some of the lotions, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with my outcome. So, me and my guy are happy with the results, I love getting several salon-type treatments for less than the price of one, and I accomplished it myself. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a wide range of different brands of waxes and this was by far the most effective with the best results. Removed about 97% of hair. Ofciurse all waxes are a little messy but gigi Brazilian was the easiest to use and the wax warmer is extremely convenient. I already odered more of the 14 oz refills And will continue to buy this product. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My friend is licensed and used to wax me but she raised her rates and I wasn&#x27;t about to pay them.  So I purchased this item for less then 50% of what she would charge for one wax session.  I got multiple areas and multiple sessions with my one 14oz jar of wax.  Which says a lot as I am not a professional.  But the results were more then superb.  I am very pleased, with Gigi hard body wax and its products.  I use it on the bikini, under arms, legs and face.  It also doesn&#x27;t require it to be applied too thick.  I must add that you have to watch it closely and peel it off at the right time so it doesn&#x27;t break.  But as with anything practice makes perfect :-)  I give this product great ratings.  A must buy for anyone who would rather save money and do it them selves versus the salon.  Granted it takes a bit longer doing it yourself, but in time you will get better and faster.  You could even ask for help from a significant other.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, just like they use in good salons.  I like to use it on my lip since it&#x27;s easier to pull off and gets all the hairs.  Strips are too messy and annoying.  The wax takes awhile to heat up in the warmer but it&#x27;s wonderful if you&#x27;re doing larger areas.</li>
    <li> After the kit arrived I went to local beauty supply for the honey wax and the muslin strips in 2 sizes. I wanted to test both types of wax. All you do to change wax type is remove the can and put in the one you want to use. EASY! That is the last easy part. I didn&#x27;t think either wax too hot even on max heat. It was easy to spread except in areas you can&#x27;t reach or see. So I recommend a partner that is not going to be bothered with seeing your nether regions.     The DVD gives great detailed instructions, again if you are going to be upset with graphic close up details, skip the video.     This kit is a bargain to get the heater and hard wax. The other things are more large sample size. It is messy. Maybe best have a towel, robe and whatever other minimal clothing that is just for this purpose. Wax drips are hard to clean up.     The heating unit is larger than I expected which it needs to be for the can of wax which is almost 2 cups worth.     Personally, I didn&#x27;t find a wax lasted that much longer than shaving for the amount of time and trouble involved.  But for some regions shaving is not a good option. So, if you want to try out doing it yourself this is a good kit for that as you didn&#x27;t invest much and have everything you need including good instructions.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. I was paying $50-60 to get waxed, and this cost less than 1 salon waxing! What a deal!    With that said, a salon waxing is a quick, clean, 15 min. ordeal. This requires a bit more time and patience. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now, and I&#x27;m getting better each time. The first time was a mess! Now, its not so messy, but takes about 45 min. You have to be good at do-it-yourself beauty solutions. If you cannot dye your own hair, paint your own nails (neatly), you will end up like the people with 1 and 2 star reviews, in a big waxy bleeding mess. Know thy self. And proceed accordingly. I also think you need to be relatively healthy and in shape- you need to sit in an awkward position on the floor for quite some time.     The best thing about this wax is that it doesn&#x27;t break the hair at the skin at all! It may miss a few hairs because they are too short, but it doesn&#x27;t break any. You just have to go back through with tweezers and get the missed ones. You also have to be careful to apply just the right amount of oil to the skin before waxing. Too much, and the wax will ball up and not stick. Too little (or you forget!) and you&#x27;ll either bleed or break blood vessles under the skin. Rub the oil on like your applying suntan lotion. Just a fine layer. That&#x27;s all!     Key points to remember:  -peel a little edge of the wax strip up from the bottom with your fingernail (if wax sticks under your fingernail, its not dry enough yet), use it as a tab, hold this tab as close to the skin as possible, pull the skin taught around the area with the other hand, and rip the strip quickly in the opposite direction of hair growth (don&#x27;t rip upwards, rip backwards) Drink a glass of wine before hand too!</li>
    <li> I got this product last week. It came with everything it said plus a collar. You definitely need the collar or else the wax could drip into the warmer if you&#x27;re not careful. The video is great for visual learners and first time home users. I&#x27;ve been waxing my upper lip and eye brows for about 3 years now so waxing at home is not new to me. It is a graphic video so make sure young children are not around - it shows how to do a Brazilian wax. The great thing about this type of wax is that strips are not needed. So its important to put it on a little thick and have more wax at the end so it is easier to pull. This is similar to Sally Hansen&#x27;s microwaveable wax, which is what I have been using primarily. The first thing I tried was waxing my upper lip and eyebrows. All of the hair on my face did not come off, so I had to apply it 2 more times (for a total of 3x) and it still didn&#x27;t completely come off. So that was disappointing, which is why I gave it 4 stars. At least with Sally Hansen, even though I also have to wax the same area 2-3 times, it eventually pulls all the hairs completely. I&#x27;m gonna order a different type of wax for the face and see if that works better. I also waxed the hairline/collar area on my husband. That seemed to work better and all the hairs came off the first time. I haven&#x27;t tried the bikini area yet...I&#x27;ll try that next week.</li>
    <li> its really good..my wife liked it..but it wasn&#x27;t packed properly, when I received it it was leaking, except the it is good</li>
    <li> Video shows you how to quickly and easily use the product.  I was skeptical at first that it would work as stated but it really does.  It is so much better than the days where you applied was and then used a strip to pull it off.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The kit did not have any templates for eyebrows.  Was very messy and hard to use.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this and is really pleased.  It is easy to use and does a really good job.  RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I have seen better. Wax does not work so well and it does not get all the hair.  I wish it worked as described.</li>
    <li> I love this kit. It has everything you need to do a Brazilian wax on yourself or someone. The price is really good, and I am saving a lot of money by not having to go somewhere and get it done. Typically I spend about $60 every month and a half going somewhere to get it done before I purchased this item. Now I just pay for the kit up front and whenever I run out of the wax (which takes about 4 sessions) I just buy some more wax either online or at a beauty store near where I live. I feel this is a very very great purchase and the results are just as good :)</li>
    <li> Does not have everything you need, still have to purchase strips for waxing separate, and if you want cooling/healing gel and numbing spray or gel for before and after..</li>
    <li> Superb product.You will be amazed how well this works on all parts of the body.A very important step is to use prewax oil.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I contemplated buying a smaller, simpler kit for a first purchase, but am so glad I went with the Gigi kit! The low price is not reflected in the product, as everything is high quality. I expect this 14 ounces of hard wax to last at least a year for all my waxing needs. Works great on the face, though it is recommended for thicker, darker body hair. Take an ibuprofen to reduce swelling on more sensitive areas. As a first time user of waxing products, I had no difficulties with product utilization.</li>
    <li> So basically when I went to do my legs, there were areas in which the hair would not come off. I had not shaved in awhile, so really there was no reason for this not to work, however it did not. I have a low pain tolerance, and honestly the pain was not worth the results, considering I am going to have to shave anyways.  That being said, I have bushy brows normally and I dispise plucking them, and this really helped in reducing the tweezing that I had to do.   So I will use this for my eyebrows.  Just a recommendation: Do not forget to put on the pre-epilation lotion, this is utterly important. I forgot to put it on when I went to a new strip, and the wax, clung itself onto my skin. It felt like it was trying to rip off my skin, it did come off, however the pain was much greater than with the pre-epilation, so use it.</li>
    <li> I was very inexperienced when it came to waxing but this kit came with everything I needed and seemed to have the professional look and feel as if I was at the salon. The only complaint I have is the DVD and the printed material said I needed the waxing clothes and I didn&#x27;t see it in the kit, after watching the DVD again I noticed sometimes they used a cloth and others they didn&#x27;t, so I assumed it&#x27;s not needed. My underarm feel smooth and pretty painless when applied, my bikini area is another story. I think I have low pain tollerance in that area and I was bright red and irritated for about 5 days. So I think I&#x27;ll use this for my underarms and legs. Thanks Gigi!</li>
    <li> I had been to the salon twice for a Brazilian and decided to give it a try myself so I ordered GiGi based on the positive reviews.  The product is easy to use and does a great job of removing all the hair without pain.  Seriously, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to do myself and now I can save time and $$.  The salon cost $55 plus tip.  I would recommend having the first one done at the salon b/c I think it would hurt if you had to remove all the hair yourself, but the regrowth is thinner and easier to remove.  I&#x27;m hooked.  Love GiGi!</li>
    <li> You will be amazed to view the results of your first peel.  All of the little hair roots will be staring back at you, and the area will be smooth and hair free.  Definitely hurts less than cold wax.  The quantity of wax that comes in the kit is a good value.</li>
    <li> This set is definitely a must to anyone who would like to remove hair at home, or even if you are a working salon, it&#x27;s a great starter kit. Includes all of the things you need to wax your hair off, except the wax off product, which I do recommend for leftover wax on the skin. This brazilian wax kit is even ideal for the face as it removes hair nice and easy. Very glad I invested in the set, the warmer is a must, as it prevents you from having to warm wax in a pot or microwave and it holds the temperature nice and steady. I received the product days before scheduled, which is a nice added bonus!</li>
    <li> Aside from those that may have sensitivity to the wax, I definitely don&#x27;t get why there are negative reviews!  Let me start by saying ---READ THE INSTRUCTIONS and GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO GET THE HANG OF IT especially if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with hard wax.  They tell you everything you need to know in the manual and DVD.  Also, if you haven&#x27;t waxed ever before, definitely get a wax at a salon first because the first time is a guarantee it will hurt the most.  I used it for that area down there by the way and I used to dread going to get a brazilian.  That is until I found a salon that used this type of wax and not the strips.  In an effort to save some cash though, I&#x27;ve been using the Sally hansen  hard wax kit for a few months and I honestly think this Gigi kit is a great investment!  The consistency of the wax is stickier than the sally hansen one but it&#x27;s also so much easier to spread which I love.  Add to the fact that the hansen kit only brings a 4 o.z wax jar unlike this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One technique I learned that helps is if you have multiple spots of the hard wax on a part of your body, you can remove one and then use that same strip of wax that you removed to overlay it on the end of the next spot of wax, using that to assist you in removing it.  The other thing I would recommend is if you&#x27;re a first timer with the hard wax, have some patience.  The first time I used hard wax I wasn&#x27;t too familiar with the right consistency it should be and how dry it should be before pulling it off and so it was a very messy experience.  However, since then, I have gotten much faster and cleaner about it!  Definitely happy about this purchase! :)</li>
    <li> This was my first time waxing let alone waxing at home. I researched information/instructions and read/watched reviews/opinions/experiences before I even considered purchasing anything. This kit is what I ended up buying for many reasons... it includes a warmer (I wouldn&#x27;t even consider doing the microwave option. With the warmer, you can heat it up to the perfect consistency by putting it on high for about 30 minutes, then set it on low and take your time waxing.), it is hard wax (Easy on skin and no need for strips. Put the wax on thick in direction of hair growth, wait for it to cool, press on skin and pull wax off, quickly and close to the skin, in the opposite direction), it includes the pre-oil (put a little on the area before waxing) and post-gel (put on to cool the area after waxing) as well as applicators and it&#x27;s all for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instruction book thoroughly and watch the instructional DVD (which is also included)! Know what you&#x27;re doing before you try it or it&#x27;s not going to go so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing this kit does not include that is recommended in the book and the DVD is the cleansing lotion. You can order it separately online or get similar products for a few bucks in stores. I just gently cleaned the area well before waxing with soap and warm (not hot) water. I would also recommend getting something for care of the area for the weeks after waxing... an exfoliating and moisturizing scrub to help prevent and get rid of ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it painful? Not bad at all if you do it properly. A quick sting and then it&#x27;s fine. I removed everything in the bikini area and it was a bit more painful in the more sensitive areas. You might want a little help with a few strips in the not-so-easy-to-see places. The area was a little red and tender for a day or less. Totally worth it! Definitely beats shaving. Stay hair free and smooth and get it all done in the privacy of your own home, in your own time and for a veryreasonable price. I had plenty of unused wax, oil and gel left for future applications and would not hesitate to use this product again and again!</li>
    <li> I have NEVER waxed, nor had anything waxed in my life.  And yet, I was able to do this the first try without any problems.  You don&#x27;t need anything else, it&#x27;s all in the kit.  And it wasn&#x27;t very painful at all.  I don&#x27;t know what they do in salons, but this wasn&#x27;t bad at all!  Well worth not having to shave constantly.  LOVE IT! (and so does my husband)  :)</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my package, until I opened it. Both the lids on the two small bottles included were open and leaked all over inside the box; completely soaking the manual in oil and leaving the bottles totally empty. Frustrating to have to return for bad packaging. Frustrating to have to wait again for re-order and hesitant to re-order for fear it will happen again.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many waxing products before. This one is the best so far. Not messy unlike other kinds. I should add that I dye my hair, do my nails, and etc; so if you are not used to doing your own mani, pedi, and etc, it is not for you. It was my first time ever doing Brazilian waxing (hey i did it myself even though many people recommend having it done at the salon for the first time) It was great; yes i hurts a little :) If you are not so tolerant to pain, then I would not recommend this product for brazilian. I feel no pain when i use epilator for my arms, legs and arm pits; so you know what kind of tolerance i am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;Love love love it! no way i am going back to shaving (sorry TMI)</li>
    <li> This is a perfect product if you are interested in waxing hair off of your cha-cha in the privacy of your own home. I&#x27;d never gotten a bikini wax in a salon before buying this and I see no reason to go to a professional for waxing now that I have this. The first time I used it I just worked in small sections and got used to the feel of product and everything went great! No anxiety, no disasters, no need to fear. And with the hard wax and pre-epilation oil, it&#x27;s hardly painful at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the great things about this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard wax: this firms up into a plasticcy strip that can be pulled off without the use of a muslin strip. It hardens to a non-sticky consistency, meaning that it does not adhere to your skin, only to the hair that it traps and removes. So, if you drip some onto a very sensitive hairless area (ahem) you did not want to wax, it does not stick there, it comes right off!! It&#x27;s easy to remove the errant drop from floors because unlike regular wax, it hardens to a brittle consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-epilation oil: ALWAYS spread this on beforehand, and spread it everywhere. I&#x27;ve found that it keeps wax from sticking to skin at all. I coat my fingertips in this stuff too and the wax doesn&#x27;t stick to my hands when I pull it off. I looked at the ingredients list on this and it&#x27;s basically just soybean oil, so when I run out of it I imagine I could substitute it with any body-safe oil such as olive oil, argan oil, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warmer: Melts fast, keeps the wax temperature safely warm. I like that the temperature is adjustable. It makes it easier to get right consistency for spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of this kit is about half of what a hard-wax brazillian wax goes for in my overpriced city. I&#x27;ve been using this once every two weeks for the last 6 months and I&#x27;m only HALFWAY through the container of wax that came with the kit. Get this, put on some trashy TV in the background, and wax yourself smooth.</li>
    <li> Ive been going to a professional to do my Brazilian waxing for 2+ years. Although she does a great job, I could no longer justify paying $70 for it. I bought this product and had my husband help me with it. I laughed and cried at the same time (he was scared to help me).  Some areas are more painful, while other areas slightly stings.  My advice is to watch the video first and also lay the wax on thiick, let it harden a bit and rip it away swiftly! My outcome was actually better than what I had expected. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers I was super nervous to get the box, afraid it would be covered in oil, but it came in perfect condition. I watched the dvd first, followed the instructions exactly and was super pleased with the results. Advice:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wear rubber gloves&lt;br /&gt;2. Wait until the wax forms a \\&quot;bulb\\&quot; on the stick when you lift it up. This is KEY and required a balancing act of turning the temp up and down throughout the process, but well worth it. If it runs off like syrup when you lift the stick up, it&#x27;s too hot.&lt;br /&gt;3. Drink ice water or be in a slightly cool room. My skin would get slightly moist from the heat of the wax and it made the wax not adhere to the hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never done hard wax at home, be prepared, it will be SUPER messy until you get the hang of it. I felt like pooh bear covered in bits of honey when I was done the first time. But once I got everything adjusted right it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Quick review....don&#x27;t wait until an important event to try this. It took me two \\&quot;sessions\\&quot; to get it right. Now my strip rips off just like my professional did it. I&#x27;ve done my bikini line, and underarms. It may have been user error but it was stinging in the crevice so that won&#x27;t happen again. I say heat it up on high for a little over an hour, then put it on medium until it thickens a bit...too runny is not good and too thick not good. I did put wax on top of wax to make sure it was thick enough to rip off. Also bring wax all the way up because stopping in a patch is a no no.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works...just takes practice or perhaps watching the video. I admit I went with trial by error because I was spending 60 a month to get waxed and thought...jersey, this can&#x27;t be rocket science.</li>
    <li> This item works great for eyebrows but that was about it.  Tried on my legs and not a single hair came out and it hurt like heck too!  Eyebrows are nice because I know when the tug is coming and it did not seem to bother me as badly but the legs...uggg.  And it comes with no clean up lotion and do NOT go into the shower with any of this stuff on you as you will regtret it for about 3 days.  (this was how long it took for the wax to come off of my legs)</li>
    <li> I got the kit a little while ago, but i&#x27;m just now getting to the review. The product itself is pretty good. It&#x27;s hard wax, so you don&#x27;t need to buy anything extra. I couldn&#x27;t tell you about how well the Pre Epilation Oil works though, because when I opened the kit, the oil was opened and all over everything. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Overall it is a good product to have. It makes waxing easy and affordable. I would recommend this item. It happens to be especially useful when needed for last minute.</li>
    <li> We love this product... just be sure to use plenty of oil, before applying the hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;product arrived on time and was intact. We both, could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I bought just about every at home wax kit available. Every single one of them ended up being messy, painful, and completely ineffective. My legs have very thick dark hair, the sort where you can feel the stubble already coming back by evening after having shaved in the morning. It&#x27;s awful and on top of that I have sensitive skin so no matter what precautions I take I get razor burn pretty regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my point in all this: after finally giving up on all those DIY microwave kits I found this Gigi kit here on amazon for a pretty great price considering those microwave kits that DONT work go for $10-$15 a pop. So I gave it a shot and I am sooo glad I did. It worked beautifully. I know the kit says its for bikini but firstly- I didn&#x27;t want to test it out in so sensitive an area and secondly- I knew that if it worked on my legs it would work anywhere. So I did my legs. I did read the instructions that came with the kit fully and it does recommend Soft Wax for the legs which I will do the next time but the important thing here is it DID work on my legs where every other kit failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a long time ( hour and a half) and yes it was a bit messy (though nothing like the sticky mess the microwave kits caused)  Definitely use a towel under you if doing your legs.  It also took some practice to get the hang of it. But I felt like a pro by the time I finished and I&#x27;m confident that next time I can do it all in half the time. For the first time EVER my legs felt smooth for the entire day and for a good 3 or 4 weeks after. And best of all my skin did not have any negative reaction to the process. There was minor redness immediately after which was expected but nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit it completely worth the price. It really is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Really excited to receive this product and try it out. Unfortunately, like many of the other 1 star reviews the oil leaked everywhere. When we opened up the package, we expected the oil to have burst and the box to be damaged - not the case. The box was in perfect condition, just soaked in oil. The cap to the oil (that has to be push down to open like some shampoos have), was pushed down and open. Not sure how since the box wasn&#x27;t damaged at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I cleaned the oil off my hands I wondered why knowing this was a common problem that they didn&#x27;t take an extra step and plastic wrap the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try and buy from another distributor.</li>
    <li> As an Aesthetician I have experience using both soft and hard waxes. In all fairness I have been out of the business for almost 7 years and had more experience with soft/creme waxes but hard wax is much more effective in my opinion. I successfully waxed my underarms (hurt like hell if you are new to waxing your underarms) The first strip was SO painful but once I got the technique (doing it on yourself) it was less painful. I waxed my underarms that normally grow pretty thick almost a week and half ago and I&#x27;m just now starting to see hair grow back but it&#x27;s SO much thinner. Hard wax is less messy in my opinion and you don&#x27;t have to deal with muslim strips which is nice. Use the pre-epilation oil that comes with it, and aloe or the cooling gel in this kit works well too. Don&#x27;t be surprised if you bleed a little bit. I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try my bikini area but I&#x27;m expecting it to be a similar experience since the hair is equally as coarse. I have also used this on my face (brows and lip) and works well even on my sensitive skin. I suggest watching the short video (though it&#x27;s a bit graphic I will warn you, it&#x27;s shows a full Brazilian wax job) it helps you understand how to make sure you get enough wax on the stick and understand what the thickness/texture of the wax should look like. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, i love it.It is easy to use. Maybe now i won&#x27;t use other product for depilation. I recommend 100%</li>
    <li> I have been visiting this product on Amazon for awhile trying to decide if I wanted to go there.  I finally did and am so happy I did!  It&#x27;s a great product!  It came packaged new, not damaged or missing anything.  The instruction manual was super informative and the DVD extremely helpful........it&#x27;s a DVD made for professionals learning to Brazilian and I loved that perspective.  Waxing hurts but it gets better and easier. Probably easier for those who have gotten them done professionally before.  If I have never gotten it done before, trying to do it myself would most likely have been a  bit traumatic.  Very happy with this purchase &amp; would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This wax really grabs thick hairs and rips them out with little discomfort.  It does not work so well on thin hair(eyebrows) but it is not labeled for that so I can&#x27;t be upset.  Really wish it did because it was so easy to use, especially when reading some of the very helpful how-to reviews on here.</li>
    <li> Package arrived in tact with all items.  This wax system is so easy to use!  Some waxes with really test your flexibility, but with patience and practice it gets easier.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to do myself at home, rather than paying $50+ a session at a salon.</li>
    <li> Great product . . . a little tricky if it is the first time, would recommend orderring wax remover too</li>
    <li> I love this product. And i am gonna continue to buy gigi hard wax. I think this product is the best for brazilian waxing and i have tryed many other that have not been good at all. So GIGI thums up ;)</li>
    <li> Nice product. Wasnt used to hard wax but the product worked well. Just need more practice. The warmer is pretty neat.</li>
    <li> If you want to DIY wax this is the way to go. Yes, it still hurts. But in my opinion not as much as otherwise. I use the pre-epilation stuff and take Advil before hand.</li>
    <li> This product arrived precisely when they said it would.  It works wonderfully as a cheap alternative to salon waxing.  I&#x27;ve had no bruising or any negative reaction to this product.  It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I bought this in January 2011 (p.s. it was $48 on amazon back then), and it&#x27;s been about 8 months &amp; I have used it almost every month.  When I first got it, it made quite a bit of mess and it took me a good 2+ hours.  Nowadays I am much more comfortable using it, and I can now do it under an hour :)    The warmer is really easy to use, just plug in and turn on.  If you&#x27;re using the hard wax, it will take about 20 minutes to heat up to the perfect temperature, however I found using the normal wax (like the light pink one), will take anywhere from 10-15 minutes. If you want to do the brazilian wax, you gotta use the hard wax, I tried using the pink one like they do in the salons, but it was REALLY messy doing it by myself.      Aside from the product itself, I found waxing the front of my pubic area the most painful, which is normal since that&#x27;s the most sensitive area.  As for the \\&quot;inside\\&quot;, it&#x27;s not painful but rather difficult to see if you aren&#x27;t too flexible, so I gotta use a big mirror. This product is good, but definitely takes some practice.  I want to do laser removal in the future, so this is helping me save money from the salons!    Tips:  -Wear gloves so the wax doesn&#x27;t get all over your hands, although hard wax comes off easily you&#x27;re bound to get some on yr hands during the process.  -The regular wax (like the light pink one), is easy to use for the bikini, underarms, and legs, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the Brazilian wax because it gets messy in large amounts.  - Wear SOCKS! the first time I used it, I spilled a lot on the floor. :( and it got on my feet. :(  - Put old towels or newspapers on the floor! (see above) Hope it helps!</li>
    <li> The title says it all, this product works but it hurts. I should mention that as a guy I have thicker hair and I had never waxed before so the hair on my arms and torso had not been thinned out. From what I hear from other waxers it gets easier.</li>
    <li> To be honest I was expecting more of this product but I am pretty satisfied with what I git and considering the price I paid. The wax works well for small areas. I used the wax on my face and it worked the best out of any other place I tried it. using this kind of hard wax on your legs is pointless and messy and in terms of the bikini it worked well but hair should be short or it&#x27;s much harder to use.</li>
    <li> worked well and is a good wax product. However the wax warmer broke the second time i used it. dissapointing to say the least. hopefully i can get it replaced.</li>
    <li> I love this kit! It arrived promptly and was packaged with care. The directions and dvd were so helpful and the product actually works so well. I wish I had gotten this kit sooner.</li>
    <li> So I am very happy that I have this wax machine, very handy and that I can now wear sleeveless shirts without freaking out about crazy hair growth. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> You should be a professional to use this product. For me it was a mess...It took me so many days to get rid of wax drops from floor....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I thought it was worth a try for how much I am spending on waxing every month. It was not worth it! It made a huge mess. I keep finding bits of wax on my floor, cabinets, bathrobe, body even though I used an old sheet underneath me. It took me forever and I did not get all the hair off. It was a disaster. I will say that it wasn&#x27;t painful though! But, definitely not worth the inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I gave the GIGI Brazilian waxing kit to my daughter and she just loves it. Easy to use with great results.</li>
    <li> This Kit is awesome ~  almost painless!!!  I&#x27;ve already done a Brazilian wax and waxed my underarms, in the less than the week that i&#x27;ve owned it :D I&#x27;m not going to stick to my tips and tricks rather than revisit some of the amazing reviews that are already here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never gone to  a salon for waxing, I&#x27;m always scared i&#x27;ll have a reaction to the chemicals.  So my method of choice (until purchasing this system) was Nair/Veet or shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;ve tried cold wax strips, microwave waxes etc, but they all left me more bloody and bruised than hair free.  This product is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried that has worked and it worked well.  I&#x27;m italian and the hair i waxed is pretty course, and thick.  This kit took it out pretty painlessly.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the amazing results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRAZILIAN:  this took me like 3.5 hours and i did not do the back.  Mainly because i had been doing this for 3 hours and i had stuff to do.  That being said, I removed about 95% of the hair, and areas like the front, and my bikini line are perfectly smooth.  I think the main reason was wax was too warm (see below for more info).  I&#x27;m sure then next time it will be way faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNDERARMS: This took me a bit less than an hour- again see below.  However, I got rid of about 99% of the hair, and the hair i did miss was easily plucked right out.  (I did need hubbie for this on a couple of pulls).  However the next day, my underarms are smooth and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A FEW UPDATES TO OTHER POSTERS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  They must have updated the video (as of Aug 1) because it was only on the hard wax and not other types as other reviewers said.  The video was a nice bonus in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The kit includes 1 collar to help keep your warmer clean.  You can purchase a set of 50 for $6 well worth it.  There was NO clean up on the warmer when i was done.  Plus each collar can be used more than once if you&#x27;re neat.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Test the wax on the inside of your wrist before putting on your bits.&lt;br /&gt;4.  I had no problems with the oil or the gel spilling in the container.&lt;br /&gt;5.  My kit does NOT look like the one in the photo.  I don&#x27;t know if they recently re-did packaging.  Doesn&#x27;t really matter i guess, my box &amp; products look different but are as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY STEPS TO DO WAXING&lt;br /&gt;1.  lay down garbage bag under wax warmer and working surface on the bathroom counter, an old sheet on floor &amp; a small bag to put used wax in after.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Add collar to the wax pot, set in warmer and turn on&lt;br /&gt;3.  Take Advil&lt;br /&gt;4.  Shower &amp; exfoliate (I used Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash- its for the face, but it&#x27;s gentile and I love it).&lt;br /&gt;5.  Flip the hard solid wax that&#x27;s still in the center of the pot&lt;br /&gt;6.  Add Pre-Epilating Oil (DON&#x27;T FORGET THE OIL IT HURTS 1000 times more if you don&#x27;t remember the oil)&lt;br /&gt;7.  Start waxing&lt;br /&gt;8.  Use olive oil to remove any wax residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, i think the hardest thing in the whole process is figuring out what temperature is the right consistency for the wax.  I&#x27;ve done two waxes with it (Brazilian and under arms) and still don&#x27;t think i have it quite right.  I wax wouldn&#x27;t be sticky to the touch on top but then would have the consistency of gum on shoe (best i can think of to describe it).  I ended up with both waxes getting an ice cube, and putting it in a plastic bag and rubbing it over the wax strip.  It worked -- YAY!!! Seems counterintuitive but i think maybe i am still having the wax too hot.  One reviewer said waiting for the wax to cool was hardest part, and boy oh boy is she right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those that complained the &amp;#34;Kit doesn&#x27;t come with strips to remove the wax&amp;#34;, really aren&#x27;t giving the product a fair shake.  You don&#x27;t need strips.  That being said, I can understand why they want them.  For me, the wax never seemed to get to that perfect not sticky state.  Therefore, when i was doing my second underarm i had an idea.  i took aused bit of wax and kinda made a wax strip out of it.  Then i&#x27;d cover the spot to be waxed with fresh wax from the pot, then put the wax strip over the hotter wax cooling on my skin.  I then rubbed the strip a little bit, so the wax strip sort of melts into the fresh wax i just applied.  Then RIIIIPPPPPPP!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That seemed to give me the best result.  It allowed me to really get at the hair with the wax, and the &#x27;wax strip&#x27; i added on top was too cool to stick to skin at all, but added enough strength the wax underneath so everything came out nice and clean.  I actually can&#x27;t wait to try this technique during a brazilian, there were a few spots I couldn&#x27;t get and i think this would be perfect! As an added bonus, because you are re-using wax you need less &#x27;fresh wax&#x27; to make the thick hard wax strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I didn&#x27;t find this wax messy (some of the reviewers had me scared).  i spilled a little bit on my granite counter, and it cleaned right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER THOUGHTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  After Wax Cooling Gel (included in the kit)- stung.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to but I&#x27;ve ordered 100% aloe to use next time.&lt;br /&gt;2.  GiGi Wax Off Wax Remover (purchased separately)- this stung too, didn&#x27;t do a great job of cleaning the wax off and it stinks like cheap lotion.  I just used olive oil.  .  Save your money.  Do NOT purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;3.  GiGi Clean Collars 14 oz.- You get one free one in the kit.  You&#x27;ll want to purchase this (50 collars for $6).  If you figure 3 waxes per collar that $6 will last a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Years later:&lt;br /&gt;I still would have purchased this kit knowing all of this (it was a great starter kit) and gives you everything you need to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost 4 years later and the pot still works.  However something happened.  After about two years, temperature control stopped working.  It has like two settings now - off and molten lava.  I kept it to heat wax if I wanted to do a soft and hard wax at the same time.  On a side note, believe it or not, I still have the original bottle of Pre-Epilating Oil and use it since you only need a couple drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing the Satin Smooth Professional Single Wax Warmer Quick - SSW09C as a replacement when my gigi stopped working correctly.  It has a bit more temperature control (10 settings verses the few with this one).  Gigi and Satin smooth take the same size pots so there&#x27;s not concern if you want to try a different wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as waxes go, I tried everything (gigi, the blue one, etc etc) and these are my two favorites.  They both fit in both the Gigi and the Satin smooth pots):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * Satin Smooth Tea Tree Wax 14 oz. - Soft wax for legs (you need strips and sticks when using this)&lt;br /&gt;  * Satin Smooth Calendula Gold Wax - hard wax for brazilians, underarms face etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as time, using the Satin Smooth pot and wax to do a full brazilian (stem to stern so to speak), it takes about an hour including setup.  It&#x27;s not so much the waxing but repositioning my body in contorted yoga positions to get &#x27;stuff&#x27;.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt unless I let things grow in too much.  Legs take a bit longer using the soft wax because its messier.  If i was just doing bikini, face or underarms - that&#x27;s stupid quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t waxed before or in a while, I recommend you go and get things done professionally then maintain monthly with waxing - less hair &#x3D; less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For clean up I still use Olive oil and coconut oil.  I have not reaction and I feel better about it since it&#x27;s less chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Avoid ingrown hairs use:&lt;br /&gt;  *  PFB Vanish + Chromabright  (brazilian area, underarms, face).  This works well and I&#x27;ve bought it several times.  It&#x27;s a bit drying so i couldn&#x27;t use on  my legs&lt;br /&gt;  *  Glytone Body Lotion - I use this on my legs and if I don&#x27;t do the PFB Vanish on the rest of waxed areas I just started using it in the past few weeks but have been very impressed.  It&#x27;s an expensive lotion but a little goes a long long way.  It&#x27;s rather thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Whatever you do don&#x27;t mix PFB and Glytone- it burns! eep)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve linked below to things I buy regularly.

    <li> This is honestly a great kit. I bought it for home use. Its so easy to use, and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for weeks. The pain is medium.  I will never go back to shaving again! The only problems I have are the wax that sticks all over the place for me and that sometimes I have to go over the same spot twice. Make sure the hair is grown out.</li>
    <li> The seller didn&#x27;t bother to put extra tape on the oils in the box before sending it to amazon to ship. The oils spilled everywhere, ruined manuals, all over cd, and the unit, however i gave it two stars to give the product line GIGI props for their wax, pretty good, but be careful you can burn yourself if you dont do it right</li>
    <li> Hi, so a couple of weeks ago I went to target and bought the sally hansen wax kit. it says the wax melt in 25 minutes. well 2 1/2 hours later, the wax is hard as rock, the warmer was hot, but i guess not hot enough, after trying it again the same problem, so i return it. i read many reviews of this gigi wax, and they were pretty good, so i gave it a try. and let me tell you, in about 30 minutes, you can see the wax melting, it worked perfectly, did not leave any residue on my skin, however i could not just wax with the applicator, so i used some clothes strip i had around. if you are used to wax, is not big deal, did not hurt, is fast, i recommend it, i just wish it come with clothes strip, now i have to find more. good luck</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what they use in the salons except you pay a one time price and u get to use as often you&#x27;d like and whenever you want.</li>
    <li> I received this waxing kit just over a month ago after having been to the salon several times for brazilian waxing at $60 +tip per visit.  The warmer kit has more than paid for itself already.  I turned the warmer on a few minutes before getting in the shower and by the time I was done, dried off and had prepped my skin the wax was ready to go (about 30-45 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by doing just my underarms (with a little help from my boyfriend) since I did not need to wax my bikini area yet, and it removed 95% of the hair in the first pull.  And it didn&#x27;t really hurt at all.  I did use the pre-epilation oil and I think that probably made a big difference.  Also, almost a month later and I only have a few very fine hairs growing in, instead of the daily dark stubble from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week later I ventured south and did my bikini area myself, again a little messy since I don&#x27;t have the hang of it completely, but it worked just as well as going to the salon and hurt WAY less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the legs! I decided after doing my underarms that I would see how it worked on my legs since I am a bit ocd and have to shave every day to avoid that stubbly feeling.  Managed to make it through 3 weeks of no shaving so the hair would be long enough and started on my legs.  It did take me a while, almost 2 hours, but I got 90% of the hair using the hard wax.  I am guessing that this will get quicker as I get used to the process of doing it myself. And 2 weeks later I am just starting to get a little fine hair growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the creme wax and muslin strips and I am waiting for that to arrive so I can see if that is easier to manage on my legs than the hard wax, but I will continue to use the hard wax for my underarms and bikini area as that works great.</li>
    <li> I am a DIY kind of gal.  I prefer not to pay for something I can easily do myself.  To prepare myself to use the hot wax hair removal method, I watched multiple You-Tube videos. (I highly recommend this if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing.)  I read the directions, had everything I needed and was excited to do this myself at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a terrible mess.  One drop of the hot wax hit my bathroom rug and it was ruined.  (Put down an old towel or sheet)  I got it on my hands (tried using gloves but they tore pretty quickly).  To sum up, it was a sticky mess with less than acceptable results.  I had more hair left than was pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to accept responsibility for the results.  I obviously was not prepared or trained to do this.  I believe the actual quality of the product is fine, it was operator error.  I think if I gave it a few more tries, it would work out.  I&#x27;m just not that interested in working through my learning curve.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending all this money waxing at the salon, finally saw this here and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but it is time consuming, and hurts like hell to do it myself. Takes me abt 2 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does the job, the oil really helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone else, and they seem to enjoy it very much. Only wish it came with waxing pads, but that is no issue considering how much comes with this kit at the price.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my wife, it works very well, a bit messy but fun fun fun. . . .</li>
    <li> NOT FOR BEGINNERS. I had a woman hard-wax me in a salon, it hurt so little and looked so easy! I had a very hard time with it on my own, haha. I&#x27;ll be sticking to soft wax.</li>
    <li> The professional wax drys slower, so it&#x27;s less painful to remove. It takes off almost all of the hair so there isn&#x27;t much tweezing to do, plus I got it for less than the cost of a single professional waxing. My biggest recommendation regarding this product is to apply plenty of baby powder immediately before spreading the wax, it helps to prevent the wax from sticking to your skin.</li>
    <li> I would definetly recommend this product to any woman who wants to wax, this bundle is such a good deal, as the heater is around 50 dollars alone and the wax is 18. I tried some &amp;#34;Nads&amp;#34; wax before that you microwave and i couldnt finish because it hurt too much and the wax got cold too fast. Gigi wax is very easy to use and having the melter is awesome. makes everything so much easier. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Everything in the packaging is good quality however I got an allergic reaction and I am not allergic to anything else, ever.</li>
    <li> Just like that I&#x27;m completely capable of doing things I was paying A LOT of money for. These products are great, extremely informative &amp; very easy to use. I really love this product</li>
    <li> Ok first of all the package came alot sooner then it was so pose to come the product it self works really great it dose not stick to your skin at all that&#x27;s a plus for me and the cd it comes with helps you a lot too I love this product</li>
    <li> Was worth the switch from Sally Hansen&#x27;s hard wax. Definitely less painful and cleaner of a process. That said, the wax warmer is a monstrosity (almost R2D2 sized) and the Sally Hansen kit is a bit more petite (easier to store and travel with).</li>
    <li> I bought this kit as a gift for my significant other. She&#x27;s very happy with the quality of the warmer as well as the included hard wax, but was disappointed that the warmer didn&#x27;t come with cloth strips. You don&#x27;t *technically* need them, but some people still prefer using an extra cloth layer. (The GiGi-brand strips can be ordered separately via Amazon, though.) The wax refills are reasonably priced compared to using a service, and the one delivered by Amazon appears to be the same quality product as the one included with the kit. Go for it!</li>
    <li> Received item as described.. no problem with leaky bottles as previous reviewers did. I do recommend that you use the pre-wax oil, didn&#x27;t in areas and ended up a bit rashy in those areas only. Love the results, lasted over 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> I love this product, its easy to use and its safe. The result are amazing and I am saving money by doing my own wax job at home</li>
    <li> I have gotten my eyebrows and lip waxed a few times but never had the courage to get a bikini, let alone a Brazilian, wax from the salon.  Shaving is a pain and the stubble that comes shortly after is even worse.  Very irritating.  I was fed up with this so I finally ordered this kit after reading the reviews.  I am so happy I did!  Wow.  Let me tell you something...&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived at the door I grabbed it and immediately tore it open expecting a leaking bottle of pre-epilation oil as many had complained about.  To my surprise, my bottle was fine and everything else was too.  Yippee!  I popped in the DVD and watched.  The DVD is helpful, but it shows a technician waxing a customer.  I was hoping more for it to show someone doing it themselves so that I could understand exactly what I was getting myself into.  The DVD was very professional and informative. While watching the DVD I heated the wax on high for about 15 minutes.  I then quickly showered and turned the wax on low.  It did not look very melted at all, only the outer margins were melted.  I thought maybe I should stir it instead of waiting any longer and that is exactly what needed to be done.  One I flipped the hard wax in the center over and mixed it all together I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;I put a towel on my floor and started with my inner thigh.  I applied a drop of the oil, and a semi-thick strip of wax to my leg in the direction of the hair growth, let it dry for a minute, and ripped it in the opposite direction of my hair growth while holding my skin taut.  Voila!  Yes, it hurt for a second, but I expected that.  It was nothing unbearable (and I have never gotten this done before).  Once I had both leg areas waxed I moved inward and then downward.  That hurt a little more because the hair seemed to be thicker and coarser down there.  Make sure your hair is 1/4 to 1/2 inch long like it says.  There were a few times toward the end, and toward the more sensitive areas that I thought I could just not take this anymore.  I walked away, but came back in a few minutes to finish up.  Then I applied the cooling gel and I was done!&lt;br /&gt;This wax REALLY got off most, if not all of the hair.  My skin is smooth and completely hair free now and I don&#x27;t expect any hair growth for a few weeks so I am very excited!  Here are a few tips from my experience:&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure you leave a little tab of wax to pull from on an area that has NO hair.  This can be tricky and if doing a Brazilian you might need to start at bottom and work your way up since you have to pull in direction of hair growth (assuming your hair grows down).&lt;br /&gt;-Do not forget the pre-epilation oil.  It makes it much easier to remove the wax.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t use too much wax at a time.  My friend did this and ended up with something glued together.  Hmm.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure you put a pretty thick layer of wax and wait for it dry.  This is tricky because it is kind of tacky. You don&#x27;t want it to pull like gum when you pull it off, but you don&#x27;t want it to be completely hard either. Timing is everything.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly feel that if I could do this to myself, anyone can!  It took about an hour to get it all done because I was putting on a strip, letting it dry, and pulling it off...one by one.  In time I am sure I will get better at this and it will take less time to do.  No burns, no blood, a little pain...but totally worth it.  For beauty we must suffer...a little that is!  Did I mention the GREAT price as well?ust not take this anymore.  I walked away, but came back in a few minutes to finish up.

    <li> After getting some waxing done with hard wax, I was hooked, but couldn&#x27;t afford to keep going to the salon. I did quite a bit of research and decided to try the Gigi system after all of the rave reviews. I quickly received the kit, read through the manual, and watched the video. It&#x27;s an easy system to use. However, the wax itself did MAJOR damage. Hard waxes are not supposed to adhere to skin, only to the hair. This wax tore of chunks of skin, left me lightly bleeding in spots, and extremely inflamed. I figured the inflammation would go down as I&#x27;ve been waxed before. However, it&#x27;s been 5 days, and my bikini area is still quite inflamed and raw. I can&#x27;t recommend this at all. Thankfully getting a refund...now to just get my skin to heal!</li>
    <li> I used to live in Brazil and get my bikini waxed every few weeks, so I thought I have seen it so often I should be able to do it myself. a few patches worked perfectly with no pain, of course I experimented first on an area without hair, etc. But then I ended up in a big mess with not being able to get a patch off whatever I did unless I take the skin off!!! I have still given it 3 stars because I think it is not so much about the wax but about training. The only difference that I see compared to what was used in Brazil is that this wax dries slower and that is a little bit of a pest. So I suggest if you really want to DIY it, practice a lot before you actually move on to the bikini area.</li>
    <li> First time buying whole kit such as this one. I love the wax, does a great job. For this price, I will def purchase in the future. Highly reccomand.</li>
    <li> I have not used my wax system yet. The package was packed poorly. The small container containing the oil was completely empty and leaked on everything in the box. My instruction manual is literally transparent due to it soaking up the oil. The other product had the lid completely off but since the product was a gel, I dont think any of it leaked. BOOOOOOOO on the packaging. I hope the product works better!!</li>
    <li> This review is based on my personal experience, being a first-time waxer. My mother in-law owns her own salon, but I would never have her do my wax so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with everything you need right up front to do your own self-wax job at home. I would add (3) items to the order if you buy this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing you should add is some type of after wax lotion like Tend Skin or No Bump from GiGi. The Tend Skin is expensive, and you can also make your own solution with alcohol and aspirin, as others have said, should you choose. I chose No Bump this time, but will make my own next time. The 4oz No Bump will last you a very long time though. I would also buy an extra pack of collars with this order. Buy these (2) extra things at a minimal cost and you will not need to purchase anything for a long time (if you are only waxing small areas). Lastly, have a really good pair of tweezers handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took about an hour to only wax my private area the first time. Knowing what to so now, I could easily do it in half the time or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set the heat on the warmer to high for about 30-45 minutes and then set it to full low after it is melted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed on my first wax is that my skin is particularly sensitive so I had tiny blood spots from the hair follicles after pulling the wax off. This can be expected depending on your skin. Wipe carefully with a damp cloth and keep waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another technique I found helpful was to make strips of wax about 1 inch wide and maybe up to 3 inches long. Spread the wax over the hair against the growth direction and spread beyond the hair slightly. Wait for the wax to no longer be tacky to the touch, flick up the end passed the hair, get a good grip on it and yank as fast as you can (yank against the growth direction). I perfer to rip it all off in one swipe...this hurts less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continue until you are free of whatever hair you wanted to remove. Tweezing right after you pull the wax also helps, because the pores are still open from the heat and the hair pulls out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean with the post-wax oil or use baby oil to clean up leftover wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the No Bump directly after waxing and it stung badly, but I am unsure how long to wait before applying so try it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your time and prepare. You should do fine without spending $50 for a pro to do it. This whole kit costs less than that already. With the few extras I mentioned, it will be right at the same cost as a single wax visit to a pro.l the wax also helps, because the pores are still open from the heat and the hair pulls out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean with the post-wax oil or use baby oil to clean up leftover wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the No Bump directly after waxing and it stung badly, but I am unsure how long to wait before applying so try it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your time and prepare.

    <li> I understand that my wife might be a one-off, but since trying this system last weekend, she has been bedridden for 4 days with a horrendous skin rash covering her lower abdomen and pubic area.  She cannot sleep, she is miserable, and we have tried everything short of steroid creams, benedryl, cold packs, hydro cortisone creams and lots of rest, but she is in hell.  She has been waxing at the Four Seasons for years without issue.  If your skin is at all sensitive, or if you have a history of histamine reactions, be very careful selecting this product.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000CCSXFU GiGi Professional Brazilian Waxing Kit]]</li>
    <li> The product was great except for the oil bottle was opened and leaked all over everything. Took a great deal of time to clean it all up and then there was no oil to use.</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive my package on time. It was a great starter kit! Really easy to use, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This waxing kit was so easy to use.  I&#x27;ve never used hard wax before so I was a bit nervous.  The pre-epi oil did a great job of making this process almost pain free.  I read the most helpful reviews to get helpful tips in making this a success.  I will definitely be using this waxing kit on a regular basis!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few mounth ago, good quality of wax, the machine takes a while to warm up but the takes the heat just fine.</li>
    <li> After paying $75 a visit for a Sphinx...I finally got up the courage to try this KIT for myself.  I was thinking...how hard could it be lol...not hard at all.  This KIT is very convenient...I&#x27;ve finally mastered the technique...instead of letting the wax get completely stiff when applied...I let it get tacky just enough and then rip it off...works like a charm each time.  Ladies remember to trim-trim-trim, take a hot shower before hand and remember to exfoliate after the fact.  As you continue to get waxed...you find the hair growing back finer and easier to pull out.  I&#x27;m in love with hard wax and this waxing kit.  My bank account can&#x27;t thank me enough &#x3D;-)</li>
    <li> I have used other wax kits in the past. I was getting sick of having to run to the kitchen periodically to re-warm the wax. I decided to get the warmer and I love it. The wax stays the correct temperature throughout the whole procedure. I also found the product to be much easier in my skin than others I have used. There is less redness afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have never given myself a brazilian wax but this product made it so easy. I could not have been happier with the results and it will end up costing less then repeat salon visits.     Yes, it was messy as I had no idea what I was doing and it took a long time but after some practice I know it will get much easier. The wax took longer to heat than I expected but no big deal.     Most importantly, it did not hurt like a salon visit. There was almost no pain and I could not believe it. I have never used hard wax before so maybe that is just a plus of the wax itself. Great stuff!     Follow the directions for best use.</li>
    <li> I was not happy about the machine at all. I had to heat the wax myself since the machine is taking long time around 2 hrs. I did not like the applicators as they are not applicable except the bigger one. In regards to the wax, I was unable to use it because it was sticking on my limbs and did not go easily, and remain on my legs and arms for days!. I am totally disappointed about it and feel bad since I am unable to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after reading the reviews. But if anybody have lots of time and money then they can buy this.&lt;br /&gt;1.The wax will take close to 2 hours to melt.&lt;br /&gt;2. The hair will not come off properly still you have to use tweezer or razor.&lt;br /&gt;3. It took nearly 1 hour for me to shave a single hand, I am not new to waxing I am doing it since 15 years.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and comes with a great instructional DVD. Doesn&#x27;t get overly hot, seems pretty safe, takes forever to melt the wax though.</li>
    <li> I have never waxed with a hard wax before.  After reading the reviews I thought a novice like myself could give it a shot.  Well, I did it (bikini) and it worked.  It was super painful, but if you can get the wax to the right temp and make it thick enough, every last hair comes out.  I will attempt more than a basic bikini wax next time - I just needed to know if I could stand the pain/heat and if the hair would come completely out before I did any more!  I think I can.  Watch the DVD and read reviews - they really help with tips for beginners!  (Huge thanks to the other reviewers!!)  My tip is to use enough of the oil - it will keep the wax from sticking to your skin.</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviews, my package arrived with the pre-epilation oil spilled and the bottle totally empty; the manual is covered in oil and is now tranparent.  The lid to the warmer was also cracked but since I am going to be the only one using it, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for a new kit.  I ended up going to Sally Beauty to buy another bottle of pre-epilation oil and saw that they sell everything that came in the kit for about the same price.  If I could do it over again, I would have purchased everything there.  One would think with all the problems with the packaging, that either the company selling this, GiGi, or Amazon would do something to fix this.  I guess it is a sign of the times though where all they want is your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did ok with using this for the first time.  The directions and DVD were helpful.  Since it was my first time ever doing this, it took me a long time and I found it to be extremely painful.  I thought I had a high tolerance for pain...I had three kids naturally but I guess this is something I need to get used to.  I was happy with the results, again for my first time.  I don&#x27;t think I could compare to a salon but I&#x27;ll work on it.</li>
    <li> The wax is of poor quality. It becomes brittle &amp; breaks if it is on the skin a second too long. The oil does little to help remove the wax. I did like the instructional DVD but never again will I ever purchase a Gigi product...</li>
    <li> This product is great, the wax did take a little time to heat up and it took me a bit longer to learn how to use it properly once that was accomplished .... WOW, I will be a lifetime buyer.</li>
    <li> I have never done my own waxing until I bought my kit about 2 months ago. The DVD was helpful and instructions were easy to follow. The wax is great and leaves your skin baby soft. It takes a few strips to learn how long to keep the wax on but you should get the hang of it pretty quick. Baby oil works great to remove wax that has been set for too long or residue wax (if there&#x27;s any). Will never use another kind of wax!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I bought this since we were going on a cruise. Unfortunately I have hair on my back, so I usually shave before hitting the beach or pool. But I wanted something that lasted longer. My girlfriend wanted something for her bikini line so we went with this. No strips are needed as you just put wax directly on the skin. It worked well (when it worked) and our hair was gone, or at least mine for weeks. The problem was you would pull the wax off and small pieces of wax would be left on your skin. Then you were stuck picking it off your body, on one to two occasions this resulting in ripping off my skin and my girlfriends and leaving small sores and red spots. Other than this huge flaw, the wax worked very well and very painfully. It sure hurts but it does work, and if your not careful you will lose some skin!!</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for. Delivery was quick, the heater works great, the hard wax is much less painless than using the one with the strips. The only caveat is that it takes a couple minutes to dry, so if you&#x27;re in a hurry this is not for you. I use it for my underarms, bikini area and sometimes face and eyebrows, and it works like a charm. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product came 2 days before it was scheduled and it works! My advise would be to make sure you put enough wax on the waxing area so that you&#x27;re able to grab it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waxed my underarms and put the wax on too thin. I couldn&#x27;t grab the wax and I had quite a bit of wax left under my arm. I had to put another 2 layers of wax on. It eventually came off, but it was painful. I did the other side perfectly... no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy!</li>
    <li> I have been visiting salon&#x27;s regularly for waxing. but it was becoming more and more expensive. I bought this product and it has helped me a lot. I can do waxing myself at home. I place the wax metal container directly in the wax warmer. Because of this my warmer does not even become messy. I am very happy to find this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first wax warmer/kit and I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier. I am an esthetician who has become addicted to waxing and naturally for christmas I had to get this. I used it on Christmas day along with the wax and must say it did the job extremely well.It kept the wax at a consistent heat it heated quickly and before you know it I was done with 14oz tin and was online ordering more. I used the pre-epilating oil as a post waxing residue remover and it works just fine (cleansed with a little witch hazel before beginning) and then I immediatly follow with the cooling gel which really does the trick. I was left perfectly soft and smooth. I am very pleased with this kit and I will be using it often I really hope it has some good lasting power because it will be put to the test :p</li>
    <li> This wax is amazing!  I was so impressed at the ease and how pain free it was when using.  Wish I had known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> I got my first Brazilian wax at the salon a couple months ago.  It was great, felt wonderful, clean.  I was addicted.  What I wasn&#x27;t addicted to was the price.  $75, plus tip?  Gas to get over there, and incidentals, you are looking at almost $100 to get a wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the GiGi waxing kit for $30. I was skeptical, because of my amateur waxing status.  But after I finished, I knew I made the right choice.  Beautiful Brazillian for a 1/3 of the cost - and I have plenty of wax left over for at least two more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;- Hard wax is much less irritating to the skin than soft.  Not need for strips, just pulls off so nicely&lt;br /&gt;- So much cheaper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s messy!  Bits of wax get everywhere.  I suppose this will improve with skill, but use an old towel or article of clothing under you.&lt;br /&gt;- Getting the wax even enough so it peels off nicely is a bit of an art.  You&#x27;ll get the hang of it, but your first time will be tricky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it necessary to point that you may notice I say nothing about pain.  Well, my vote doesn&#x27;t count.  I am a paraplegic and can&#x27;t feel anything below my waist.  So of course this was painless (eat your heart out ladies!)</li>
    <li> great deal! excellent wax pot for professional service at a super good price, and great instructions....don&#x27;t pass on this! very good buy!</li>
    <li> This is the best wax warmer ever! It works awesome. I haven&#x27;t had any problems and it keeps the wax at nice temperatures with the 3 settings.</li>
    <li> I usually use the premade wax strips but I thought I wanted to try something different.  Keep in mind that you do not strips for this wax (I did not know this and wasted money on a pack).  It comes off very easy, is not very messy, and doesn&#x27;t hurt TOOO bad (of course it still hurts a little).  Definitely like it better than the pre wax strips.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not pain at all and just perfect! The first liquid to put on your skin before waxing works very well. It help the hot wax just be stick on the hair, not your skin, so it is easy to take off the hair out of you body without suffer. I love all of them, GiGi!!!</li>
    <li> I love LOVE this product!  It works just like it says it will, plus, Amazon has it at the best price.  The instructions are thorough and easy to understand.  I do recommend using newspaper to keep your floor/carpet clean.  I also suggest you use the \\&quot;oil\\&quot; that is provided before waxing.  Strange, I know, to oil up before waxing, but it does keep it from sticking to your skin but at the same time allows for effect hair removal.  Save yourself the money and buy this kit.  Read the other reviews for tips (heat times to get the right stickiness, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve used it twice and still haven&#x27;t made a dent!!! Also, this is the least painful (and thriftiest) way to do it!</li>
    <li> I ordered what was in the photo. I did not get it. What I got was already opened. There was oil all over everything! ruining instructions and CD i will never order from here again. AWFUL!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting full Brazilians for years - living in SoCal for so long its sort of a requirement. Since this is so common there it is inexpensive to get it done. Boy was I in for a rude awakening when I moved to D.C. The women must just stay hairy here because a Brazilian will set you back upwards of $65 and that&#x27;s without the butt strip! YOUCH! I found very few places that used the hard wax I preferred - the wax with strips leaving me with major ingrown hair. In desperation I turned to amazon to see if there was such a thing as at home waxing. Enter this GiGi kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First - my kit came complete and everything worked. No broken parts, spilled bottles, etc. All good. It was easy to set up - but did take much longer to get the wax hot than it said (took me almost an hour). Once it got hot I put it on Low for 15 minutes and was ready to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second - this stuff is MESSY. Very very messy - at least when doing a Brazilian by yourself. While some areas were very simple others were nearly impossible - and clumps of hair were the most difficult to get effectively - especially as the journey took me further down and under. It took 1/2 the container to do a full Brazilian including the butt strip part (and surrounding area). Unfortunately this wax sticks something terrible. About mid way through I switched from the oil provided to baby powder (which is what my wax lady uses) and that was markedly better. Still the under area was a real bear to do. The heat level of the warmer was just right and I had no issues. No ingrowns that I can see - and very smooth areas after wax. In terms of pain I&#x27;m a masochist so it didn&#x27;t bother me much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third - my lessons learned. Make sure you hold the skin taut - it just doesn&#x27;t work if you don&#x27;t. Do put the wax on in the direction of hair but NEVER stop wax in a group of hair...you will be sorry. Try talcum or baby power instead of the oil if that doesn&#x27;t work as well as you want. Put a big towel out you don&#x27;t care about as it&#x27;s gonna get wrecked. WEAR GLOVES - you will thank me later. Use smaller sticks in areas you cannot see - better to do smaller bits at a time than big globs that get stuck. Don&#x27;t wait too long to pull it off or it glops up and you cannot get it off. Use the cooling gel after - It really did help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! Overall I am VERY happy with this kit. I am saving about $65-100 a visit using this even with the warmer cost. Well worth it!you don&#x27;t care about as it&#x27;s gonna get wrecked.

    <li> Waxing hurts. It doesn&#x27;t matter what kit you use or where you go.&lt;br /&gt;But you can save the pain of your wallet of you use this kit. Saves a ton of money already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Salon uses this exact kit and charges $75 a pop (plus tips!).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice and still have lots left over for more. Paid for itself in the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after reading many of the reviews here, I said what the heck and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If its your first time, watch the DVD that is included and read all instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Shower before you wax. By showering, it softens up the hair folicles and makes it less painful.&lt;br /&gt;-Have plenty of towels and news paper around. Its gonna be messy if its your first time.&lt;br /&gt;-Use the included Pre-Epilation Oil. Helps reduce pain a lot&lt;br /&gt;-Pre cut your hair if its too long.&lt;br /&gt;-Heat it up so it is not warm, not HOT. you will burn yourself.&lt;br /&gt;-Have your bf help you for those hard to reach places :) if hes comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;-Do it on a small area first if its your first time. Once you are confortable, then you can do the rest. Take your time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, like all waxing, your skin might get irritated after depending on your sensitivity levels, I like to put on a moisturizer afterwards to help protect the fragile skin area where you waxed. Any gentle hypo allergenic lotion should work fine. I recommend pure argan oil from morocco. Josie Maran has some good ones but they are expensive. I personally like this [[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.)]] . Pure &amp; organic argan oil, non greasy, fast absorbing and forms a protective layer on your skin as well as moisturizes it.</li>
    <li> I love this GIGI hard wax. I didn&#x27;t know what a hard wax is, but after reading so many amazing reviews of this Wax Kit, I wanted to give it a try. After trying this, I&#x27;m never going back to Sally Hansen&#x27; wax. Works well for under arms and bikini area. There is a learning curve with any hard wax, and once you know the technique, this wax can do wonders for you.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, unlike other waxing kits that tend to be really messy, this one is perfect! To my opinion it is not messy at all, it sticks to the hair and not to your skin, it makes the whole procedure less painful. This was my first time trying waxing down there, and although I did not go for the brazilian, i did get the bikini area done and I mean, it did NOT hurt whatsoever, I am really happy with this product. I regularly wax my armpits and eyebrows with the muslin strips and a different kind of wax, but after trying this out I don&#x27;t think I will go back to muslin strips. This wax removed all the hair on the first try and like I said before, it did not hurt. This kit also comes with a video that shows you how you should use the product and how much wax you should put on, as well as, when it is ready to peel off. The video is graphic but seriously, like if you are old enough to get a brazilian, you are old enough to watch the video in a non-repulsive way or at least, I dont think it should bother you, because it is a good way to show you how to get the job done. Overall, this is an amazing product and will continue to use it! :D</li>
    <li> omg this hurt so bad i cried real tears but smelled like honey so im making it into a candle and selling them to my sister in law</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic about trying to do this type of waxing on my own, but after reading all the amazing comments and tips I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works amazing and is NOT too painful at all. Make sure the hair is trimmed, the area is clean, and use the oil in the areas you will be waxing, or you&#x27;ll be sorry! Start with the heat on high for about 30 minutes, and then set it to Low. The wax should be gooey but not totally liquid. A thicker consistency than, say, honey. Get a mirror between your legs, and do 2\\&quot; sections at a time. I started from the top area, and then outwards - inwards. Wait until it feels like if you pull it, it won&#x27;t stretch like gum. Flick a corner up to grab onto and hold the skin taut. Pull away! The oil prevents skin from being pulled along with is (causing the pain!) I redid a few spots a couple of times and didn&#x27;t have any issues we rewaxing the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMINDER: DO NOT USE IT IN A VERY HOT LIQUID FORM. I had it on high heat the second time around, and the wax simply did not work! It was also really hot. You do not want it watery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ladies!</li>
    <li> After waxing me with wax for more than 15 years, I bought this product by the fact of being hard wax and not having to use the strips to shave.&lt;br /&gt;The product clearly says that it brings a container of hard wax, wax not needing any wax strips. To use this wax you need strips, because never becomes hard enough to be able to remove it without strips.&lt;br /&gt;Totally disappointed in this product, is not what I wanted and I was obliged to buy the strips to be able to make use of this product.</li>
    <li> I use this every month and use it on my friends , I do not have any compliant. it is awesome</li>
    <li> Love this~! It is easy to use, and it comes with everything you would need for it! It pays for itself the first few times you use it instead of going to the salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING IT, BUT I FIRST HAVE TO TRACK DOWN A LOCAL SOURCE FOR THE TWO BOTTLES FROM THE KIT. AND WIPE ALL THE OIL OFF EVERYTHING. WHAT A MESS, AND TWO FOR TWO SETS UP THE EXPECTATION THAT THE BOTTLES ARE EITHER DAMAGED OR PRODUCT CAN NOT BE SHIPPED WITHOUT DAMAGE...</li>
    <li> I purchased the Gigi kit recently. The warmer works great, but the hard wax is just ok. At first I forgot to use the pre epilation oil and wow what a mess. The oil really helps but the wax doesn&#x27;t remove a lot of the hairs. I had to go over areas more than once and still there is hair left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never gotten a professional wax done before, so I don&#x27;t know how well a professional waxing removes hair, but I&#x27;m dissappointed how much is left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try the honee wax and see if this method works better.</li>
    <li> I had been thinking of going and getting my bikini area waxed but with 3 kids I just never had time to go.  I researched the different methods and products and decided on the Gigi hard wax kit.  I&#x27;ve done it twice now and it was easier and faster after just one time.  The first time was an adventure but I figured it out and watching the DVD helped also.  I turned the warmer up to high until the wax melted and then turn it down to low.  The wax doesn&#x27;t burn or hurt my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions:  Take an advil about 30 minutes before you start, make sure your hair is trimmed because if it&#x27;s too long it hurts more, don&#x27;t wax during your period because that area is more sensitive and it will hurt more (I was too excited to wait) and make sure to let the wax setup before trying to peel it off or you will have a waxy mess on your finger nails.  It is pretty time consuming at first but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get faster the more often I do it.  I&#x27;m completely happy with my purchase and will be purchasing more hard wax when mine runs out!</li>
    <li> Stuff is worthless, does not peel off easily, and is very messy and time consuming. Save your money and leave waxing to the professionals.</li>
    <li> Love this kit! I&#x27;ve used other waxes before and they just don&#x27;t compare to this one, plus no wax strips needed so that saves some $. Such an awesome buy!</li>
    <li> If you want to do waxing at home instead of in a salon, you will not be disappointed. Convenient size. Not too messy. Easy clean up if you&#x27;re a clutz like me.</li>
    <li> It really works. You have to be patient.....and strong about it. In my personal opinion it hurts real bad, not used to it and wont use it anymore for that purpose, but its great for eyebrows and upper lips too!!!! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Received the product today and the oil spilled all over the inside of the shipping box--instructional dvd, power plug,paper instructions, and wax cover!! It literally stained the outside of the shipping box. How am I supposed to use this now?!</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you need at an excellent price, I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys being hair free for weeks without the price of the salons.</li>
    <li> I prefer waxing over shaving SO much, but it gets very expensive. This kit is great! It comes with an instructional video (beware: it is GRAPHIC). The wax comes completely off without using strips. TIP: DO NOT try to pull this wax off before it is completely cooled. It will hurt SO badly when you have to peel it off part by part. ALSO: Do not accidentally drop any wax onto the floor or other surfaces. Goo Gone does nothing for getting it off of the floor. I had to use a scraper and my fingernails. :/ My own carelessness aside, this is a GREAT product and the wax is great on sensitive skin. :)</li>
    <li> Amazing waxing kit!  Way easier and more effective to use than any other system I have tried.  I highly recommend it!  Great value too!!!</li>
    <li> I got the kit on Aug.20, and finally had the time and privacy to try it out this morning. I didn&#x27;t have a third hand of help, nor had I ever done waxing before, so it took me over an hour just to finish the front side of my right calf. After messing up everything around me, I finally started to get the techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good kit, and it does not require strips, since it&#x27;s hard wax. But I think it might be easier to use soft wax and strips, because it felt so uncomfortable with all the wax on my hand and in the gap of my nails that I could hardly continue. So for rookies like me, I would definitely suggest something that&#x27;s less challenging. The instruction book and the DVD are clear enough on the whole procedure, though they&#x27;re more aimed for professionals. However, when doing it myself, it seemed so much harder than what was shown in the instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is strong enough to pull out any hair. But for those who have as much in-growing hair as I do, you may want to get tweezers for the particularly stubborn little \\&quot;buddies\\&quot;. There is always some of them left out after one pull. And more importantly, I DEFINITELY would NOT recommend using it for your underarm area! For the record, I was never sensitive to pain, but it was just TOO PAINFUL that I almost gave up the other side and cried. I know Gigi has some product to reduce the pain. Never tried it, don&#x27;t know if it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is very sticky. Even if I put on the pre-waxing oil, it&#x27;s still hard to clean off the wax utterly, not to mention the areas I forgot to put on the oil, OH..MY..GOD... Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m still discovering some sticky dots every now and then - ones I failed to spot in the past few hours - thanks to the dust that&#x27;s attached! So please try not overlooking this little step. And by the way, it takes longer than the video said to warm up the wax, for about half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very good. Effective, I&#x27;ll say. But for green hands like myself, it can be a lot of effort before grasping the gist. Good luck and have fun! :)</li>
    <li> Prepare yourself for too much sharing.  But come on - we are talking about a kit expressly made to wax one&#x27;s lady parts.  Is this really a time for modesty?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s put it this way.  If we lived in the 70&#x27;s, the \\&quot;delicate curls\\&quot; of my nether regions would be appreciatively referred to with such adjectives as \\&quot;expansive\\&quot; and \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot;.  Also perhaps \\&quot;impressive\\&quot;, what with my nether mane&#x27;s ability to creep halfway down my thighs like a spreading fungus.  However, living in the now, the only acceptable place for an expansive and luxurious mane is on one&#x27;s head.  Sucks to be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman with an \\&quot;expansive and luxurious\\&quot; rug, personal care can be difficult and embarrassing.  Dark and coarse hair never seems to completely disappear, even directly after shaving.  Combine this with the palest skin on earth (finding makeup is difficult because of my light skin) and super sensitive skin (oh look, another razor burn &amp; ingrown hair!).  Now what do you have?  A hairy ghost-white chick with a red rash at her bikini line.  No wonder I never want to go swimming or wear shorts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks back I happened to pick up some [[ASIN:B000AAAVZE Sally Hansen Hair Remover Wax Strip Kit, for Face, Brows &amp; Bikini]] to take care of some unsightly hair on my face.  Somehow, instead of filling me with rage, ripping off that wax strip was wholly satisfying (even though the first time I did it, I took some lip skin along with it).  And, I am insane, but something about looking at the strip afterwards was mesmerizing, in the same vein as staring at a Biore strip after you pull all of the gunk out of your nose pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stared entranced at this wax strip and the multitude of tiny hairs, visions began to dance in my head.  Visions of me, frolicking through the grass in a pair of tiny white shorts, my legs smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt (too bad I&#x27;m not skinny enough).  Me wearing a swimsuit that&#x27;s not a skirtie because I am not trying to hide my crotch from the world. And, (TMI ALERT), better romantic spontaniety with my spouse because I don&#x27;t \\&quot;have to shave first, sorry, ask me tomorrow\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bit the bullet and ordered this kit.  And I waxed, and waxed, and waxed some more.  I waxed my bikini line.  I waxed my upper thighs.  I waxed inward from my bikini line to a landing strip.  I waxed my armpits.  I waxed my happy trail (did I mention I am hairy?)  I waxed my legs... at least halfway.  Then I ran out of wax and became sad, so I ordered some more.  Don&#x27;t worry, there is a lot of wax in the kit.  You&#x27;ll get several brazilians if that is your only objective.  I was just going crazy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness - this kit is awesome.  It has everything you need to be a waxing superstar.  I found the wax perfectly suitable for every area of my body that I tried it (upper &amp; lower legs, armpits, crotch, tummy).  It is VERY easy to use.  It didn&#x27;t take me long at all to get the hang of multiple strips at a time (otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem time efficient since you sit and wait for it to firm up).  I&#x27;d apply just as many strips as I needed for the first one to be ready, then go back down the line ripping them off.  It&#x27;s still taking a long time because I am inexperienced and trying to wax off a LOT of hair, but I expect it to become easier as I get more practice and get more into the \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; phase of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as pain, there are some areas I just couldn&#x27;t get because it hurts.  I mean really, you are ripping the hairs out of your body all at once.  It is not as comfortable as having a massage, or even stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I am super tolerant of pain however and MOST areas of my body were no issue for me.  Just remember, it&#x27;s pain in the name of beauty and convenience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not comfortable double-dipping into your own wax, you&#x27;ll need lots more wax sticks.  The first time I used the kit I never double dipped and I used almost all of the sticks that it came with and hadn&#x27;t even accomplished that much.  I quickly decided that my personal double-dipping policy is that it&#x27;s ok as long as I&#x27;m outside the bikini line.  Remember NO double dipping EVER if you are sharing your wax pot with someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a good kit of wax sticks also from Amazon: [[ASIN:B0035LCSH4 FantaSea 350 piece Wax Applicator Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll also need: [[ASIN:B0001IEYK8 GiGi Clean Collars 14 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips.  Others have said them, but they bear repeating.&lt;br /&gt;* Commit an old sheet to the cause and put it down on a hard floor and put your wax warmer on the floor with you.&lt;br /&gt;*  NEVER EVER forget the pre-epilation oil.  Ow :(&lt;br /&gt;*  If I was getting a hard to reach spot or an area that I can&#x27;t really move the pull end into a non-waxed area (some areas this seems impossible??) I would roll up a bit of the last strip I pulled off, and stick it to the end of the new strip to make a tab I could grab.</li>
    <li> nice and clean package, nice working wax, comfortable warmer. good. I would recomand you to get it. DVD was helpful too.</li>
    <li> I found everything I needed in this kit to wax myself, although a painful process - it was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Park</li>
    <li> The only &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; thing I can say about this product is, is it didn&#x27;t take forever to arrive. However, the rest isn&#x27;t good. I opened the box, and the quality of the wax melter is very cheap and poorly made, oh and IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK!! I was so disappointed because I was really excited to start using this, and I ended up having to send it back because it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I wouln&#x27;t recommend this product not only because it didn&#x27;t work, but also because of the quality it is made of. I was bummed.</li>
    <li> When I decide to use this, I&#x27;m very happy with the results. However, I have sensitive skin and it does hurt. It&#x27;s very good for what it is.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The hard wax grabs the hair so you only need to apply the wax once (unlike other wax products I&#x27;ve used where it only removes 50% of the hair).  It may take a few sessions to get your technique down, but once you do it won&#x27;t take much time at all and you&#x27;re left with smooth, hair-free skin for a few weeks!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the one that we had for awhile for quite some time. Easy to use and effective.</li>
    <li> I have been going to the Salon for years,getting my brows waxed and my lip,then my chin,and the cost was $8.00 on up to $30.00 to have your whole face waxed. I was getting pretty upset at the cost of just having someone take a few hairs off my face,so I looked into one of these kits and am I ever so glad I did.It pays for it self in 2 applications. You don&#x27;t need to order any thing extra just the kit and off you go. It took me around a whole hour to do my first application.I&#x27;m sure with time and with experience it won&#x27;t take me that  long next time at all. But ladies if you are wondering about &amp;#34;Should I get this&amp;#34;? The answer for me was yes,and I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;Now if I just just learn how to do my own nails. :)&lt;br /&gt;Oh and by the way it is easy to do and it does not hurt. That is a biggie right there!</li>
    <li> I can never get out now a days to wax my legs so this was a great alternative. It worked really well and my legs were smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is marketed to professional aestheticians, but I find that it is excellent for the conscientious in-home user, as well. The enclosed instructional video clarifies proper techniques for use. ***The procedure demonstrated is a Brazilian pubic wax, footage is detailed. Please be aware of this before you stick it in your DVD player with the kids in the room. The DVD label and menu also give sufficient warning of this.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gigi&#x27;s hard brazilian wax is great for all waxing applications. I&#x27;ve done my upper lip, my eyebrows, legs, underarms (brace yourself for significant discomfort on those) and bikini with great success. Recommend purchasing post-epilation oil or lotion to help remove sticky bits of wax that may remain on the skin afterward. This is not included in the kit. You will also likely need to purchase additional applicators. Double-dipping is a no-no, and you&#x27;ll go through the included applicators fairly quickly. I am a bit forgetful and still working on the habit of pitching the applicator as soon as I&#x27;ve applied the wax. I&#x27;m the only person who uses this kit, but to help reduce the chance of infection from accidental double-dipping, I&#x27;ve added about 1 milliliter (15-20 drops) of tea tree oil to the melted wax as an antibacterial/antifungal agent. It&#x27;s potent, safe for skin, and in that small amount it does not compromise the wax&#x27;s ability to harden sufficiently for hair removal.</li>
    <li> A single bikini wax in my area costs about $70, so when I saw this kit I figured I would give it a shot, great decision.  It heats up great, wax works wonderful, highly recommended kit!</li>
    <li> such a good investment! It takes a little practice to make it not messy. I did a brazilian all by myself and I did quite a good job. super easy and self explanatory. just dont leave the wax on skin long enough or it will be almost impossible to peel off. It&#x27;s more affordable than going to a salon and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the regular wax. I love it! So glad I bought it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great deal. Only thing that sucked for me was that the two mini bottles of pre oil and post gel was opened n spilled everywhere in the box when I received it :( but this was such a great deal, so I&#x27;m not going to complain. It heats up in a timely manner and is super easy to use. Worth buying!!</li>
    <li> So excited about this waxing kit! The wax heats up very quickly... about 20 min. Its mess free and get ALL of the hair. I&#x27;ve been paying $50 for a session at the spa and it didnt even get all my hair...... I payed $25 for this kit and it will probably last me all year!</li>
    <li> This product is advertised as hard wax but the wax never hardens enough.  When you pull the wax off (or try to because it&#x27;s so difficult to do because the wax is soft), it comes off in tiny little sticky pieces and sticks to your fingers. I&#x27;m trained in professional waxing and have used many types of products. This one is the worst by far. What a waste of money. I hate this product and regret buying it.</li>
    <li> So, I decided to try this product since I read some reviews were people used it on their eyebrows and it worked perfectly! And I figured since I have really thick eyebrows and thick eyebrow hair, that this could work.  So I waxed my eyebrows and now I am getting some kind of rash.  I don&#x27;t think it was the actual waxing part because I have waxed my eyebrows many times before and have never had a problem.  I think it was the per-exfoliating oil because I&#x27;m starting to get the rash at spots on my face that I did not wax at, but the oil could of gotten to when I wiped it on my face.  Many people even said to use the Oil because it works and helps!  So I am guessing it is an oil for only Brazilian stuff which is what its originally made for... Guess I will read better next time and remember that...</li>
    <li> This is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s ALOT of wax if you are an occasional home-user like me.  I guess I didn&#x27;t look at the descritpion right because it comes with &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; wax.  The soft wax (that you use muslin strips with) is SO MUCH EASIER.  So, after a trip to the local beauty supply for &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; wax and supplies, it does a good job.  It&#x27;s pretty messy, but it&#x27;s good if you are pressed for time and can&#x27;t get in to see your beautician for a pro job.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT kit.  I get lots of waxes, and I rarely do them myself because I&#x27;m so bad at it.  Plus I always felt like I was getting good results in NYC.  I&#x27;m thrilled I gave this a shot because it&#x27;s incredible.  Easy to set up and use (although set aside some time and newspaper) far less pain than I&#x27;ve experienced from other waxes and no need to repeat areas. You do it once and it&#x27;s done.  I&#x27;ve spent thousands on salon waxes and those days are definitely done.  I&#x27;m delighted with it and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> First wax warmer and hard wax ever purchased and loved it. However, the wax warmer takes a bit to warm up (about 30 minutes) but that just gives me time to do other things while I wait. If you wax correctly, the hard wax will be easy to clean up. Make sure to purchase the GiGI Clean Collars to prevent wax from spilling onto the side of the warmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a teenager and I&#x27;m swimming and I have to keep up with these kind of things you know? This product is perfect for this. It IS  a little bit messy, but some old towels down, but I didn&#x27;t even watch the video and I made it through. It took a long while, but now I know exactly what to do and should be a pro next time. If you don&#x27;t mind a little bit of pain (being well worth it by the way) and a bit of time you should be good. It also came really fast. No negative things. One thing is I thought it would have the little strips, but no. This is purely hard wax which is better than strips anyways. Go for this product I really love it and recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am new to self waxing and this kit worked great. I used it for facial,chest and underarm hair. The packaging was good too everything was sealed. The instructional dvd and booklet really helped me understand what needed to be done so that the wax wasn&#x27;t too hot or cold. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this product is nice and good . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> My mother never told me about waxing. Why did I wait so long.  This kit is great for starters, as it has everything you need for waxing.  Watch the enclosed dvd to get some pointers ( be advised that the tape is explicit)  But it really does the job for underarms, legs and bikini area.  If you&#x27;re just a beginner it may hurt a little..But I had no issue with pain, as I had already been using the epilator and that prep&#x27;d me for waxing, as the epilator is painful.</li>
    <li> When Zipwax changed their product I had to find something else.  The wax is just as good as Zip if not better.  Love the warmer &amp; I love the before and after wax prep products.  I will buy again</li>
