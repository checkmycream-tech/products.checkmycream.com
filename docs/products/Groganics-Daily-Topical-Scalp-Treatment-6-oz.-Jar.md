      <li>and i wasn&#x27;t sure at first</li>
      <li>so excited I&#x27;ve been praying and asking the Lord to help grow my edges.</li>
      <li>It is more intense when I put a silk cap on my head.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure with continued use, our family member will have a complete head of hair again without any noticeable bald spots.  </li>

<li> This one was not too heavy, and worked just average for me.</li>
<li> Been using little over month.  </li>
<li> and I see little hairs growing now.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> Used everyday.  </li>
<li> My scalp started flaking like it was shedding dead skin</li>
<li> and I have suffered hair loss due to it!!!</li>
<li> I purchased this item for a family member who has some hair loss, possibly due to poor management of hair as well as a condition of hair pulling.  </li>
<li> It just pulled the remaining hair out because its basically vicks vap-o-rub: A thick petroleum jelly based thing with some saw palmetto and menthol to give you a feeling on the area of application.</li>
<li> and afterwards my hair started growing in the same spot where it was thinning really bad at.</li>
<li> The stuff didnt come out of my hair for days and made what was there look even worse than before.</li>
<li> If they could replicate the results without those terrible ingredients, I&#x27;d buy it.</li>

    <li> My edges are growing back. Been using little over month.  Don&#x27;t expect fast growth, but you will see a difference in 5-6 weeks.  Used everyday.  Must use daily.  Patience is key!</li>

    <li> This product was ordered for a friend who uses it exclusively for ecema problems.  She has found it highly effective for her hair and scalp problems, as well as other places.</li>
    <li> After experiencing a great deal of shedding from wearing a weave I decided to try this product.  I received a sample at a recent hair show, like the tingling it at least gives me the impression that it is working.  Hope it helps stay tuned for follow up reviews.</li>
    <li> I have to warn everyone that this product has mineral oil and petrolatum in it. If they could replicate the results without those terrible ingredients, I&#x27;d buy it. My temples thickened up after thinning due to a temporary bout of malnutrition.</li>
    <li> Product came on time. Product is GREAT for shine and moisture, too soon to say if my hair grew yet. I recommend this item as well as the seller!!</li>
    <li> Great product, the ointment type smell felt so good on my scalp, like it woke up my hair follicle, &amp; I think you will enjoy too</li>

    <li> this was recommeded by one of my hair dressers and i wasn&#x27;t sure at first but i followed the instructions and my hair feels so much different .... in a good way.</li>
    <li> Great for thinning hair. You will notice a difference right away. Very soothing on your scalp and promotes hair growth. Works better with other groganic products. I used this product for several weeks and I noticed where my hair was thinning at. My scalp started flaking like it was shedding dead skin and afterwards my hair started growing in the same spot where it was thinning really bad at. This product works wonders.</li>
    <li> I saw no significant changes to scalp or hair then using any other hair product. Scalp treatments are beneficial in general, and you should have a regime that works for your hair texture. This one was not too heavy, and worked just average for me.</li>
    <li> The oil in this broke me out and I have suffered hair loss due to it!!! Please don&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> This product has a tingling effect and feels great on my scalp.  I use it only on the affected areas and find that it helps.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a family member who has some hair loss, possibly due to poor management of hair as well as a condition of hair pulling.  This item has help to regrow the hair and my family member loves it.  We can see the hair beginning to fill in where the bald spots are located on our family member&#x27;s head.  I&#x27;m sure with continued use, our family member will have a complete head of hair again without any noticeable bald spots.  The person is quite HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT and recommends it!!!!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>

    <li> Great stuff.  I used this product before so I already knew how good it worked. I probably will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil, castor oil and even emu oil for about one year and my hairline didn&#x27;t grow at all. I brought this item at my local beauty supply store and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks and I see little hairs growing now. I use this at night and follow the directions by massaging my hairline for 3 mins daily.  so excited I&#x27;ve been praying and asking the Lord to help grow my edges. Brought the groganics feather conditioner at the store and just ordered the groganics deep freeze shampoo off of Amazon today.  I&#x27;ve just included 5,000 mcg biotin, drinking lots of water, working out, eating healthy and just started wild growth oil 3 times per week only in the mornings. I&#x27;m on a mission to grow my edges and natural hair longer and healthier. I still use castor oil but not for my hairline but my hair and ends, it keeps my hair moisturized. FIND WHAT WORKS FOR YOU!!!</li>
