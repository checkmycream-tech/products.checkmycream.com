      <li>Shampoo is great!  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels great</li>
      <li>Great moisurizing shampoo</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved this shampoo since I walked by a friend in the hall and smelled her</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, perfectly conditioned, and full of body.  </li>
      <li>so it probably is way more cost-efficient anyway!  </li>
      <li>And it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing, but did not feel it did anything to my hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for moisturizing and leaves my hair shiny and clean.  </li>
      <li>SO worth the money (which is very reasonable, compared to any Great salon shampoo)!</li>
      <li>i love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
      <li>no terrible funky smell.  </li>
      <li>If you have dry, thinning hair, this product is perfect.  </li>
      <li>so when I shampoo its hared to get a come through until I add the UNITE now its easy to comb and shiny.</li>
      <li>The results are fine.</li>
      <li>One of the finest moisturizing/conditioning shampoos available.  </li>
      <li>although this smells amazing, I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in their shampoo products.  </li>
      <li>but anyway, this shampoo is light weight but CLEANS your hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m also someone who normally shops around for the next best product.</li>
      <li>Kinda pricy, but well worth its value!</li>
      <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, which is good because it won&#x27;t strip my hair of the much needed oils.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s well worth the premium over cheaper shampoos, and if you have hair like mine, you don&#x27;t need conditioner afterwards.</li>
      <li>it just leaves your hair super smooth but not oily feeling; and it leaves it feeling super soft!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty heavenly.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo smells and feels great, and you only need a little bit to fully clean your hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this after it was personally recommended to me by a professional cosmetologist at a nice hair place.</li>
      <li>Switched from Wen to this brand-work really well.  </li>
      <li>My stylist turned me onto this brand after scolding me for not getting a cut for over 4 months (with my hair type, I really should be getting a cut ever 6 weeks).</li>
      <li>This comes very recommended by me as I have been using this product for quite some time.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my fine, dry hair</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This is the shampoo I normally purchase at my hairdresser&#x27;s shop.  </li>
      <li>I also appreciate that it&#x27;s a reasonably unisex bottle design, a lot of hair products are marketed to women, and I don&#x27;t want people to make snarky comments, but I definitely want the high quality stuff.</li>
      <li>I recommend it for every type of hair, mine is fine and limp,</li>
      <li>Professional shampoo like this doesn&#x27;t lather, and you don&#x27;t touch your hair at all when you wash it out, just let the water do its work.</li>
      <li>Seeing that I color my hair, perm and get hi lights in my hair frequently</li>
      <li>The price is not outrageous considering a little of this shampoo (and the conditioner) goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended and is the only shampoo I now use.</li>
      <li>I discovered this shampoo at an upscale salon near Boulder, CO and have been a devotee even when that salon moved to the next lucrative product line.  </li>
      <li>I have fine blonde hair (but a lot of it) which normally is limp and flat.  </li>
      <li>I was using the volumizing shampoo for years but it made my hair a bit dry, with the moisturizing my hair is soft but not limp</li>
      <li>This definitely doesn&#x27;t dry my hair our as much as their &amp;#34;Volumizing&amp;#34; line, but it doesn&#x27;t take the frizz out either.</li>

    <li> Love this shampoo although I think its too expensive. I don&#x27;t think anyon should spend that.much on shampoo when there&#x27;s really no great difference</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t good for me, I had a big expectation for this shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, at the end I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> My stylist turned me onto this brand after scolding me for not getting a cut for over 4 months (with my hair type, I really should be getting a cut ever 6 weeks). With curly/wavy, coarse hair, I need all the moisture that I can get. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, which is good because it won&#x27;t strip my hair of the much needed oils. And it smells amazing. I will be buying this for the rest of my life, or until my hair adapts and I have to switch it up.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried many. I was using the volumizing shampoo for years but it made my hair a bit dry, with the moisturizing my hair is soft but not limp I still have the body without being dry. I recommend it for every type of hair, mine is fine and limp,</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I have been using it for about 3 years now.  The results are fine. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo.  and frankly it was about the same price as my salon (including shipping), and i didnt even have to leave my house! and just FYI my salon is about a 40 minute drive from my house.  not to make myself seem crazy for driving that far.  let&#x27;s just say i moved recently, so in my head it&#x27;s still close by.  except when i have to get gas. but anyway, this shampoo is light weight but CLEANS your hair and scalp.  no residue.  no terrible funky smell.  it&#x27;s pretty heavenly.  no build up or residue left behind.  it just leaves your hair super smooth but not oily feeling; and it leaves it feeling super soft!  trust me, trust the world, there is a difference between $3 shampoo and this product! plus you only have to use a little bit versus piling on the cheaper stuff. so it probably is way more cost-efficient anyway!  it&#x27;s like a miracle worker.  and i&#x27;ve tried other shampoos like alterna hemp, bumble &amp; bumble, aveda, nexxus, matrix, redken, neutrogena, and the really bad ones like suave, garnier, herbel essences, pantene, etc., and basically, duh, Unite has far out performed all of them!</li>

    <li> Shampoo is great!  Switched from Wen to this brand-work really well.  Keeps my fine, dry hair well moisturized!  Kinda pricy, but well worth its value!</li>

I&#x27;m getting another bottle when this one&#x27;s out, probably a bigger one, too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am normally frustrated with my shampoo and conditioner combo.  i&#x27;m also someone who normally shops around for the next best product. Unite changed everything for me.  I have fine blonde hair (but a lot of it) which normally is limp and flat.  I started using Unite conditioning shampoo and conditioner a year ago and never looked back.  My hair is shiny, perfectly conditioned, and full of body.  Amazed that a product performs so well for the price.</li>
    <li> Great moisurizing shampoo</li>
    <li> although this smells amazing, I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in their shampoo products.  This definitely doesn&#x27;t dry my hair our as much as their &amp;#34;Volumizing&amp;#34; line, but it doesn&#x27;t take the frizz out either.</li>

    <li> my hair dresser recommended this. My hair feels great and I have a long hair so when I shampoo its hared to get a come through until I add the UNITE now its easy to comb and shiny.</li>
