<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started by using the tamanu oil on my face, neck and decollete. I only used a few drops for each area. I then used a drop or two for my hair and very lightly near my scalp. I just add a few drops in my palm, rub my hands together to warm the oil and then lightly comb through my hair. I don’t like using oils on my scalp as it makes my hair look greasy. If want a deep conditioning, I will use oil directly on my scalp and allow to sit for 30 minutes or more and then shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not changed anything about my beauty routine and I noticed a difference the next day. My hair was soft and bouncy. My hair felt like it had added volume and I have straight hair. Before trying tamanu oil, my hair would be straight and no volume or bounce. Now, my scalp feels clean. My hair looks healthier.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, oily skin and oily fine hair. I also have acne, and not just acne on my face either; I have the dreaded back acne and even chest acne. I used to always buy oil free acne wash and acne scrubs and the like with no results. Then I researched and found that all these scrubs and acids I&#x27;d been using actually made my skin worse. I&#x27;d been drying out my skin, making it kick into high gear over-producing oil and clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I stopped using scrubs and acne wash and my skin got better, but it still wasn&#x27;t ideal. I also found out that my skin is too sensitive for fabric softener on my laundry, but I still had some back and chest acne. So I researched and found that certain oils (like tamanu!) can both moisturize AND keep bacteria from clogging pores. It seems counter-intuitive to put oil on oily skin, but I can testify that it works. I started off using jojoba oil, but have decided to branch out with this tamanu oil, and I am impressed. Without even considering the acne benefits, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. It&#x27;s great on my elbows and heels. Also, I love the nutty, earthy smell. I feel like a sexy organic earth mother or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this particular oil is fairly thick, I only use it on my face if I&#x27;ve picked at something and need to heal that lesion quickly or if I need to heal a sunburn. But on my back and chest, it has worked wonders. I am able to wear backless dresses when I was always too embarrassed before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I&#x27;m going to try it on my split ends and see how that works.</li>
    <li> Having never heard of tamanu oil, I went to the scientific literature to see what I could learn.  I found a number of studies in medical journals that demonstrated the healing properties of this oil.  Of course, using it is more relevant to me than just reading about it, so I applied this oil to a rash I’d been experiencing for a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleared the rash.  Now it wasn’t an instant fix.  It took about 10 days to fully clear the rash which had appeared from unknown causes, but it did work to leave my skin rash-free and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with summer approaching, I’ll keep tamanu oil at the top of my list for the inevitable scrapes, bumps, and bruises that accompany the hot weather.  I ‘ve proved it to myself -- it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of Tamanu oil before but I was more than willing to give it a try especially since I saw it helps with psoriasis which I suffer from really bad I have to admit it helps with the itching I&#x27;m really grateful for that hopefully the more I use it the better my psoriasis will be</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week now and can tell a huge difference in my complexion already! I have combination skin and use a drop in my night cream. It doesn&#x27;t get too greasy- love the earthy smell! I love the dewey glow it gives my skin!</li>
    <li> We were not familiar with Tamanu oil until we were offered a sample to review.  The first thing that I noticed about this was the smell.  Tamanu oil doesn’t have a particularly pleasant smell with its wood-y kind of scent.  From all the oils we have tried, this and tea tree oil have a similar kind of smell that I am not fond of.  However, if it does what it is supposed to, I can deal with the smell.  The oil is medium consistency oil that is yellow-ish in appearance.  It absorbs quickly into the skin but does have a bit of a sticky but moisturized feel.  The wife has been using this mixed with tea tree oil (combining the superpowers of stinky oils) as a way to help control her problem skin areas that are oily and get acne.  So far the oil combination has helped her problem skin areas and made them less prone to acne and overall made her skin healthier.  If you are sensitive to smells though, this may not be the oil for you.  I will update my review with any long term observations of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Would be great if it came in 2oz bottles.</li>
    <li> I’ve used several different natural and organic oils, including argan oil, but haven’t tried the tamanu.  Tamanu has properties that I definitely like, skin-soothing ones that anyone who has dry, rough skin may wish to take a look at.  Many of these oils have the usual miracle claims attached to them, but I only can look at the tamanu from my own perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing immediately noticeable, without even using a single drop, is the USDA Organic and Ecocert seals.  I’ve noticed that many important products claim to be organic and perhaps they are, but if I don’t see that seal, I’m not interested.  Leia is 100% pure and 100% organic.  It’s in a small brown bottle which will keep the oil from becoming rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a dropper the Leia has a pump cap for easy dispensing.  Tamanu oil is of Southeast African origin, an area which produces some of the finest medicinal oils in the world.  My experience with tamanu was quite positive.  I have been using it as a hand moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a small drop of this heavily concentrated oil to make a difference in the look and feel of my skin.  It absorbs readily and isn’t greasy, although my skin has a light sheen after using.  Even washing my hands doesn’t remove the protective coating during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Leia tamanu has a nice earthy scent, sans fragrance.  I do have several lotions, but will only use those with shea butter, yet another tree fruit product of African origin.  My preference is for all-natural, preferably organic products.  Keeping my skin healthy, sans chemicals is a priority and now tamanu has been added to the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;►  100% Pure&lt;br /&gt;►  100% Organic, USDA; Ecocert&lt;br /&gt;►  Unrefined&lt;br /&gt;►  Cold Pressed&lt;br /&gt;►  Fast Absorbing&lt;br /&gt;►  No additives, parabens, fillers, preservatives, or fragrances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPECS (tamanu-specific):&lt;br /&gt;Odor- Heavy, fatty and odoriferous&lt;br /&gt;Free Fatty Acids- 0%&lt;br /&gt;Peroxide Value- 0.68&lt;br /&gt;Non-Saponifiables- 0.6&lt;br /&gt;Saponification Value- 194&lt;br /&gt;Iodine Value- 84.1 Specific Gravity- 0.91&lt;br /&gt;pH- 4.11&lt;br /&gt;Fatty Acids&lt;br /&gt;Oleic- 41.4%&lt;br /&gt;Palmitic- 14.5%&lt;br /&gt;Linoleic- 29.7%&lt;br /&gt;Linolenic- 0.2%&lt;br /&gt;Stearic- 12.9%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.H- 4.11 Fatty Acids Oleic- 41.4% Palmitic- 14.5% Linoleic- 29.7% Linolenic- 0.2% Stearic- 12.9%  Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> This product works! It is unique in that it has versatility and can be used in the skin or hair as a moisturizer to make you feel great!</li>
    <li> Up until about 3 years ago, oils like Tamanu, Tea Tree, Oregano were hardly used and little known.  Well, things have changed and you see them all over and I&#x27;ve had  the opportunity to try all of them on my skin or my families&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Tamanu oil is 100% organic, which is something I look for and appreciate. It comes in a dark amber bottle with a pump.  The oil itself is somewhat thick with the color and consistency of Olive Oil.  It has an earthy smell, which is rather pleasant and not strong at all like Oregano Oil.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on your skin smoothly and is absorbed readily.  It can be washed off easily with soap and water or shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has had psoriasis for years which comes and goes.  He has been using the Tamanu Oil for about 4 weeks now once a day.  It has cleared up his psoriasis, but I must say his psoriasis is a mild case.  Sometimes it just goes away on its own, sometimes he uses a cortisone cream.  The Tamanu Oil worked, but since this is not a scientific study, it&#x27;s hard to proclaim it&#x27;s effectiveness, but more an incidental conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;The next time his psoriasis flares up, he will definitely try this oil again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 oz bottle should last a very long time even with daily use, as very little is needed as the oil covers a lot of skin area. It doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; on your skin and makes your skin feel very smooth.  If like my husband, you have psoriasis, I would highly recommend giving this Organic Tamanu Oil a try.  I received a sample for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Over the last few years, I had made a dramatic change with both my diet, and all my skin and hair care needs. Gradually I have switched to natural, pure, and organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that the biggest impact on the health of my skin and hair is due to pure, natural, and organic oils.  I have discovered that all the chemical ingredients that I had previously used in the everyday products were nothing more than a temporary fix at best, none of them ever had a permanent effect, but the use of plant and other natural oils are very different.  Instead of a temporary repair, natural oils get to the root of the problem with a permanent solution. Chemical products are a temporary cover up, and sometimes cause skin irritations, whereas natural oils nourish, heal and repair on a perpetual foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil is a natural substance that offers a variety of health enhancing benefits. Derived from the nut kernels of the Tamanu Nut Tree, this tree is indigenous to Melanesian countries such as Vanuatu and Polynesian countries such as Hawaii; and the Tamanu Tree grows in other tropical countries like Vietnam and Thailand. The extracted oil from the kernel has a color range from a greenish to a yellow hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As natural oil, Tamanu contains the all-important natural antioxidants. The medicinal properties of Tamanu oil include, destroying bacteria, reducing inflammation, therefore, anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-oxidant properties, as well as anti-cancer agents. In addition, it contains vitamin E to help repair an assortment of skin injuries, with an easy topical usage by applying it directly to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil as a natural remedy has shown improved results for the following conditions:&lt;br /&gt;• acne&lt;br /&gt;• athlete&#x27;s foot&lt;br /&gt;• eczema&lt;br /&gt;• psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;• sunburn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Tamanu oil usage promotes healing for other skin conditions; burns, blisters, cuts, and scrapes, and even to treat insect bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Tamanu oil helps to alleviate pain, topical use can bring relief to skin disorders like sciatica, shingles, and rheumatism. There has been documentation regarding helpful aid in the regeneration of skin, therefore this oil has been useful to help reduce the appearance of stretch marks and scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past seven weeks, I have used Tamanu oil by Leia Naturals, which is 100% pure and organic. Their Tamanu oil is in a dark amber color bottle, with a pump delivery.  I prefer the pump delivery for a few reasons, there is less chance of bacterial contamination, it is easier to use; no caps to undo and lose, and each spurt from the pump is pre-measured so there is none of the waste that I experience with a vial delivery.  The color has a slight greenish yellow hue, and the scent is warm, rich and earthy. I use the oil as a moisturizer, a skin softener, as a nourishing agent for my hair, and I have received excellent results in alleviating the itch on a small patch of psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a skin softener, I use Tamanu oil, right after my shower and before toweling dry. I use one spurt in my palms, rub them together, and then apply to each section of my body. Tamanu oil softens and moisturizes the dry skin on my elbows, knees, and especially the heels of my feet, which require more attention since I wear sandals in our dry and arid heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been my personal experience to observe that even expensive store-bought moisturizing lotions might work throughout the day, but I would need another application in the evenings for my dry skin. However during my usage of Leia Naturals Tamanu Oil, my skin is still moisturized and soft at the end of the day, therefore another application of moisturizer is not necessary, just a daily use of Tamanu oil after my morning shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Tamanu oil for a facial moisturizer as a skin softener and for an extra layer of antioxidants before applying a sunscreen.  Tamanu Oil is highly concentrated; therefore, after the applications of all my facial serums, I use two spurts, spread it in my palms and gently pat into my face and neck, which leaves my skin soft and supple. There is no oily or greasy residue from this small amount and below I have explained the benefits that Tamanu provides for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil has anti-aging benefits, due to its ability to penetrate through the epidermal level down to the dermal level where it helps to regenerate the deepest tissues of the skin.  An application at night thickens the epidermal level (the top protective layer) and the positive result on lower dermal level as the top layer goes through the natural exfoliation process results in healthier and more youthful looking skin. Therefore, Tamanu Oil is both a wrinkle preventative and a wrinkle-repairing agent.  As an inflammatory, it helps to repair sun damage, a cause of aging, and fine lines are noticeably softer, and less pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us who use a facial derma roller a few times a week, a very light application of Leia Naturals Tamanu Oil to lubricate the skin before the derma roll session helps to prevent skin irritation which may help to extend the session as the pre-lubrication helps to avoid the dry stinging irritation. As an extra benefit, I use the Tamanu Oil again, after all the facial applications as my last procedure. The oil is soothing, and provides relief as it re-moisturizes and helps to repair the injured skin, it immediately and visibly reduces redness, and as an inflammatory, it is effective to decrease the initial swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil is also useful for a scalp and hair treatment. As a reference, my hair condition was previously dry; it is course textured, thick, and colored monthly with a chemically colored process. It does tend to have a frizzy appearance (in both dry and humid climates). Currently, my hair is about 5” past my shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recommended use is to apply the oil in the evening and wash it out the next morning, but that does not fit in with my lifestyle.  Instead I mix a little of the oil in the palm of my hand with the shampoo, and massage it into my scalp as I wash my hair. I also use a couple of spurts in my rinse out conditioner, and let in remain in my hair while I finish my shower. After my final rinse, and while my hair is still damp, I use the Tamanu Oil once more as a detangle assistant and apply it to the bottom length of my hair, this helps the ends to remain smooth and shiny, and provides frizz control.  However, a word of caution, do not use much along the top roots of your hair as I did during my first use, the front came out flat and limp, but otherwise my hair had a pretty glossy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Tamanu oil is safe when used topically, it may trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, especially if you have a sensitivity regarding nuts; therefore, you may want to try a patch test first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil is a powerful, transdermal agent that can penetrate deep into the skin. Therefore, its benefits don&#x27;t just affect the surface layers, but also has the capacity to nourish skin at lower levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a believer in the power of natural, pure and organic oils, over any chemical ingredient product, and although the different oils may have slightly different organic compounds, their benefits are to nourish, repair and prevent damage from our environment. Tamanu Oil by Leia Naturals is 100% pure and organic, and cold pressed to preserve all the natural benefits.  I would classify Leia Naturals Tamanu Oil as one of our planets’ most beneficial oils, and if you favor Argan, Emu, or Rosehip, then you will love Tamanu Oil too as either an addition or an alternative for healthy skin and scalp results and as assistance to help repair other skin conditions including scarring and stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation; much of my research is from multiple internet sites, andthe usages, statements and opinions are my own.ge it into my scalp as I wash my hair.

    <li> I love this oil, love! I saw a lady on YouTube selling an Elixir for $30.00 I was about to buy it when I looked at the ingredient list it was Tamanu Oil (which I never heard of before) and vitamin E, so I decided to look for just the oil and presto. This makes my skin so smooth and silky soft, I use it as a moisturize, it is very hydrating. I have combination skin. I will say I do have the dreaded open pores and I feel at this makes them more prominent but I love it so much I will not stop.</li>
    <li> LEIA NATURALS present premium quality 100% Pure Organic Virgin Cold Pressed Tamanu Oil, no additives, parabens, fillers, preservatives, or fragrances, a product that is sourced directly from the South Pacific Islands of Vanuatu. For those to whom this tanamu is new, &#x60;Tamanu oil is a natural topical healing agent with skin healing, antineuralgic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antibiotic, and antioxidant properties. It is pressed from nuts of the tanamu tree The tamanu tree is indigenous to tropical Southeast Asia; it is found in Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia, South India, Sri Lanka, and the Melanesian and Polynesian islands. Tamanu oil possesses a unique capacity to promote the formation of new tissue, thereby accelerating wound healing and the growth of healthy skin. This process is known as cicatrization. For this reason, it is a widely used traditional topical aid. In Pacific island folk medicine, tamanu oil is applied liberally to cuts, scrapes, burns, insect bites and stings, abrasions, acne and acne scars, psoriasis, diabetic sores, anal fissures, sunburn, dry or scaly skin, blisters, eczema, herpes sores, and to reduce foot and body odor. Tamanu oil is also massaged into the skin to relieve neuralgia, rheumatism and sciatica. Tamanu oil is employed by Polynesian women for promoting healthy, clear, blemish-free skin, and is also used on babies to prevent diaper rash and skin eruptions. Oil of tamanu is suitable for general skin and cosmetic purposes. The oil&#x27;s unusual absorption, its mild and pleasant aroma, and its luxurious feel make it ideal for use in lotions, creams, ointments and other cosmetic products. Considering that tamanu is a potent healing agent with proven benefits, it is only a matter of time before tamanu breaks through to more widespread use, and assumes a position among other successful topical and cosmetic ingredients. Oil of tamanu contains three basic classes of lipids, neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids. The oil also contains a unique fatty acid called calophyllic acid, and a novel antibiotic lactone and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent called calophyllolide. These and other components of tamanu oil, including anti-inflammatory coumarins, account for some of the oil&#x27;s beneficial activity. Based on the known activity of known constituents, it is clear that oil of tamanu possesses antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. The same is true for tamanu&#x27;s anti-neuralgic properties. Tamanu oil is well documented for its relief of neuritis, but the constituents responsible and their modes of activity are not yet known.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the facts are there. What LEIA NATURALS has done is provided us with the purest form of the oil. While it is probably good for all the reasons the information on the bottle say, my experience with eh oil is using it for dry rough hands that come from too much exposure to the sun in the past resulting in actinic keratoses and scaly lesions on the dorsum of the hands. Us for about a week and the healing is remarkable - soft fresh healthy skin without the keratoses. It is a very welcome addition to the topical herbal supplements venue. Highly Recommended.

    <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes well sealed in a dark amber bottle, with a nice dispenser pump that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a distinctive nutty smell.  It&#x27;s a strong smell and I personally find it pleasant though others may not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very moisturizing though it does take a bit to absorb.  The color concerns me, though I am far from an expert, because pure tamanu oil is usually green or at least dark yellow tinged green.  This is a florescent yellow.  (See pictures, one on clear slide on solid white, the other a blot on a white tissue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put this in the refrigerator, it solidifies a bit, as a good olive oil would do, but not completely.  It has a slightly oily feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave skin feeling soft and luxurious though, and hair quite shiny. I don&#x27;t think it is any better than plain olive oil is though.  I do like it; I just question its purity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It says it is not tested on animals, and that it is 100% organic, and is from a company headquartered in Atlanta, GA.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil, it&#x27;s helped tremendously with my son&#x27;s acne and especially his dry skin caused by all of the different acne products that he has used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This oil has also helped with me with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I will buy again..</li>
    <li> Good Stuff! Don&#x27;t let the secret out.</li>
    <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin and after using this for 4 days my skin felt smooth and wasn&#x27;t dry and cracking anymore. I truly love this product. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this for myself as I have acne along with acne scarring. This moisturizes my skin well, especially if left overnight.  I have not personally noticed any changes in my acne scarring. But I recently recommended it to my brother who has a severe rash all over his body.  He has had this rash for well over two years  and has tried numerous topical ointments.  Although this rash is undiagnosed it is believed to be from a Candida overgrowth. Since this oil is supposed to be good for bacteria I recommended he use it. He said that within one Day his rash began to disappear. In his words, &amp;#34;it is miraculous&amp;#34;. He said he wishes it came by the gallon as he needs to use so much of it.  I will continue using this for my acne and acne scarring and I will update the review if I see any improvement for myself.</li>
    <li> Really love the oil. The smell is &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;, but not bad.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful stuff!  I&#x27;m always skeptical of an all purpose product, but this oil really does provide an instant look-and-feel-good result.  I&#x27;d never heard of tamanu oil before, but I&#x27;m a believer now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received free for review.</li>
    <li> I use this for overnight moisturizing and wash it out in the morning! It&#x27;s pretty heavy so I don&#x27;t put it in for everyday wear. It didn&#x27;t sink in very well so when I ran my hands through my hair I could feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this really shines is on my dry skin!! I use this on my forearms where they are so dry and they often itch from sunscreen that I&#x27;m allergic to. The price on this for how strong and concentrated it is is a great value</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> this tamanu oil is awesome . I love it ! it has a slight green color to it, earthy and makes my skin glow . if u suffer from mild acne with flare ups this is a perfect oil to add to your beauty routine . I&#x27;ve used argan oil before . this oil is next on my list as my favorite , love the quality. heals any post acne marks fast , only been using a day and seeing results already which I can&#x27;t believe . can only imagine after awhile how much more my skin can improve . thanks for a high quality product that will change my skin forever !!</li>
    <li> Note: I received this item for free for reviewing purpose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a household we tend to stay away from cosmetics. Especially the chemical based skin products of well known cosmetic giants are totally not welcome at all. This means our skin care is left to proper cleaning with olive oil based soaps and some natural oils like this one. Among these relatively new, skin friendly oils, I have used argan oil for sometime with good success on my skin and hair and shea butter for dried areas for moisturizing and healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the seller contacted me about this product I had never heard of Tamanu oil. After a web search I found out that this is made from the fruits of a very tall tree endemic to Pacific islands. The interesting thing is that the fresh fruit kernel  has no oil at all but once it is dried for one month it gets rich in this oil. The chemical composition of the oil is pretty similar to those of other vegetable oils but it contains trace amounts of unique compounds which are thought to be mainly responsible for its healing ability. During my web-search I have come across, in a few places  that this oil helps epithelial proliferation which in turn increases the rate of skin turnover and wound healing as well as prevention of scar formation. It is thought to have anti-aging abilities too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest with you, neither me nor the other reviewers have the capacity to objectively test these claims but at least I can tell that it has good mousturizing ability. It has been gentle to my skin, the absorbtion rate was okay but not as great as what the company claims. An hour after applying my skin was still slightly oily but that is kind of acceptable. It is a relatively thick green liquid but it does not stain your skin after applying. On the other hand, one other thing that needs to be told about this product is the strong and persistent smell. Compared to other similar natural oils I used, this smells the most and it can be off-putting for some users or limit the use in all occasions. So, if you are picky about smell then this product may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is labeled as organic (USDA certified) and cold pressed . Being organic is a plus in terms of not containing pesticides that dissolve in the oil and being cold pressed ensures that the nature of the oil was not altered by heat during the extraction procedure.  The bottle oil is stored operate with a pump dispenser system similar to that of the hand sanitizers. The instructions say pumping in the palm once or twice before applying to wherever you want but I think fingers work better than palm for precision (Try to pump slowly as you may end up having way more oil than you need.) I think a droplet applicator would be a better choice for precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as of april 2015 this product was sold for $19.99 which is above the market average for similar products ( same size organic, unrefined cold pressed tamanu oil can be found between $12 to 20 including free prime shipping for most)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this is a pretty unknown compound and the effects are based on claims rather than scientifically proven facts so I would approach this product as a natural alternative for a skin mousturizer rather than a magical compound that cures everything and that way you would set your expectations right and not yell here saying that it did not cure your skin issue...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Keep it away from any area that is close to your eyes. I applied it on my cheekbones and as far as I know it did not get in contact with my eyes directly but may be the fume or something like that it really gave me a painful red eye for the rest of the daye in all occasions.

    <li> I had never heard of tamanu oil before, but I like a lot of the other trendy oils out there (argan, avocado, coconut, etc.), so I figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you will notice right away is that this has a scent. It&#x27;s a nutty scent and I rather like it. However, it&#x27;s a fairly strong scent and some people will not be as fond of it. (The scent does fade quickly enough, so don&#x27;t worry about it interfering with any fragrances you were planning to wear.) There is a notation on the bottle to avoid this product if you have nut allergies, so be careful there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this three different ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) As cuticle oil. The pump makes this a little awkward, but basically I dispensed one pump&#x27;s worth and rubbed it over the cuticles on both hands. I waited a bit and then pushed my cuticles back with an orange stick. This oil really worked well to soften up my cuticles. (Do wash your hands after using this way, though, or you&#x27;ll get oil all over everything you touch...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) On some rough, flaky, dry skin. For some reason, the skin on my elbows gets dry and flaky at all times of year. I substituted this in for my regular healing balm for a few days and it performed at least as well as the balm. (My elbows are looking pretty good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) As a hair oil. This works best in combination with a detangling spray, for me, but essentially you use it anywhere you would otherwise use a hair oil. In my case, I detangle and comb out my hair while it is still wet and then apply this oil to my hair in the morning. This adds shine and tames most of my flyaways, so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the pump dispenser better than the eye droppers that come with some of the other oils I&#x27;ve tried lately. However, this oil is pretty viscous so is a bit more difficult to distribute through long hair than some other oils. (It&#x27;s not impossible, and warming the oil up in your hands first decreases the viscosity a bit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I&#x27;m pleased to have discovered a new natural product, especially one that works for so many different applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.&#x27;m pleased to have discovered a new natural product, especially one that works for so many different applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> I use the Tamanu Oil daily.  Despite having naturally oily skin, this oil does not leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful oil for skin and hair.  I recently had shingles. Using Tamanu oil on the lesions around my right rib cage not only eliminated the itching, but literally cut the duration of them down to under two weeks. It also is a great moisturizer for the entire body.</li>
    <li> I am a big coconut oil user, it for me is the best thing next to sliced bread. I was turned onto Tamanu oil, so I began a comparison. After using it for about 2-3 weeks, Tamanu keeps my face perfectly hydrated and has evened out my skin tone as well! Coconut oil has that fine line for my face where it is perfect and is just a bit too much - i often cross this line and not always onto the same side.  I also used it on some injuries (burns from cooking) and they have healed cleaner than they would have otherwise, I will continue to use it to confirm that it helps with scaring as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Leia &amp; the Tamanu oil!</li>
    <li> I have scars from surgery and was using the product recommended by the plastic surgeon. It has been a slow process because I&#x27;m not good about everyday....twice a day...use. Since using the Taman oil for about three weeks, about four times a week, I have seen considerable improvement of the surgery scars. Great product!</li>
    <li> Helped my eczema break out on my hands</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really been the person to use oils so I&#x27;m very pleased and surprised about this product. I&#x27;ve mostly been using it on my hair to maintain my frizz. I really try not use a lot of product in my hair so I was excited when the only using the oil worked perfectly in my hair. All I do is add a bit to my hair at night or in the morning and it helps a lot with my frizzy hair and it has also made my hair noticeably smoother and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the oil once a day after using the OCM on my face in the morning for 2 weeks now. The most immediate effect is that my face has not felt dry at all. No patches or irritation. Just one pump a day and it&#x27;s plenty for the face, neck and décolletage. Be careful not to let it get in the eyes if you sweat or are located in warmer or more humid area (irritating).  I&#x27;m giving it more time to see the results on acne after a full month at least.</li>
    <li> This is a new thing to me. I had never heard of it.  It seems like a lot of oils are out there, and I had no idea what the difference was. So I was eager to try this one when offered a sample to inspect and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it is a light oil, not something that will leave you greasy all day.There&#x27;s virtually no scent.  The item description will tell you many ways to use it, but here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done so far, with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My hands, on the back of them, are dry and old-lady looking.  I&#x27;m not an old-lady.  But for some reason, whether it&#x27;s the brutal work I do with them making copper jewelry (with chemicals and torches) or just doing dishes or just trying to keep my hands clean, this has made them softer.  Not a little. A LOT.  I put it on the backs of my hands up to my elbows in the morning after I&#x27;ve done the morning dishes.  It takes two drops per arm.  It goes a long way.  It rubs in well and I can tell it&#x27;s there all day. At night when I&#x27;m in bed I&#x27;ve done the same.  No oily sheets, just a nice soft finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I got one of those callous roller things for heels that looks like a brutal torture weapon but works great for smoothing heels. This goes on after.  I used to use Vaseline but it&#x27;d make my feet too slippery in my shoes and I&#x27;d get blisters. This soaks in nicely, and isn&#x27;t too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. My decollete, or shall I say, my bosom?  Dry skin from years of suntanning.  I&#x27;ve used a gazillion creams over the years. This one works to smooth and soften, as most of them admittedly did. But this one doesn&#x27;t stain my bra or make me look too greasy in a V-neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t know what this oil is made of, but I like it alot.  I&#x27;ve used so much and still there&#x27;s half a bottle left. It&#x27;s a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rec&#x27;d a sample for inspection and review.</li>
    <li> I saw it was working on my discolored skin &amp; it helped to bring my natural color back in but I need to order more to see if it heals it completely.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was satisfied with the oil.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and lovely.</li>
    <li> Calms my acne. Has a nutty, earthy scent, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Haven&#x27;t noticed it lightening any of my acne scars too much, but maybe with time it will.</li>
    <li> I have mixed it with Organic Rose seed oil, you don&#x27;t need much just rub a couple drops into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this for less than a week, and there is a noticeable difference. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks after a month.</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;ve been using this at might before bed and it really gives my skin a smooth and rich feeling, I love that it soaks in so fast with no oily feeling.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin and dry hair. Oils are my best friend in helping me combat both. I had never heard of Tamanu Oil before, and was excited to try it out for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for the past week or so, on my hair and dry skin areas. The results in my hair have been beyond amazing. Better than my tried and true Argan Oil. I apply this on at night before bed, let it stay on overnight, and rinse it out in the morning. My hair is left feeling so incredibly hydrated, soft, and shiny (in the healthy, clean way). My hair just feels amazing after using this as a treatment. This is defintely something that I will keep up with on a weekly basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also starting to use this on my dry skin and things seem great.  My skin not only feels better, but also looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied, and I look forward to seeing the results my hair and skin after using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product for free to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try Tamanu oil for the first time and was a bit hesitant about putting oil on my face because I didn&#x27;t want to look &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, but after reading about all the benefits, I decided to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised when I did because it was immediately absorbed by my skin! It made my skin look and feel soft &amp; smooth as if I had applied a light powder. I love how it felt and the fact that I was able to apply my makeup immediately afterwards! I will definitely continue to apply it to my skin as a daily moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is really pretty and I love the dispenser pump which makes it very easy to get the perfect amount of oil without making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very &amp;#34;natural/earthy&amp;#34; and could also be described as &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; which isn&#x27;t surprising because it actually comes from the Tamanu tree nut kernel! Also, love the fact that it is 100% Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for testing &amp; review purposes, the opinions shared are my own.</li>
    <li> Tamanu oil is produced from the seeds of Calophyllum inophyllum, a tree native to Southeast Asia and the South Pacific regions.  It is used extensively for medicinal purposes in those areas, especially for healing the skin and to reduce scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is organic and cold-pressed to preserve the natural qualities.  It has a beautiful deep green color and a pleasant fragrance with nutty and spicy green notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very rich, but is quickly absorbed by the skin so it can be used on the face as well as the body.  It is an excellent moisturizer and immediately soothes dry or irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 oz. (30 ml) amber bottle protects the oil from the harmful effects of sunlight.  It has a convenient pump top that dispenses a good-sized drop and a protective cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil has been analyzed to contain linoleic acid 38%, oleic acid 34%, stearic acid 13%, and palmitic acid 12% as the primary triglycerides.  It also contains calophyllic and isocalophyllic acids, which are unique to the Calophyllaceae family of plants.  The fatty acids are absorbed through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leia Naturals provided a bottle for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have thin hair that is always looking dull. Once I found out that you can also put the oil on your face and stomach, I got really interested! I have been using it twice a day for three days now and I really like it! My hair feels thicker, has a shine and my face feels like I&#x27;m putting good natural product on it. My face is getting smoother and the pores are slowly getting un noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about it is that how easily it absorbs into the skin and hair... its a very non-oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite thing is the smell... its very earthy and I am starting to like it actually but as the creater Leia suggests, you can add some scented oil to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its a great product and I will be buying it once I run out again!!</li>

I will update if it doesn&#x27;t work, but so far things seem great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am satisfied, and look forward to seeing the results my hair and skin achieve while using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> With dry, middle aged skin and hair, I&#x27;m always willing to try new oils and serums.  I prefer virgin and organic oils, and those without added chemicals or preservatives.  I&#x27;ve used argan oil, emu oil, and coconut oil, among others.  I hadn&#x27;t heard of Tamanu oil until Leia Naturals contacted me, so I did some research on it while waiting for my sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil is pressed from the seeds of an evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the South Pacific islands.  It&#x27;s anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-biotic, and deeply moisturizing.  Research shows that it relieves pain, fades scars, cures acne, heals burns, reduces pain from arthritis and neuralgia, and regenerates skin.  Like most oils, it&#x27;s rich in lipids (fatty acids) and vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leia Naturals Tamanu oil comes in a dark glass bottle, which protects it from oxidizing.  It has a convenient pump dispenser which allows it to be dispensed drop by drop without any waste.  It&#x27;s pure organic, cold pressed, unrefined virgin oil and it&#x27;s mixed with a carrier oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this oil on my dry, scaly elbows and did see a marked improvement after just a few days.  It absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or oily. It was also very nice as a moisturizer after I shaved my legs.  I used a few drops of it brushed through my hair before bed, and when I shampooed in the morning my hair felt hydrated and soft. I also tried using a drop or two as an anti-frizz serum, and when I used the blow dryer on it my hair was shiny and had more body. The pleasant nutty fragrance reminded me of linseed oil, although the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I didn&#x27;t try it on a cut or burn so I can&#x27;t say how it works medicinally, but as a moisturizer and beauty oil I like it a lot.  This 1 ounce (30 ml) bottle will last a long time, and the price makes it comparable to other beauty oils I&#x27;ve used.  Leia Naturals also guarantees you&#x27;ll love this oil, or they&#x27;ll refund your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have nut allergies, you should not use tamanu oil.  My daughter tried it on the dry skin underneath her eyes and had some redness and irritation the next day.  I didn&#x27;t have any reactions from using it, but I don&#x27;t have any known allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of tamanu oil for testing and review purposes. I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I otherwise compensated for giving my honest opinion..
