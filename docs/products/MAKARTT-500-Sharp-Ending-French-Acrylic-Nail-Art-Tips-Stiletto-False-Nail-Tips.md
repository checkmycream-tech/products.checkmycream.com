<li> Too wide</li>

<li> Nothing missing.</li>

<li> if you don&#x27;t know how to apply the acrylic or say this are bad quality</li>

    <li> I thought my package was lost.Post office told me it was returned to sender&amp;It arrived sometime after that.Owner/CustoMer Svc was very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Nails look good,Feel sturdy NOT flimsy,&lt;br /&gt;Packaged very neat&amp;the right amount 500ct different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE!2017 I have used them&amp;They are great! They Work just as good as any nail salon would use.I am surprised at how sturdy they are.Good quality. I do my own nails(self taught)and others&amp;this is a product i use for both.I don&#x27;t use this shape often &amp; I am updating this post 3/17 and I still have some of these tips left! I use them now to to turn into coffin shape &amp; Sqaure Shape by cutting the tip.They Make the perfect Shape! Definitely Recommend these&amp;I will purchase again.</li>

    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but as of now it seems durable. I took some out and wiggled and bend it a little And it was sturdy.  years later review, these nails are something else. its had to find one that fit your finger,</li>

    <li> My 11 year old daughter picked these out from here and my husband got them for her.  If i would have known beforehand, i would not have bought them.  Neither of them knew they were for doing tips. Not the seller or product fault. Just lack of researching on their part. I am sure they would look great.</li>

    <li> These nail tips are everything!! I no longer have to go through the trouble of shaping my nails to stiletto. They are not flimsy as some reviewers say. They come in individual bags numbered with the size. These are my new go to tips and definitely will order more when needed.</li>
