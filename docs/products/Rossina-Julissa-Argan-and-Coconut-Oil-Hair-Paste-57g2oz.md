      <li>There&#x27;s so many things I love about it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great Product, I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> This product DOES WORK very well...but the perfume smell was too strong for me and I had to return it after one use. I had hoped the smell would dissipate after some hours, but I had to wash it out. If you aren&#x27;t particularly sensitive to smells, I would recommend this. It works well without being stiff. I would have kept it for sure.</li>
    <li> beautiful packaging.  Looks expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those products where a little goes a long way - too much and your hair will look weighed down and greasy.  A little dab on towel dried hair looks amazing.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way. This texture paste is a medium hold paste that makes your hair softer in the process of giving it a messy look or whatever else you may be going for with the paste. My son&#x27; has thick, curly/wavy hair that can be dry. To counter that we use this texture paste and it has made his hair softer. This container is small and looks nice on the counter plus the container makes it easy to access just the amount you want. This does not have any overpowering scent which is nice also. I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful Argan Oil &amp; Coconut Oil Styling Hair Paste. Works wonderfully and smells wonderful! Plus will leave your hair feeling so soft and not flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil conditions and softens hair, while Argan Oil, a deep, penetrating oil, instantly absorbs into hair from root to tip. Together, this luxurious combination is becoming the number one choice for beauty products. Ilex Paraguariensis Leaf Extract is an added nutrient and antioxidant rich in vitamins and amino acids that conditions and protects hair and scalp. It&#x27;s that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> At  first I was disappointed at the size of the jar, then I discovered that a little goes a long way. To say that it gave my hair added definition is an understatement not mention the shine.  The fragrance of this unique product alone will make you glad you purchased it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I use it to style my hair everyday.</li>
    <li> It was great for my hair, and the smell was also a plus. This was my first time trying a paste, and I got interested in the product because I&#x27;m a person that&#x27;s always willing to try new things, and it paid off</li>
    <li> Really good styling paste and it smells pretty good too. Not very greasy or sticky at all. Washes out easy and does not flake. My hair looks shiny and healthy. I used to use a glue in my hair that was too stiff and flaky. I&#x27;m glad I made the switch to the Argan &amp; Coconut oil based paste.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great price. The best fragrance of any hair products I&#x27;ve ever used and it keeps your hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this! It smells great and works great! 5 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;  -jm pueblo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking out for different hair pastes out on the market and when I stumbled upon this Exotic Argan Oil Texture Hair Paste, I realized that it not only had the perfect texturing for shorter hair, but it also included a vital ingredient  which is the Argan oil.  It has coconut oil which is also beneficial for hair care.  Other hair products have parabens  and harmful by-product.  I&#x27;m just looking for the best day to day products and this one deserves the 5 stars for sure.  Smell and feel is great!</li>
    <li> Very good paste and great customer service.</li>
    <li> Allows me to firmly style/sculpt my hair without feeling greasy afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washes out quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It smells great and gives my hair soft hold.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Good hold, yet pliable and does not irritate my skin as many other hair products have.&lt;br /&gt;--Joseph S.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. Smells great, came on time</li>
    <li> This item caught my eye on Amazon due to its perfect, 5-star rating, and it did not disappoint! I purchased this after getting a short hair cut and it has helped add texture, shine and hold to my hair without the grease of other products or the sticky, crunchy feeling I get when using hair gel or mousse. It smells great, too! Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this find!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Holds well without being heavy.</li>
    <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love how soft this leaves my hair. The smell is delightful as well! It does not leave my hands for hair feeling oily either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> I tried a new product and I loved this because it is a little different. I live in Fl. where it is humid and need something with a little substance because I have long hair .It  looks shiney and thick. Other products make my hair go limp. It is also very reasonable because I have used other expensive argan oil products. I would give it a 5 star rating</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. I will always continue to use this hair product on my hair in the future. There&#x27;s no more need to search for a hair product that has the results I was looking.</li>
    <li> Very stringy and sticky.  Felt like plastic...</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I have curly, frizzy, thinning hair. I discovered that using a hair paste was a great way for me to define my curls and create a better look, so I was delighted when I found this product. Most of the hair pastes and texturizers are too dry for me and I hate the texture of my hair after I use it. This product is different. I love having argan oil in the product because I know it is making my hair healthier, and it looks good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s texture was really great and I loved the sound.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I can&#x27;t wait to receive my next jar. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Love it and love the way it smells, and it works wonders in my hair when I style my hair every morning ill be ordering this stuff again soon :) absolutely love it :).   Danielle E todd</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want to give 100 points&lt;br /&gt;Good seller !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband bec he doesn&#x27;t know what to look for. He has only usedit a few times, not every day. He doesn&#x27;t like fussing with his hair, clothes or anything. But I&#x27;m trying to show him that his hair really looks better when he uses it. And it does! He says he likes it when he uses it. Afrerall what&#x27;s not to like? It&#x27;s argan oil!</li>
    <li> Smells great and the hold/shine was perfect.</li>
    <li> Initially, I loved that it is made with Argan oil which is perfect for my natural hair. Whenever I wear a high puff or a Mohawk, this cream makes my hair look so sleek compared to when I just used daily moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over s month now and I will continue.</li>
    <li> feels and acts like glue on my fine thin 54 year old hair.  Someone please tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong.  I washed my hair and put a very small, sticky amount in my fingers and put it in my just beyond my super fine, thin shoulder length hair.  It felt like glue going in.  It looks like I have glue in my hair even after blow drying and trying to comb it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t want to ding this product as so many other people seem to benefit from it. I have always had fine, thin hair but since going through menopause I&#x27;ve lost A LOT of hair so now it is very thin. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone out there knows what I&#x27;m doing wrong I&#x27;d love to hear it.</li>
    <li> This smells great, I don&#x27;t have to use very much and it leaves my hair soft and frizz free.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky or crispy like mousse or hair spray. I&#x27;ve had it a little less than a month and used it on my hair when it was medium long, and recently got it cut pretty short, helps both lengths.  I live in the South where it&#x27;s hot and humid and I&#x27;ve tried tons of things on my naturally wavy/curly hair and never thought to use a paste of any kind.  I&#x27;m very glad I gave this a chance after reading the reviews.  I&#x27;m thinking I want my hair cut shorter to try making it spiky with this :)  haha.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great for a short spike hair style.  Does not leave hair sticky.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have fine short hair and was looking for a healthy product to give my hair a lift in the humidity of Florida summer.  I find it helpful for extra body and easy application.  Nothing will ever give me the hair I desire but this is a good product, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> This product is great for controlling frizz and those pesky flyaways without leaving your hair feeling stiff or sticky. I really love the smell, and a little goes a LONG way. Pretty sure this small jar will last me a few years, since I only use a little bit around my edges and for curl control on 2nd or 3rd day hair. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> When I travel, I need to carry hair product that I can fit into a small container for those tiny plastic bags that I need to carry-on.  Because this paste is thick, it allows me to transfer it very easy and it travels well.&lt;br /&gt;Now, let&#x27;s talk about the product itself.  I started using the product about three months ago. I use it every day and really like the scent.  Very tropical!  I dont have a lot of hair to work with and a little goes a long way.  The product works as advertised and it makes my hair look fuller/thicker without weighing it down too much.  I find that it does it&#x27;s job all day without making my hair greasy.  I plan on buying it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair, but it does grow out at a decent pace (I usually get a hair cut once a month to keep it moderately short).  This $15.00 small jar of paste says &amp;#34;Medium Hold&amp;#34; right on the label.  I&#x27;m not expecting frozen rock solid hold.  That being said, a small glob from this jar does not hold my hair back very well (when my hair has grown out a bit).  If I run a comb through after applying to paste, it is most likely to break any hold that was there.  Applying a larger amount of paste does seem to work a bit better, but then I&#x27;m not sure how long this small jar will last me.  Additionally, I do tend to run my hand through my hair often to ensure it is in the correct place; I could be breaking the hold by doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell nice, and my hair never feels too sticky or dirtied like after using the cheap axe hold paste.  Although I wish the quantity was more, I&#x27;ll say for the price it gets the job of &amp;#34;Medium Hold&amp;#34; done sufficiently.</li>
    <li> this was ok, i have used better, i didnt keep my edge slick down as long as the others i have used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cool product twice and I wish someone had been here to take photos of my hair because I can’t get selfies right to save my soul. I&#x27;m still amazed by the results. I didn’t go all out and wild with my hair style but I did give my hair body and curl. I was afraid my hair would be stiff but that wasn’t the case. My hair is straight and fine and I’ve never, until now, been able to curl my hair and keep it curled all day. The last time I used this product, I applied it and styled it in the evening, and even after sleeping on it all night, my hair was curled the next day.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product. It has a somewhat sticky texture when applying, and doesn&#x27;t spread easily until you apply heat- I use a blow drying curling iron to smooth and shape my unruly curly hair. This paste smells delicious, and once heat is applied it spreads and coats the hair smoothly and evenly. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and helps hold my hair in the curls and shapes I create for several hours.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair in place which is great since my hair is very unruly.</li>
    <li> Great texturizer! Smells amazing and lasts a really long time! Holds curls and style really well.</li>
    <li> This works very well and smells great too! It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave those flakes in your hair that look like dandruff.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Keeps hair sturdy, but not flaky or greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product, keeps my hair edges soft without a residue. I like the pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great product comparable to most hair pastes (e.g., American Crew), Its very light and has a pleasant, but not overwhelming scent. The package arrived quickly, the product is a good price, and works wonderful!</li>
    <li> One of the best products you can get to make your hair stay in place, but still want to be able to play around with it throughout the day. No hardness or oily residue.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I use it to spike my hair and it works all day!  It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Need only a little, works nice</li>
    <li> We used this on my daughters hair to help keep her hair tamed from a bad perm until her hair grows out so we can cut it. She doesn&#x27;t always style hair and most of the time just sweeps it up into bun on top of her head, but sometimes she has extra time before school and will style it and this really helps to keep it under control. I was sent this at no cost to facilitate this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out again, which seems to be a pattern I&#x27;ve formed in the cooler months. It can be hard to find a suitable style in between electrocuted porcupine and long and sleek! That&#x27;s why I enjoyed playing around with this Exotic Argan Oil Texture Paste from Rossina Julissa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s thick enough to help hold a style in place but without any of that weird stiff crunchiness or flakiness that some products cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains both argan oil and coconut oil which made my hair so shiny and moisturized! With the length it is now, it gave me that perfect tousled &amp;#34;piece-y&amp;#34; look that usually takes forever to achieve but is supposed to look like it just happened naturally. Although it provided a silky softness, the product didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all in my hair or on my hands while applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would go for something with a stronger hold if my hair was thinner or if I was going for a more extreme style, but for natural-looking, shiny locks this did the trick perfectly!</li>
    <li> I was so glad I tried this! I impulsively cut my hair into a pixie, and ended up with a disaster. I needed styling products, but I didn&#x27;t have anything in my arsenal of beauty products. This is light-it didn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff, but it controls and keeps it in place. I&#x27;m kind of obsessed with Coconut Oil, which is one of the ingredients, and this paste leaves my hair soft. It also smells amazing!</li>
    <li> My brother and I have different types of hairs so we both tried it out. I don&#x27;t even know how to describe his hairstyle but most of it is shaved and he has a section of long hair that he usually slicks back. Right now he uses a styling creme and hair spray so I had his try this. It&#x27;s a paste so it is a thicker consistency than cream. Once he had it in his hair, he combed it through to slick his hair back and hair sprayed it. It didn&#x27;t show any flakes! It had a stronger hold than the product he usually uses and he had to work it a little more than usual but all in all he said it had a good hold and he would use it again. He also said it washes out easily.  He has thick straight hair. Now for myself, I have thick, curly hair. I used this to hold down my baby hairs after I put my hair in a bun. There&#x27;s so many things I love about it. I love the smell! It held my hair down, it gave it a nice shine and no flaking! I use gel most of the time and it flakes, but I haven&#x27;t found something that would hold and not flake till now. I also love that it&#x27;s made with Argan and coconut oil which help moisturize hair. I was able to try this product at a discounted price for my honest review. Great product!</li>
    <li> I was recently introduced to Exotic Argan Oil Texture Hair Paste and I wasn’t for sure if I was going to like it or not. It seemed very thick and sticky when I was feeling it from the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an amazing smell, and after reading up on it, I saw that it does not leave any flaking or residue behind like most other pastes, gels, and mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I love how it made my hair lay down and mind its manners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the coconut oil that is in this product, it makes my hair look more healthier and alive — which is something to be said. It usually looks like horse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this paste to lightly put all in my hair to make it lay down  — and it works wonders after I flat iron it. It keeps it from flying away all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the exotic, citrusy, smell. It lasts all day it seems and does so much work for my hair. It’s great for creating and holding any hair styles with out the hard crispy feel from hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no flaking or stiffness and is non greasy. It can also be used on ends of longer hair to coat and define. It’s paraben &amp; phthalate free, and I love the fact that it is made in the USA!</li>

This product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly , it arrived in excellent condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a argan oil and coconut oil styling hair paste,great for all hair types.

    <li> I am always happy when I try a product and I like it, BUT when I try a product and I love it, I feel a huge need of telling everyone about it. I love hair products and I am always happy to try new stuff that could possibly be good for my hair and help it stay strong and look good as long as possible. My hair is long, blonde, dry, heat damaged and the top layer get  frizzy sometimes. Exotic Argan Oil Texture Paste by Rossina Julissa gives me so much confidence  every time I use this product because I just feel happy with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with this Exotic Argan Oil Texture Paste the  first time I used it. The humidity in the air after all day raining destroyed my freshly straightened hair and made it look frizzy. I just took a tiny bit of the product, rubbed it in between my palms and went through the whole hair with my fingers. This unique paste calmed down my frizzy hair instantly without leaving any stiffness or sticky and greasy residue. My hair was feeling soft, smooth and manageable as well as looking  shiny, healthy and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On days when I do not want to use heat I love using Exotic Argan Oil Texture Paste by Rossina Julissa on wet hair and then let it air dry. Gives my hair wavy frizz-free texture, body, shine and movement. It also smells great, just like pineapple gum.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this is the best product to use for any hairstyle and hair type, especially for those with dry frizzy hair. Always makes hair look healthy, shiny and frizzless without weighing it down. Exotic Argan Oil Texture Paste by Rossina Julissa comes in a plastic white jar with beautiful Oriental purple detailing on it and considering the great way that it works for the price of only $14.97, I think that this paste is a keeper and I am really enjoying using it. I will repurchase it again and highly recommend it to everyone. I am glad to announce that I have a new holy grail hair texture paste.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.

    <li> This product is great. I  have thin, baby fine hair and styling gel, hair spray, styling mousse, none of that works on my hair. This stuff, I just rub a tiny bit on my fingers and barely sweep through my hair and magic happens. I use it every day, I can even put it on that (just woke up) hair when I don&#x27;t have time to waste. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Not only does it make you look good,  it smells great!! Plus ingredients promote hair health?? Exactly what I was looking for. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have tried several different types of texture pastes, but....they all went in the garbage after trying to like them. I got my hair cut pretty short in Late 2014. I just happened to run across this product while shopping on Amazon and thought I would give it a try. I opened the jar and first noticed the soft mild scent. I am very sensitive to odors, so that is a must for me! I took a small amount and rubbed it in my hands. It wasn&#x27;t so \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; like some of the other ones I&#x27;ve used...another must! The hold is a moderate hold. It lasts between washings, without needing to re-apply. I have thick course hair and it works extremely well for me! I will be using this product as long as I keep my hair short!  Very pleased!  Julie G.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine hair and lots of flyaways. This stuff hold is together and makes my hair easier to style. Just doing braids on my hair is a challenge since it&#x27;s so stringy. But this stuff makes it easy and smells amazingggg.</li>
    <li> Sticky and paste like blue</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  I love using it on my hair and get awesome texture!  TameraD</li>
    <li> Nice smell and I like that it&#x27;s natural. Doesn&#x27;t last very long but I&#x27;d rather add more as i need than feel like it&#x27;s too sticky and have to wash it out.</li>
    <li> Fabulous, I love the fragrance and the hold is moderate but not sticky for a pomade.&lt;br /&gt;Julie A</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t give too much weight to reviews (some are fabricated), but I bought this product because of so many 5-stars, and I&#x27;m happy to report the positive reviews are 100% correct.  It&#x27;s a light paste with a very appealing aroma.  The the initial &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of it is a little different from usual pastes, but it goes on evenly and is easy to work into hair.  Once dried, it really stands out.  Gives a perfect texture, not shiny or heavy like some others.  It&#x27;s the perfect hold and look for me.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair setting gel that is not too greasy yet does the job right. Liked it and will order again. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and keeps my hair in place throughout the day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quality is also very good compare with its price.</li>
    <li> Great product, you only need a small amount so it lasts a long time. Hold is good I just wish it came in a stronger hold. Very natural look and feel to your hair. No flakes or stiffness. Overall great hair product.</li>
    <li> This paste has a fleeting pineapple/tropical scent to it. Not exactly my preferred flavor but not unpleasant. I actually like this hair &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy which is the biggest reason I try to avoid putting gel/hair spray in my hair. It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, either, so I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair more often. I only use a little of it to tame flyaways, haven&#x27;t tried it for a complicated up-do yet but it works exactly as advertised. Only downside, which is why I took away a star, is that it has silicone/alcohol in it. While the argon/coconut oil seems to balance out any kind of drying effect, that may change after a few months of use. If my hair continues to look as healthy after a few months of use due to the cumulative detrimental effect of the silicone/alcohol, I will update this to five stars.</li>
    <li> Product works exceptionally well, easy to use on damp hair.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product for supplying a decent hold without making the hair stiff. It keeps my hair in place without looking greasy, it basically just looks natural. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy or gross feeling later in the day either. It basically disappears but still works.</li>
    <li> I have been using another two hair products for a long time, however one was very expensive before being discontinued – and much more so when able to find the occasional container on eBay. My other is getting almost as hard to find – I had to order from Europe the past two times.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews of this product caught my attention for this product and I was skeptical not being familiar with the brand before, though am happy I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;It works great for men’s hair – including in the rain and hot weather without issue. The fragrance and consistency or luxurious. As a man, you do not need to worry about the fragrance being too much or embarrassing as quickly goes away relatively quickly once you applied.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it daily for about a month, and see myself buying more of it in the future.</li>
    <li> nice cream, I have been using for 3 weeks, and I liked it so far..</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast!!!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this hair product.  I used it everyday.  It was perfect for my hard part and was not hard to apply.  It dried looking natural and no flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Zach S</li>
