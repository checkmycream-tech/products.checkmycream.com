### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>After doing some research I found that the best brushes to have for your hair are the 100 percent boar bristle brushes.</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE BEST BRUSH GOING!!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>The quality of this thing is great not losing bristles</li>
      <li>WAS I HAPPY.</li>
      <li>this is a good brush.</li>
      <li>Good purchase here....</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>Good service.</li>
      <li>nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>I am relatively pleased anyway because it brushes through my hair and gives a good scalp massage.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this brush if you want a real true boar bristle brush.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this boar bristle brush.</li>
      <li>My hair is shinier and more</li>
      <li>It is not &amp;#34;6 inches&amp;#34; in length, it&#x27;s more like 9 inches, a full-sized brush.</li>
      <li>There is more nylon than bore bristles in this brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d after a bath both easily</li>
      <li>i have fine, shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice brush, with a lovely comfortable handle, and nice stiff boar bristles.</li>
      <li>I contacted the manufacturer of this brush and confirmed that this brush is boar/nylon, not boar.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t grip your hair,  it slide right over your hair on top.  </li>
      <li>And has many more lines of bristles than my older worn out brushes.  </li>
      <li>And has many more lines of bristles than my older worn out brushes.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased this natural bristle brush to help eliminate static and for that it works OK.  </li>
      <li>This brush pulls smoothly through my hair and gives it shine, reaches to the scalp, is gentle yet thorough.</li>
      <li>This brush is worth every penny of the cost.</li>
      <li>So I got this brush and so far I just love it.</li>
      <li>Most of the brushes out there only get the surface.  </li>
      <li>For my everyday brush, I like the Mason Pearson &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; which is boar/nylon also but will go through my hair much more easily than this brush.  </li>
      <li>It is hard to find a good one.</li>
      <li>What I really like is the way it makes my scalp feel.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a real hair brush for sometime now.</li>
      <li>But it is gentle and detangles effectivley.</li>
      <li>expected more because of others&#x27; glowing reviews.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this one to anyone who is looking for the real thing.</li>
      <li>decent brush i guess.  </li>
      <li>Well needless to say I found this wonderful brush only on amazon.</li>
      <li>WOW!!</li>
      <li>After my favorite brush wore out, a few years ago, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brushes.  </li>
      <li>It would be good for thin hair.</li>
      <li>I have been using boar bristle brushes all my life and mine were very old and worn and needed replacing.  </li>
      <li>I have been using boar bristle brushes all my life and mine were very old and worn and needed replacing.  </li>
      <li>Well I couldn&#x27;t be happier, it is definatly still enough to massage my scalp and easy to pull through my long hair.  </li>
      <li>this brush does a good job of getting through moderately thick long hair.</li>
      <li>I can highly recommend this brush for anyone with long hair that&#x27;s looking for a boars bristle at a reasonable price.</li>

      <li>The bristles are much too short.  </li>
      <li>It is good and stiff and will go through my hair and is good if you use ayurvedic hair oils before shampooing to spread them through your hair since the base is wood.  </li>
      <li>I like a stiff brush that goes all the way through to my scalp and could never find one to fit the bill.  </li>

      <li>This brush goes all the way to your scalp for a complete brushing and a scalp massage at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I barely slit the plastic bag enclosing the brush just to see and it would not go through my hair.  </li>

<li> I had looked in the beauty supply stores and they were all too soft or the bristles were too short for my long hair.</li>
<li> A brush that doesn&#x27;t have long bristles on the outside and short ones on the inside.  </li>
<li> ESPECIALLY FOR MY WIFE WHO HAS LONG THINNER HAIR.</li>
<li> It has a large enough handle for someone with the beginning of arthritis to hang onto, stiff enough bristles to do an efficient job, and is shaped to get through thick hair and brush all of it.  </li>
<li> It gets through the tangles in my wet h</li>
<li> This is not 100% boar bristles but there are a few mixed in.  </li>
<li> this brush is a nylon bristle brush with just a few boar bristles mixed in.</li>
<li> a little heavy though, and kind of expensive!</li>
<li> I also have the Mason Pearson &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; which IS pure boar and very stiff to go through thick long hair.  </li>
<li> If you have thick hair this brush does not get to the roots enough to stimulate the scalp.  </li>
<li> A lot of money for something I could buy at Walmart for much less.</li>
<li> BUT A LITTLE PRICIER.. THOUGHT WE WOULD TRY THIS</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to use any oils with a pneumatic base brush as it might damage the rubber, so this cheaper brush is just right for the uses I have.  </li>
<li> Useless</li>

    <li> this brush is a nylon bristle brush with just a few boar bristles mixed in. for this price it should be all boar bristles......</li>
    <li> nothing spectacular. decent brush i guess.  i have fine, shoulder length hair. expected more because of others&#x27; glowing reviews. it does distribute oil like others said</li>
    <li> YEARS AGO WE BOUGHT HAIRBRUSHES JUST LIKE THIS. THEN YOU DIDN&#x27;T SEE THEM ALOT, AS TIME WENT BY. THEY ARE SOLD BY ANOTHER CO. BUT A LITTLE PRICIER.. THOUGHT WE WOULD TRY THIS AND HOPED IT WOULD WORK OUT. WOW!! WAS I HAPPY. THIS IS THE BEST BRUSH GOING!! ESPECIALLY FOR MY WIFE WHO HAS LONG THINNER HAIR. SHE JUST LOVES THE WAY  HER HAIR GETS AFTER BRUSHING. NO FLY-AWAY HAIR.  WILL BE BACK FOR ANOTHER.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this boar bristle brush. It gets through the tangles in my wet h a I&#x27;d after a bath both easily and without damaging my hair. I recommend this to all my friends and family!!!</li>
    <li> this brush does a good job of getting through moderately thick long hair. My hair is shinier and more \\&quot;in control\\&quot; after using this brush</li>
    <li> I returned in same box on same day as received.  The bristles are much too short.  I barely slit the plastic bag enclosing the brush just to see and it would not go through my hair.  A lot of money for something I could buy at Walmart for much less.</li>
    <li> There is more nylon than bore bristles in this brush. I would not recommend this brush if you want a real true boar bristle brush. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair this brush does not get to the roots enough to stimulate the scalp.  This is the second brush I ordered from this company, and it doesn&#x27;t quite make it.  It would be good for thin hair.</li>
    <li> Who could believe a hairbrush could make such a difference! This brush pulls smoothly through my hair and gives it shine, reaches to the scalp, is gentle yet thorough. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> this is a good brush. a little heavy though, and kind of expensive! But it is gentle and detangles effectivley.</li>
    <li> Finally!  A brush that doesn&#x27;t have long bristles on the outside and short ones on the inside.  This brush goes all the way to your scalp for a complete brushing and a scalp massage at the same time.  After my favorite brush wore out, a few years ago, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brushes.  This one hit the spot!  It has a large enough handle for someone with the beginning of arthritis to hang onto, stiff enough bristles to do an efficient job, and is shaped to get through thick hair and brush all of it.  Most of the brushes out there only get the surface.  This brush is worth every penny of the cost.</li>
    <li> This is not 100% boar bristles but there are a few mixed in.  I am relatively pleased anyway because it brushes through my hair and gives a good scalp massage.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t grip your hair,  it slide right over your hair on top.  Useless</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush, with a lovely comfortable handle, and nice stiff boar bristles. However the description is not correct. It is not &amp;#34;6 inches&amp;#34; in length, it&#x27;s more like 9 inches, a full-sized brush.</li>
