      <li>Cream is very smooth and easy to apply.  </li>

      <li>I found this cream in Honolulu at the ABC Stores and let me tell you if you suffer from eczema this is the best to help control the itching I can not live without it.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s great for smoothing on hands and heels prior to bedtime.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great on your skin; especially if you have problems with dryness.</li>
      <li>free  part of it.  </li>
      <li>I use it as a moisturizer and to keep my feet soft and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>I love finding something new and really enjoying it.</li>
      <li>but it is great on winter dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Good for dry skin, very soothing and nice texture.</li>
      <li>I think the body lotion might work better for me but its soft and fluffy texture is delightful.</li>
      <li>I mostly use it in the winter time and it really helps.</li>
      <li>The kukui moisturizer works better than high-end creams costing four or five times as much.</li>
      <li>Sis was very pleased to open it and have the top quality cream, fragrance free, to keep her face soft.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin very soft, it&#x27;s very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a great skin care product that will actually heal your skin and make it feel so very soft.</li>
      <li>Very soothing and light weight feel</li>
      <li>I LOVE it - makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
      <li>The oil from a freshly picked nut will stop the itching of insect bites.  </li>
      <li>The product also does not smell quite right.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful basic moisturizer cream for everyday use.</li>
      <li>I have bought this very product directly from Oils of Aloha - love it for summer skin - and decided to give these guys a shot because they were cheaper.</li>
      <li>When I opened the jar the product was not up to the top and there was a HAIR - looked like a fine, black animal hair -</li>
      <li>If it keeps working I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>, Amazon is always my first stop when looking for things, so I tried and found it.  </li>
      <li>Not geasy, makes your skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Great to use after being  at the beach&lt;br /&gt;and being in the sun!</li>
      <li>This product melts right in but with my dry skin I could use a more moisturizing product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just a basic cheap cream you could get for a couple of bucks almost anywhere.</li>
      <li>The very 1st ingredient listed is Water.</li>
      <li>There is way too much water in this cream ...</li>
      <li>I have used other products that are better.</li>
      <li>I believe it makes a significant difference in whether I look burned the next day or not.</li>
      <li>It is all natural, soft not goopy, has no odor, does not stain clothes - I&#x27;ve got only good words for this terrific product.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine who goes to Hawaii quite regularly had this cream, she said it would be great to put on and should bring the color down by the next day, so I used it.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is effective, nicely unscented but not entirely free of an extremely subtle natural olfactory cue.  </li>
      <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about 8 years and it completely erased the &amp;#34;Living</li>
      <li>not waste time or money on this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream.</li>
      <li>I am amazed how it penetrates the skin, disappears from view, but your skin is soft for hours and hours and hours.  </li>
      <li>With this Kukui cream I use way less Super Glue now.  </li>
      <li>I do have prescription cream also that I use during outbreaks due to quick climate changes or extreme dry periods, but Kukui helps very much during normal times.</li>
      <li>Upon further inspection the jar was clearly old and used (paint chipping off and scuffed up).</li>
      <li>Just another product that promises much and delivers little.</li>

<li> I still love the lotion, but I was disappointed about the misinterpretation of the meaning of &#x27;cream.&#x27;</li>
<li> I almost gave this 5-starts but held off for a single reason--the slow absorption (typically, even with working in, the lotion is still visible for several minutes).  </li>
<li> I have to wonder if they &#x27;water down this product&#x27;.</li>
<li> I usually use both Kukui Oil and a cream together to fight dry skin.</li>
<li> I have really sensitive skin and often have various rashes, etc during the cold winter months.  </li>
<li> My skin cracks so bad I have to use Super Glue to seal up the cracks.  </li>
<li> It is heavy and greasy.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious smell and the cream itself isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream does not have the same effect as the Kukui oil!  I far prefer Origins A Perfect World or Eucerin to this cream.  I usually use both Kukui Oil and a cream together to fight dry skin.</li>
    <li> I spend hours in the sun daily. In addition to multiple applications of sunscreen &amp; taking astaxanthin, I use Oils of Aloha in my regimen (post-sun exposure). I believe it makes a significant difference in whether I look burned the next day or not.</li>
    <li> Kukui cream and oil is great for helping to control my eczema. I use it as often as necessary.  I do have prescription cream also that I use during outbreaks due to quick climate changes or extreme dry periods, but Kukui helps very much during normal times.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time. The only moisturizer I use on my face. Great wrinkle cream.</li>
    <li> This fragrance free cream is a great cream that absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and softens skin beautifully. It&#x27;s great for smoothing on hands and heels prior to bedtime.</li>
    <li> After only 48 hours I can visibly see how the facial lines have softened. I am anxious to see what a week will do. If it keeps working I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> This cream is all I ever use on my face and have been a customer of the company for more than a decade. I receive many compliments on my skin and always say I owe it all to Oils of Aloha. I&#x27;m thrilled to see it&#x27;s available now on Amazon, which I learned just this morning. The kukui moisturizer works better than high-end creams costing four or five times as much. I live in Hawaii so I can buy it many places here, but its availability on Amazon will help me send it with ease to friends and family on the mainland.</li>
    <li> A friend brought this back to me fro m Hawaii. I ordered this once the gift ran out.  It&#x27;s identical.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> i first bought this cream in Hawaii, and loved it.  I found out I could get it here on the mainland via Amazon, and have ordered several jars of it.  It has Kukui oil and Vitamin E, both very light and healing.  It absorbs quickly and is very light.  Great for chapped cheeks on kids!  I use it as a moisturizer and to keep my feet soft and in good condition.  It is the oils that are in it.  I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> For Xmas, I asked my sister if she&#x27;d like an expensive department store face cream. She said, NO - I like the Hawaiian cream you bought for me when we were in Maui. So I looked it up on Amazon and found it. Sis was very pleased to open it and have the top quality cream, fragrance free, to keep her face soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  It soaks into the skin with no oily feel at all, but it moisturizes dry skin like a prescription medicine.  My skin cracks so bad I have to use Super Glue to seal up the cracks.  With this Kukui cream I use way less Super Glue now.  I have tried many skin creams and this product is the best I have come upon so far.  Give the product a try.  It has no after-effects like bad odor, oily or sticky feelings, etc.  I am amazed how it penetrates the skin, disappears from view, but your skin is soft for hours and hours and hours.  Buy it!  I believe you will be impressed as I am.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter who has psoriasis and it has lessened her inflammation. Great product</li>
    <li> The kukui nut oil has some amazing properties.  The oil from a freshly picked nut will stop the itching of insect bites.  This cream does not contain enough oil to do that but it is great on winter dry skin.  I have given some to friends who have eczema and they said the cream has soothed and healed.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased and will continue to use it.We will continue to buy the product in the coming months.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful basic moisturizer cream for everyday use. Good for dry skin, very soothing and nice texture. I discovered this in Hawaii and have been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> This did not live up to the hype about it. I used it at night and as an under makeup moisturizer for several weeks. It is heavy and greasy. I have used other products that are better. I would suggest that&lt;br /&gt;anyone not waste time or money on this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream. Just another product that promises much and delivers little.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream! Very soothing and light weight feel&lt;br /&gt;Will order again definitely it reminds me of the consistency of a serum</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin very soft, it&#x27;s very light and absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer. I have very dry skin and I noticed a difference after a week of using it.  I used it along with kukui oil, don&#x27;t think it would have been as effective on its own but still a good product.</li>
    <li> I am on vacation and yesterday I didn&#x27;t to lotion my face, figured since I was under an umbrella it didn&#x27;t matter, boy was I wrong!!!  S at about five o&#x27;clock when I looked in the mirror I was horrified, I was sooooo red.  A friend of mine who goes to Hawaii quite regularly had this cream, she said it would be great to put on and should bring the color down by the next day, so I used it.  I was so happy when I woke this morning to find my face a perfect shade of tan and not red, it truly is a miracle worker.  So this morning I knew I had to buy some for myself, Amazon is always my first stop when looking for things, so I tried and found it.  Now it will be waiting for me when I get home, I am also going to try it as an everyday moisturizer.  Btw I burnt my face a lot when I was younger so even though my face was lobster red I had no pain so I don&#x27;t know if it takes pain away with the redness, my guess is that it does.</li>
    <li> Not geasy, makes your skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Great to use after being  at the beach&lt;br /&gt;and being in the sun!</li>
    <li> Great for skin, non oily,velvety and a  great moisturizer, would recommend to anyone with or without dry skin. Try  it!</li>
    <li> Living in Hawaii, this has been a staple beauty product for me! I love this item. I have combination type dark skin, and it really helps moisturize without being harsh on my face. It doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious smell and the cream itself isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy. I mostly use it in the winter time and it really helps. If you have dry or eczema skin, this product does wonders!</li>
    <li> The oil is better, but this is still good.</li>
    <li> The cream was o.k. but it started smelling bad after a short time and it turned rancid. I wasted my money,could not use this product.  It smelled  terrible</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and often have various rashes, etc during the cold winter months.  This cream worked wonders for me - cleared up skin areas in about three weeks that I&#x27;ve suffered with for years.  It is all natural, soft not goopy, has no odor, does not stain clothes - I&#x27;ve got only good words for this terrific product.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin care product that will actually heal your skin and make it feel so very soft. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  We first bought a small bottle of it in Hawaii at the ABC store, so as we were getting low on it I decided to check Amazon.  I picked this \\&quot;cream\\&quot; over the bottle of lotion because I thought it would be thicker than the lotion, but it turns out to be the same consistency--just in a different container.  I still love the lotion, but I was disappointed about the misinterpretation of the meaning of &#x27;cream.&#x27;</li>
    <li> This product melts right in but with my dry skin I could use a more moisturizing product.  I think the body lotion might work better for me but its soft and fluffy texture is delightful.</li>
    <li> I received this from my daughter-in-law on a trip to Kauai.  I LOVE it - makes my skin feel so soft.  Although it doesn&#x27;t say it, it is for night use, because it doesn&#x27;t have an SPF rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to any over-40-yr-old who knows it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;sun-proof.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Nice cream very light not heavy or greasy feeling has a great healing effect to it .got it for chapped skin and itchey skin and it works well for that .</li>
    <li> This cream is non greasy, and I love the fragrance free  part of it.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a really good moisterizer without perfume.</li>
    <li> Except for the kukui oil it&#x27;s just a basic cheap cream you could get for a couple of bucks almost anywhere. This stuff made my face break out in an awful rash which defeats the purpose of using it for eczema. Your mileage may vary. Mine was terrible.</li>
    <li> It is the best all around cream for itching burns sore spots,I would not be without it, I make sure I have it on hand all the time</li>
    <li> I have used the oil before but thought I&#x27;d try this cream. There is way too much water in this cream ... so it&#x27;s not very creamy at all. The very 1st ingredient listed is Water. I have to wonder if they &#x27;water down this product&#x27;. I won&#x27;t be buying this cream again because I feel like I am applying creamy white water. I will go back to using their oils.</li>
    <li> Cream is very smooth and easy to apply.  Does not remain greasy, which is a big plus when you are in a hurry.  I love finding something new and really enjoying it.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite of mine. This is one of the best skin are products I have found. Would recommend to others</li>
    <li> This product is a facelift in a jar. I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about 8 years and it completely erased the &amp;#34;Living In A Desert Lines&amp;#34; I had.</li>
    <li> So, I never write reviews until now. I have bought this very product directly from Oils of Aloha - love it for summer skin - and decided to give these guys a shot because they were cheaper. Mistake.  When I opened the jar the product was not up to the top and there was a HAIR - looked like a fine, black animal hair - in the top ON the cream. Upon further inspection the jar was clearly old and used (paint chipping off and scuffed up). The product also does not smell quite right. Not sure what the deal is but as someone who knows what this stuff is supposed to smell like coupled with the packaging - very fishy.</li>
    <li> This stuff works for so many things!! We use it for dry skin and any other skin issues and nothing compares!</li>
    <li> I found this cream in Honolulu at the ABC Stores and let me tell you if you suffer from eczema this is the best to help control the itching I can not live without it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It absorbs well and is not greasy. I usually will break out even with non-comedogenic lotions if I don&#x27;t thin them out. But I don&#x27;t have to thin this lotion - I apply it as is and not just a thin coat either.  It helps keep my skin balanced, and it is so great for sun burns.</li>
    <li> Ever since I took my Mom to Hawaii for a couple of weeks, we&#x27;ve been purchasing this cream. It&#x27;s great on your skin; especially if you have problems with dryness.</li>
    <li> My skin rebelled when I moved from Hawaii to Nevada - my fingertips were forever cracking and bleeding until I began to use this.  Loving it!</li>
    <li> Perfect choice to moisturize sunburn skin. The skin won&#x27;t peel off. Skin is moisturized and it helps with the pain sensation too.</li>
    <li> Good product, didn&#x27;t work for my granddaughter though</li>
    <li> I almost gave this 5-starts but held off for a single reason--the slow absorption (typically, even with working in, the lotion is still visible for several minutes).  Otherwise, it is effective, nicely unscented but not entirely free of an extremely subtle natural olfactory cue.  The ingredient list is reassuring.</li>
