<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great deal on the price for the amount of product!</li>
    <li> Never knew shampoo could make this big of a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Love this shampoo and conditioner. It has helped with thickness and breakage and you only have to use a little amount. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Leaves hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> great stuff, good company</li>
    <li> love the product.  has helped my hair heal from heat damage</li>
    <li> Best thing I have ever done for my hair. It&#x27;s smooth, shiny, stronger!! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy fine hair. Pureology leaves my hair silky smooth with no frizz.</li>
    <li> This is really great stuff!!  I mean that it&#x27;s absolutely amazing!  It transformed my tired, dry hair into gorgeous, shiny, bouncy tresses.  I regularly color my hair in addition to heat styling several times a week so my hair was definitely in the mood for some serious TLC.  This shampoo/conditioner states that it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;micro scarred&amp;#34; hair (whatever that means, lol!).  However, I consider my mane to be seriously &amp;#34;scarred&amp;#34; so this seemed like a likely choice for damage control.  These products totally revived and rejuvenated my seriously abused hair and turned it healthy looking and happy.  It only takes a small amount of product so this bottle actually lasts longer than you may think at first glance.  For my shoulder length hair, a dollop of shampoo the size of a quarter was plenty and I used an even smaller amount of conditioner.  The Pureology line is specifically for color treated hair and I can tell that the company pays very close attention to their formulas. This formula has protein for strength and hydrating oils and other moisturizers for shine.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month and I can honestly say the difference is awesome.  And they are very gentle, yet the shampoo cleanses well and the conditioner has a lot of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so detangling is easy.  I also really like the fragrance, although it dissipates rather quickly.  My hair is now in such good shape that it responds really well to my styling efforts.  I have made these products my HG hair care brand.  I&#x27;ve never used anything remotely like them.  Yes, they are expensive.  But I have a hall closet full of hair product FAILS that I&#x27;ve wasted countless dollars on so I&#x27;m not the least bit uneasy about spending money for products that actually do what they claim.  I love this stuff.  It works like magic.  Use it for a month and you&#x27;ll understand just how good they are. And the results just keep getting better and better.  I highly recommend this excellent shampoo and conditioner.  If you have hair like mine, the transformation will be profound.  They are absolutely extraordinary!!.  If you have hair like mine, the transformation will be profound.  They are absolutely extraordinary!!</li>
    <li> Product same quality as salon,  just way cheaper.</li>
    <li> It has really helped my hair become more healthy and feel softer than ever before!</li>
    <li> I have been using Pureology products for a while, recommended by my hair dresser. This is their newest product. I have fine hair and it gets frizzy esp in the sun. I have been looking for something that smooth&#x27;s my hair and this works great, I use it with Pureology Fabulous Lengthening Treatment.</li>
    <li> I have used Pureology for years now and this particular line is ok, my hair is just not smooth enough after conditioning.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
    <li> I noticed a huge difference in my hair just after a couple uses. Awsome shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> The first use made my dry damaged hair soft and shiny, great product and worth the money.. You only need one pump each time you wash your hair. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Really like this product, except it makes my hair oily to where I have to wash daily.</li>
    <li> Wow! Leaps and bounds better than any other shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner. I really enjoy and see results after the 2nd use. My hair feels alot stronger and healthier!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner, and here you get a LOT of it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been using it about six months, since my hairdresser gave me a sample.  They leave my hair softer than anything I&#x27;ve used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best price I found.  Delivery was prompt and as promised.  All &#x27;round great experience.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Love Pureology. Better price than salon</li>
    <li> Love this stuff my hair made a huge improvement just after 6 washes. I am 41 years old and had started buying over the counter stuff. I have to dye my roots every 2 weeks and although I mix my own and don&#x27;t use the store box dye, my hair lost all its shine and was brittle! I feel like I can style my hair without damage love the smell and my shine is back. I also got the leave in stuff that goes with this the strengthener.</li>
    <li> Great smell to the shampoo and conditioner, my hair is soft and wonderful using this.</li>
    <li> My fragile hair needs help and this is the one.  I can wash and condition daily without fear of drying and breaking.</li>
    <li> Very glad I bought this and tried this line. I have used the Pureology Hydrate line - which is more geared for moisture,and has a conditioner leaves a mint-scent and minty feel when you use it, especially when you leave it on for a few minutes. If you are interested in keeping your hair strong and healthy, or if it is damaged at all - or if you color it, I would definitely try this. Even if your hair is healthy I would try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a proponent of using Pureology - there are no sulfates, its Vegan and its concentrated so you only need to use a small amount compared to other brands of hair products. I am growing my hair out so my focus is on keeping it healthy and I color my hair dark brown, every couple months I update the roots. I already love this new Strength Cure line, and had used Essential Repair line before as well as the Hydrate. Definitely recommend it if you care about keeping your hair healthy and strong!</li>
    <li> Love Pureology. I espeically love the Stength Cure line. It smells so nice and my hair is so healthy.</li>
    <li> My hair is vibrant and full worth the ptice.</li>
    <li> It worked fine. I wasn&#x27;t wowed.</li>
    <li> When I first looked for a product to help strengthen my hair, I was excited to come across this shampoo/conditioner set with excellent reviews.  The only complaint that I could find was that it smells like baby powder.  I&#x27;ve always loved the Pureology line up until now. Since I started using this product, going on 3 months soon, I&#x27;ve noticed some at first great results and now just terrible. The first month was great!  My hair was shiny, happy, healthy and felt strong. Then the acne started around my ears, forehead, neck, chest and back.  I felt like a teenager going through puberty all over.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing this since the only thing that I had changed was the shampoo/conditioner.  I started really looking into the ingredients used in this set and realized that they&#x27;ve changed a lot of the formulas and now include pore clogging ingredients.  As you can imagine for a 37 year old woman this is mortifying!  Needless to say that I will not purchase further products from Pureology.  What a shame!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite shampoo/conditioner products! It leaves your hair feeling very clean and helps protect against damage. I have very thin, color-treated hair and this shampoo/conditioner provides excellent protection and strengthening for the hair. The only reason I did not give it a 5 stars is you have to use the  shampoo and conditioner together. If you only use the shampoo, your hair feels dry and is difficult to brush. Once you add the conditioner your hair feels smooth and is de-tangled but if you have oily hair, you may not like it since you do have to use the conditioner every time.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! I use it all the time after discovering it at the hair salon Mario Tricocci! It leaves your hair feeling so silk and it&#x27;s good for your hair. Lots of natural ingredients.. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper buying through Amazon. There is one store by me that charges $76 just for one and the hair salon charges $67 for one! Do not pass this up.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. These products are wonderful for your hair!!</li>
    <li> Love love this product!!! My hair feels thicker and healthier. And it smells good</li>
    <li> Love this product immensely ..great to repair damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for color processed &amp; damaged hair. Nice fragrance &amp; soft silky feeling. I&#x27;m very pleased with both products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and the Shampoo and Conditioner are both FANTASTIC products. My hair is so much healthier and shines.</li>
    <li> Great price, my wife loves this shampoo, so much cheaper on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Great smell- like baby powder. My hair is frizzy and dry- this shampoo and conditioner makes is feels smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Good value for a great product</li>
    <li> i use this shampoo and conditioner, my hair is breaking. i love it&lt;br /&gt;it leaves your hair soft and smelling great.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo to make my dry/fried hair silky smooth and soft. Beautiful and healthy!! Absolutely reccomend :)</li>
    <li> Liquid GOLD! I Love it! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great product, cheaper then the salon</li>
    <li> Love this product for my color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the conditioner is thick and works well.  Better price than any salon.</li>
    <li> Been using pureology line for a couple of years now and I love their products my hair is stronger and healthier thicker fuller . Last product I have been using is their strenght line I noticed a dramatic reduction of hair loss my hair grew beyond shoulder length which was impossible before hairdresser was surprised of how strong my hair reacted to color processing especially bleaching it wouldn&#x27;t break and if 5 hairs fell off during chemical process it was a lot. She asked what I use I said pureology strength shampoo conditioner it really works!</li>
