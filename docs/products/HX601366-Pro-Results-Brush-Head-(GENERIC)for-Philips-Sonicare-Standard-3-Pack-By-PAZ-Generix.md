      <li>These are just as good as name brand.</li>
      <li>A fair balance of savings and quality.</li>
      <li>Honestly it worked great for 3 weeks</li>
      <li>These are just as good as the name brand brushes.</li>
      <li>However, this is a good price for the amount you&#x27;re getting.</li>
      <li>And they fit perfectly!</li>
      <li>Good price</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  </li>
      <li>It would be much more sanitary with a cover on it!</li>
      <li>Glad I decided to try them!</li>
      <li>These work pretty well, but aren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
      <li>These are great for the price but doesn&#x27;t quite fit as well as the name brand ones.</li>
      <li>These Fit great.</li>
      <li>Great price, grate fit for me brush!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great cheap replacement for sonicare brush heads.</li>
      <li>The price is nice, but the heads keep pulling apart and getting stuck on the brush handle.</li>
      <li>OK, the price is, like, really, really good.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s kind of a pain to do every time</li>
      <li>they work just as good as the more costly ones.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years, but this new Sonicare toothbrush is the best yet.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this substitute is working as good as the original replacement heads</li>
      <li>I find this to be more superior than that of the original brushes...</li>
      <li>was too good to be true</li>
      <li>So fresh and so clean!!!</li>
      <li>While these are more inexpensive, they are also cheaper.</li>
      <li>It hurts the pocketbook to pay more.  </li>
      <li>Buy Philips production would be better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I chose to order this product.</li>
      <li>These are 2 piece, lose bristles, don&#x27;t fit teeth!  </li>
      <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Double win!</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so much better after using it.</li>
      <li>They seem to be labelled better now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found these.  </li>
      <li>all three light gray!  </li>
      <li>would like more colored ring options to differentiate between our toothbrushes though.</li>
      <li>This is a problem if more than one person uses the handle.</li>
      <li>You will need to change the head much more often so in reality the cheaper price balances out.</li>
      <li>After seeing authentic replacement brushes for $40, I opted for the cheaper solution.  </li>
      <li>I have the Sonicare Healthy White, and these things are a perfect replacement.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see that there wasn&#x27;t much a difference in appearance and that the brush head fit perfect on the holder.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try the brushes and am still appreciative of the medium bristles.  </li>
      <li>Works great arrived early and cost 25% of the OEM replacement.  </li>
      <li>They do what they do, clean your teeth and leave them feeling clean and fresh!!!</li>
      <li>I was able to pull the one off my previous brush head and it fit on these perfectly.  </li>
      <li>You could hold it in place, but then your finger dampens the vibration and there will not be as strong of a vibration needed to most effectively clean your teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very good quality and deal given that the standard brush heads for the sonic diamond clean are +$40.</li>
      <li>they aren&#x27;t quite as nice, but nice enough for sure.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, my teeth do not feel as clean.  </li>
      <li>These replacement heads work fine once attached.</li>
      <li>2-3 weeks is doing just fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line for me is that I&#x27;d buy these again without hesitation, even knowing that they are of a lower quality- where it counts they are just fine.  </li>
      <li>The fit for mine is fine, but still can&#x27;t recommend.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my brush handle quite as smoothly as the manufacturer&#x27;s and caused a bit of corrosion to appear on the metal shaft they fit onto.</li>
      <li>It looks like others experienced different.</li>
      <li>These brushes do the job and fit well.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t properly fit my Pro-results sonicare, at all.</li>
      <li>These off-brand ProResults heads didn&#x27;t fit as well as brand labeled ProResults heads.</li>
      <li>Keep one from your name brand ones and they will fit on these,</li>
      <li>this cheap.</li>
      <li>Although &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; they don&#x27;t fit HX6930.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>This brush is softer, does fit on the toothbrush handle quite well, but</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>The generics don&#x27;t totally fit on the toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t even fit on the model they claim to be made for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Same quality as the non-generic version, but much better on my wallet. I&#x27;m so glad I found these.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying these again when I need more.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately these doesn&#x27;t work with my model. I thought I searched for the e series so didn&#x27;t question them. They look great, according to the description they come with caps for travel, these don&#x27;t have any.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for here. The price is nice, but the heads keep pulling apart and getting stuck on the brush handle. I would not buy this product again. To me it isn&#x27;t worth the savings to deal with the quality issues.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush. My teeth feel so much better after using it. And the price for brush heads on Amazon makes the purchase well worth it compared to anywhere else.</li>
    <li> They come apart every time you take it off the unit, and the metal pieces on the inside, near the base, instantly started to rust.  The original brushes that came with the kit were fine, but the replacements are junk.  They also fit so tight on the handle that you can barely get them off.</li>
    <li> This is the lowest price I have found these at. They seem to be just the same as the brand name ones that are twice the price on the shelf. I&#x27;ve had one on my toothbrush for 6 weeks and it still looks like new. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I was excited to see that there wasn&#x27;t much a difference in appearance and that the brush head fit perfect on the holder. However, I don&#x27;t like the way some bristles at the top sway back and forth in a crazy manner shooting toothpaste everywhere. The original heads don&#x27;t do this. I don&#x27;t feel like this substitute is working as good as the original replacement heads but it will do for now.</li>
    <li> Excellent value and looks and feels just like the OEM brushes. Will know in a month or so how long they last. If no further post, then they are OK and wear just like OEM</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother trying to save money on sonicare toothbrush heads, these are nowhere near the quality of the philips branded heads. Hard to pull off handle, and the bristle wear out quickly. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they&#x27;d be quality generics, like the last sets i bought at Target and bed bath and beyond.  NOT EVEN CLOSE&lt;br /&gt;the quality  of the bristles is very poor.  they are cut in a very strange manor and feel more used after one use than a quality head does after weeks.  i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a replacement for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in the product overall, nothing like the actual sonicare heads or even a quality knock-off</li>
    <li> The fibers of the brush have a tendency to pop off (just a couple on one) and I&#x27;m sure they aren&#x27;t exactly as high quality as the name brand version, but they do the job just fine and so if you&#x27;re tight on cash these are a great replacement until you can save up for the real ones.</li>
    <li> Poor quality!First use on the bad!Would never buy again!I propose everyone not to buy this product.Buy Philips production would be better</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t go cheap and get these generic ones. They don&#x27;t fit the toothbrush very well and the bristles are much softer and less effective than the real Sonicare replacements. My mistake but won&#x27;t make it again.</li>
    <li> These things are as cheap as possible. They feel flimsy, don&#x27;t have the spot for the little rubber color band and don&#x27;t look like the picture.</li>
    <li> I bought these brush heads thinking that, even if they only lasted a couple of months, the price would still be better than buying new Philips brush heads.  Unfortunately, each began rusting on the inside within about 2 weeks.  The first one rusted so bad, I almost couldn&#x27;t get the brush head off of the toothbrush.  I admit that I left the brush head on the toothbrush for those 2 weeks.  But I never had a problem with the original Philips brush heads.  Anyway, the rust started on the second and third brush heads even though I removed the brush head each day and let it dry.  There is a little gap between the shaft and the base.  It doesn&#x27;t look like a gap, but that&#x27;s where the water gets in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the quality of these generic brush heads is terrible.</li>
    <li> this is a very low quality product. It is not worth using as it just slips out of the electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> I am very much a generic advocate, but these just don&#x27;t work as well.  I tried these generics three different times (9 brush heads in total).  This last time I bought the generic and real and did an experiment where I alternated them.  There was a very noticeable difference.  The generics don&#x27;t totally fit on the toothbrush.  This causes the toothbrush to have rattling sound that is much louder than when normal heads are on it.  Also, the bristles tend to come loose and end up floating around in your mouth. Most importantly, my teeth do not feel as clean.  My wife and I interchange heads for the same base when we travel and it is really hard to get them on and off.  I had her do the experiment as well, she found the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They still work, but they are half as good.  I&#x27;m all for saving money, but not if means my teeth are half as clean.</li>
    <li> Lets face it, the brushes all wear out sooner than we like.  These are just as good as name brand.</li>
    <li> Shame on me for buying.  Shame on Amazon for Selling...These are 2 piece, lose bristles, don&#x27;t fit teeth!  Come apart.  Smell Bad.  Hurt your gunms.</li>
    <li> I have had better luck with these generic brush heads than I do when I pay the full price.  They seem to last longer than the other brand.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Sonicare toothbrush, although the heads can be expensive, compared to almost anything else (besides dental bills.)  The the brush heads have lately been underwhelming: The last two packages I bought were flawed: the heads would not come off the handle/spindle thingie without a huge struggle.  Understand, this was not every head, just three in two packages of three (one, in one and two in the other, to be clear). I was worried about breaking the handle. Indeed, one of the heads came apart as we tried to remove it. At the cost of these things, and with the recommended three month replacement period, I am paying way too much.  We are giving these one more try: if what I just ordered is also flawed, we will be looking for another tooth brush brand.</li>
    <li> Dentist told me I needed to change brushes every 6 months.  I&#x27;d read it when I got the gear, but never followed through and forgot that I had those extras for a reason.  Guess at the brushing time of day I cease to think.</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the price but you get what you pay for. None of them fit on the toothbrush and when I forced it on I couldn&#x27;t get them off with breaking the brush head.</li>
    <li> Better than the ones i buy in the store, also half the price!&lt;br /&gt;Last much longer than name brand does!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy these with all the negative reviews, but I am forced to conclude that some of the issues must be around device incompatibility. I have the Sonicare Healthy White, and these things are a perfect replacement. I even slightly prefer them to the on-brand versions (the brushes are a bit more stiff, which I like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously great deal at this price. I&#x27;m going to buy a few extra packs (I think they offer a 9 pack as well) to cover me for the year. Maybe the problems noted are valid for other Sonicare brushes, but for mine, these are a welcome and affordable replacement.</li>
    <li> They have worked perfectly with my tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and recommend this product to my patients.</li>
    <li> These are great for the price but doesn&#x27;t quite fit as well as the name brand ones. We will see if they last as long but so far the bristles seem to be holding out.</li>
    <li> At initial inspection, they look identical to OEM heads. Operationally, they seem fine, however, the fit is not precise - it is a tighter fit onto the brush handle and does not seat as far down onto the handle as the OEM heads, leaving a slight gap between the handle and the base of the brush head. Being a tighter fit also means that they are harder to remove. After a few removals, the head actually separated between the shaft and the circular base, exposing its rusty interior parts. These heads are probably acceptable if you don&#x27;t need to swap heads (i.e., have other users sharing same handle) often, but I will not be getting them again.</li>
    <li> They do not line up on the toothbrush as well which causes them to vibrate way too much.  I am going back to sonicare brand.</li>
    <li> These are awful! After the first use my mouth was full of bristles that had fallen off and it&#x27;s only been worse ever since.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping. Brush replacement fits toothbrush fine but zigzag bristle shape doesn&#x27;t seem to make as much tooth contact as usual flat bristle design. Bristles do seem slightly stiffer than on original heads which is a plus. However will probably go back to non-generic replacement head in the future.</li>
    <li> I have had no problem with this product. It works well even though it is generic. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> The bottom connector of the brush heads separated when taking off. All three had this problem - so when switching between users - it becomes a challenge.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use with my sonicare toothbrush. They are a perfect fit!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order these &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; toothbrush heads again.  They look different, feel different and clearly work different.  Spend the extra and get the real deal.</li>
    <li> These brushes work very well for me. How do they differe from the originals? The original brushes come with the additional plastic ring, but this one does not, nor does it need a ring. If you have the ring from the original, i recommend that you remove it, since it causes the brush to vibrate. Another difference: the original brush has a metalic support inside, where the brush head connects to the Sonicare Pro, while this one is plastic. However, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month since I bought it, and it works as well as the original. Like with any new brush, be gentle on the gum when you start using it. After a week or so, you can apply it to the gum and teeth with no problem.</li>
    <li> This brush is softer, does fit on the toothbrush handle quite well, but not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Because it is much softer than the brand, I would probably go back to the standard brush next time,</li>
    <li> These generic brush heads were better than I expected. They are harder to install and remove on my sonicare base, but that was to be expected. So far the brush part seems fine, and the cost was less than half of the philips brand product. I&#x27;ll definetly order again!</li>
    <li> the price difference is significant. But the bristles are much softer, just doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling as clean. not sure I will purchase again when it comes time to restock.</li>
    <li> The brush itself is not bad, but the metal ring at the base is extremely rust-prone.  Wherever the brush head sits, it leaves iron oxide behind -- red-brown stains.  Not attractive, not particularly healthy, not a good way to get your daily dose of iron!</li>
    <li> These work well enough, but they are obviously not the real deal.  Some things you need to know before you buy these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. There is no color ring at the base of the heads, which can be annoying if you have more than one.  I just put a little notch in one of the heads with a knife to differentiate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They do not come with the bristle covers.  Keep one from your name brand ones and they will fit on these, if just a little snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There is a small gap between the head and the base which causes some extra vibrations.  It isn&#x27;t anything that causes them not to work, but it&#x27;s noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. They are a little stiffer than the name brand.  If you don&#x27;t like a hard toothbrush, you won&#x27;t like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, they work well enough for the money you will save, but you&#x27;ll know that they aren&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
    <li> Brush Heads work well with my Sonicare. for the price I can replace them a lot more often, not that they don&#x27;t last as well or better than name brands.</li>
    <li> These brushes fit very poorly on the spindle and the bristles begin falling out after about 2 weeks of use.  I will never buy these brushes again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a knock-off but it works.  Although the bristles could be softer.  Also, the identifying color ring at the bottom is missing.</li>
    <li> Same utility as the brush that was on the Sonicare when bought but at a far more competitive price. Very good customer service.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these and the first one actually functioned normally for a week or so but they began to make a rattling noise when used.  I pulled it off and put the second one on.  It also vibrated and didn&#x27;t really stay where is should on the Sonicare.  It also had some hard plastic that was really sharp right where my lips are.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, you get what you pay for.  Though the real sonicare ones seem like a rip off, but it&#x27;s just not worth it for these knock offs.</li>
    <li> Yes, you will save about half by buying this generic brush head, but in my experience, they didn&#x27;t last as long.  After a few weeks, the brush head started to wobble, and shortly thereafter, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could have been a fluke, but given the price, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s not.  That said, I&#x27;ll finish out the three-pack and see if I decide to buy again.  Because hey... they are a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> A good functional replacement head. A fair balance of savings and quality. I do not miss the &amp;#34;lack&amp;#34; of &amp;#34;Brand&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great price, grate fit for me brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;Seller described this product perfect. Pictures included can show you everything what u need to see it and know about it!!!</li>
    <li> We needed new brushes for our electric toothbrush but paying the retail store prices was a little much. When I found these they were the same quality at half the price. Excellent product and price.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a little stiffer brush and what may me unhappy could got it for $14 on nomorerack. Does not have indentation for color ring.</li>
    <li> The name of this product led me to believe that they are Philips brand brush heads.  They are not.  Of the three heads in the pack, one of them fits so loosely that the vibration of the handle makes the head fall off in your mouth.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> These heads did not fit the unit and ended up breaking the end off of the toothbrush, essentially ruining it.  I am back here on Amazon looking to buy a whole new Sonicare now.  Will not be buying the product again!</li>
    <li> It was not clear that these were generic heads to fit the Philips Sonicare brush.  They fit but do not work as well as the non generic heads.</li>
    <li> advertised as a Philips Sonicare HX6013/66 Pro Results Brush Head and is nothing more than a generic brush which is hard and not friendly to the mouth.  I have used Sonicare for approximately 10 years and there is nothing about this brush that is Philips Sonicare.  Would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought from Amazon for years and this is my first really big disappointment in products.  Shame on you Amazon for even selling something this cheap.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy and they perform the same! I&#x27;m going to purchase another set. At tis price I can&#x27;t lose.</li>
    <li> Broke after 12 uses.  See my review on their Sonicare brush.  I won&#x27;t buy Philips again, even with someone else&#x27; money.</li>
    <li> The product meets the requirements.  In comparison to the name-brand brush heads, these are not nearly as nice. If you have sensitive gums then I would avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Some of the brush heads don&#x27;t fit well.  This causes the brush head to not vibrate.  However, this is a good price for the amount you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> I should have known this was too good to be true, and now it is too late to return them.  Amazon should not stock these brush heads, they simply do not fit.  I almost broke my Sonicare toothbrush trying to remove them.  I didn&#x27;t notice that they were not made by Philips because the first thing that comes up is Philips Sonicare HX6013.  Bad purchase.</li>
    <li> Returned. It was not understood that these are generic when we ordered them. They seem to be labelled better now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just over a week and have already run into problems. Yes, the materials appear to be a little cheaper than an authentic Sonicare head. I normally wouldn&#x27;t mind in light of the huge savings...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the brush head keeps sliding off the toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to jerry-rig the head with a rubber band around the base to keep it in place. I will probably continue using them to get my money&#x27;s worth but I definitely plan to spurge on the real deal for my next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money here!</li>
    <li> Was hoping the generic would hold up to the brand name Sonicare heads, but in my opinion, they did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- lacking firmness of brand name heads&lt;br /&gt;- brush head segment that connects to Sonicare base often comes apart when trying to switch out heads (we shared one base between two people, so daily switching is commonplace).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy them again. I&#x27;ve gone ahead and just resigned myself to the fact that the generic brand doesn&#x27;t cut it here.  I bought the Sonicare brand DiamondClean heads, and they are *awesome*.</li>
    <li> This is a good option for replacement (save $20), there is one thing wrong: The product does not look like the picture!!! In the picture you can see the color ring (all grey), but the actual product can not use the color rings. This is a little annoying since my wife and I have a tooth each. Now we don&#x27;t know whose is whose. We have to put them in different location so we don&#x27;t mix them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see the picture changed to represent the actual product. I will not buy again, just or this reason.</li>
    <li> After seeing authentic replacement brushes for $40, I opted for the cheaper solution.  BIG MISTAKE.  The first thing I noticed was the bottom metal rings were missing and replaced with plastic. Well the reason they are metal is because that is the area where the base connects to the actual brush and is also where the vibrations culminate.  Without the metal rings, the plastic wears over a few uses (I think I used it 10-20 times) and then becomes useless.  Pay the extra $20 and buy authentic replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> It is counterfeit! It doesn&#x27;t fit the handle well and when pulling out, ended up pulling out the metal part that&#x27;s in the handle and broke it. DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> If the bristles had not started coming out at 2 weeks they would have been worth the it. But replacing ever 2 weeks is not worth the savings.</li>
    <li> These are not actually HX6013 brush heads, but generic clones instead. Even worse, they don&#x27;t actually fit the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads work fine once attached. They are a little softer than the normal Sonicare heads (which can be OK depending on your preferences). The big problem is that in a household where you change heads every night (we have two bodies for four people), these heads just don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Sonicare heads, which are one integral piece of plastic, these heads are two pieces, attached together at the curved base. The head itself seats on well, but when you try to pull it off, the brush part tends to pull off, leaving the lower part of the base attached to the brush body.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t compare the quality compare to the original, because it is generic but not bad for the price...&lt;br /&gt;If you try to save the money, this is not a bad choice</li>
    <li> These fit and work. They dont &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; on like the OEM style ones but they dont fall off and they feel the same.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of bad reviews about this product but I think they are terrific.  3 for a low price beats one for huge amount of money.  Don&#x27;t throw your money away on something more expensive.  I can change more frequently keeping my teeth cleaner.</li>
    <li> These are just as good as the name brand brushes. Why pay the high price when you can get good quality for less.</li>
    <li> In this three pack, on of the brushes did not articulate well with the electric portion. Disappointing. Will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Hoping to save a little money on Sonicare replacement brushes? Don&#x27;t purchase these. They are very difficult to remove from the handle. This is a problem if more than one person uses the handle. They will not last 3 months, within 2 weeks the bristles were shedding. I am generally all about subsituting generics for name brand, but not in this case.</li>
    <li> I was thinking I could save a few bucks by buying the off brand brush heads. Within one week of daily use, the toothbrush heads were already splaying. I guess I expected a little more usage for the cost. Heads fit perfectly though, and it did do the advertised job, so I am going to give it a three star</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  Not only do the brushes come without caps, the bristles are flimsy.  Poor quality, not worth the price.</li>
    <li> These are &amp;#34;generic replacement brush heads&amp;#34; [X000FLBXAL] for the Philips Sonic toothbrush and are not inexpensive.  The brushes, unfortunately don&#x27;t fit the Sonic toothbrush, they are too loose and fall out!  Although &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; they don&#x27;t fit HX6930.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to get them replaced [I bought 6] with the proper brush heads.</li>
    <li> They do their job, But dont expect the same level of life or feel from them in comparison to the OEM Philips. I was expecting this to happen, but the quality turned out to be low grade.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; toothbrush heads do not even come with covers for the heads.  I had to wash our old ones and keep them, so we could use them on these heads.  We all have a terrible time trying to remove the heads from the toothbrush handle, usually prying it off with a pair of scissors.  Other than that, they work okay, except I had to throw one away 2 weeks after I started using it, because it had black mold on it!  I have never had that happen before, and I rinse the brush well after every use!</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking I might save a few bucks. 2 people share the same unit so after changing the brush heads twice a day, it became almost impossible to get them off. So when I placed a reorder, I went to the OEM. If your muscles are like Arnold go ahead &amp; buy them, but if age is creeping up on you, I recommend to stay away from generic heads.</li>
    <li> I read a few negative reviews and was hesitant to buy this product...but decided to give it a try regardless. It&#x27;s definitely not the same quality as the original Philips replacement brushes. But it also doesn&#x27;t cost as much. It&#x27;s also a little louder, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> These suck. Buy the actual Sonicare ones. These get &amp;#34;vibrated&amp;#34; off the handle. They are not worth the money I &amp;#34;saved&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Three in a pack.  No issues.  They usually last about 4-6 weeks when brushing twice a day.  I cannot really tell the difference between these and the real Philips ones.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush heads in the picture are actual Sonicare brand heads, but these are generics (which explains why they are half the price). The first toothbrush head that I tried started to fall apart the first time I used it, leaving me with a mouth full of tiny bristles--which is nasty unpleasant. I&#x27;ve never had any toothbrush lose bristles before and I sent it right back as defective.&lt;br /&gt;I guess there&#x27;s no getting around paying for the brand name heads.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are smaller than Philips Sonicare and they do not have a brush head cover.  I will not buy them again.  Sorry that I bought 2 and will not buy them again.</li>
    <li> The brushheads gripped the metal shaft so hard that the brush head was finally pulled apart! Then it took a pliers to remove the last part. Don&#x27;t buy these!</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t exactly like the pro results replacement heads, but they seem to fit fine and perform to the level of the Phillips Pro results replacement heads.</li>
    <li> These are comparable to the actual Sonicare toothbrush heads but at a much more reasonable price!  I just switched from the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brushes so the bristles seemed a little stiff but that could just be because of the switch.  Overall, completely satisfied and intend to purchase these since they&#x27;re half the price of the name brand ones yet just as good!</li>
    <li> Me and my wife share our Sonicare,&lt;br /&gt;so I remove my brush daily, that has never been a problem before,&lt;br /&gt;these brushes fit so tightly that I had to struggle to remove them,&lt;br /&gt;then it came apart in two pieces.</li>
    <li> I tried all three and they are a piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The bristles are not stiff at all and they fall off. It doesn&#x27;t fit right and they tend to rattle a lot. Buy the real thing here or on ebay for under $18 it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> These are generic brush heads.  They are NOT from Philips.  Have not used yet but am skeptical if they will work.  I was wondering about the great price and now I totally understand.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product.  One didn&#x27;t even sit straight on the brush.  This is such a poor quality, I wouldn&#x27;t use themif the were giving them away.</li>
    <li> I tried a cheap copy and was disappointed so I gave the name brand original a try.  They&#x27;re &#x27;ok,&#x27; but rather expensive...</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m usually open to cheaper knock offs but this was a bad experience for me.  I bought two 3-packs, one was this generic and the other was the original Philips.  This generic version immediately started losing brissles over the first 3 teeth brushings and had a noticeably shorter life.  Also, one of them wouldn&#x27;t stay on my Philips unit when I turned it downward to rinse in the sink, the oring inside it that holds it ok was missing.  So, in this example, stay away from this Generic, it was a waste of money, even though it was a lot cheaper, it wasn&#x27;t worth it at all.</li>
    <li> Stopped working in a few weeks. The vendor did not want to make it right.</li>
    <li> Got the generic, broke one immediately, managed to stick it back together, after that - no problem. Except for the durability of the plastic, I had no other no issues. If you take the head often (to carry with you in a case) - it may pose a problem. The quality of brush is the same. The price difference is great!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the word GENERIC in the description. I have the Sonicare Flexcare HX6911/02 and these were a bad fit. I ended up throwing them away and getting the real deal.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and deal given that the standard brush heads for the sonic diamond clean are +$40. My only qualm is that they don&#x27;t come with plastic top/protector for the brush.</li>
    <li> The quality is obviously a cheaper knock-off version of the real toothbrush replacement heads I expected.  The bristles are extremely HARD, so I&#x27;m afraid i&#x27;m going to have to buy a different brand next time or I won&#x27;t have teeth left to brush.  The fit for mine is fine, but still can&#x27;t recommend.  It gets 2 stars because... it&#x27;s a toothbrush.... technically, it does clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> Well, while I don&#x27;t speak Spanish, I do know a few words such as that \\&quot;paz\\&quot; means \\&quot;peace.\\&quot;  So, I guessed the company name, PAZ GENERIX meant something like \\&quot;general peace.\\&quot;  It was only after opening the package and finding generic substitutes for the Sonicare brushes I thought I was ordering, that I went back to the product site and figured out that \\&quot;generix\\&quot; was apparently supposed to be a substitute spelling for \\&quot;generics\\&quot; (how clever that a company that substitutes products also substitutes spellings).  I confess to not having read the site carefully, but I knew what Philips Sonicare HX6013/66 Pro Results Brush Heads are; the product description said they were that, so no need to look further.  Hmmm.  Maybe there was a reason, after all.  I see that other purchasers also missed that these are substitutes.  I&#x27;m surprised Amazon doesn&#x27;t require vendors to clearly identify generic substitutes as such.  I&#x27;m also surprised Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow zero stars for a review:  giving this product one star seems exceedingly generous.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about these is that the color rings, that came with the sonicare do not work with them.</li>
    <li> This generic brush head is as good as the original without the exorbitant price. I will buy these again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to save money in the past by getting generic heads for my Sonicare, and been successful.  This time, I was not.  Yes, they will work with your toothbrush and the bristles will brush your teeth.  But they don&#x27;t come close to snapping on all the way.  There&#x27;s a big gap left between the toothbrush handle and the head, and after several seconds, the head will vibrate right off the brush.  You have to hold it in place with your thumb, or tape it on.  Also, they did not have the clear plastic covers that snap over the bristle part to keep your toothbrush clean--a big necessity in my opinion, because then you can&#x27;t leave it in a drawer and even standing it on the counter it&#x27;s going to get nasty.  The only nice thing about this product was the packing they came in--each head was in a separate molded plastic compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the other reviews it sounds like people are getting different products from this listing, which I notice happens really often when buying generics online!  Beware--they could waste your money!  I picked up a set of real Sonicare heads today with my 20% coupon from Bed Bath and Beyond, and there was a $5 rebate on top of that.  After suffering with these for so long, it was such a nice feeling to actually snap my new head on completely.  So consider paying a little more and getting the real thing.  You just can&#x27;t trust ordering generics you can&#x27;t see first.</li>
    <li> I ordered this not realizing it wasn&#x27;t the name brand.  It wasn&#x27;t clear in the ad.  I hated them but they did return them with no hassle.</li>
    <li> Good price but these brushes have much stiffer bristles than the name brand. Probably won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my brush handle quite as smoothly as the manufacturer&#x27;s and caused a bit of corrosion to appear on the metal shaft they fit onto. Not wanting to further damage my brush handle, I stopped buying them.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t seem as stiff as the bristles on the sonicare brand but very close.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are very fake. They felt different than the real Sonicare brushes. The blue line that is supposed to turn white to indicate wear level doesn&#x27;t even do anything. I will stick to real Sonicare brushes from now on. I recommend the Sonicare Diamond Head brushes for best results.</li>
    <li> NOT as advertised. These don&#x27;t even fit on the model they claim to be made for.</li>
    <li> I think these are factory seconds - I won&#x27;t be buying any ever again - very poor performance!  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> fits perfect on my sonicare and these feel great on my teeth</li>
    <li> This inexpensive aftermarket brush works quite well on the Sonic.  The quality of the bristles, themselves, seems equal to the Sonic brushes. However, it required so much brute force to put the head on and take it off, that I became convinced that it would eventually damage the motorized brush holder. IF you are a user who prefers to leave the brush attached the entire time between replacements, I&#x27;d recommend this third-party substitute. I like to avail myself of the UV sanitation compartment, though, so I&#x27;ve gone back to the name-brand heads, fearing that daily re-attachments would lead to premature mechanical failure of the motor.</li>
    <li> Heads a little too small.</li>
    <li> we opened the box, tried to put the toothbrush head. when we removed it 1 min later, the head fell into pieces. The metal inside was rusty even if the toothbrush head was never used!!&lt;br /&gt;How is it possible to sell such bad quality ! Don&#x27;t buy these</li>
    <li> There is not much difference in quality other than there are no caps to cover the brush head. I would rather be sanitary especially when my husband and I just switch out the brush heads to brush our teeth. It would be much more sanitary with a cover on it!</li>
    <li> The last Philips brush heads I bought wore out very quickly. These are a third the price and the one I&#x27;ve been using for 2-3 weeks is doing just fine. I highly recommend them! Thank heavens someone else makes these.</li>
    <li> awful no way to attach to toothbrush I am idiot for buying thought deal was too good to be true</li>
    <li> This looks like a great deal...however the brush heads do not fit the pin correctly.  If you are not travelling (where you have to take the brush off daily to fit in the travel case) then they are probably rated four stars.</li>
    <li> definitely don&#x27;t spend the cash on the originals, these work just as well! they aren&#x27;t quite as nice, but nice enough for sure.</li>
    <li> Bought this because the price was much less than the original heads for the sonicare. Honestly it worked great for 3 weeks then it started falling apart. You will need to change the head much more often so in reality the cheaper price balances out. Walmart sells the Original heads for 25.00 that includes 3 much cheaper than amazon is currently.</li>
    <li> I think that it is absolutely incredible that these guys nockoff a brandname product so well!! I wish we would have quality generic products for everything!! Keep up the good work!! KFN!!</li>
    <li> I am VERY happy with this product!  It looks just like the brand name product and works equally as well.  I read other reviews about the head not fitting quite flush with the electric handle and that is true.  But I have no problem whatsoever with how the toothbrush functions. The replacement head stays on the handle just fine and cleans perfectly well.  It would be nice if the three pack came with the little colored rings for the base of the replacement to make it easy to distinguish whose is whose, but that is certainly not a deal breaker.  I just switched the ring from the old brush to the new one!  Fits perfectly!  Will continue to get these as long as I can!</li>
    <li> These are cheap but you pay for what you get.  They fit like the real ones and the bristles feel similar.  But when I remove the head for my fiance, the brush separated from it&#x27;s base.  So now I have a stuck brush head base (the thing with the grey ring) that&#x27;s still connected to the sonicare unit in one hand, and the other half brush head in the other.  I eventually got the thing out and clicked them back together but that&#x27;s kind of a pain to do every time and I don&#x27;t know how long that will last.  I hope this is just that one of the 3.</li>
    <li> The advertisement says that it should fit my toothbrush and it sort of does --- but its a real pain to get on and get off.  I guess that&#x27;s the problem with generics.</li>
    <li> These brush heads in my opinion are as good as the more expensive brand name version.  My only complaint is that they are a bit difficult to remove from the brush handle.</li>
    <li> Unless you are firmly pressing the brush against your teeth, they vibrate loose and you must continuously push it back on. You could hold it in place, but then your finger dampens the vibration and there will not be as strong of a vibration needed to most effectively clean your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: don&#x27;t bother with these, they are too much hassle to bother with.</li>
    <li> Works alright, but the real Philips Sonicare heads are much better quality. These don&#x27;t seem to last as long, so you replace them more often.</li>
    <li> While these are more inexpensive, they are also cheaper. The little metal rings on the bottom rust, they are not made from stainless steel. I went back and ordered the non-generic Phillips replacement heads. These are in the garbage now.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase these toothbrushes and decided to give it a try. Compared hand to hand with the Philips Sonicare and they look just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I been using it for 3 weeks now and we are 100% happy with the purchase, will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....And they fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> After this I will buy only brand name. The bristle is too stiff and the fit is too tight and not able to go all the down.</li>
    <li> Works great arrived early and cost 25% of the OEM replacement.  Saved money and it is a great product. Double win! I will order more next quarter.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks by buying these. I so regret the purchase! Not only did they not last nearly as long as the original, but each one had fit issues. Regardless of which handles the heads were put on, they either didn&#x27;t slide all the way down, or they got stuck and came apart while trying to remove them. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> My only complaint with the original name brand brush head is the high price, but that was enough to set me looking for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a set of these figuring that at this price it was worth taking a chance.  It took a while to wear out the head that came with the brush, but I&#x27;ve been using the new generic one for about two weeks now.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, they do not come with the hard plastic head covers, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.  They fit snugly on the base, leaving a slightly bigger gap than the old one, and there is no \\&quot;snap\\&quot; when it locks on, but it works fine.  I find it easier to remove the head by gripping the shaft with a hand towel and pulling, instead of trying it bare handed.  One exception I have to several reviews is that the color rings were on ours- all three light gray!  I was able to pull the one off my previous brush head and it fit on these perfectly.  I don&#x27;t find the bristles stiffer than the old ones, except maybe in comparison to a worn out brush.  I did not experience bristles falling out, head falling apart or coming off the handle even when it was sitting on the base, or rusting, etc. etc. like some reviewers claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line for me is that I&#x27;d buy these again without hesitation, even knowing that they are of a lower quality- where it counts they are just fine.  I sent one to my Mother-in-law to try, and she&#x27;s asked me to order some for her, too (which is saying something, because she can be very particular).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appended 9/16/2013  I just got our second order of brush heads, and these are not the same as our first order.  First, the blister package came open during shipment, so when I opened the shipping box the brush heads were rattling around loose in the package with the other items I had ordered, so ding on packaging.  On visual examination, the heads are made differently- the wide part of the base was a separate piece from the rest of the head(creating the possibility that it may fall apart during use), there was no longer the stainless steel ring under the base(don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good or bad), and the color ring feature used to keep track of which brush is yours was NO LONGER THERE- they don&#x27;t match the photo.  I took one head to try fitting it to the base, and surprisingly it fit pretty well, and no big gap between brush and handle.  So it appears they&#x27;ve changed manufacturers, or perhaps they use multiple manufacturers with loose quality control.  For now I&#x27;m lowering my rating to three stars, I might change it again once these brushes get into use.  For now, just realize these are not only inexpensive, they&#x27;re cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appended 9/17/2013  Imagine my surprise when my brush head fell apart this morning :0  It lasted all of three weeks.  I might be able to epoxy it back together, but really.  It is looking like I will be going back to a manual toothbrush- the brand name refills are too darned expensive, and these generics are too low quality to function.  I will search around to see if there is a higher quality generic refill, but I can&#x27;t recommend buying these- they are junk.</li>
    <li> The bristles are not well anchored, so half of my tooth-brushings end up with a few bristles swishing around in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the heads dont fit properly, but you can still use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The brush head is of poor quality, they lose their hold on the shaft after very few uses.  One lasted about 2-3 weeks, and another only lasted a couple days.  The brush head begins to slip off the vibrating shaft while brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> I have read a number of reviews stating the replacement heads are on too tight. I have had the opposite experience. It worked great for about 3 weeks and then the brush head would separate from the base while brushing. After the same thing happening with two brushes, I am giving up and going back to brand name.</li>
    <li> Originally purchased it seemed like the original product and was cheap. The toothbrush heads came in a rather discolored and old looking package. They were also missing the standard cap to cover the spare brushes. My primary concern was that the toothbrush heads vibrated so vigorously and loudly that I ended up discontinuing use for fear of damaging my $200 Sonicare. Bottom Line: would not recommend.</li>
    <li> These Fit great. much cheaper than in store. would like more colored ring options to differentiate between our toothbrushes though.</li>
    <li> These do not work with my UV sonicare toothbrush.  They fall off the brush and the head separates from the base of the attachment when you try to remove it from the toothbrush.  Not equivalent at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered these, thinking that I found an inexpensive substitute for Philip&#x27;s Pro Result&#x27;s brush.  What I received instead were three cheap knock-offs of the original.  I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for years, so I know what the brush heads are supposed to feel like - for starters, the originals have differentiated bristles, which lead to cleaner teeth.  The &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brush heads I bought use the same bristle throughout the brush and merely give the bristles different colors.  My second complaint is that the bristles are exceedingly soft - I have stiffer paint brushes; perhaps if you have very sensitive gums or advanced gingivitis, these might be acceptable.  My final gripe is that the factory producing these clearly doesn&#x27;t have a Sonicare brush on hand to see if the heads properly fit.  One of the heads almost fit, one of the heads fit half-way on with great difficulty, and I gave up getting the third one to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall opinion: These are dollar-store quality and are a complete waste of money.  If I hadn&#x27;t already brushed my teeth with them, I would have returned them.  Worthless product except for fleecing your wallet.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the brushes and am still appreciative of the medium bristles.  I find this to be more superior than that of the original brushes... however, the thing that displeases me is that they are not bound properly and some of the bristles fell out while I had to cut others as they stood out and were longer than the they were supposed to be.  The only good thing is the battery of the Soniccare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> They break after 1 week of use. Hate being cliche but you really get what you pay for, maybe even a little less.</li>
    <li> works fine in my toothbrush, seems to clean my teeth. Holding up well with 3 uses each day. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> They work just like the &#x27;real&#x27; sonicare brush heads, the only issue is what other reviewers mentioned. They&#x27;re a pain in the butt to pull on or off the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> worstever purchase on amazon. be aware of this PAZ GENERIX brush head. Buy the real thing instead</li>
    <li> Great cheap replacement for sonicare brush heads. they work just as good as the more costly ones.</li>
    <li> I really liked that a generic was available for these normally pricey brush heads. They fit very well on my toothbrush and have not had any problems with them. I am very pleased and definitely will order these again!!</li>
    <li> OK, the price is, like, really, really good. Compared to the price of the name-brand item these are way cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a packaged item bears no marks indicating who manufactures it, or who distributes it, or even its country of origin (I thought that&#x27;s a legal requirement), then all those nasty episodes of 60-Minutes come to mind. You know. The one&#x27;s warning viewers about using products made by predatory foreign manufacturers out of recycled Chinese condoms. Scary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not saying at all that that&#x27;s the case here. I&#x27;m just saying I&#x27;ll probably go with the name brand next time.</li>
    <li> Despite one negative review I took a chance and ordered these ... and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  They&#x27;re every bit as functional as the name brand replacement heads ... at half the cost.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to pay twice as much just because the name brand says &#x27;Pro Results&#x27; on the brush head, so I&#x27;m sticking with these.</li>
    <li> just like the original.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the OEM brushes for A LOT less.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> These brushes do the job and fit well. Only problem we are having that we never had with brand name brush is that my husband,  who suffers from mild dementia, is now splattering front and side mirrors during every brushing. But savings is worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve changed my review for this item.  The first review was \\&quot;five star GREAT!\\&quot;  Now that I&#x27;ve used it for over a month, I&#x27;m revising my original thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  After only a month, while brushing my teeth, the brush head started slipping off the handle&#x27;s attachment pin and kept falling into the sink.  I think this happened due to my trying to force the brush head onto the pin in the U/V light box.  So now, I&#x27;m in a dilemma.  Do I not try to force the brush onto the U/V pin and just let the brush wobble while trying to sterilize it, or do I widen the hole by forcing it onto the pin?  If I don&#x27;t try to force it onto the U/V pin, perhaps the brush head wont fall off the handle after a month?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The brush head doesn&#x27;t fit properly onto the pin in the \\&quot;U/V&#x27;s Cleaner Box.\\&quot;  This causes the brush to not align properly to the U/V light.  It just wobbles around and flops back from the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe OEM is best unless these two points don&#x27;t bother you?  It is a big savings, but when you add up one month of usage to two months of usage with an OEM head and the fact that you can sterilize the OEM head but can&#x27;t be sure of the generic, perhaps you might have second thoughts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the decision is yours.  I&#x27;ve gone from five stars down to two after using the generic brush for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I&#x27;ve just reordered the generic brushes again, in the hope that it has been improved, especially the fit onto the U/V pin.  (I refuse to shave the plastic pin in the U/V chamber so the generic will fit, just in case I decide to go back to OEM.)  I&#x27;ll let you know if the new generic brush will fit the pin in the U/V chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I the only one with these problems?  I&#x27;d appreciate your comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years, but this new Sonicare toothbrush is the best yet.  Between the Sonicare and my WaterPic, my semi-annual cleaning at the dentist has always been a joy.</li>
    <li> Love this product, great price for 3 definately a great price! The bristles are not as string as I would like they are on the soft side but still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This must be a joke. They don&#x27;t properly fit my Pro-results sonicare, at all. There is a 2mm gap between the brush head and the toothbrush. When you apply ANY force whatsoever to the brush-head, it will literally fall into pieces in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I honesty didn&#x27;t think much of the \\&quot;Generic\\&quot; listing when I saw it, but these are sub-generic. I don&#x27;t know how China, a country capable of making some of the worlds most intricate consumer electronics, can blow it on a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. You were warned!!! I&#x27;d return, but it&#x27;s such a pain, I just thought I&#x27;d warn others that these are a straight scam. Get the \\&quot;equate ones\\&quot; at wally world. Spend the extra 10 bucks and get Sonicare. Don&#x27;t waste your time, money, or teeth on these. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Decided to actually do the return as a defect, since they don&#x27;t even fit the pro-results sonicare properly. This review will be deleted once my return is processed IN FULL.</li>
    <li> The price on these is great.  The brushes seem to be softer than the expensive ones that I used to get at WalMart before they quit carrying them here, but they do the job and even if they don&#x27;t (and I don&#x27;t know this yet) last quite as long, the price, by far, makes up for any shortage that may come on that end.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for replacements.  It hurts the pocketbook to pay more.  I didn&#x27;t change more often due to cost.</li>
    <li> This product is as advertised, and as expected (even if the the price makes no sense at all for a little brush.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well, but aren&#x27;t perfect. They fit securely on the toothbrush base, but leave a small gap between the top of the base and the bottom of the head. This just means you need to be extra diligent in cleaning the toothpaste gunk, which is not enough to deter me from purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I did a side-by-side comparison with the brush included with my new SoniCare toothbrush and this Generic replacement.  These are indistinguishable in performance at half the price.  The only difference is in my wallet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I chose to order this product. This fits my Sonicare perfectly and I paid less than half of the retail cost for the name brand replacement brush heads. Shipping was great as well, everything was packaged securely and came in an incredibly timely manner!</li>
    <li> These off-brand ProResults heads didn&#x27;t fit as well as brand labeled ProResults heads. They technically work, but I&#x27;m having trouble keeping these heads seated while brushing.</li>
    <li> Fits okay on the brush, didn&#x27;t come with caps, old caps from OEM are too loose on these.</li>
    <li> Although this price is quite cheaper than other philips products, I didn&#x27;t know- it&#x27;s not a real one. There&#x27;s no mark or brand name something on the head, and it&#x27;s slightly not fit on my old sonicare..(It&#x27;s still work but makes some noise.) I wouldn&#x27;t return it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> They do what they do, clean your teeth and leave them feeling clean and fresh!!! So fresh and so clean!!!</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered these and they turned out great. They are of equal quality to the name brand but MUCH cheaper. Glad I decided to try them!</li>
    <li> They fell apart in the first week we bought them and the internal piece was rusted.  Ended up having to  buy the Phillips version anyway! So much fo that money saving move!</li>
    <li> Bought these in hope of a good replacement. Did not live up to expectations. The heads do not naturally fit on the devise. My wife and I had to almost tear them off.  The brissells don&#x27;t function as well as the leading brand. Hey you get what you pay for in this suituation. If you want to avoid a headache and frustration don&#x27;t buy these. This has been just my experience. It looks like others experienced different.</li>
    <li> I looked carefully at the photo prior to purchase to make certain I was getting the right replacement heads.  The brush heads pictured read &amp;#34;Pro Results&amp;#34; on them and had a little colored rim - in this photo the rim is gray.  However, my brushes did not have the labeling and no rim.  While the heads do fit, they do not fit as well without the rim.  There is a gap which traps debris and water.  I would expect to receive what is pictured.  To be fair, I did not contact the seller to remedy the problem as I did not want to hassle with a return.  I just put the brush head on and used it.  Thanks.</li>
