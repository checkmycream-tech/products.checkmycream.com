      <li>It is very light with hint of vanilla smell.  </li>
      <li>No one has said anything about what I&#x27;m wearing either, nor given me the eye of &amp;#34;emmm, what are you wearing :) &amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Love this on my husband</li>
      <li>Never had so many compliments from a 20 bottle of cologne...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the smell....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite cologne, which I also use as an after shave.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cologne.</li>
      <li>and so I was able to locate on Amazon when he ran out of the gift bottle .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure he will have me purchase again.</li>
      <li>and I like them both. :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a year or so now and have had so many complements on it.  </li>
      <li>pump from 2 feet away is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>An acquaintance loved it so much she asked me to spray some on the nearest object she could take with her, which happened to be a receipt from a restaurant.</li>
      <li>great not very strong good mellow fragance</li>
      <li>I like the smell a lot more than the original Realm as I agree with the 1st reviewer that it smells a bit sweeter.  </li>
      <li>I like the original realm because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>but just as nice to smell.  Like Real and Stetson, these are favorites that are always on the shelf.  </li>
      <li>It is more masculine than the original Realm scent (which itself is pretty good).</li>
      <li>I have been using the original Realm for a while</li>
      <li>Been a REALM fan for years with the original fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is not as strong as the original Realm, but still has a distinct smell.</li>
      <li>This bottle was shipped to my house in Alaska on the very day it had quoted for delivery safe and sound.</li>
      <li>I give it three stars because it has a pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it daily, I like the aroma.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did order the inner realm for men for someone as a gift and he loved it</li>
      <li>scent is nice, if only it weren&#x27;t so strong.</li>
      <li>I specify the original Inner Realm on the older packaging (women)It smells great</li>
      <li>just E mail me a quick note to just &amp;#34;return it&amp;#34; within 30 days.</li>
      <li>be back for more!</li>
      <li>The synthesized human pheromone component in this fragrance is pleasing and will attract many women!</li>
      <li>So Much!!</li>
      <li>It has a clean crisp scent.</li>
      <li>This new fragrance is as good as the original with a lighter, longer lasting scent.</li>
      <li>If you enjoy REALM like I do, you will LOVE Inner Realm.  </li>
      <li>It should be worn on guys that are considered the pretty boy, or the upscale guy or a Jesse from Full House kinda guy.</li>
      <li>I personally feel that the original is much more prevalent at the end of the day then this one.</li>
      <li>My husband loves this one more then original one(the red one).</li>
      <li>the delivery was quick and the item exactly what was ordered....</li>
      <li>I have worn this scent for many years and it is the only one that my husband likes.</li>
      <li>Kinda girlyish at first</li>
      <li>but it grows on you fast!</li>
      <li>I would suggest that if you are trying realm for the first time to consider getting both of them at the same time to see which one you like more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not often that you can purchase cologne withour smelling it first that matches your body chemistry.</li>
      <li>However, if you are differentiating your cologne use, Inner Realm is more of a daytime, summery scent.</li>
      <li>This is a soft clean smelling product.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting great smelling product at an affordable price, Inner Realm is the right choice.</li>
      <li>Just get Real Realm and forget this.</li>
      <li>This item arrived really fast.</li>
      <li>opinion too much.</li>
      <li>For evening and colder weather, I now use [[ASIN:B00SKXM14W Realm Intense]]</li>
      <li>While I am not 100% sure about the scientific veracity of human pheromones (Inner Realm contains the chemical androstadienone), I can definitely say women love the smell of this cologne.</li>
      <li>This is the real stuff.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a hit or miiss really.</li>
      <li>I wore the original Realm off and on since 1997, as well as Curve, but once I smelled Inner Realm, I immediately switched to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>more often than Inner Realm, but Inner Realm still works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to try and pretend I can describe the smell, but its not overpowering by any means and will last all day and just plain smells good.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion it is similar to light blue Dolce and Acqua di Gio by Armani.</li>
      <li>Plus its on the cheaper side as far as colognes go!</li>
      <li>In fact, more so than any other cologne that I&#x27;ve had (~20 or so different brands I&#x27;ve tried over the years).  </li>
      <li>I used the other Realm; the one in red bottle most of the time and wanted to try this one out</li>
      <li>Plus, very few people wear this, so it is pretty unique.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an everyday cologne that wont give you a headache and is easy on the wallet this is something to consider.</li>
      <li>In fact, since I thought they may have discontinued it (I am not sure if they have or not), I&#x27;ve stocked up on it, especially since it is priced so reasonably from many vendors.</li>
      <li>I have had co-workers and clients come near me just to smell me.</li>
      <li>I have had women ask to keep the bottle, and I have obliged them by giving them bottles when they are near empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little sweeter smelling than original Realm</li>
      <li>the original Realm but not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>No regrets whatsoever</li>
      <li>I do like the smell but am not sure if it lasts as long as the original.</li>
      <li>I am not very good at describing scents, but it is very fresh and masculine, with a slight degree of fruitiness.</li>

    <li> I have been using the original Realm for a while so I thought I would give Inner Realm a try. No regrets whatsoever and I would recommend this scent.  It&#x27;s a little sweeter smelling than original Realm but it is subtle and not overpowering which I like.  I would describe it as a Lavender type scent. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a product or fragrance that I never heard of....I really enjoyed the smell....the delivery was quick and the item exactly what was ordered....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a year or so now and have had so many complements on it.  In fact, more so than any other cologne that I&#x27;ve had (~20 or so different brands I&#x27;ve tried over the years).

I&#x27;m not going to try and pretend I can describe the smell, but its not overpowering by any means and will last all day and just plain smells good.  Try this cologne out though, you won&#x27;t regret it.  Plus its on the cheaper side as far as colognes go!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as I, was told and meet my expectations, well done!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even get a scent from this at all...at least not one that I can smell.  No one has said anything about what I&#x27;m wearing either, nor given me the eye of &amp;#34;emmm, what are you wearing :) &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This spray has an amazing smell!! It is not as strong as the original Realm, but still has a distinct smell. The bottle is pleasing to the eye and will last for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I specify the original Inner Realm on the older packaging (women)It smells great and I get alot of compliments once I was sent the newer version and it was aweful. I did order the inner realm for men for someone as a gift and he loved it</li>
    <li> I used the other Realm; the one in red bottle most of the time and wanted to try this one out and I&#x27;m glad I did. The smell is very different to the other one and I like them both. :)</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. reminds me of an aroma from a tobacco store actually...not sure why, but it is good stuff.</li>
    <li> This is among some of the best cologne to ever be marketed for men. The smell is truly great. If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting great smelling product at an affordable price, Inner Realm is the right choice. The synthesized human pheromone component in this fragrance is pleasing and will attract many women!</li>
    <li> Love this on my husband</li>
    <li> Been a REALM fan for years with the original fragrance. This new fragrance is as good as the original with a lighter, longer lasting scent. A great addition to thier lineup. Makes it difficult to choose which one to use. so I alternate betwwen the two. You can go wrong and have received many compliments wearing them.</li>
    <li> This scent is the best ever on the hubster. It has a clean crisp scent. Not overpowering at all. It manly but yet sensual.  Love, love, love it. It arrived on time too which added to it.</li>
    <li> He had received a bottle of Inner Realm as a gift when I purchased a parfum I always use in a mall in Oregon. He loved it and so I was able to locate on Amazon when he ran out of the gift bottle . I&#x27;m sure he will have me purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great scent, not overpowering, light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Kinda girlyish at first but it grows on you fast! It should be worn on guys that are considered the pretty boy, or the upscale guy or a Jesse from Full House kinda guy. Good stuff. It&#x27;s a hit or miiss really. If anything pass it off as a gift. Don&#x27;t buy if you are worried about others opinion too much. You should wear what YOU like to smell like. If you&#x27;re open minded get it. BTW this is only borderline girly cause it&#x27;s flowery not fruity just so ya know :D</li>
    <li> .... but just as nice to smell.  Like Real and Stetson, these are favorites that are always on the shelf.  Does it insnare women?  Well, lets just say my dogs seem to like the smell and that is probably not the overall intent of the pheromone laiden cologne.  But, nice girls do comment once in awhile. LOL</li>
    <li> Lighter daytime Cologne by the people who make Realm.  Lighter than Realm without being too Flowery or Fruity.  Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> I feel the smell is a little sweeter then the original Realm but not overwhelming. I do like the smell but am not sure if it lasts as long as the original. I would suggest that if you are trying realm for the first time to consider getting both of them at the same time to see which one you like more. I personally feel that the original is much more prevalent at the end of the day then this one.</li>
    <li> Very good perfume i like, I use it daily and it is very good quality the scent lasts up at night.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it daily. Oftern get comments about its&#x27; fragrance. It&#x27;s my favorite cologne, which I also use as an after shave.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about this &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; without using words that are not fit for mixed company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve kept a supply of Realm since the 90s.  This isn&#x27;t even in the same Universe.  The odor is so horrific, as soon as it invades my nostril it feels like a dagger is jamming me in the frontal lobe of my brain and my immediate reflex is to vomit violently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
    <li> I give it three stars because it has a pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it daily, I like the aroma.&lt;br /&gt;If you wish to purchase this product should know that you have good fragrance.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a womans perfume and its a mans. I ordered it off my sisters wish list item cuz she thought it was a womans perfume too. I was disappointed when it came for a xmas gift thinking it was a womans perfume. Now she wont get her gift on time and all the Seller did was just E mail me a quick note to just &amp;#34;return it&amp;#34; within 30 days. No phone call, no customer service at all and no help on this gift I had wrapped for my sister for xmas. I wont buy from this seller again. Dana</li>
    <li> This is the real stuff.  Don&#x27;t buy the knock-off version which is made by someone other than Erox.  I have worn this scent for many years and it is the only one that my husband likes.</li>
    <li> Never had so many compliments from a 20 bottle of cologne...and I have a few $100+ bottles! It has female pheromones. I swear I got licked by a chick once wearing this. GET IT!!</li>
    <li> It still smells the same, the package is the only difference. I love love love this fragrance!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne. I am not very good at describing scents, but it is very fresh and masculine, with a slight degree of fruitiness. It is more masculine than the original Realm scent (which itself is pretty good). I wore the original Realm off and on since 1997, as well as Curve, but once I smelled Inner Realm, I immediately switched to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn this since 2014, and the compliments I get are unbelievable. While I am not 100% sure about the scientific veracity of human pheromones (Inner Realm contains the chemical androstadienone), I can definitely say women love the smell of this cologne. That is why I always keep it in my briefcase and car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get random people complimenting me on how I smell all the time. An acquaintance loved it so much she asked me to spray some on the nearest object she could take with her, which happened to be a receipt from a restaurant. I have had co-workers and clients come near me just to smell me. I have had women ask to keep the bottle, and I have obliged them by giving them bottles when they are near empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is honestly crazy. And, I promise I don&#x27;t work for the makers of Inner Realm. In fact, since I thought they may have discontinued it (I am not sure if they have or not), I&#x27;ve stocked up on it, especially since it is priced so reasonably from many vendors. I am embarrassed to say how many bottles I own, but let&#x27;s just say I have a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it any time, day or night, at work and out and about. However, if you are differentiating your cologne use, Inner Realm is more of a daytime, summery scent. For evening and colder weather, I now use [[ASIN:B00SKXM14W Realm Intense]] more often than Inner Realm, but Inner Realm still works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I mentioned, it smells great and everyone seems to love it. Plus, very few people wear this, so it is pretty unique. It is highly unlikely every guy at your job or at the club is wearing this. For the price, it is absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing like Realm except the similar bottle. It smells like those Inexpensive designer fragrance copies. Just get Real Realm and forget this.</li>
    <li> Not as good as original Realm IMHO, but still VERY, VERY, Good!  Love it and I will def. be back for more!</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing , it is now my go to cologne for the clubs . LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS FROM THE LADIES !!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the original realm because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; smell. I wish I could say the same about Inner Realm.&lt;br /&gt;One pump from 2 feet away is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, if only it weren&#x27;t so strong.</li>
    <li> This bottle was shipped to my house in Alaska on the very day it had quoted for delivery safe and sound. The bottle was unused and to my relief the actual fragrance. This is a soft clean smelling product. In my opinion it is similar to light blue Dolce and Acqua di Gio by Armani. If you are looking for an everyday cologne that wont give you a headache and is easy on the wallet this is something to consider. Also, this outsold Dolce and Armani in my store almost every month after it was released.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy REALM like I do, you will LOVE Inner Realm.  Try it and you will not be sorry.</li>
