<li> It&#x27;s all broken off now pieces up to my chin!</li>
<li> I have lost a disgusting amount of hair to an autoimmune disease.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I alternate this shampoo with another Aphogee Deep Moisture Shampoo in combination with Keratin 2 Minute Reconstructor and Essential oil regimen once per week or as needed.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I use it with the aphogee keratin 2 minute reconstructor and they work more than OK. I would recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fine but I really prefer clear shampoo to creamy types.  I have very fine, thin hair and creamy shampoos seem to make it feel thinner and finer.</li>
    <li> Sodium Laureth Sulfate- that&#x27;s the ingredient anyone with hair on their head should take steps to avoid, it does nothing but strip your hair of its natural oils. i bought this product based on what a friend told me and neglected to actually read the ingredients. i will not put a drop of it in my hair, i will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I have lost a disgusting amount of hair to an autoimmune disease. I&#x27;m 34 and had long dark brown hair. It&#x27;s all broken off now pieces up to my chin! My hair is destroyed. I used this shampoo one time! And my hair feels amazing, I even received my first compliment in well over a year about my hair looking \\&quot;nice today and really shiny\\&quot;. I was so happy I almost cried. Buy it, it works miracles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Asian with thick black hair, currently platinum blonde. This took 5 bleachings, so my hair is pretty damaged to my standards. But it&#x27;s holding up, thanks to my super hair regime! I use both ApHogee shampoo and conditioner biweekly, and deep condition my hair with unrefined coconut oil every two weeks. My hair is not brittle or falling out (massage coconut oil onto your scalp before bleaching), and is still thick and bouncy. My hair doesn&#x27;t have a plastic shine anymore, and I like that. Some reviewers say that they only use a dime size dollop but for the shampoo I need a quarter size, and probably two quarter size for the conditioner to thoroughly soak my hair. Maybe my hair is just thicker?? Either way, the conditioner is essential to keep your hair bouncy and not brittle, and shampoo for sparing your protein stripped hair from more stripping.</li>
    <li> I always get a supply of every single product made by Aphogee....love them</li>
    <li> Awesome Shampoo! It made a huge difference in my hair. It&#x27;s so much softer than it was, and I can feel it repairing my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have not used the product long enough to give a definitive &amp;#34;excellent job&amp;#34; yet. but, I have noticed less break with my hair in the last two weeks then previously. I will keep you posted on how it goes.</li>
    <li> Outstanding Product!&lt;br /&gt;I have been bleaching my hair from a stubborn natural red to blonde for years and it has severely damaged my hair. My hair has been so fried I thought I would have to chop it off and maybe go with extensions for awhile. I saw this product on Amazon along with its companion 2 minute keratin reconstruct or and decided to give it a shot. I am sooooo glad I did. These products are nothing short if amazing. I have only used it 3 times and already my hair feels like hair again! The shampoo is creamy pearl like with an almost whipped appearance and a delightful light citrus scent. Washes out clean and is not at all heavy on my hair. The reconstructing conditioner does not weigh my hair down either. Great products all around and I will be back for more. If you have damaged hair the Aphogee products are an absolute must have for you!</li>
    <li> Came on time and a great product.</li>
    <li> So... Me and my natural hair hated this. Honestly I brought this at my local beauty supply after much research and reading the reviews. And just like others said it left my hair a tangled mess. It also left my hair hard before I used my conditioner and that really turned me off. So for that reason I&#x27;ll only give it 3 stars and not use it in my hair again. However, I tried Salerm Protein Shampoo and loved it and it left my hair amazing. So it&#x27;s a win win for me. I guess it just depends on your hair needs.</li>
    <li> After two months of having my baby I have been experiencing post partum shedding and have been searching for a product that will help curb it. Immediately after the first use of this product I saw a difference. My baby girl is 8 months now and it has stopped plus my hair has started to grow back. It also smells great. I used it together with the Aphogee Balancing Moisturizer and the Keratin two minute Reconstructer. I&#x27;m also impressed with the delivery and packaging from this seller, is  very secure.</li>
    <li> I think the shampoo was expired because the texture was bumpy and not consistent or creamy. It made my hair dryer and I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> I found the product to be quite drying. It left my hair feeling stripped, and squeaky feeling.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have damaged hair but wanted to use a pre-treatment to catch and possibilities of damage since I&#x27;m newly transitioning to natural. This smells wonderful and feels like butter on the hair love it!</li>
    <li> Definitely does what it says. I&#x27;ve used this line of products all by itself and it definitely stops breakage keeps your hairstrong the protein is great... I love this, it&#x27;s my third time purchasing I have combined it with Garnier products as well it works well with my hair but all and all this product definitely is amazing!!</li>
