    <li> My skin feels better than it has in years!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I am using it on my body and face, and both are soft and smooth.  I will buy a couple more  for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Make&#x27;s my skin soft and smells so nice.</li>
    <li> Not very substantial, not much grit/texture, small amount -- only lasted about a week when used as directed. I really wanted to love this because of the minerals.</li>
    <li> I used this product in the shower last night and it made my skin so soft. I have never ever used body scrub before all over my whole body, I have just used face scrub before. The smell is great, to me it has a hint of orange smell. When this product is use you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot. I like that the jar is big because I plan on using it for every shower I take until it&#x27;s gone. My daughter and son really like this scrub also. They said they like the smell of it also. My kids and I all have dry skin and after using this body scrub our skin was no longer dry, it was nice and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has All Natural Dead Sea Salt Minerals, Ginger Root, VIT E and Pure Essential Oils of Grapefruit, Coriander, Cardamom, Eucalyptus, Ginger, Clove, Lime, Orange, Bergamot and Lemon.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is paraben free and not tested on animals. I think it is great that it is made in the USA with 100% satisfaction guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have been using Body Scrub by Derma-nu in combination with the Aloe Vera Moisturizing Skin Cream by Derma-nu. I use both products on my feet each evening when taking a bath. My feet have become terribly dry in the past few months, and they really needed attention. Because it&#x27;s sandal weather, I need my feet to look their best. The mineral body scrub and moisturizing cream have done wonders for my dry and rough skin. The body scrub contains Dead Sea Minerals, Ginger, Essential Oils, and Vitamin E, which are natural moisturizers that help hydrate skin. The moisturizing skin cream contains Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, and Vitamin B3, which penetrate deep into the skin to help revitalize and refresh the skin. I massage a quarter size amount of body scrub on each foot so that the Dead Sea Minerals exfoliate my skin as the other ingredients infuse moisture into my skin. After my bath, I massage a generous amount of moisturizing cream on my feet. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly. I received both products at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I used both products specifically on my feet so that I could honestly review them. I have been pleased with the results. My heels and the balls of my feet were extremely dry and rough two weeks ago. My heels are no longer dry, and the balls of my feet have improved a great deal. There are still some rough spots, but with consistent use, I have no doubt that the rough spots will eventually be gone. One thing that I haven&#x27;t found pleasing is the smell of both products. The scrub has a citrus smell that seems to be a combination of lemon and orange. The moisturizing skin cream smells like an anti-bacterial cream used for burns. Because they work so well for me, the smell is not a deal breaker, but it is the reason for a four star rating instead of a five star rating. The Body Scrub by Derma-nu and Aloe Vera Moisturizing Skin Cream by Derma-nu are great in combination and have worked well for me.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use a body scrub, just facial scrubs. So when I was offered this Body Scrub from Derma-nu for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a jar. It arrived and I&#x27;ve used it a few times over the last week and I love the way my skin feels! I couldn&#x27;t tell you the last time my skin was this refreshed! I know that I&#x27;m gonna have to use this Body Scrub from Derma-nu every week because I can&#x27;t imagine not having skin that feels so amazing ever again. I definitely recommend that everyone try this body scrub and reveal a new you.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and worked well. My skin feels soft and great after use. Will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this Derma Nu Body Scrub for my feet because summer is coming and my feet weren&#x27;t looking so great. Soon after it arrived,  I realized that it would be good to use on my whole body.  It contains salt from the Dead Sea which breaks down toxins and hydrates the skin.  It dissolves fatty tissues and helps to reduce cellulite and stretch marks.  I have been using this in the shower after I wash my body.  I rub it on and rub rub rub all over and let it sit for a little while and then rinse it off. It exfoliates my skin and it is becoming so soft and smooth. I also discovered that it is good for cuticles -  mine now look better than they have in years!  Oh - and my feet --they are now sandal ready!!!  : )&lt;br /&gt;I got this body scrub at a promotional price for evaluation and review purposes.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub. It smells amazing and makes my skin very smooth, although it&#x27;s not very gritty and abrasive. I think it&#x27;s the minerals in this scrub that make my skin feel so hydrated and smooth. I will definitely be reordering!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Only a  teaspoon applied smooths an arm or the face. My face needs less cleansing, and it is non-greasy. I just smooth it on without any rubbing, and it does the job</li>
    <li> I love this body scrub.  My skin feels so rejuvenated and hydrated.  This scrub makes your skin also feel clean.  I will definitely buy this item again.  You&#x27;ll never want to use a soap bar again.</li>
    <li> This scrub is totally awesome.  My skins feels so smooth, fresh and clean.  And I  looks so so much younger!!  I give this product an A+++++ Thank you so much for making this product and making it available at such a great price!!!</li>
    <li> My wife started having pimples after using it once. She did not like it.</li>
    <li> Dead Sea Body Scrub by Derma-nu Miracle skin, is an excellent product. The scent is very herbal, fairly strong, however, once the hands (or body&amp; feet) are rinsed off, hands feel so soft.  I use about a teaspoon of product per use.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Make your skin come alive.  A must have!</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about the collection of products I received from Derma-Nu. They came highly recommended by a friend so I had to try them and I am very glad I did. Don&#x27;t let the simple packaging fool you. These products are packed with wonderful ingredients which my sensitive, dry skin loved and the light natural smell is very pleasing. You definitely want to buy the complete set. Your skin will feel firmer, moisturized and pampered, like you just had a spa treatment. So pleased with all 5 of these products! - (I will leave the same review for all the products with the specific product at the top)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Body Scrub is heavenly! I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the spa after I use it. It smells wonderful and is so versatile. I use it on my face, hands and body. My skin feels so smooth and pampered after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Moisturizing Skin Cream is super rich &amp; emollient! It is a delicious tub of yummy moisture that lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth Regenerating Moisturizing Skin Cream is just wonderful! My dry face loves it! I love it as a night cream - my face still feels hydrated in the morning. After 1 week I noticed a more evenness in skin tone, moisture and appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serum is amazing! My skin felt firm and toned the very 1st time I used it. After about 2 weeks I can really see a difference in my fina lines and my face has a nice glow from the Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth Activating Eye Gel is so great! I love that it comes in a gel form because it is so soothing. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes at all. As soon as I put it on the eye area looks firmer and my little lines seem to disappear.</li>
    <li> I love this spreadable body scrub. It has a really light citrus scent and I noticed that my skin immediately started improving and getting smoother. I love the mix of essential oils with the salt. It is nice to soak in as well and not harsh on the skin as other scrubs.</li>
    <li> This feels like a very high quality product - unlike any other scrub I&#x27;ve used.  I like it!</li>
    <li> This mineral body scrub is very moisturizing and greasy.  It has very little exfoliant properties.  If you like salt or sugar scrubs, avoid this one.  This reminds me of a thick body butter with a 1/2 teaspoon of sand mixed in.  The scent is ok and it  might be nice for someone who has extremely dry skin.  I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but I exfoliate my legs before shaving them and this was not the product to do that with.  I&#x27;d be better off with body wash and a wash cloth or puff ball.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> iT FEELS GOOD ON THE SKIN, SMELLS GOOD, AND IS EASY TO USE. DON&#x27;T KNOW ABOUT ITS EFFICACY - IT IS JUST A NICE PRODUCT WITH NO BAD STUFF ADDED, I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, AS &amp;#34;THE BAD STUFF&amp;#34; TRANSMITS THOUGH THE SKIN TO YOUR BLOOD STREAM AND CELLS AND WHO WANTS THAT ON THE INSIDE?</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local show and it&#x27;s great. I keep it in the shower and use it on my arms. It smooths out the little &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; and exfoliates the skin. It&#x27;s not too harsh like some other products, but works!</li>
    <li> A must have product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Best cleanser and exfoliator that also nourishes and moiturizes for real!(no empty promises,as yucky chemicals)&lt;br /&gt;I love having healthier skin, my skin loves the essential minerals combined with organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have bumps on the back of my arms and thighs and thought this product might help and I truly think it is. I don&#x27;t use it as often as I probably should ( I usually use it about once a week) but I do think it is helping. The grit is pretty fine, which really doesn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;ve never really been a big fan of body scrubs because of the feeling of whatever the product uses to exfoliate. ( I know I&#x27;m weird) But what I usually do is wash the area in the shower and then apply this stuff and rub it in/around with my wash cloth and then rinse. The area usually feels much smoother than before I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell: The smell is not bad. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of ginger but I still like it. Once out of the shower those areas don&#x27;t feel dry, so the scrub is moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall; I like it and i&#x27;ll probably continue to use it on a weekly basis. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to my mom and other friends.</li>
