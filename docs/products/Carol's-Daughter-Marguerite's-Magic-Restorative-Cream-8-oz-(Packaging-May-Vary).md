      <li>I also love the scent.</li>
      <li>Try it and you too will love it.</li>
      <li>Love it will buy it again</li>
      <li>medium twists came out shiny and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>I ended up returning the product because I found better and more cost-effective alternative for myself.</li>
      <li>Works better than miss jessies also.</li>
      <li>Well anyway, I decided to try CD&#x27;s Marguerite&#x27;s Magic after reading all of the reviews and what I thought was moisturized hair</li>
      <li>so far so great, I&#x27;m in love</li>
      <li>next day my twists were beautiful.</li>
      <li>it tames down the frizz and gives a perfect shine.</li>
      <li>However, S of M M works best in my opinion to smooth down edges and flyaways while adding sheen.  </li>
      <li>Works great paired with the M. Honey, which I used on my ends only.</li>
      <li>It helps me keep the hair frizz free.</li>
      <li>I think that some hair types and textures have better success with Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products than others.</li>
      <li>so its a great value) I predict the 8 oz jar will last around 6 months, maybe more.&lt;br</li>
      <li>: So I have been working out more intensely and this product still keeps my hair smooth, moisturized, shiny, and manageable after working out.</li>
      <li>used this on clean damp hair.</li>
      <li>well and makes it soft and have a nice sheen to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for good hair products that moisturizes, reduce flakes, safe for relaxed/color treated hair, helps breakage, and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  </li>
      <li>Works great paired with the M. Honey, which I used on my ends only.healthy, and fluffy, with a uniform pattern.</li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t use a mix of ingredients that also smell nice - like fruits and vanilla and such.</li>
      <li>From Soft Sheen (Anti Breakage/Dandruff), Organic Root Stimulator (Carrot Oil, Coconut Oil, Hair Fertilizer), Sulfur 8, Top Brass, Dr. Miracle, Motions, Castor Oil, etc.  </li>
      <li>much so 1 jar could last you a good while.  </li>
      <li>but I think it may be worth it.  </li>
      <li>Amazing for twist out and flat twist out.</li>
      <li>However, it is easy to figure out how much you need and it won&#x27;t leave a film unless you really put way too much in.</li>
      <li>Love it and would definitely recommend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Reduces # of split ends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not discolor my blonde hair like many like products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Possibly it is okay for a different texture.</li>
      <li>AND it even softened my new growth tremendously.</li>
      <li>But my experiences were still positive; maybe this will help someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I did not like it as well when I first purchased it because my hair was straight</li>
      <li>It really works best in my daughters hair (3yrs old) which is naturally curly and delicate.  </li>
      <li>no frizz and super soft.  </li>
      <li>there are often these ingredients that have such strong smells.</li>
      <li>/&gt;A week later on clean hair, I used a lot more product to do 6 large twists (about a quarter size for entire head) on damp hair.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>but it really conditions my hair</li>
      <li>it straight</li>
      <li>Once I begin to get ready for work</li>
      <li>The consistency really throws me off, though, but I will repurchase.</li>
      <li>The consistency really throws me off, though.</li>
      <li>really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have tried several of CD&#x27;s products and most have just been OK, or did absolutely nothing special for my hair and even at times seemed like it was making things worse for my hair.  </li>
      <li>When I was transitioning, it made my new growth softer and more manageable, and my relaxed hair less dry and more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
      <li>My main purpose for purchasing this product is because I want to turn up my workout</li>
      <li>I live in New Orleans and it can get very humid here..</li>
      <li>I think I will only use this the first time I two strand twist my hair, then every other day or more.</li>
      <li>My mother, who is natural, and who presses her hair, really likes this product.  </li>
      <li>I plan to use it for when I twist and to moisturize twists, but it also works well as a normal moisturizer sans twisting.</li>
      <li>My hair was shiny, healthy, and fluffy, with a uniform pattern.</li>
      <li>youre not careful and add too much it can leave a film on your hair.</li>
      <li>I have used this product many times, and on both wet, freshly-shampooed and dry hair.  </li>
      <li>It is too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I think, at least for me as an African-American, that this product works better on relaxed hair, or on pressed, natural hair.  </li>
      <li>in the morning her hair is not so tangled, she&#x27;s a wild sleeper.</li>
      <li>I have a sensitive nose, and it doesn&#x27;t give me problems.</li>
      <li>I have type 4a natural hair</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel soft, holds a curl, and does not flake or feel greasy.</li>
      <li>I often thought that with the abundance of oil and natural products I was putting on my hair that it was well moisturized, even though some oils would not be dissolved into my hair too well leaving me with an oily face</li>
      <li>I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and it just seemed to sit on my hair, not absorb.</li>
      <li>I use this on my 10yo daughters natural kinky/coily thick hair, honestly its the only product we have tried that actually softens and moisturizes her hair.</li>
      <li>While on initial application, the hair is soft and shiny,</li>
      <li>Essential for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>Now that I am fully natural, I have a different opinion.  </li>
      <li>I like it a lot for the way I am wearing my hair presently, which is all natural.  </li>
      <li>Tomorrow starts a new workout regime which includes daily running and strengthening, I&#x27;ll come back to let you all know</li>
      <li>I have lots of natural straight blonde hair that is extremely prone to dryness, breakage, and split ends.</li>
      <li>Finding good products that actually work for African American hair types can be a difficult task.  </li>
      <li>I never blow dry,  straighten, or process it any way; my hair is just naturally brittle and dry.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is often my complaint with many products for black hair.</li>

    <li> I have lots of natural straight blonde hair that is extremely prone to dryness, breakage, and split ends. I never blow dry,  straighten, or process it any way; my hair is just naturally brittle and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I&#x27;ve been searching forever to find something... And this may be it! Here are the pros and con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit goes a long way, about 1/2 tsp is enough for all my ends (@ target this is only $12 so its a great value) I predict the 8 oz jar will last around 6 months, maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair shiny, smooth, and manageable! Not greasy or limp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is growing again! Hair isn&#x27;t breaking off as much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent, does not irritate my skin or scalp allergies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduces # of split ends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not discolor my blonde hair like many like products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t a permenant fix, the next day I still have to use it again to get the same effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If youre not careful and add too much it can leave a film on your hair. However, it is easy to figure out how much you need and it won&#x27;t leave a film unless you really put way too much in.</li>
    <li> I have been trying all kinds of products on my hair since \\&quot;going natural.\\&quot;  This is the only product that I like for my ends as a sealant.  I experience less breakage and it appears and feels stronger.  It is a bit pricey but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product !! love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product several months ago when I was transitioning, i.e. growing out my relaxer.  When I was transitioning, it made my new growth softer and more manageable, and my relaxed hair less dry and more moisturized.  Now that I am fully natural, I have a different opinion.  I have used this product many times, and on both wet, freshly-shampooed and dry hair.  I have used it as a leave-in before applying a styler, and have used it over a styler.  While on initial application, the hair is soft and shiny, these attributes, at least in my experience, are not long-lasting.  I find that by the end of the day, my hair has lost its luster, and feels rather crunchy.  My mother, who is natural, and who presses her hair, really likes this product.  I think, at least for me as an African-American, that this product works better on relaxed hair, or on pressed, natural hair.  So, I don&#x27;t plan on tossing it; it&#x27;s much too expensive for that. LOL!  When I press my hair, I will give the product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that I find rather peculiar about Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair care products is this: Lisa Price claims that they are designed for all hair types and textures.  I don&#x27;t think that this is the case.  I think that some hair types and textures have better success with Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products than others.</li>
    <li> I will only use Carol&#x27;s Daughter on my curly hair</li>
    <li> I have type 4a natural hair and I use to use miss Jessie products but all they did was dry out my hair. I came to find out it was because miss Jessie puts mineral oil in her products. I can witness that carol daughter hair products have no mineral oil and they cost less. All in all I use this cream to do twist and twist out and it leaves my hair moist and shiny also no frizz and super soft.  When using use a little and you will be amazed. I also love the scent. It is not over powering at all. Try it and you too will love it.</li>
    <li> Finding good products that actually work for African American hair types can be a difficult task.  I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for good hair products that moisturizes, reduce flakes, safe for relaxed/color treated hair, helps breakage, and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  I&#x27;ve tried almost everything!!  From Soft Sheen (Anti Breakage/Dandruff), Organic Root Stimulator (Carrot Oil, Coconut Oil, Hair Fertilizer), Sulfur 8, Top Brass, Dr. Miracle, Motions, Castor Oil, etc.  But I was never completely satisfied with either of those products.  They either didn&#x27;t work, still had flakes, didn&#x27;t smell too great, or weighed my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol&#x27;s Daughter Marguerite to the RESCUE!!! I LOVE the smell of this hairdress.  This is my 1st time using it and so far my hair feels light, moisturized, and smells GREAT! The price is a little steep for a hairdress but I think it may be worth it.  You don&#x27;t need to use much so 1 jar could last you a good while.  As I continue to use this product I will update my review if I experience any changes.</li>
    <li> I have tried several of CD&#x27;s products and most have just been OK, or did absolutely nothing special for my hair and even at times seemed like it was making things worse for my hair.  However, there have been a few that I think work and does what it says, and this is 1.  I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and it just seemed to sit on my hair, not absorb. However, S of M M works best in my opinion to smooth down edges and flyaways while adding sheen.  It really works best in my daughters hair (3yrs old) which is naturally curly and delicate.  It holds her flyaways nicely and keeps her hair looking neat with no frizzies. A little goes a long way though, because if too much is used it does tend to be too heavy on the hair and will leave product build up. Try it, it just may work for you.</li>
    <li> This product prevents my hair from bring frizzy. The smell is great and you don&#x27;t have to use much. Keeps my hair moisturized. I will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft, holds a curl, and does not flake or feel greasy. I ordered another jar. Essential for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> Love Carol&#x27;s daughter and Marguerite&#x27;s Magic. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy and if I wear my hair curly or flat iron it straight it tames down the frizz and gives a perfect shine.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 10yo daughters natural kinky/coily thick hair, honestly its the only product we have tried that actually softens and moisturizes her hair. it has a really nice smell, which she likes-bonus! i apply it to hair and scalp at night and wrap her hair up. in the morning her hair is not so tangled, she&#x27;s a wild sleeper. All in all it is a good product and it works for her hair. With anything it&#x27;s trial and error, for the past two years now this has remained a staple in her hair reg.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Amazing for twist out and flat twist out. Very moisturizing. Works better than miss jessies also. This is Def a staple product for me.</li>
    <li> this is often my complaint with many products for black hair. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t use a mix of ingredients that also smell nice - like fruits and vanilla and such. there are often these ingredients that have such strong smells. I hate to use it but it really conditions my hair well and makes it soft and have a nice sheen to it. but I have to wash my hair every 3 days.</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations.  I see an improvement in my hair, I am getting the results I hoped for.</li>
    <li> I often thought that with the abundance of oil and natural products I was putting on my hair that it was well moisturized, even though some oils would not be dissolved into my hair too well leaving me with an oily face :-/ YIKES! Well anyway, I decided to try CD&#x27;s Marguerite&#x27;s Magic after reading all of the reviews and what I thought was moisturized hair truly transformed into something wonderful. After applying to my scalp and ends--Instantly my hair was softer, shinier, and well manageable by allowing me to comb/brush with little to no breakage AND it even softened my new growth tremendously. My main purpose for purchasing this product is because I want to turn up my workout and I sweat heavily on my scalp. We all know that sweat includes salt and salt dries out anything especially hair and I don&#x27;t want my hair to become a reason for me to not be in the best shape of my life. Tomorrow starts a new workout regime which includes daily running and strengthening, I&#x27;ll come back to let you all know how or if this product remains \\&quot;magical\\&quot;...so far so great, I&#x27;m in love already!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: So I have been working out more intensely and this product still keeps my hair smooth, moisturized, shiny, and manageable after working out. After I workout my hair is always wet. I just apply a little MM (a little goes a long way) and wrap it up for the moment. Once I begin to get ready for work I unwrap my hair and you would have never thought that I worked out that morning. This is a keeper in my book.</li>
    <li> I just got this product a few days ago and already plan to reorder when I run out of it.  I am really pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I use it after shower while styling and when in need to tame rough hair. It helps me keep the hair frizz free.</li>
    <li> I am not having good results with this product, as I am not seeing any benefit. It is too heavy for my fine hair. Possibly it is okay for a different texture.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product [one from Amazon and one from a retailer].  I like it a lot for the way I am wearing my hair presently, which is all natural.  I did not like it as well when I first purchased it because my hair was straight and it was too heavy and weighty for the hair.  Works best on hair that is not permed.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use mine for my L.O.C. I also use Carol Daughters leave in conditioner as part of my L.O.C regime.  It leaves a beautiful shine.  Softness and takes a lot of frizz away. Ive also noticed little breakage after wash day. I am very heavy handed with products but once you get the hang of them you will realize that a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> Love it will buy it again</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product! I live in New Orleans and it can get very humid here..this control&#x27;s frizz and make my hair silky..a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I honestly have no idea what this product does but I never stopped hearing my sister tell me how it worked miracles for her.</li>
    <li> Love it and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff in my hair.  One of the best products I have used on my natural hair.</li>
    <li> **I ended up returning the product because I found better and more cost-effective alternative for myself. But my experiences were still positive; maybe this will help someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on clean damp hair. I used just a tiny bit, emulsified it between my palms, and smoothed it on a small section of hair, then twisted my hair. I made 20 medium twists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My medium twists came out shiny and healthy looking. If you are making small to medium sized twists/braids, just use a touch per section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day my twists were beautiful. Two days later I unraveled to re moisturize and re twist. My hair was shiny, healthy, and fluffy, with a uniform pattern. I used just a touch of creme on each section to moisturize for the day, then twisted back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later on clean hair, I used a lot more product to do 6 large twists (about a quarter size for entire head) on damp hair. My hair responded well and is moisturized, shiny, and soft while twisted up. It&#x27;s winter here so I don&#x27;t plan on wearing a twist out until summer, but whenever I take my twists down to remoisturize I like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant, light scent. I have a sensitive nose, and it doesn&#x27;t give me problems. It is VERY thick. A little goes a long way. I think I will only use this the first time I two strand twist my hair, then every other day or more. I would not put it all over your hair every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this stuff. The consistency really throws me off, though. I plan to use it for when I twist and to moisturize twists, but it also works well as a normal moisturizer sans twisting. Works great paired with the M. Honey, which I used on my ends only.healthy, and fluffy, with a uniform pattern. I used just a touch of creme on each section to moisturize for the day, then twisted back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this stuff. The consistency really throws me off, though, but I will repurchase. This 8oz jar will last me the longest. Works great paired with the M. Honey, which I used on my ends only.</li>
