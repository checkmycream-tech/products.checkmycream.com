      <li>Hopes it works better for you guys though.</li>
      <li>I am not quite sure why this product is specified for men.  </li>
      <li>but it couldn&#x27;t handle it any more.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I used to use whatever deodorant was cheap or trendy at the time</li>

      <li>I preferred Mitchum&#x27;s old sold stick, but this is still a good deodorant to use that doesn&#x27;t seem to stain shirts.</li>
      <li>In the past I used the gel variety, but if you travel by air this might not be the best choice since the gel seems to like to extrude as the plane compresses and decompresses</li>
      <li>Use the stick as the liquid roller ball stuff, while it works great, takes a while to dry.  </li>
      <li>But I do know that it lasts a full day.</li>
      <li>Still a good solid stick deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I switched to Mitchum and have been smelling sweet ever since.  </li>
      <li>It smells fresh and clean all day--even after a brisk trip out of Sodom.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to Sure for sure.</li>
      <li>It lasted a very long time and smelled good.  </li>
      <li>On top of this, I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to find a product you&#x27;re so satisfied with that you can just use it with confidence and not give it any more mental attention for a few decades!</li>
      <li>I recently used old spice which I loved</li>
      <li>This is the first time in  about 20 years I strayed from Mitchims gel product.</li>
      <li>Needless to say this product is awesome.</li>
      <li>Although I use it daily, the stick lasts for the better part of a year.</li>
      <li>well I went camping over a hot 4th of July with no shower at night and</li>
      <li>For all the hot temp people out there and have uncontrollable sweat</li>
      <li>Third, it&#x27;s easy to apply and leaves no stain.</li>
      <li>Why did Mitchum get rid of their excellent solid unscented deodorant and replace it with several less desirable products?  </li>
      <li>This summer while working in a non-air conditioned warehouse I really needed to control the wetness and odor as the &amp;#34;AXE&amp;#34; product I was using seemed to do nothing.  </li>
      <li>Adds time to getting ready for work.</li>
      <li>Not only have I lost the red spots, but this deodorant keeps me smelling great THE ENTIRE DAY!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Mitchum Deodorant for over 30 years, very simply because it works, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, and causes no negative effects like skin irritation.</li>
      <li>Mitchum works better than any other deoderant I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old Mitchum (i.e., not &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34;), it still gets 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t comment on its usefulness as an antiperspirant, because after putting it on for the first time, I had to immediately scrub it off before I developed a migraine.</li>
      <li>There are several reasons why I&#x27;ve remained loyal to it.</li>
      <li>Highly rated by the leading consumer magazine.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Of course, last but not least, it worked quite well as an antiperspirant and deodorant in the very hot Middle-East.</li>
      <li>Keeps me dry and fresh all day!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am not forced to order any and all SmartSolid Unscented I can find</li>
      <li>Costs a little bit more on here than some other places but includes free shipping (with $25 order) and you can skip parking, walking, and waiting in lines at the store.</li>
      <li>Finally found a good replacement for my previous Mitchum product that had worked well for years but was apparently discontinued.</li>
      <li>i got the new mitchum with the oxygen control one instead of this one, this is</li>
      <li>Amazon was nice enough to refund me for this mistake without requiring a return; I guess there&#x27;s not a huge market for used deodorant.</li>
      <li>Wow did this deodorant exceed my expectations!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to most antiperspirants/deodorants, traditional and advanced control Mitchum are the least likely to cause a reaction.</li>
      <li>I was worried about purchasing this because it has the exact same active ingredient in the exact same amount (20% Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY) as many other antiperspirants, such as Degree or Right Guard.</li>
      <li>Second, it keeps me dry and odor free throughout the day.</li>
      <li>believe this new \\&quot;Oxygen\\&quot; stuff is a new formula, so perhaps the older stick did not have such an overpowering smell.</li>
      <li>Complete, full-day coverage.</li>
      <li>2 weeks ago I started using this deodorant in hopes of stopping the irritation causes by Old Spice.</li>
      <li>The new gels stink when you exercise -- hot deodorant is not really a better smell than hot sweat.  </li>
      <li>Only complaint is the cap doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
      <li>online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING BACK SMART SOLID!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really keep you dry and also end up deteriorating the pits of your shirts.</li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
      <li>it goes on clear (use less if its going on white) and last a full day + ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Caveat - buy stuff fulfilled by Amazon even if you have to wait a little while to reach the $25-35 threshold for free shipping with multiple low priced items.  </li>
      <li>This solid is okay but not nearly as good as its predecessor.  </li>
      <li>Finally, I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>so it barely works on me.</li>
      <li>I used to use Old Spice products because they were the only deodorant that would work through the work day.</li>
      <li>I used the old solid unscented for years.  </li>
      <li>This solid variant fixed that issue for me.</li>
      <li>I still sweat when the heat is turned up but under normal conditions I stay dry and funk-free,</li>
      <li>To me, it does the exact same as other antiperspirants</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Why did Mitchum get rid of their excellent solid unscented deodorant and replace it with several less desirable products?  I used the old solid unscented for years.  It didn&#x27;t  smell weird and it worked really well.  The new gels stink when you exercise -- hot deodorant is not really a better smell than hot sweat.  This solid is okay but not nearly as good as its predecessor.  I am looking for another brand to switch to after having used Mictchum for the last 40 years.</li>
    <li> Strongest antiperspirant on the market.  Use the stick as the liquid roller ball stuff, while it works great, takes a while to dry.  Adds time to getting ready for work.</li>
    <li> I was having issues with my prior deodorant (a soft solid).  Actually, one underarm would get funky well before the other.  I switched to Mitchum and have been smelling sweet ever since.  I still sweat when the heat is turned up but under normal conditions I stay dry and funk-free,</li>
    <li> When my son started his pre-teen years, he started smelling like salty chicken. No more baby scent. This deodorant was recommended by his doctor. It is life changing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They usually sell this at any drug or grocery store, but they don&#x27;t sell this formula at the store near me anymore. This formula is the white solid stick (Mitchum also has this gel-solid which is gross). Great price, great product... I plan on buying it in bulk.</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like a bottle of cheap cologne exploded on you, buy this. Can&#x27;t comment on its usefulness as an antiperspirant, because after putting it on for the first time, I had to immediately scrub it off before I developed a migraine. I basically had to take a second shower, and even then, the scent is \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; enough that it&#x27;s still on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the smell like? It&#x27;s like a drunken monster made of Axe Body Spray punching you in the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual scent itself might be bearable if it was 0.1% of the intensity, but they left the knob turned up to 11. If you smell so bad that you need something this strong, you are probably a) a rotting zombie corpse b) need to see a doctor or c) just take a friggin&#x27; shower already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this new \\&quot;Oxygen\\&quot; stuff is a new formula, so perhaps the older stick did not have such an overpowering smell. Amazon was nice enough to refund me for this mistake without requiring a return; I guess there&#x27;s not a huge market for used deodorant.</li>
    <li> I am a woman but not a big fan of flowery scents, nor do I want to smell like a man. This antiperspirant works really well and the smell is pleasant, mild, and rather gender neutral.</li>
    <li> I am not quite sure why this product is specified for men.  I am a woman and really liked it.  I used this while traveling abroad for several weeks.  It lasted a very long time and smelled good.  It did not leave white residue on my clothing.  Of course, last but not least, it worked quite well as an antiperspirant and deodorant in the very hot Middle-East.</li>
    <li> For all the hot temp people out there and have uncontrollable sweat this is it best deo i have ever tried smells great and actually works so happy no worrying anymore thank you</li>
    <li> ived tried many differnt deodorants to mask my musk and none worked until i found this ne thumbs up great value</li>
    <li> This works very well and has a pleasant smell. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve found my &#x27;grown up&#x27; deodorant .. it goes on clear (use less if its going on white) and last a full day + ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason to reapply is because you washed it off in the shower (please shower).</li>
    <li> It really does smell terrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years. It has the same active ingredients as any of the clinical strength stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum solid stick deodorant for at least two decades. There are several reasons why I&#x27;ve remained loyal to it. First, it&#x27;s long lasting. Although I use it daily, the stick lasts for the better part of a year. (It&#x27;s far superior to gels in this regard. I tried a Mitchum gel once, and it only lasted a few months, despite the fact I used it sparingly.) Second, it keeps me dry and odor free throughout the day. The outside of the container says that it lasts for 48 hours. I&#x27;ve never tried to see whether it lasts that long, since I shower every day and I put it on after showering. But I do know that it lasts a full day. Third, it&#x27;s easy to apply and leaves no stain. Finally, I have sensitive skin. And some other deodorants make me itch. Mitchum has never done this. So, I imagine I&#x27;ll keep using it for quite some time to come.</li>
    <li> Love it. Been using Mitchum for40 years. It WORKS.</li>
    <li> I do not purchase deoderants with &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34;.  I looked and looked all over this container before buying it and NOWHERE does it say that it is &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34;.  And the scent is HORRIBLE... makes me sick.  So I cannot use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should say plaining that it&#x27;s scented.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant my husband will use. He loves it. It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> i got the new mitchum with the oxygen control one instead of this one, this is an old one, the new oxygen one is HORRIBLE , smells like sweat, makes you sweat like you dont have anything on, and gives you b,o in 4 hours</li>
    <li> Come on you didnt know this was the best deodorant on earth? This stuff lasts all day and doesnt drip off. A must for serious sweaters. Costs a little bit more on here than some other places but includes free shipping (with $25 order) and you can skip parking, walking, and waiting in lines at the store.</li>
    <li> Husband love ready to get more</li>
    <li> Not a real value- same price or cheaper at Walgreens!</li>
    <li> good product will used again</li>
    <li> It smells fresh and clean all day--even after a brisk trip out of Sodom.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that works for me. Although it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old Mitchum (i.e., not &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34;), it still gets 5 stars. I can&#x27;t afford to skip a day though...I get about 12 hours of protection instead of the supposed 48.</li>
    <li> Finally found a good replacement for my previous Mitchum product that had worked well for years but was apparently discontinued.</li>
    <li> I was worried about purchasing this because it has the exact same active ingredient in the exact same amount (20% Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY) as many other antiperspirants, such as Degree or Right Guard. However, I tried it due to the abundance of recommendations. To me, it does the exact same as other antiperspirants so it barely works on me. Hopes it works better for you guys though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum Deodorant for over 30 years, very simply because it works, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, and causes no negative effects like skin irritation. Simply invisible protection. Years ago when they seemed to do more advertising, their motto was that it was so effective, that you could forget a day and still be protected. No doubt some executive said, hey, you can&#x27;t tell people to skip a day lest our sales drop 50%. But it does seem to meet that claim. In the past I used the gel variety, but if you travel by air this might not be the best choice since the gel seems to like to extrude as the plane compresses and decompresses and I often found a mess in my toiletry kit. This solid variant fixed that issue for me. It&#x27;s great to find a product you&#x27;re so satisfied with that you can just use it with confidence and not give it any more mental attention for a few decades!</li>
    <li> I am a big guy who sweats constantly. I have had trouble in the past finding deodorant a that work well for me. On top of this, I have sensitive skin. I used to use Old Spice products because they were the only deodorant that would work through the work day. But even with this deodorant, I would end up smelling bad by the time I got home. Also the deodorant would irritate my arms and leave red marks. 2 weeks ago I started using this deodorant in hopes of stopping the irritation causes by Old Spice. Wow did this deodorant exceed my expectations! Not only have I lost the red spots, but this deodorant keeps me smelling great THE ENTIRE DAY! That is unheard of for me!! Needless to say this product is awesome. I am very happy to have stumbled upon it.</li>
    <li> great product, great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum deodorants for awhile now and am very happy with how they smell and keep me from smelling. I don&#x27;t wear cologne, but people will often say that I smell good. Not sure if it&#x27;s just the way I smell or if it&#x27;s the Mitchum working it&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> Good deodorant, no smell really, perfect for my routine which is no scents or light scents and a nice cologne.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few times and finally stopped. Doesn&#x27;t really keep you dry and also end up deteriorating the pits of your shirts.</li>
    <li> I hate that Mitchum decided to &amp;#34;reinvent&amp;#34; their products and packaging. This deodorant is terrible compared to their old SmartSolid line that they discontinued. With the SmartSolid, I could probably apply deodorant and not have underarm odor for a couple of days if needed. With this &amp;#34;Advanced Control&amp;#34;, I would need to apply by lunch time the same day...it just doesn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not forced to order any and all SmartSolid Unscented I can find online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING BACK SMART SOLID!</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry and fresh all day! Why can I not find this in the brick and mortar? No matter, because I can get it here!</li>
    <li> Highly rated by the leading consumer magazine. Works fine.</li>
    <li> Does NOT work! Useless. I&#x27;m going back to Sure for sure.</li>
    <li> A proven name with a proven product. Tried others but nothing works as well as Mitchum.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great shipping great price. Buying again. Real dude real b.o. Real good Deodorant.</li>
    <li> Mitchum works better than any other deoderant I have ever tried.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works Great. Quick shipping</li>
    <li> Clear cap that covered the deodorant/antiperspirant was stuck with so much suction, when attempting to remove it after taking off the green cap, the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; broke exposing the screw post. Unusable.  Amazon pre-paid return accomplished without a bit of trouble.  Caveat - buy stuff fulfilled by Amazon even if you have to wait a little while to reach the $25-35 threshold for free shipping with multiple low priced items.  Amazon business model should be adopted by the U.S. Gov&#x27;t. It works!!!  Happy customer here!</li>
    <li> I used to use whatever deodorant was cheap or trendy at the time and I would sweat like I had applied nothing with several other brands.  Mitchum caught my attention a few years back when they had a contest and awarded prizes to the hardest working ppl in America.  This summer while working in a non-air conditioned warehouse I really needed to control the wetness and odor as the &amp;#34;AXE&amp;#34; product I was using seemed to do nothing.  I made the switch to Mitchum and it was night and day.  I heard that they used to run an ad campaign that stated you could skip a day and still be protected,  well I went camping over a hot 4th of July with no shower at night and even on the second day sweat was minimal and odor was non-existent.  Due to the superior performance I&#x27;ve experienced with this product I&#x27;m gonna have to say that I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant ever!!!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Only complaint is the cap doesn&#x27;t fit right, it always comes off when it&#x27;s not supposed to.</li>
    <li> every time i go to the grocery store i keep forgetting i need deodorant so i just bought it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant for men!</li>
    <li> It is what it is I didn&#x27;t care for the scent but works all day</li>
    <li> do you have issues with heat... I do, so cut that moisture off before it even begins.... LOVE THIS! Works great for me&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to most antiperspirants/deodorants, traditional and advanced control Mitchum are the least likely to cause a reaction.</li>
    <li> This is the first time in  about 20 years I strayed from Mitchims gel product. I wont use this producf again. Lets me smell myself by mid afternoon. Never an issue with their gel product. Sorry Mitchim.</li>
    <li> Everything was great!</li>
    <li> Best antiperspirant on the market. Complete, full-day coverage.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. I recently used old spice which I loved but it couldn&#x27;t handle it any more. This stuff works great - protects dress shirts and the life. Highly recommend even though a little more expensive.</li>
    <li> Still a good solid stick deodorant.  I preferred Mitchum&#x27;s old sold stick, but this is still a good deodorant to use that doesn&#x27;t seem to stain shirts.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Keeps you dry and best of all, does not stain your shirts! You will stay dry all day and I have not had any skin irritation from using this deodorant for over a year.</li>
