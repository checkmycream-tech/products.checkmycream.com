      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously, do they want you to be able to USE this stuff or not?</li>
      <li>After searching the isle this one looked pretty good.</li>
      <li>I was  pleased that Amazon had it available and ordered the pack of 4.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product for your hair leaving it soft and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>Only product that makes my hair gorgeous!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s mostly acidic and overly sweet).</li>
      <li>I like the fact that its a fine mist and not a cream.</li>
      <li>The product is light and each time I get my hair cut</li>
      <li>The paranoid part of me thinks that these bottles are being filled with something cheap in someone&#x27;s basement.</li>
      <li>It helped smooth some of the frizz while styling hair</li>
      <li>Since this product is no longer available in stores, I had to order it through Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT - WISH THE COMPANY WOULD BRING IT BACK INTO THE STORES WHERE I COULD FIND IT.</li>
      <li>this Dove Damage Therapy Daily Moisture Replenishing Mist is great for those split ends.</li>
      <li>really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!  </li>
      <li>This has a light Dove clean scent.</li>
      <li>I originally found it in drug stores but can no longer find it, except at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Evidently Dove doesn&#x27;t make it any more because I didn&#x27;t find it Dove online.  </li>
      <li>However, it is great on dry hair to help comb it out and also helps to straiten if my hair has gotten a bit wavy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many replacements since and absolutely nothing compares to this product.</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair shiny and soft and has a nice clean fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, she is still able to purchase it on-line, and will do so as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>have ever found to work so well with my hair , My hair is some what thin an some what frizzy , But this product was awesome</li>
      <li>, I was actually washing my hair 2-3 times in the shower to make sure it was really clean</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, it&#x27;s a good product, works better on my hair than Pantene&#x27;s more expensive leave-in sprays; I just wish the people at Dove would redesign the bottle!</li>
      <li>Very, VERY frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The second time even better, but there is damage that I guess it just gonna take time to undue.</li>
      <li>and I actually get comments on how healthy my hair</li>
      <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is super soft and silky.</li>
      <li>The first time I used my old leave in, my hair was already looking and acting 90% better.</li>
      <li>I used to use this religiously back in the day when it was still available in stores.</li>
      <li>&quot; it is very manageable.  </li>
      <li>oh why when you find something that really works, it&#x27;s discontinued???  </li>
      <li>The seller was very prompt.  </li>
      <li>Dissapointed, expected better service from Amazon.</li>
      <li>fast shipment and</li>
      <li>I really like the way</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that I am going to enjoy it this summer also, because of my hair&#x27;s length by the time the natural oils and mosture get to the bottom half, the top half looks greasy and needs washing again.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is a bit different from that of the original product.  </li>
      <li>I bought this recently, because I couldn&#x27;t find my normal leave in condition (Johnson&#x27;s no more tangles) believe it or not that stuff is amazing, and cheap.</li>
      <li>I use the Dove Damage Therapy Daily Moisture Replenishing Mist each time before I comb or brush my hair and it keeps my hair soft and easy to comb through.  </li>
      <li>Dove&#x27;s Repht replenishing Mist is great for controling my hair&#x27;s static issues during these cold, dry winter months.  </li>
      <li>I do not see much of a difference as far as this spray adding moisture.  </li>
      <li>it is soft, shiny and the frizz is much reduced.  </li>
      <li>I have been unable to find this product locally and liked it better than any substitutes.  </li>
      <li>It works pretty well with my dry hair, just don&#x27;t use too much</li>
      <li>Normally it drys soft, shiny, and with no frizzing.</li>
      <li>I like it because it is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
      <li>Now my hair looks nice without having to be locked in place like with gel, or weighted down and greasy-feeling like with other leave in conditioners.  </li>
      <li>Use in morning and hair stays in place all day/night and is not stiff, but natural looking.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s slightly ROUNDED on top, probably for some aesthetic reason, instead of ergonomically flat or concave, so your finger slips right off every freaking time you try to depress the button!</li>
      <li>AND IT COMES OUT SO SOFT.  </li>
      <li>keeps my hair feeling soft and moisturzied.  </li>
      <li>what in the world are they thinking about makes women&#x27;s skin soft and radiant</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and controls my &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>This product is the reason my hair is soft and silky.</li>
      <li>Personally I feel this one should have stayed and new one just be a new product.</li>
      <li>use this product everday after normal shampoo and condition and it is the only leave in conditioner/mist I have found that works.  </li>
      <li>AND SHE&#x27;S VERY PICKY ABOUT WHAT SHE PUTS ON HER HAIR, AND HER HAIR IS SOOOOO DRY</li>
      <li>/&gt;Oh, and to the commenter above - Dove fixed the bottle to make it easier to push the pump.  </li>
      <li>Just seems very... personal.. a little sketchy.</li>

    <li> My wife has been using this for years, but can no longer find it locally.  Fortunately, she is still able to purchase it on-line, and will do so as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> Sorry I can&#x27;t buy this in the stores anymore. Glad that I can get it online. It is a great product. Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have a really hard time finding this anywhere but I&#x27;m so glad they sell it on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product everday after normal shampoo and condition and it is the only leave in conditioner/mist I have found that works.  My hair is normally frizzy and very dry, but after I use it and let my hair air dry it is soft, shiny and the frizz is much reduced.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy and heavy like a serum and it especially works wonders on the tips.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve got short hair, and a few spritzes of this stuff in the morning immediately relaxes my course, dry hair and they fall into place, softly -- no more &#x27;bed head&#x27;.  I can no longer find it in stores locally, so now I buy it online, because I won&#x27;t be without this product.</li>
    <li> This hair moisturizer is the only product I&#x27;ve found in 10 years that will help get rid of my dry scalp and dry hair!  I use it daily and I actually get comments on how healthy my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my scalp is so bad, I also have to use presciption dandruff relief, but my scalp still itched during the day until I started using this hair moisturizer.  Now my hair looks nice without having to be locked in place like with gel, or weighted down and greasy-feeling like with other leave in conditioners.  And it&#x27;s still shiny and frizz-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!  And I think Dove may have stopped selling it in the US!  I think I&#x27;ll write a letter to Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and to the commenter above - Dove fixed the bottle to make it easier to push the pump.  You don&#x27;t need to transfer it to another bottle anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this recently, because I couldn&#x27;t find my normal leave in condition (Johnson&#x27;s no more tangles) believe it or not that stuff is amazing, and cheap. After searching the isle this one looked pretty good. Then I used it! I always let my hair air dry, cause its so thick and I&#x27;m lazy. Normally it drys soft, shiny, and with no frizzing. With Dove my hair was drying frizzy, course and dried out, my scalp was dry and itchy, and worst of all it made my hair very greasy. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing it, I was actually washing my hair 2-3 times in the shower to make sure it was really clean and I wasn&#x27;t having buildup. Now I&#x27;m left with unmanageable hair that is dried out when it wasn&#x27;t before, and my scalp is itchy, and dry. The first time I used my old leave in, my hair was already looking and acting 90% better. The second time even better, but there is damage that I guess it just gonna take time to undue. I&#x27;m shocked there are any positive reviews on here.</li>
    <li> love this product - nice &amp; light</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It reminds me of the no more tangles I used for my children&#x27;s hair.  My hair can be all over the place and I spray it and \\&quot;voilah\\&quot; it is very manageable.  I am having trouble finding it in the stores so was especially grateful to find it here.  The seller was very prompt.  Thank you.  Carol</li>
    <li> Hate this product has been discontinued by Dove. I have not found a replacement that isn&#x27;t too thick and sticky. Wish they would return it to their line.</li>
    <li> I love this product its the best leave in product</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any stores (for over 2 years) and I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon. I&#x27;ve tried many replacements since and absolutely nothing compares to this product. It makes my frizzy hair very manageable and soft (even in the worst humidity). I was lost without it and am so glad I&#x27;ll soon be reunited with my favorite product. Thank you, amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Only product that makes my hair gorgeous! Tried everything out there and nothing comes close to the softness, shine and bounce dove gives my hair.</li>
    <li> Does protect from damage and your hair is silky and shiny, too.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used to use Biolage leave-in, but I had to go to a salon to get it &amp; it&#x27;s quite expensive.  This is light, but a good moisterizer. I spray some on my hair just before drying it (my hair is damaged from coloring &amp; blow-drying). AND it smells really good.  I use it on my 5 year old&#x27;s hair every morning, which is tangled mess. It works well and smells great. I couldn&#x27;t find it recently (I only saw it in Food Lion) &amp; used a product made for kids- phwew! It deos not smell pleasant at all (supposedly it&#x27;s pear scented, byut it&#x27;s mostly acidic and overly sweet). Anyway, I hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It works pretty well with my dry hair, just don&#x27;t use too much, it make it look really wet.</li>
    <li> HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.  THINK THE COMPANY HAS CHANGED THE NAME OR STOPPED MAKING IT. I&#x27;VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR IT.  WORKS SO GOOD ON MY HAIR.  MY MOM EVEN LIKES IT AND SHE&#x27;S VERY PICKY ABOUT WHAT SHE PUTS ON HER HAIR, AND HER HAIR IS SOOOOO DRY DUE TO PERMS AND COLORING, AND IT COMES OUT SO SOFT.  THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT - WISH THE COMPANY WOULD BRING IT BACK INTO THE STORES WHERE I COULD FIND IT.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this product and loved it , but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any more. Once I started using it, I decided to hunt it down online. Found it through amazon. The product is light and each time I get my hair cut I am asked what I am using on it. This product is the reason my hair is soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Dove has replaced this with a Thermal spray. Personally I feel this one should have stayed and new one just be a new product. I use this as my leave in and the other as my spray before blow drying. My hair looks and feels amazing! I can tell you 4 is not enough! I need to stock up! This has a light Dove clean scent.</li>
    <li> We think this one of the finest hair-care products around.  I ordered some sent to my wife and some to her best friend.  Arrived way before promise date.</li>
    <li> Great buy and it works. My hair is super soft and silky. Love it love it love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy all though....save some for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner and detangler ever invented!!!   I am a &#x27;true&#x27; blonde (which is difficult with haircare products). My twin daughters have also inherited my blonde hair and this is the ONLY product that works for us and does not weigh down our hair or leave it &#x27;greasy&#x27;.   THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE BEST PRODUCT FOR HAIR, EVER.  Very hard to find anymore. I originally found it in drug stores but can no longer find it, except at Amazon.  You will NOT regret this purchase. THE BEST EVER!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My fine long hair tangles really bad this Dove Damage Therapy Daily Moisture Replenishing Mist is great for those split ends.</li>
    <li> bought it for $3.99 on sale at Walgreens and it works great as a detangler and to moisturize hair after shower.  My hair isnt greasy or flat or feels like his has hair product in it. My hair feels softer and not so dry.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product all over  ,I love it best product iI have ever found to work so well with my hair , My hair is some what thin an some what frizzy , But this product was awesome I am so sad i cant find it any more .....please put it back on the market I am heart broken  I need my spray back it&#x27;s great for my hair.</li>
    <li> Dove&#x27;s Repht replenishing Mist is great for controling my hair&#x27;s static issues during these cold, dry winter months.  I like it because it is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I have long thick hair and during the winter months I can hardly brush it because of all of the static and this product does the trick.  I&#x27;m sure that I am going to enjoy it this summer also, because of my hair&#x27;s length by the time the natural oils and mosture get to the bottom half, the top half looks greasy and needs washing again.  This leads to fuzzy ends and this product will help me control that.</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding.  Use in morning and hair stays in place all day/night and is not stiff, but natural looking.  Extremely well in dry climates due to sun drying hair.  will keep on buying.</li>
    <li> On opening the box, found 3 packed together with a tight plastic covering and 1 lying by itself. Don&#x27;t know if that one was a returned item or used.  Dissapointed, expected better service from Amazon. Used the mist once. It helped smooth some of the frizz while styling hair but you might want to carry it around for retouches.</li>
    <li> Love this product. . . why oh why when you find something that really works, it&#x27;s discontinued???  Come on Dove -- bring this one back!</li>
    <li> fast shipment and when i spray this in my hair it smells so nice... this helps my hair to look healthy, smoother cause i color my hair most of the time and i try that leave in product before but it just made it worst... glad to found this product love it...........</li>
    <li> I started using Dove Damage Therapy Daily Moisture when I could buy it at our local Walmart.  They quit carrying it, but I could get it online threw Walmart.  Now they aren&#x27;t carrying it online either, but I found it on Amazon. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if Amazon quits carrying this product.  Evidently Dove doesn&#x27;t make it any more because I didn&#x27;t find it Dove online.  I do hope that&#x27;s not so as it works so well on my aging hair.</li>
    <li> Since this product is no longer available in stores, I had to order it through Amazon.com. Turned out to be a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product, my hair is extremely thick and curly and with this stuff my hair is ready in no time. It has a pleasant smell, is not sticky, and keeps hair in place.</li>
    <li> I use the Dove Damage Therapy Daily Moisture Replenishing Mist each time before I comb or brush my hair and it keeps my hair soft and easy to comb through.  A little bit goes a long way.  It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  I have curly hair and a few sprays of this mist keeps my hair feeling soft and moisturzied.  My hair no longer feels dry when I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I do not see much of a difference as far as this spray adding moisture.  However, it is great on dry hair to help comb it out and also helps to straiten if my hair has gotten a bit wavy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the store any longer so I was pleased to find it online!  It&#x27;s a great product for your hair leaving it soft and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> I used to use this religiously back in the day when it was still available in stores. It kept my ends from breaking which is why I loved it so. I got this pack of 4 a few days ago, and its been making my hair very frizzy when it dries (I apply the spray when my hair is wet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m not sure how big of a deal it really is, but when I received the package, a couple of the bottles were loose in the box and they were wrapped in a newspaper called The Jewish Harold. Just seems very... personal.. a little sketchy. And the product is obviously not the same as it once was. The paranoid part of me thinks that these bottles are being filled with something cheap in someone&#x27;s basement. apparently a jewish man&#x27;s basement.</li>
    <li> I really like the way Dove Sheer Moisture Replenishing Mist WORKS, I just HATE the bottle! Specifically, the spray button on top...it&#x27;s slightly ROUNDED on top, probably for some aesthetic reason, instead of ergonomically flat or concave, so your finger slips right off every freaking time you try to depress the button! Very, VERY frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, do they want you to be able to USE this stuff or not? I had to transfer mine to a different bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s a good product, works better on my hair than Pantene&#x27;s more expensive leave-in sprays; I just wish the people at Dove would redesign the bottle!</li>
    <li> this product has been discontinued by dove what in the world are they thinking about makes women&#x27;s skin soft and radiant</li>
    <li> Started using dove damage therapy on the weekends after swimming and sunning at our Lakehouse. It worked so good I offer it to our guests now.  I&#x27;ve even started using it at home every morning. Leaves your hair shiny and soft and has a nice clean fresh smell. I would definitely recommend. I like the fact that its a fine mist and not a cream.</li>
    <li> I had previously used Dove Daily Moisture Mist to replenish the moisture missing in my hair.  I have been unable to find this product locally and liked it better than any substitutes.  I was  pleased that Amazon had it available and ordered the pack of 4.  The fragrance is a bit different from that of the original product.  All other qualities remain the same.  It leaves my hair soft and controls my &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.  It can be applied to damp or dry hair.  It can indeed be used daily since there is little or no residue at the end of the day.</li>
