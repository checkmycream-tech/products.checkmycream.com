      <li>Five more words required and I am done with this review</li>
      <li>It works ok</li>
      <li>Ok ladies</li>
      <li>I would recommend the Magic Skin Conditioning Powder with Aloe.</li>
      <li>armpit, it felt like a kind of cool burning sensation.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t hurt at all, it was kind of cool on my arm.</li>
      <li>Please be careful not to exceed the recommended time though and use the Palmer No Blade razor with it for best results.</li>
      <li>I used it for the pubic hair and worked just fine</li>
      <li>Works great, has a smell to it, but overall does the job.</li>
      <li>but that doesn&#x27;t bother when in comparison to the smooth feeling</li>
      <li>I suggest that it be ordered by persons who familiar with the product.</li>
      <li>You will come off clean as a whistle after using it.</li>
      <li>My legs were perfectly smooth on the first try!</li>
      <li>I really appreciate this Magic Shave.</li>
      <li>Wash face off, or better yet take a shower because this stuff smells really</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a young woman who has tried everything to keep my legs smooth for more than 12 hours after shaving.</li>
      <li>It left it amazingly smooth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I still have yet to see a true before &amp; after shot anywhere (which is sort of surprising for a 100 year old product), but I did find some youtubes where I realized I wasn&#x27;t applying nearly enough...</li>
      <li>This one works good but smells a little.</li>
      <li>I just tried Magic Extra Strength Shaving Powder and decided to leave it for just the 7 minutes it recommended...</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is pretty</li>
      <li>has anyone noticed this making the hair grow back more thinned out?</li>
      <li>Followed the directions exactly as it states.  </li>
      <li>Much more effective than other hair removers designed specifically for women, without ANY burning, rashes, or red bumps.</li>
      <li>my boyfriend HAS to shave for work but we both want him to be able to grow a nice thick beard when he gets a new one eventually.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, even on delicate skin it works very well with no complications.</li>
      <li>Not just for men of color - this product has a strong &amp;#34;underground&amp;#34; following from women.  </li>
      <li>The videos show people using large amounts for much longer than the instructions, and were all people with basically shaven faces to begin with...</li>
      <li>It really does stink, but it does do the job.  </li>
      <li>REALLY thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only thing it has going for it is it&#x27;s dirt cheap.</li>
      <li>My leg hair grows so fast</li>
      <li>I heard it makes the whole house smell</li>
      <li>and they don&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>The other Magic shave</li>
      <li>I recommend using 3 teaspoons instead of 2 on the directions, with the same amount of cool water.</li>
      <li>These are the ONLY reasons you should use this super old-fashioned chemical burn on your face</li>
      <li>(it doesn&#x27;t make your skin smell, it just smells after applying), though I&#x27;m sure all depilatories are messy and smell.</li>
      <li>Normally after shaving my legs they would get prikly about 12 hours after.</li>
      <li>so, I kept adding water and stirring (with a toothpick, since it sticks to EVERYTHING) and finally got the right consistency.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love and highly recommend for anyone with similar problems or just doesn&#x27;t feel like shaving every single day!</li>
      <li>This stuff is a little messy, but works GREAT.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t burn me or anything, even though I applied it in a very sensitive area.</li>
      <li>Nothing has worked thus far, this product included.  </li>
      <li>Clairol Clairoxide Professional Salon Clear Peroxide   Color Developer Volume 40.    </li>
      <li>my leg and the last bit of magic shaving mix, I put in a few drops of peppermint oil.</li>
      <li>SoftSheen Carson is missing a big opportunity for more money here.</li>
      <li>two heaping teaspoons of magic shave with about 5 teaspoons of water, so its about as thick as toothpaste.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Get a small spray bottle because the stuff dries on your face and you have to keep it kind of wet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Wait about 6 minutes, After that, use something with a sharp corner (or buy the Ti Razor) like a credit card, shave against the grain in super short strokes until hair is removed.</li>
      <li>A test patch worked ok, but when using for real it hurt my face, giving me a little rash for a couple of days, and only removed a small portion of stubble.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a cream form like the other types of Magic shave products.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gray and nasty to apply, and dries to a light gray color, and isn&#x27;t real easy to remove once it&#x27;s on.  </li>

<li> Didnt have any any reaction like other said, was going to try Nair,</li>
<li> It does take longer on other body areas.</li>
<li> This stuff is really not worth the money (shoulda known by the price)</li>

    <li> My beard hairs are thick and dull razors quickly, and I sometimes get a lot of ingrown hairs, which leave bumps and then darken my skin(white/easily tanned) for a while, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot.  I followed all directions.  A test patch worked ok, but when using for real it hurt my face, giving me a little rash for a couple of days, and only removed a small portion of stubble.  It worked great for a test patch of body hair and didn&#x27;t hurt my ears either.  It might be really good for swimmers and bikers during race prep, but be cautious!</li>
    <li> OK THIS SHAVING POWDER IS MEANT TO BE USED BY BLACK  MEN WITH SKIN PROBLEMS INSTEAD OF SHAVING. IT DOES   NOT WORK ON YOUR BEARD .. I AM NOT EVEN BLACK AND I  BUY THIS STUFF FOR MY HEAD !!!    THIS STUFF IS A BIT HARD TO MIX IN THE RIGHT PROPORTIONS  AND IT IS NASTY, BUT IT DOES THE JOB. GET IT TO A MUD   CONSISTENCY PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD .. CHEST .. BACK .. LEGS  ARM PITS, PUBS .. LOL.    APPLY SOME .....    Clairol Clairoxide Professional Salon Clear Peroxide   Color Developer Volume 40.    TO YOUR HEAD AFTER YOU RUB IN THE SHAVING POWDER WATER SOLUTION...  YOUR HEAD WILL START .. SMOKEN !!!  SERIOUSLY .. THIS STUFF WORKS ON ALL HAIR EXCEPT... FACIAL   HAIR .. SO PLAN ON USING A RAZOR FOR YOUR MUG !!!</li>
    <li> It works ok I guess. Not sure tho. I didn&#x27;t end up using it. I heard it makes the whole house smell so I didn&#x27;t want that.</li>
    <li> This stuff literally works Magic for baldheaded men. You will come off clean as a whistle after using it. The other Magic shave products are too weak for head hair, including the one specifically designed for it. Please be careful not to exceed the recommended time though and use the Palmer No Blade razor with it for best results. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a cream form like the other types of Magic shave products.  It would be a lot less messy and time-saving than using the powder form. SoftSheen Carson is missing a big opportunity for more money here.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good production</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a hair removal product that works, and I have definitely found the one! This stuff is a little messy, but works GREAT. I don&#x27;t even want to save my legs or bikini area again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only catch is that it smells awful, and strong, like rotten eggs. I looked on the back and this is due to the sulfide in it...It stunk up my WHOLE appartment complex, so next time I will be doing it in the gym shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell, this stuff is great and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate this Magic Shave. Especially since I had know idea how I was going to acquire it here in Jinan, China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again! Hope to do business with you soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, even on delicate skin it works very well with no complications. It would have 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t smell bad, but it works so well I don&#x27;t mind putting up with it. They have it in a cream form too.</li>
    <li> I just got it in the mail today.&lt;br /&gt;I am female.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the amount given for a beard.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my an arm, leg, and armpit. I USED IT IMMEDIATELY after I got it.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t hurt at all, it was kind of cool on my arm. It left it amazingly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My armpit, it felt like a kind of cool burning sensation. But it&#x27;s just lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pretty awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my leg and the last bit of magic shaving mix, I put in a few drops of peppermint oil. It masked the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all. THIS is a really great product.</li>
    <li> It really does stink, but it does do the job.  Be careful as it can have a burning sensation if left on too long.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a person who used the product and stated it burned his skin. I would not order it again for this person. I suggest that it be ordered by persons who familiar with the product. If you are not familiar with it please test it on a small portion of your skin before using it.</li>
    <li> Ouch!!! These are the ONLY reasons you should use this super old-fashioned chemical burn on your face: 1) you have a serious razor bump and ingrown hair problem that can&#x27;t be resolved any other way (and you&#x27;ve already learned how to properly use a safety razor with shaving oil and still had no luck). 2) you have no sense of pain or smell 3) you have a ton of time on your hands  I put so comparatively little of this on my face and the results were: 1) no change in facial hair whatsoever 2) ridiculous burning sensation for over an hour, even after applying aloe to try to sooth my skin 3) nauseating smell that won&#x27;t go away  I then went online to find proof it works at all... I still have yet to see a true before &amp; after shot anywhere (which is sort of surprising for a 100 year old product), but I did find some youtubes where I realized I wasn&#x27;t applying nearly enough... The videos show people using large amounts for much longer than the instructions, and were all people with basically shaven faces to begin with... But I did see when someone was scraping it off that there was some black hair that had come off... And the fact that they&#x27;d used it for years and had a clean face was a good sign.  All in all, I assume it works but it takes about 3x&#x27;s the amount of time it would take me to shave, it hurts way more and is probably bad for your skin (if this intense burning sensation is any indicator), and it smells so bad I can&#x27;t even describe it--it&#x27;s a smell that permeates everything.  Nasty stuff.  The only thing it has going for it is it&#x27;s dirt cheap.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Apply, wait a bit and the hair washes off like dirt.  I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This is the best version of this product I have found. The other versions are too weak. This one works good but smells a little. Otherwise great product!</li>
    <li> has anyone noticed this making the hair grow back more thinned out? my boyfriend HAS to shave for work but we both want him to be able to grow a nice thick beard when he gets a new one eventually. bought it before we realized you dont actually shave with it. wont use it if it will affect hair growth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and it works perfectly. the only issue is of course the smell but that doesn&#x27;t bother when in comparison to the smooth feeling i have each time i use it. i HIGLY reccommend this product!!</li>
    <li> It works exceptionally well. Used it on my chest, waited 7 minutes, turned on the shower and was like &amp;#34;MY GOD THE HAIR HAS BEEN NUKED FROM ORBIT.&amp;#34; Stinks horrifically though. Don&#x27;t use immediately before expecting &amp;#34;company&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Followed the directions exactly as it states.  Then I tried to make it a little thinner.  Then I tried to make it a little thicker than the directions stated.  Left it on a couple of minutes longer than the directions said.  All is did was weaken the hair, but I still had to use a razor.  It seems to be effective for some people based ont he reviews.  I had absolutley no luck.</li>
    <li> Works great, has a smell to it, but overall does the job. I recommend using 3 teaspoons instead of 2 on the directions, with the same amount of cool water. Use aftershave or shower afterwards to help with the smell.</li>
    <li> Used this in-between a waxing couldn&#x27;t get an appointment. I remember growing up my uncle used to use it for his face. So I said what the heck. Didnt have any any reaction like other said, was going to try Nair, used it years ago and it did not work so i now have a cheaper and i know it will work alternative.</li>
    <li> Omg! I never write reviews but this DEFINITELY gets a review from me. I hate to shave my legs because I have very coarse hair and it takes forever. I have tried hair removal creams for women before like Nair and Veet and they don&#x27;t really work. I have left them on for double the recommended time and still had to shave afterwards. I just tried Magic Extra Strength Shaving Powder and decided to leave it for just the 7 minutes it recommended... Just to see if it would work. OMG! My legs were perfectly smooth on the first try! I didn&#x27;t use a damp cloth to remove it like it recommends. I used a bath poof since I was in the tub. I will never shave my legs again! This is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm but you have to use it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a black man and I get horrible razor bumps from shaving traditionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do which works every time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First put on some after shave moisturizer which contains cocoa butter to protect your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix two heaping teaspoons of magic shave with about 5 teaspoons of water, so its about as thick as toothpaste. Apply to face evenly. I like to apply it with a shaving brush. It&#x27;s less messy that way and goes on better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a small spray bottle because the stuff dries on your face and you have to keep it kind of wet. Spray every time the powder dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait about 6 minutes, After that, use something with a sharp corner (or buy the Ti Razor) like a credit card, shave against the grain in super short strokes until hair is removed. Wash face off, or better yet take a shower because this stuff smells really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you use this stuff, apply after shave with cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, I used their lower strength, but this works better. It does take longer on other body areas. Great for prior to EKG test to avoid their nasty Bic disposable razors that cut and nick your body. A couple of my lady friends use it on &amp;#34;All&amp;#34; their body areas, leaving it on for 20 minutes. They love it.</li>
    <li> Works great but the smell is god awful.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work all that well</li>
    <li> Great! better than the creams,doesn&#x27;t have the best smell but gets the job done,I will buying again. I am pleased</li>
    <li> This stuff does work. I was skeptical because other products in the past have been a dud, but this did as promised. It does smell bad, but you wash it off anyways. I used it on my chest/stomach area as I unfortunately got the Austin Powers genes and it left no irritation and was silky smooth. Would recommend as an alternative to the razor as you get no bumps or rash.</li>
    <li> Took the hair off from where I wanted it removed. Had to do two applications. It&#x27;s kinda messy and it smells (it doesn&#x27;t make your skin smell, it just smells after applying), though I&#x27;m sure all depilatories are messy and smell. It didn&#x27;t burn me or anything, even though I applied it in a very sensitive area.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great price....</li>
    <li> I only used it a couple of times, did its job but its similar to shaving. I used it for the pubic hair and worked just fine but dear God the smell is horrible, which is why only 4 stars. It stays around on your skin for at least a day and I was foolish and did it once in the bathroom and the smell just lingered.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS, so, I have thick black hair EVERYWHERE.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of it.  Nothing has worked thus far, this product included.  I thought that since it was formulated for black men, then it should work on coarse black hair.  WRONG!  The following was my procedure:&lt;br /&gt;1. Mix the two tablespoons of powder with two tablespoons of water.  It didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; consistency that it was supposed to, so, I kept adding water and stirring (with a toothpick, since it sticks to EVERYTHING) and finally got the right consistency.  Noticed it smelled kind of like Nair and got hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Spread it liberally to the area where hair was to be removed.  And I put it on REALLY thick.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Set the timer, and noticed that in this short amount of time, it was starting to dry&lt;br /&gt;4.  Add water to moisten it (since the label says to not let it dry) and then I had to apply more, because adding water made it run.&lt;br /&gt;5.  When the timer ran out, I tried removing a section of it, and it didn&#x27;t work.  It took NO HAIR off at all.&lt;br /&gt;6.  I left it on for longer than the amount of time, and tried again to wipe it off.  Again, it took NO HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I was disappointed, and wiped it all off.  It&#x27;s basically like mud.  It&#x27;s gray and nasty to apply, and dries to a light gray color, and isn&#x27;t real easy to remove once it&#x27;s on.  This stuff is really not worth the money (shoulda known by the price)</li>
    <li> I have finally found the answer to my leg shaving problems! I&#x27;m a young woman who has tried everything to keep my legs smooth for more than 12 hours after shaving. My leg hair grows so fast and it&#x27;s thick and dark, I know it sounds gross but that&#x27;s life for a lot of women. I cant shave everyday Because I get those stupid bumps from razor burn, ingrown hairs, sensitive skin you name it. This stuff is amazing. I tried for the first time 2 days ago, it smells awful and is messy but after the results, I don&#x27;t even care. 7 minutes on each leg and my legs were silky smooth with no irritation! Normally after shaving my legs they would get prikly about 12 hours after. Its been 2 days and the prickle is there but VERY subtle ! I&#x27;m in love and highly recommend for anyone with similar problems or just doesn&#x27;t feel like shaving every single day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s legit but it smells like the devil</li>
    <li> works as described. It is good for girls who have some growth under their chin. Five more words required and I am done with this review</li>
    <li> Ok ladies yes i know that this is for facial hair but let me tel you it works for ALL the hair you want gone.most likely tmi here but i had never shaved my lady parts (im 30) before and it took every thing off.It does smell but honestly smells better than nair i think.</li>
    <li> Not just for men of color - this product has a strong &amp;#34;underground&amp;#34; following from women.  It can be used on armpits, facial hair, legs, as well as upkeep in the bikini area (and beyond).  This Magic Shaving Powder truly is Magic!  Much more effective than other hair removers designed specifically for women, without ANY burning, rashes, or red bumps.</li>
    <li> Works well, but I knocked off 2 stars because off the messiness, smell, and difficulty when trying to get the can open over time when you haven&#x27;t used it for a while.</li>
    <li> This smells terrible! Although the product works, the smell will stay in your home for a good 30 mins after you&#x27;re finished. I would recommend the Magic Skin Conditioning Powder with Aloe. Smells better and works great! Magic makes a great product.</li>
