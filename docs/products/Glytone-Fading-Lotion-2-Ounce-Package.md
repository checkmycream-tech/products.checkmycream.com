### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am so impressed!!</li>
      <li>I was so impressed with this product that I&#x27;m now using the Glytone sunscreen and gel face wash.</li>
      <li>Hurts to be beautiful!</li>
      <li>Great product, would recommend to anyone!</li>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>So happy!</li>
      <li>Granted I do have fair skin which is ideal for this product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a month and have seen great results.</li>
      <li>Great product to even out skin tone.</li>
      <li>Great for spots.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>It is not as good as the cream.</li>
      <li>, it is a good product, and I like the applicator vs. a cream - it lasts longer.</li>
      <li>Need another month to give it a fair trial this time.</li>
      <li>And now I was able to re-purchase this without needing a prescription!</li>
      <li>So possibly my own fault.</li>
      <li>This is an effective product to help fade unwanted scars.</li>
      <li>It smells strong but if it works, who cares!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always best to make informed decisions, especially when it comes to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Seems to be working as I&#x27;m getting compliments on my skin being more even.  </li>
      <li>I do make sure to wear sunscreen</li>
      <li>I love the Glytone Fading Lotion</li>
      <li>Just consult your physician to see if it is okay to use if you have concerns about it.</li>
      <li>Love those, too.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s in a bottle with a sponge dabber top.  </li>
      <li>I love this brand and will continue to give it a try.</li>
      <li>It looks to me as though the alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) are a relatively safe bet for evening out skin pigmentation.</li>
      <li>The Glytone does have a strong odor, but it lasts about 1-3 seconds after application, then disappears.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong smell but goes away in seconds.  </li>
      <li>I have used high dollar to ---&amp;#62;OTC products and thus is so far is the best!!  </li>
      <li>Recommended by my dermatologist, this transparent water-like solution is very effective in fading the darker areas that appear on my cheeks especially in the summer time (in spite of sunscreen lotion use).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and it has made a significant difference in their appearance.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use it consistently and wear sunscreen.    </li>
      <li>The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns.[6]&lt;br /&gt;Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin.[5][7]&lt;br /&gt;While using hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.</li>
      <li>So, I will continue wrestling with this bottle until it&#x27;s empty, but the formulation and delivery are not making me happy at all.</li>
      <li>You might also want to see the Wikipedia article titled \\&quot;Skin Lightening\\&quot; for a good overview of safety and risks of various ingredients.</li>
      <li>Loving this so far</li>
      <li>Glytone really does work to lighten my malasma and hyperpigmentation from many years in the sun.  </li>
      <li>other than that it is still a great product.</li>
      <li>It is NOT a lotion ,It is a clear liquid.its OK.</li>
      <li>It works fairly quickly; can see results with consistent use in about a month.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.ng hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.</li>
      <li>What I smell is the chemicals, that heavy sort of scent that isn&#x27;t pleasant, but it goes away immediately upon closing the container and doesn&#x27;t linger in the air or on your skin.</li>
      <li>gave it four stars because of high price and because I don&#x27;t have the full result yet.</li>
      <li>This product is the first product that I have seen a difference in sun/age spots fading.</li>
      <li>At first the dermatologist offered me a product which cost around $300.  </li>
      <li>although you must apply consistently.  </li>
      <li>and it prevents them from appearing in the first place.</li>
      <li>- I started noticing a difference within the first week.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.</li>
      <li>I have been using this in the am &amp; pm its more like a serum it sinks right in..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it quite easy to simply hold my breath for the moment it takes me to apply the liquid to my hands (and one spot on my face).</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I wasnt really getting any results from it, so I stopped using it after sometime.</li>
      <li>I have used it on my face for one very stubborn spot and it has faded it also without irritation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for months, and I can&#x27;t say that I really notice any change in my skin.</li>
      <li>My spots have lightened up soo much</li>
      <li>The product absolutely works..</li>
      <li>&amp; I won&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>

      <li>I found this to work very well...</li>
      <li>I was ify about purchasing this item, but it worked out VERY well.</li>
      <li>Excited to see further results!</li>
      <li>Combined with religious application of sunscreen, it&#x27;s probably a good system for preventing new spots, but those old ones take a long time to fade.</li>
      <li>the early 2000&#x27;s I first tried it through my derm.</li>
      <li>While Wikipedia is not the final word on anything, it&#x27;s not a bad place to start.</li>

      <li>but my age spots were pretty obvious</li>
      <li>I have acne scars, and within days they had began to fade and are almost completely gone!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not dramatic, but enough to notice.  </li>
      <li>It did help to fade my old blemishes quicker.</li>
      <li>One is gone completely.  </li>
      <li>and it sends me into a coughing fit for a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>It seems to me that since they also say those other products don&#x27;t work... maybe the right chemicals aren&#x27;t in them.</li>

      <li>I have tried at least five products (from high-end cosmetic brands from Nordstrom to all-natural products from health-food stores) to fade the spots, and none worked with much - or any - success.</li>

<li> In the past couple of years sun spots have begun showing on my cheeks/jaw line (I&#x27;m in my early 40s and did not use sunscreen until my 30s).</li>
<li> My dark spots haven&#x27;t disappeared, but they&#x27;re definitely fading.</li>
<li> If it&#x27;s faded any sun spots or dark pigmented scars, it&#x27;s been such a gradual change as to not be perceptible or necessarily attributable to Glytone as opposed to just typical fading over time.</li>
<li> , spots have not faded completely but have faded a lot, I can use less concealer &amp; foundation now!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a horrible birthmark/hyperpigmentation/scar around my eye which I cover with makeup (a lot). Literally looks like a black eye. I&#x27;ve had expensive laser treatments which didn&#x27;t seem to work but slightly lighten the area plus it scarred above my lid and I&#x27;ve tried other creams as well, not hoping to totally get rid of it b/c its so dark but in hopes of lightning it enough so that my makeup will cover it &amp; I won&#x27;t have to use as much. Its only been about 5 days and I&#x27;ve applied it day &amp; nite &amp; I can already see that its gotten lighter. So happy! Since it is around my eye, I gently dab around the eye area with my finger. It smells strong but if it works, who cares! Hurts to be beautiful! Wish I cld post a pic! Excited to see further results!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect result overnight, but it works.</li>
    <li> Glytone really does work to lighten my malasma and hyperpigmentation from many years in the sun.  However, I find it stings for about 30 seconds after applying.  Other than that, it is a good product, and I like the applicator vs. a cream - it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the hydroquinone.  What I didn&#x27;t realize is that Glytone uses the word \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; to mean a liquid consistency; I&#x27;m used to seeing lotion mean \\&quot;a lightweight cream\\&quot; type of thing - a moisturizer that&#x27;s runnier than a cream would be.  This is a liquid and it&#x27;s in a bottle with a sponge dabber top.  Since I&#x27;m trying to lighten my entire decolletage, this is an enormous amount of work.  I also worry that dead skin cells are getting picked up by the sponge.  So, I will continue wrestling with this bottle until it&#x27;s empty, but the formulation and delivery are not making me happy at all.</li>
    <li> While Wikipedia is not the final word on anything, it&#x27;s not a bad place to start. Even my pharmacology professor uses it for drug research. At the bottom of any article is a long reference list you can explore. I decided to look up the main active ingredient, hydroquinone and below is an excerpt. (Remember, \\&quot;carcinogenic\\&quot; and \\&quot;neoplasms\\&quot; are terms associated with cancer, and skin cancer can be deadly.) You might also want to see the Wikipedia article titled \\&quot;Skin Lightening\\&quot; for a good overview of safety and risks of various ingredients. It looks to me as though the alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) are a relatively safe bet for evening out skin pigmentation. I have blotches too, so I know what it&#x27;s like. It&#x27;s always best to make informed decisions, especially when it comes to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excerpt from Wikipedia on \\&quot;Hydroquinone\\&quot;: In human medicine, hydroquinone is used as a topical application in skin whitening to reduce the color of skin as it does not have the same predisposition to cause dermatitis as metol does. This use is banned in some countries, including the member states of the European Union under Directive 76/768/EEC:1976.[3][4]&lt;br /&gt;In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations.[5] The FDA stated that hydroquinone cannot be ruled out as a potential carcinogen. This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis, mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell ademonas. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns.[6]&lt;br /&gt;Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin.[5][7]&lt;br /&gt;While using hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity. Using a daily sunscreen with a high PPD (persistent pigment darkening) rating reduces the risk of further damage. Hydroquinone is sometimes combined with alpha hydroxy acids that exfoliate the skin to quicken the lightening process.

    <li> This item does work. But when you stop using it the area darkens. Although I. Some places it did lighten and stay lighter.</li>
    <li> This product has a horrible smell when you put it on, but that passes within a couple of minutes.  I&#x27;ve noticed my brown spots are a little bit lighter--not a huge amount, but I haven&#x27;t been applying it for that long.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to work at all and it made my face break out in the areas which I used it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this fade product for the dark spots (sun, age, etc.) on my hands. I&#x27;ve used it for only a few weeks and my spots are fading noticeably. The packaging info does say that if it doesn&#x27;t work in three months, to stop using it. So, I have quite a ways to go yet. I feel it&#x27;s going to work completely judging by how it&#x27;s starting out, and judging by how the 4 other Glytone products I&#x27;ve used to date have worked (wonderfully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about the odor. I&#x27;ve read several reviews (here and elsewhere) that say how \\&quot;disgusting\\&quot; or \\&quot;offensive\\&quot; the odor is. I didn&#x27;t find that level of odor. What I smell is the chemicals, that heavy sort of scent that isn&#x27;t pleasant, but it goes away immediately upon closing the container and doesn&#x27;t linger in the air or on your skin. I&#x27;ve found it quite easy to simply hold my breath for the moment it takes me to apply the liquid to my hands (and one spot on my face). I am meaning to say, don&#x27;t let the fear of a bad odor scare you from trying this product. Other products, they say, don&#x27;t smell bad or have a floral scent. It seems to me that since they also say those other products don&#x27;t work... maybe the right chemicals aren&#x27;t in them. It&#x27;s designed to take pigment off of skin... why would it smell rosey?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because of high price and because I don&#x27;t have the full result yet. But I will update in a couple of months to let folks know if the spots fading all the way. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Loving this so far and I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks! Granted I do have fair skin which is ideal for this product but my age spots were pretty obvious and it&#x27;s helped even out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a month and I already notice a difference. It&#x27;s not dramatic, but enough to notice.  Especially when I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  Before, my sun damage would show through, now my makeup covers it. (same makeup).    Be sure to use it consistently and wear sunscreen.    Also, it stinks.  I have asthma and it sends me into a coughing fit for a few minutes.  The sacrifices we make for beauty!    It&#x27;s worth a shot before you try something more expensive!</li>
    <li> Great product to even out skin tone. I have used Glytone products for several years.</li>
    <li> This is an effective product to help fade unwanted scars. It works fairly quickly; can see results with consistent use in about a month. The product is non-staining, but has a slight medicine-like odor. The applicator is sponge-like with somewhat precision.</li>
    <li> Takes time, but works like a charm on sun spots as well as age spots.</li>
    <li> I was ify about purchasing this item, but it worked out VERY well. I have acne scars, and within days they had began to fade and are almost completely gone! Great product, would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I gave this product 2 stars because it did not work as well as I expected. I still have dark spots after using 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> I am Latina and have hyper-pigmentation on my cheeks and eye area.. I have used high dollar to ---&amp;#62;OTC products and thus is so far is the best!!  I have used Glytone spf fading cream along with RetinA , it helped but so drying :( I have been using this in the am &amp; pm its more like a serum it sinks right in.. My spots have lightened up soo much I am so impressed!! This is working so well, spots have not faded completely but have faded a lot, I can use less concealer &amp; foundation now!! Yay!!!!I will always use this product along with my MAC Primer &amp; 50 SPF</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference at all after three weeks of using the Glytone Fading lotion product morning and evening.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I noticed fading almost immediately for my melasma. My skin looks great, but the previous reviews are spot on: it smells terrible, and the application is awkward. There are creams out there with the same amount of hydroquinone that perform just as well. I&#x27;ll be returning to them after I finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked for me. However, it&#x27;s only been a month and even though I notice a difference in the fading of my dark upper lip-I am starting to break out more on my upper lip. I am unhappy because I never used to break out on my upper lip and I can only contribute my recent breakouts to this lotion.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working as I&#x27;m getting compliments on my skin being more even.  cheaper than prescription.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I was diagnosed with melasma on my head.  As a bald man it had become increasingly dark and noticeable.  At first the dermatologist offered me a product which cost around $300.  I began looking for a different route and came across Glytone. The product absolutely works..HOWEVER for me at least with Melasma I have to keep the area covered or it will not fade.</li>
    <li> This didnt do anything for me. I wasnt really getting any results from it, so I stopped using it after sometime.</li>
    <li> Great for spots. But it has to be continually use, to see results, and with time, the spots will heal. I have used this product since the early 2000&#x27;s I first tried it through my derm. it was about $ 66.00 + a bottle. But I found it here on Amazon for 26.00 through another vendor. Warning they have changed some of the ingredients in this product, If you have Asthma, it will make you cough, because of the ingredient they have in it now. other than that it is still a great product. Just consult your physician to see if it is okay to use if you have concerns about it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works for a short while .I like it but the felt tip or sponge tip came off and I was told its suppose to do that ,&lt;br /&gt;NOT SUPPOSE TO!!!!!!!! That tip coming off is a defect.So you will have to use a cotton ball or q-tip to apply. . It is NOT a lotion ,It is a clear liquid.its OK.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have the results I expected but I&#x27;m not good about daily use! So possibly my own fault. It did help to fade my old blemishes quicker.</li>
    <li> This fading lotion does the job. Depending on the darkness of the spot you want to lighten, it might not be an overnight change but it will do two things well that I have noted: it fades brown spots almost to oblivion and it prevents them from appearing in the first place. I use this routinely on the backs of my hands to prevent little brown spots from forming and it works very well for that. It is not literally a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; it is fairly thin and is applied by means of an applicator on the bottle itself. It has a sharp odor that dissipates almost immediately. I have used it on my face for one very stubborn spot and it has faded it also without irritation.</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It does lighten the dark spots on my face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a verrrrryyy long time ago when it was prescribed to me by my dermatologist to lighten my acne scars on my back. Not only did the scars completely fade, but I also used it on other dark scars I had, and it worked! You have to use a very thin layer (as it recommends on the label) and use a Q-tip/cotton swab to apply ONLY to the scar. Otherwise, it will also lighten the area around it. And now I was able to re-purchase this without needing a prescription! Awesome!</li>
    <li> In the past couple of years sun spots have begun showing on my cheeks/jaw line (I&#x27;m in my early 40s and did not use sunscreen until my 30s). I have tried at least five products (from high-end cosmetic brands from Nordstrom to all-natural products from health-food stores) to fade the spots, and none worked with much - or any - success. I love the Glytone Fading Lotion - I started noticing a difference within the first week. My sun spots have faded at least 70 percent. I no longer have to wear as much foundation (very little now) or concealer, and I don&#x27;t feel self-conscious about my skin if I go without foundation. I&#x27;ve been using the Glytone about five weeks. I&#x27;ve had one persistent spot that no product would fade, and the Glytone has faded it quite a bit. The Glytone does have a strong odor, but it lasts about 1-3 seconds after application, then disappears. I was so impressed with this product that I&#x27;m now using the Glytone sunscreen and gel face wash. Love those, too.</li>
    <li> It stings my face, especially when I add a face moisturizer or face cream. I hope it&#x27;s just how the &amp;#34;process&amp;#34; works.</li>
    <li> It does not work for me. I don&#x27;t like the consistency, the lighten effect is minimal and it irritates my skin really hard. I had to heal it after recommended use twice a day.</li>
    <li> I have 2 \\&quot;spots\\&quot; on my face.  One is gone completely.  The other is just faded, but I only use it once a day, not twice like it says to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months, and I can&#x27;t say that I really notice any change in my skin. If it&#x27;s faded any sun spots or dark pigmented scars, it&#x27;s been such a gradual change as to not be perceptible or necessarily attributable to Glytone as opposed to just typical fading over time. I do make sure to wear sunscreen every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the packaging. It enables you to spread the product thinly and evenly, and it makes the lotion last a very long time. Be warned, this stuff stinks a lot. I have to hold my breath using it, and it still usually sends me into a coughing fit. I&#x27;ve made it better by trying to apply near my nose last and holding my breath during application, but it&#x27;s still pretty bad. It also stings a bit. I think it&#x27;s actually helped my adult acne somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve forked out the money for the product and it seems to be at least helpful for adult acne, I&#x27;ll keep using it. My advice is that if you want to see noticeable results, this probably isn&#x27;t the product. This is something that is a long-term, permanent addition to your skin care, not something that you&#x27;re going to use a month or two and see noticeable results. Combined with religious application of sunscreen, it&#x27;s probably a good system for preventing new spots, but those old ones take a long time to fade.</li>
    <li> Lesions are regressing, which started after two weeks.  It saved me a trip to a dermatologist and the time, money and paperwrok that would have required.</li>
    <li> Been using it for 2 weeks and can already tell a difference. My dark spots haven&#x27;t disappeared, but they&#x27;re definitely fading.</li>
    <li> This product is not as I expect. I put it on my face to treat my brown spot. I don&#x27; t see any improvement at all</li>
    <li> This product is the first product that I have seen a difference in sun/age spots fading. It has been about 6 weeks and it has made a significant difference in their appearance. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> contains chemicals that cause cancer and banned in other countries.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, this transparent water-like solution is very effective in fading the darker areas that appear on my cheeks especially in the summer time (in spite of sunscreen lotion use).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it in the summer, only in the fall and winter as the sun-rays are oblique and less intense. The fading is gradual. After the dark spots have faded, I use Retin-A to exfoliate--always under dermatologist&#x27;s guidance, et voilà! Moisturize well as this lotion has a drying effect on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for years and it lasts me forever, as the affected areas are rather small.</li>
    <li> Broke my skin out so bad! I used for three days. On the fourth day I has pimples in all the areas I treated with glytone. I should have returned but I just trashed it.</li>
    <li> I have only used rbis products for.a.few days but it seems to be working on the spots on my legs caused by me picking at my ketosis pelaris.</li>
    <li> She has noticed a big difference but I just started so can&#x27;t give it 5 stars just yet but feel hopeful.</li>
    <li> I had used this in the past and it seems to work then, but not at this time my acne scars are still dark and don&#x27;t seem to be fading.</li>
    <li> It is not as good as the cream. This takes  a longer time to see results.</li>
    <li> Definitely works - I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a month and have seen great results.</li>
    <li> I found this to work very well...although you must apply consistently.  I use it about 5-6 times weekly at night before bed.  It has faded sun spots on my face quite a bit.  They are not completely gone, but much lighter.  It does have a strong smell but goes away in seconds.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> too soon to know whether this works or not. It has worked for me in the past, but not on all spots used. Need another month to give it a fair trial this time.</li>
    <li> I have melasma and this did not reduce my brown spots.  Instead it just irritated my skin, making it red.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend</li>
    <li> I have been using this for awhile and haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes. I have seen more immediate changes with other products from this brand so a little disappointed in this product.  I love this brand and will continue to give it a try.</li>
