      <li>I love this item ,I !</li>
      <li>Store away from any light source in a travel tooth brush holder, a great idea is to wrap the hairs in foil before you put it away, it keeps the shape, stops \\&quot;any\\&quot; light from penetrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I will be buying more soon.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.</li>
      <li>It was packaged nicely and item was exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>This product works just fine,  but the strong odor bumped my rating to a 4 star.</li>
      <li>It dose not dry fast, so she have plenty of time to do the nails perfect.</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully and was so much more affordable than purchasing at my local beauty supply plus I was able to buy a larger size then offered there.</li>
      <li>( I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell got to them also).</li>
      <li>But as of right now I would recommend this to a friend and order from them again!</li>

      <li>Beautiful long lasting results.</li>
      <li>Also was shipped quickly and packaged very well.</li>
      <li>It also shipped very fast.</li>
      <li>With that being said, I am pretty sure that this bottle will last me through winter and spring.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more of this in the future!</li>
      <li>The bottle was smaller than I expected but it works amazing and will still last me a good while</li>
      <li>I would love it if this kind of product wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
      <li>there is a whole lot of instructional videos to help you learn.</li>
      <li>THE VERY THING</li>
      <li>I put it in a plastic baggy (standing straight up) and it still leaked out some how.</li>
      <li>Very adhesive.</li>
      <li>It does just what it should and keeps the nails strong for a long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for about a year now, usually doing a fill every 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I do have to say though it does make some nice hard acrylic nails.</li>
      <li>It works as well as my normal nail liquid.</li>
      <li>it is not small, (i got the 8oz.)</li>
      <li>but it is professional!</li>
      <li>It works very well with the different powders I have.</li>
      <li>It costs less than the other brands I have been using and works better for me.</li>
      <li>I lost a lot of liquid when this happened, it left me with a bottle that was only half full when.</li>
      <li>It really works well with other acrylics.</li>

<li> If you are not sure how to do that check out You Tube.</li>

<li> This products works with Tammy Taylor, Nsi, Cnd, mia&#x27;s secret, ez flow, opi and all the others I have purchased.</li>
<li> Smells not that bad.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for about a year now, usually doing a fill every 2 weeks. With that being said, I am pretty sure that this bottle will last me through winter and spring. Somehow it managed to leak a little through transit, so when I received it, it was in a box with plastic over it( I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell got to them also). But I have no complaints, and  it was also cheaper than getting it from sallys</li>
    <li> This product works just fine,  but the strong odor bumped my rating to a 4 star.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I&#x27;ll keep buying this.</li>
    <li> It really works well with other acrylics. Smells not that bad. Great price. Would def buy again.</li>
    <li> This works as well as any of the top brands out there. I know because I have spent hundreds on those expensive brands. This products works with Tammy Taylor, Nsi, Cnd, mia&#x27;s secret, ez flow, opi and all the others I have purchased. Why spend more if this one works well? just remember to prep the nails correctly. If you are not sure how to do that check out You Tube. there is a whole lot of instructional videos to help you learn.</li>
    <li> item as described, thank you!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at an amazing price. Purchased with the acrylic powder from the same company. Beautiful long lasting results. Definitely buying again. Highly recommended. Will never buy the Sallys top tier equivalent in liquid or powder again. This is a MUCH better product.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my nails for some time now, and I love it. It does just what it should and keeps the nails strong for a long time.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product a lot, you get so much acrylic liquid for a cheap price. I didn&#x27;t experience any lifting which was awesome. It also shipped very fast. My only concern was that it spilled and drenched the cardboard box it was shipped in and smelled up my mall box. I lost a lot of liquid when this happened, it left me with a bottle that was only half full when. I put it in a plastic baggy (standing straight up) and it still leaked out some how. I plan on buying this again, I just hope it dosent spill all over like last time</li>
    <li> This works good on me but everyone else I use it on has had lifting problems I wont buy again</li>
    <li> Smelly but works real well I love it it works well and I feel like I can use it all the time</li>
    <li> i was afraid that it would be small and cheap. but it is professional! it is not small, (i got the 8oz.) I  love it.</li>
    <li> It works as well as my normal nail liquid. cost the same and works the same. I use both and take advantage of sell on it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very adhesive.</li>
    <li> I love the liquid works really well with the powder</li>
    <li> Nails lift with in 4 days have to be replacing nails constantly will not buy.again</li>
    <li> works great... thank you</li>
    <li> Works great. I would love it if this kind of product wasn&#x27;t so expensive. I would def buy more quantity at a time if so. I will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> I love this item ,I ! would buy this again</li>
    <li> I have used other brands of monomer and no matter how I prepped, I always had some lifting within just a few days, I did a set of nails with Supernail a week ago and have absolutely NO LIFTING! I am beyond happy with this product! It costs less than the other brands I have been using and works better for me. It works very well with the different powders I have. Yes, there is a smell but no more than the other ones I have used before. I will be purchasing more of this in the future! Also was shipped quickly and packaged very well. Very happy!!</li>
    <li> My daughter love this product. It is easy to use. It dose not dry fast, so she have plenty of time to do the nails perfect.</li>
    <li> UPDATE!!&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT .. VERY 1ST INGREDIENT WAS \\&quot;ACETONE\\&quot;!!  THE VERY THING THE \\&quot;PROFESSIONAL\\&quot; NAIL PEOPLE SAID NOT TO USE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So did FURTHER research and found this item which truly is MONOMER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia Secret Professional Acrylic Nail System Liquid Monomor 2 oz  http://www.amazon.com/Mia-Secret-Peofessional-Acrylic-Monomor/dp/B009ZKMWO8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1394662741&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Nail+System+Liquid+Monomor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the previous misinformation .. I was led astray also by lack of information!&lt;br /&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did a LOT of research on proper maintenance of gel nail brushes .. am purchasing this because the consensus was below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monomer - This is the only liquid that should ever come in contact with a brush! DO NOT USE ANYTHING WITH ACETONE .... many gel brushes are nylon and acetone will melt frizz and fray the bristles.  Store away from any light source in a travel tooth brush holder, a great idea is to wrap the hairs in foil before you put it away, it keeps the shape, stops \\&quot;any\\&quot; light from penetrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you find this helpful!</li>
    <li> The bottle was smaller than I expected but it works amazing and will still last me a good while</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and was so much more affordable than purchasing at my local beauty supply plus I was able to buy a larger size then offered there.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item Jan 8th and received it today Jan. 11th. It was packaged nicely and item was exactly like the picture. I have yet to use this item, since Im waiting for the other items I ordered. But as of right now I would recommend this to a friend and order from them again!</li>
    <li> Bottle leaks! Be warned that if you don&#x27;t store the bottle upright, it will leak. Also I&#x27;ve used this to do my nails twice and both times it gave me a rash on my hands that lasted for days. I won&#x27;t be using it again. I do have to say though it does make some nice hard acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> Great stuff works very well it dose like to be used with the same name brand powder but it dose work with others too.</li>
