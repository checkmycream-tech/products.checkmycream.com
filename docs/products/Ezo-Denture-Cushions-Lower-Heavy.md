<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Ezo cushions!  I&#x27;m so glad I read all the positive reviews here and decided to try them!  I&#x27;ve used the Cusion Grip thermoplastic for years, which was fine, but labor intensive with putting it on and taking it off.  The Ezo cushions go on and off in a snap.  The other thing I really like about them is that because they&#x27;re soft, it&#x27;s easier to eat nuts, seeds, and crispy things.  Rather than trapping hard things between my gums and the liner, and cutting my gums, it absorbs them.  After eating, the items can then can be scraped off while cleaning.  I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> These make the lower denture feel softer and more of a natural fit than anything I&#x27;ve eve found. I like them and they help where my front teeth were to not have that funny  metal tastes in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Actually ordered the lower cushions for my daughter. She is the one who recommended them to me.</li>
    <li> The &#x27;stickum&#x27; on the denture pads leaked into the area around my gums after a meal. Okay...four more words I guess.</li>
    <li> This is an item I wasn&#x27;t familiar with so I ordered one.  Instead of sending this one, they sent one of the Ezo Denture Cushions that I had&lt;br /&gt;ordered a pack of six.  So, in total, I received seven boxes of the Ezo Denture Cushions in the blue and pink box.  I didn&#x27;t consider it to be very important.</li>
    <li> Once again if you have dentures these are what you&#x27;re looking for. I wear them daily</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Mother who has used them for years  but couldn&#x27;t get them any more.You made her day!</li>
    <li> Did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> Ihave used these a long time &amp; glad I now have a lg supply.  In fact I think I have enuff for a very long time.</li>
    <li> These made my dentures fit perfectly!  I love and use them all the time.  They really help keep your dentures in place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a top denture sence I was 19 yrs old .  And this product  keeps it from slipping all day!</li>
    <li> my dad loves this great product</li>
    <li> I have used the product called EZO&#x27;s for many, many years. I was so disappointed to not be able to find them in the stores anymore. There is no other product on the market, that works as well as ezo,  I was so thrilled to find them on Amazon. Thank you for making it happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied customer,&lt;br /&gt;Beverly Brown</li>
    <li> This item was a waste of money.  If your bottom dentures are small there is no way they will work.  Like putting a layer of wax under them, and they fall out. The reline it kit I bought from Amazon works much better.</li>
    <li> My ezo denture cushions really help with my dentures.  They keep my lower denture in place &amp; enable me to eat what&lt;br /&gt;people with natural teeth have everyday.  I would recomend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> this item is not good at all.  It is too soft and will not stay in place.  I liked  the old type better.  Can I still get the other kind?</li>
    <li> These are the only cushions that my mother in law finds comfortable to wear. She appreciates the fit and ease of use</li>
    <li> Our daughter used it to help when she had braces and was playing her saxophone.  It made it less painful.  Unfortunately it is hard to find.</li>
    <li> I cut the cushions into postage stamp sized pieces to place over my lower teeth as protectors when I play saxophone. I have used them for this purpose since about 1989. They mold to the shape of your teeth and prevent injury to your lower lip. I don&#x27;t play as often as I used to and I&#x27;m less likely to develop a sore lip using these cushions.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my Mom . She loves them. Couldn&#x27;t find them in any local stores. She says her dentures fit like new.</li>
    <li> I like this product as a chshion for my lower dentures.  It gives a better fit. Easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> most of them seemed old</li>
    <li> This denture cushion works okay, except it does not last for a full day. I have bought them previously and they lasted for two days. These seem to be made of a thinner material and do not stay in place.</li>
    <li> works for my friends needs.</li>
    <li> thank you for giving me a place i can order these liners as you can no longer get them in most stores.  they are the only liners i can wear now</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. A pain to deal with.</li>
    <li> I use this product EZO for my bottom plate and it is great.  I have used other products but they are not half as good as EZO.  I was so disappointed when I could not find being sold in any local Pharmacy.  I was also glad that I found out that I can purchase this product on Amazon and great delivery.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> Not easy to use for me,the shape was hard for me to mold into my dentures.Probably others could do better than me.</li>
    <li> They work but I am not excited about using any denture adhesive.  They are easy to use, just wet and apply.</li>
    <li> This was Purchased for a friend I have all of my teeth but my firnd said they liked this product.</li>
    <li> my product arrived on time and was exactly what I ordered . This is more then I expected as a fist time online shopper. I will use this service again</li>
    <li> cushion good keeping a good suction bad</li>
    <li> My dentures could fit better and these keep my dentures from causing sore in my mouth. There is nothing I don&#x27;t like about them! I would recommend them to anyone whose dentures do not fit properly.</li>
    <li> Did not perform as promised. Did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Same as the tops.  Old, dried out, brittle.  Had to throw them away.  Waste of money.  Buyer said he was not responsible as they came from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Ezo Denture Cushions&lt;br /&gt;This product does exactly what it advertised to do.&lt;br /&gt;It last like advertised, holds and doesn&#x27;t alter the taste of your food.</li>
    <li> The cushions were too thick for my dentures, and never remained in place. The use of properly sized cushions on properly fitted dentures has some merit, in that they are a lot cleaner to use that &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; products and without the ooze.</li>
    <li> The Ezo Denture Cushion is just a little bit too thick for my lower Denture but I&#x27;m sure that it would work fine for someone whose Denture is pretty loose from long time use.  My lower Denture is not loose and worn enough yet to get the full benefit from the Ezo Denture cushion. Everyone&#x27;s Dentures fit differently and I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of Denture wearers out there that can benefit from the Ezo Denture cushion.</li>
    <li> My grandfather loves them. States others don&#x27;t compete.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these liners after reading the reviews.  I don&#x27;t know if these are old or what the problem was, but they were useless.  I might as well have put a piece of wet tshirt as a liner.  They did not stick to my denture of my gums.  I followed the directions, tried everything possibly.  Trimmed to fit my denture, warmed both denture and cushions, etc.  At least I didn&#x27;t spend much on them.</li>
    <li> This product works very well, it takes some cutting and fitting; but it does work well and stays on denture like it should.</li>
    <li> Purchasd this for my 80 yr old Aunt who loved this product but could not find it anywhere locally in Indiana or Illinois. Now she can smile and eat again.</li>
    <li> great for uppers lowers pop loose</li>
    <li> Does not work the way it says it will.  Does not help cushion gums or help dentures fit tighter.  Would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Been using thede for over 50 years. Never take my dentures out except to clean them. Sleep with them in. I can go a week easily with each cushion. Never a problem. Product deserves to be #1 over competitors, I guess the dentists don&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about goo coming out holds well and cushions every bite.  Don&#x27;t understand why they are not carried in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled you have these back. I have used them for many years... the only difference is the price... it has sky rocketed ! but I have to use these. Tried everything else and this is the ONLY ones I will wear... so glad they are back</li>
    <li> My mom (80) absolutely LOVES EZO Denture Cushions and has been using them for over 10 years. For over 6 months she was unable to find them in stores anywhere and was forced to use another inferior cushion.  I did all I could to find them for herwith no success - not even on the internet!!  one day I decided to try the internret again and I found these.  I ordered her 6 boxes and ordered more for her birthday.  Can&#x27;t tell how happy she is!!!</li>
    <li> These are not as good as they use to be. They fall apart and shred away. I think they are making them cheaper now days and they don&#x27;t have enough wax in them. I have to continue to use them as there is not another product on the market to compare to them. So I am stuck with them and they are not near what they use to be. And I am talking several years ago. They are made cheaper and it shows. If a person can get by with out them, better off they are. NOT GOOD AT ALL!!!!</li>
    <li> Guess I was hoping for more, strictly cushions, no added adhesion, great for cushioning though. Just don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d keep dentures in place.</li>
    <li> I like these and I am glad I found them</li>
    <li> Better than the gooy stuff.</li>
    <li> These are the best and sure miss not being able to purchase them. Using a substitute just doesn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
    <li> I use this to protect my skin from breaking while i play saxophone.</li>
    <li> They do not exactly fit my mouth . I have to cut them. To fit  ..... And they slide off my denture, they don&#x27;t stay put . But there the only ones I&#x27;ve found that a soft enough for my mouth ...thank you .  Marie</li>
    <li> My mother, who is 82 years old, loves these liners and made me hunt online for them fopr four months before we finally found them here!</li>
    <li> Held for about 2 Minutes. I ordered every denture adhesive that was rated high. Even one from England, not one worked better than the one I&#x27;ve been using which is Fixodent food seal which works right away and hold almost all day.</li>
    <li> I have used these denture cushions for several years.  My lower dentures are more than 50 years old and don&#x27;t fit very well.  I can&#x27;t wear them without ezo.  I have tried other brands and they don&#x27;t work.  Sometimes I can&#x27;t buy these anywhere locally and I have to look for them online.  Thank you for carrying these.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a client and she is so happy.  I will be purchasing more as I have other people with the same problems and this product will do the trick</li>
    <li> So happy with product which is not available in my area.  There isn&#x27;t a bad taste left in mouth.  Easy to use1</li>
    <li> I choose this because it works good and I tried other products and they did not even compare with this. I would reccomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I loved using these They are the only ones that would work on my teeth. I couldn&#x27;t fine this product anyplace else but here.</li>
    <li> While the Perma Soft product does last a long time, the solvent taste is really awful and lingers for several days.  And, over time, the cushion does get very hard and uncomfortable.  I found that if I trim the EZO cushion before I warm and shape it, I can anchor it into the denture using Fixodent, and after that Poligrip to keep it in pace.  I&#x27;m getting about a week from each one.</li>
    <li> Daughter used these during marching band camp to help prevent soreness during long days of playing and marching.</li>
    <li> I use this as a saxophone player. I cut out small quarts to mold to my bottom front teeth and leave it there to keep myself from bitting and adding extra support to my lip. Really good for sax and clarinet players</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at CVS and they discontinued them,  was so glad to see they were on Amazon.  I try and buy two or three boxes at a time, l like them as opposed to using that filler.</li>
    <li> EZO denture cushions are best for denture control I&#x27;ve found.  I have used them for many years. They are getting harder and harder to find especially in Alaska.</li>
    <li> I have used EZO for the past 12 years and it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I have since tried other products such as Sea Bond and Poligrip, but can&#x27;t deal with the ooze.&lt;br /&gt;EZO pads do not have any ooze, they last longer, are more comfortable and inexpensive to boot.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such a great product!</li>
    <li> I will only use these if i have to,,There way to heavy and there hard i liked the regular ones much much better  but i have heard there not makeing them anymore...I dont believe ill be buying the heavy duty ones anymore</li>
    <li> They are the best to use then any other product  that I have triedI hope ther I cam continued to perches them</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  I will not be able to use this product.  I didn&#x27;t like the texture either.</li>
    <li> I love these EZO denture cushions.  They form to my dentures and do not break down or leave a taste in my mouth.  When ready to take out; you just remove.  You have no glue to dig out.  The best I have ever used and believe me I have tried many.  Thanks EZO</li>
    <li> ** Important product for people with dentures.  Hot Item!...  This product use to be found at places like *Rite Aid, Target, Kmart, WalGreens but for a while now no longer seems to be found in these places.  ***HOT ITEM !..</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom as she mentioned that it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;She really likes them.</li>
    <li> It’s a pain in the butt to fill out this stuff!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell marketing to quit wasting our time with this.  If you want a rating the stars are more then enough to let you know what we think of the products.&lt;br /&gt;If you really want input make it optional!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walter Boutin</li>
    <li> I have used these for many years and they are the only ones that cushion my&lt;br /&gt;gums so I don&#x27;t have sores on my gums.  Also, they allow eating to be much better by&lt;br /&gt;not moving or causing other probems.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> I have tried to order this product twice before from 2 different sellers and was cheated out of boxes that I paid for. I ordered from Sams on line and got all that I paid for in a very short time. I am very, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I liked ezo because they keep my denture in place. I have used other denture cushion and they did not stay in place.</li>
    <li> These are the only denture liners my husband will use.  So glad that you have them they are hard to find where we live.  He cannot use any others, they are not as comfortable he says.</li>
    <li> This product was hard to find for my grandmother. Most denture pads don&#x27;t stand up to the quality of EZO. I am very pleased with this product and will order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would have done if I had not found this item. It is the best dental cushion to wear. However amazon is the only please to find it.</li>
    <li> again,got these for my Mom, she likes them.</li>
    <li> SERVICE WAS EXCEPTIONAL, I WILL ORDER MORE, YOURS ARE HEAVIER THAN THE ONES I HAVE BEEN BUYING. NO ONE AROUND HERE EVEN HAVE THEM ANYMORE.  THEY ARE TERRIFIC ! ! THANK YOU&lt;br /&gt;PATRICIA KELLEY</li>
    <li> When I get a sore on my lower lip from playing, I use these to keep me from making it worse with my teeth.  These totally do the trick!!!</li>
    <li> My Mom was upset when cushion grip was taken off the market, so she went to these and loves them. They do need some small triming around her dentures but all in all it is a good product.</li>
    <li> for mother in law, she couldn&#x27;t find them so I did</li>
    <li> Ezo Denture Cushions, lower are great for providing comfort and fit. Because we can not buy these in stores in our area ordering them from Amazon.com is fast and cheap. I have ordered these three times and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> did not work for me. You have to cut them to fit. That is not a good deal. Like to eat out and not read to cut.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  They slipped and slid and moved about.  Not good for bottom dentures that tend to become sore as a rule anyway.</li>
    <li> ezo denture cushions work good.</li>
    <li> Ordered these on behalf of a friend who was having trouble finding them.  She says they&#x27;re wonderful and no other kind will do.</li>
    <li> yes i would reccomend this product to others  Exactly what i expected.  Will order again.  Very satisfied customer.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use these for playing saxophone and it really keeps my lips from getting tore up after hours of playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heavy is the perfect amount of material for me. It is enough padding without having to double up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this to any saxophone player!</li>
    <li> We have been using Ezo Dental Cushions for years and were very disappointed when they quit manufacturing and over joyed when the Lower Heavy became available again and wait anxiously for the Upper Heavy to become available</li>
    <li> These dental cushions are a great little product to use while waiting to see the dentist.  Easy to fit, and they feel good.</li>
    <li> these are for my mom and she can no longer buy them here in eastern Canada. They last a long time and she loves them! They provide excellent cushioning and help her lower dentures stay in place.</li>
    <li> Terrible!! Made teeth worse had to trim down didn&#x27;t stick like it said. I will stay with Fixodent plus</li>
    <li> Product was for my mother.  It is no longer sold in local stores so was happy to find it on the internel.</li>
    <li> To anyone that has a loose fit on their lower dentures needs to try this product. It has cushion and makes your mouth feel wonderful. I recommend it to anyone who does not like adhesives</li>
    <li> They are great for lower dentures...don&#x27;t have any slimey gel oozing like other denture products do. The only thing is they are hard to find in all stores.</li>
    <li> I waited a long time for these and hope I never have to again. Nothing compares to the EZO liners for dentures. Very comfortable and a great hold. Thank you EZO!</li>
    <li> I do not know why these are not sold in stores anymore. They are soooooooo much better than anything the stores carry. They are very economical&lt;br /&gt;as they last a long time and can be cleaned easily along with the denture.</li>
    <li> My first experience with denture cushions. Like sea-bond wafers, if you have a small mouth they are hard to use. If extensively trimmed they will add a lot of comfort &amp;  some chewability.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom.  It&#x27;s. great product to help dentures fit better and stay in place while she eats.  She has told me that there is no after taste like some other products.  Plus she hasn&#x27;t had any uncomfortable feeling when she uses the liners. My mom swears by these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was very happy when I was able to order them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very efficient and my mom received the order in great condition. I would order from seller again.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Items met my every expectation !!!  The price was also great !!  In fact have ordered more ! I have used Ezo cushions for several years. They are great.</li>
    <li> Ok-I know many people swear by these, but, I&#x27;m just not on that team. I just ordered and used these for the first ime this month, March of 2013. I had full dentures installed 3 months ago, and the lower has been a sliding nightmare when I eat. I have been using Cushion Grip and Fixodent, but wanted to try something new. I have also been trying the Seabond adhesive strips. I tried many ways to make these things work, and I just can&#x27;t figure how people are so in love with these pads. They are much thicker and heavier then the Seabond and have no adhesive for holding power. They may make some peoples gums feel better because they are thick, but I found them a real hastle to try to fit and use. If they were thinner and had some adhesive on them, then maybe they would work. Unless I&#x27;m missing something here, I can see no reason to buy these again.</li>
    <li> This product works much better than the expensive Sea-Bond. I have been researching a lot about denture products to help someone with denture and gum problems and I finally found a product that works perfectly as a soft cushion for sore gum while holds the denture firmly in place.</li>
    <li> I am so glad Amazon is carrying this item again - they can be very hard to find. I bought them for my Dad who is 97 and these cushions make his dentures fit better and feel  more  comfortable. I recommend this product based on his experience.</li>
