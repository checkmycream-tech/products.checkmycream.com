      <li>It is packaged nicely, which makes it easy to gift wrap.</li>
      <li>I plan to buy more for Christmas gifts.</li>

      <li>I absolutely love them all.  </li>
      <li>I do like the set and would recommend it being bought at this price :)</li>
      <li>and I love it and got it cheaper too</li>
      <li>I cant ask for more than that.  </li>
      <li>This would make a nice, cheap gift for the holidays for someone you have an affiliation with but are not close to.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The only product from this set that is impressive is the buffer.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product line at a kiosk at the mall, and absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the first set I got</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is good to buff your nails too much.  </li>
      <li>While this is definitely worth the money you might otherwise spend why not have this product and have more cash to spend on more products from Vivo?</li>
      <li>I liked it at first, but have a rash now on my face, chest, and calves.</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on smoothly, absorbs almost instantly, smells great, and leaves your hands moisturized for hours.</li>
      <li>For a basic manicure set, this is a really great one.  </li>
      <li>this makes a great moms day present</li>
      <li>My hands feel silky smooth for hours after using it.</li>
      <li>I now love my REAL nails thanks to this product!! :)</li>
      <li>First of all, I love the way the lotion smells.  </li>
      <li>Also, I love that this comes with the cuticle oil which really does a good job keeping my cuticles soft and supple.  </li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>The nail buff and file are nothing special, but they work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>My favorite product is the hand lotion, which has a light green apple smell and makes my hands feel so nice.</li>
      <li>I received a gift set from my grandson who purchased Vivo Per Lei Dead Sea Minerals Green Apple Exquisite Manicure Set at the mall and loved the products.  </li>
      <li>This hand cream does a good job providing moisture to my dry hands and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy during the work day.</li>
      <li>The file is easy enough to replace and I have a glass nail file I use at home and love</li>
      <li>The price was so low that I gave several sets to friends, even a retired hair stylist, who all loved them!</li>
      <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the overly pushy sales person I probably would have bought the product right then and there</li>
      <li>And the price was right.</li>
      <li>I have received this as a gift and like it very much</li>
      <li>I first tried this product from a kiosk at the mall.</li>
      <li>As for the rest of the manicure set, the buffer leaves your nails irresistibly smooth and glossy, and the cuticle oil finishes the look making your nails look as though they have been professionally tended.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll pay ten times as much or more buying from mall kiosks or even vivopl.com</li>
      <li>I work at a desk and suffer with dry hands that love paper cuts...</li>
      <li>The salesperson was very clingy, pushy, and would not let me say no.  </li>
      <li>I really like this item as it works well</li>
      <li>/&gt;The box is really sturdy (so sturdy you could keep it to hold the items plus some additional stuff, like nail polish or additional nail tools).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The lotion is really moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film like some lotions.  </li>
      <li>Still, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this whole set just for the buffer.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not to worried about the file wearing out, just the buffing block which seems harder to find at a good price and of similar quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good product, came earlier than expected even.</li>
      <li>I want what I paid for and am not convinced that the items I received are Vivo Per Lei Dead Sea Minerals Green Apple Exquisite Manicure Sets.</li>
      <li>Lastly, I love the packaging and that the box can be used to store the items in with the magnetic closure and could be used for other items once these are gone.  </li>
      <li>You can clean up your nails with a few easy to follow steps and bring out their natural shine for days without the need for any polish.  </li>
      <li>The actual products aren&#x27;t really worth it, though.</li>
      <li>There is also the added benefit that you only need about a dime sized amount for your hands and only a little bit more for your whole hand/arm area.</li>
      <li>This product works great after taking off you artificial nails .</li>
      <li>I shake a lot of hands in my line of work and it keeps me looking professional.  </li>
      <li>With it you can have your nails looking professionally manicured by filing, buffing, and oiling them.  </li>
      <li>I ordered with some reserves of an online seller, but I must say I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Product was nice for the price, but poor packaging.</li>
      <li>an occasional touch up of the final buffing step leaves your nails looking nicely manicured with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So I was suckered into buying this for 79 and got one free so a little less than 40 each and was a bit upset to see them so much cheaper on amazon!</li>
      <li>: The nail buffer and file seemed a little cheap as if they’d only las</li>
      <li>When I called nearly a month later inquiring about the replacement sets, he went to the post office to track the package and called me back saying that the post office had lost the package in transit.  </li>
      <li>like the fresh green apple scent.!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cuticle oil near religiously, and my cuticles are still as dry as ever.</li>

<li> Per Lei products (facial peeling &amp; lotion) for SO much less than I would have paid at the mall....</li>
<li> complaint is that depending on the strength of your nails the file and the buffing block can dull quite quickly.  </li>
<li> , only thing I found wrong was you really can&#x27;t smell the scent.</li>
<li> When I opened my package the oil leaked out of the bottle and was all over the other products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife had this set and has been thrilled with it. She&#x27;s constantly buffing and polishing her nails and they look great! This set was ordered as a gift for our daughter.</li>
    <li> The very best hand lotion I have ever used! Great price.</li>
    <li> Value for money. You get the same stuff at mall kiosks (they actually grab you while you are walking by) for around $20-30</li>
    <li> I have received this as a gift and like it very much</li>
    <li> Works great and a great price!</li>
    <li> This would make a nice, cheap gift for the holidays for someone you have an affiliation with but are not close to. It is packaged nicely, which makes it easy to gift wrap. The actual products aren&#x27;t really worth it, though. Like other reviewers, the Vivo Per Lei brand is missing from all the items I received except for the hand lotion. I&#x27;m not sure if this set is an imitation or if it really is from the brand. I am disappointed because the lotion does not moisturize well and the nail filer is very standard, you can get the same thing from any beauty supply store or drug store. I&#x27;ve been using the cuticle oil near religiously, and my cuticles are still as dry as ever. The only product from this set that is impressive is the buffer. Still, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this whole set just for the buffer.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. I really like this item as it works well, only thing I found wrong was you really can&#x27;t smell the scent.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product line at a kiosk at the mall, and absolutely loved it. If it wasn&#x27;t for the overly pushy sales person I probably would have bought the product right then and there but alas i don&#x27;t respond well to someone half way yanking off my arm and dragging my to their kiosk (true story.) Anyhow, I went home and voila, the product is about 1/4 of the price it was at the mall. I ordered with some reserves of an online seller, but I must say I have been pleasantly surprised. The lotion goes on smoothly, absorbs almost instantly, smells great, and leaves your hands moisturized for hours. There is also the added benefit that you only need about a dime sized amount for your hands and only a little bit more for your whole hand/arm area. As for the rest of the manicure set, the buffer leaves your nails irresistibly smooth and glossy, and the cuticle oil finishes the look making your nails look as though they have been professionally tended.</li>
    <li> These products are the best.  I actually do recommend them to all my friends.  I received them as a Xmas gift a few years ago and have never been without it since.  Everyone should try Vivo.</li>
    <li> Product was nice for the price, but poor packaging. When I opened my package the oil leaked out of the bottle and was all over the other products.</li>
    <li> I tried this at a mall kiosk.  it made my nails so shiny.  I purchased from here but after buffing my nails and showing family and friends how shinny your nails became.  My nails started looking cracked and weak.  All my nails are broken off now.  I don&#x27;t think it is good to buff your nails too much.  It should come with a warning.</li>
    <li> I now love my REAL nails thanks to this product!! :)</li>
    <li> The cuticle oil is divine, and the lotion smells and works great!  My hands feel silky smooth for hours after using it.</li>
    <li> Results were the same as from the more expensive product my mom bought for me at a &amp;#34;home show&amp;#34;. And the price was right. I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set. It comes with the buffing tools and a file. The moisturizer is very nice and smells very good.</li>
    <li> The nail buffer and oil appear to be fake, the lotion seems ok. I would not buy  again</li>
    <li> Great nail kit! I loved all the products .</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself because I was looking to buy all the products individually, and then came across this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is really sturdy (so sturdy you could keep it to hold the items plus some additional stuff, like nail polish or additional nail tools).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the cuticle oil, but the other products are as to be expected. My favorite product is the hand lotion, which has a light green apple smell and makes my hands feel so nice. The nail buff and file are nothing special, but they work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over, this is a really great gift for an acquaintance or for yourself :)</li>
    <li> Good product, came earlier than expected even. I got it as a gift for someone, so I havent personally tried any of the things inside. They do smell nice. I&#x27;m not familiar with this brand but it can be a nice gift for someone that likes to pamper their hands/nails.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shine, no polish needed! This set is excellent to condition your cuticles and shape and shine your nails. They look like they are polished, are buffed to a nice sheen! No more chipping polish for me!</li>
    <li> Great Hand Cream Leaves Working Hands Non greasy.  I work at a desk and suffer with dry hands that love paper cuts... This hand cream does a good job providing moisture to my dry hands and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy during the work day.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell as &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; as I&#x27;d expected, but the product does what it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> I bought this from a mall kiosk salesman in Tacoma, WA.  I liked it at first, but have a rash now on my face, chest, and calves.</li>
    <li> For a basic manicure set, this is a really great one.  First of all, I love the way the lotion smells.  The lotion is really moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film like some lotions.  Also, I love that this comes with the cuticle oil which really does a good job keeping my cuticles soft and supple.  Both of the files work great and the buffer adds a great shine to my nails, especially when used with the oil.  Lastly, I love the packaging and that the box can be used to store the items in with the magnetic closure and could be used for other items once these are gone.  I would definitely buy again or as a gift.</li>
    <li> So I was suckered into buying this for 79 and got one free so a little less than 40 each and was a bit upset to see them so much cheaper on amazon! Pesky kiosk people!! But aside from that this set does do wonders for your cuticles if you have rough ones and the buffer leaves your nails shimmering shiny! I do like the set and would recommend it being bought at this price :)</li>
    <li> I first tried this product from a kiosk at the mall. I know I was a victim of a slick salesman at the time. I was talked into paying $90. Was very happy to find it online at an affordable price. I plan to buy more for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Pros: Had everything you needed for a great manicure&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The nail buffer and file seemed a little cheap as if they’d only las a few uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I got the manicure set I clipped, filed, buffed, and oiled my cuticles. The set worked perfectly and gave me salon-quality nails out of my home. Though I was a little disappointed that the utensils left me with the short end of the stick, the supply of cuticle oil and hand lotion makes up for it.</li>
    <li> I shake a lot of hands in my line of work and it keeps me looking professional.  I cant ask for more than that.  would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received a gift set from my grandson who purchased Vivo Per Lei Dead Sea Minerals Green Apple Exquisite Manicure Set at the mall and loved the products.  On 11/5/2012, I happened to find this on Amazon and I purchased 4 sets from Luxury Cosmetics on 11/5/2012.  When they arrived on 11/09/2012, the little green bottles of cuticle oil had the logo/label that read \\&quot;Cuticle Oil huile pour les cuticles\\&quot; with no mention of green tea oil. The whole reason I ordered this product was because it was advertised to have green tea oil in the cuticle oil. It did not have the same label \\&quot;Vivo Per Lei Dead Sea Mineral Tea Tree Oil\\&quot; as the one that came from the mall, so I wrote a complaint to Luxury Cosmetics.  The only item that had the same label was the lotion.  The other items (the file and 3-way nail buffer) did not have the same logo/label as the ones from the mall either. My concern was that these products were a knock off of the official brand.  I have spoken to the owner of Luxury Cosmetics, Tom, and Tina who answers the phone, a couple of times and he/they were very nice.  He asked me to remove my complaint from Amazon and assured me he would send out the products with the official logo/label and include a return postage label for the first 4 sets I received.  When I called nearly a month later inquiring about the replacement sets, he went to the post office to track the package and called me back saying that the post office had lost the package in transit.  This was on 11/09/2012.  I am still waiting for the replacement sets with the official logos on the items.  I left a voice mail message on 12/5/2012 and am still waiting for a return call from the owner.  I paid for all four sets and have neither received the replacements nor a refund.  I am getting very frustrated. I want what I paid for and am not convinced that the items I received are Vivo Per Lei Dead Sea Minerals Green Apple Exquisite Manicure Sets.</li>
    <li> It works well one time.  The combo filer and polishing block is worn out after one use.  You are left with the oil and the lotion which do work well.</li>
    <li> I tried this product at the mall.  The salesperson was very clingy, pushy, and would not let me say no.  I am SO glad for Amazon!  I previously purchased other Vivo Per Lei products (facial peeling &amp; lotion) for SO much less than I would have paid at the mall....so I thought I would check here again.  Sure enough....got this product for $9.44 ($80 at the mall)!  I just received my product today (just as pictured), and I have perfectly manicured fingers right now.  Shine on, nails!</li>
    <li> This kit is absolutely magnificent.  You can clean up your nails with a few easy to follow steps and bring out their natural shine for days without the need for any polish.  The cuticle oil is wonderful as it nourishes the nails and soften the surrounding skin, and of course you can&#x27;t forget the lotion which leaves your hands feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that depending on the strength of your nails the file and the buffing block can dull quite quickly.  I&#x27;m currently looking for replacements for the buffing block.  The file is easy enough to replace and I have a glass nail file I use at home and love so I&#x27;m not to worried about the file wearing out, just the buffing block which seems harder to find at a good price and of similar quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t want to go through all the buffing steps too often as it can thin the nail and lead to cracking but an occasional touch up of the final buffing step leaves your nails looking nicely manicured with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many Vivo Per Lei products and I absolutely love them all.  Getting some of these sets to pass out for Christmas.  One piece of advice though is to definitely buy online here at Amazon.  The best prices I&#x27;ve found for the Vivo Per Lei product line are here on Amazon.  You&#x27;ll pay ten times as much or more buying from mall kiosks or even vivopl.com (Vivo Per Lei&#x27;s website where you can order the products).  While this is definitely worth the money you might otherwise spend why not have this product and have more cash to spend on more products from Vivo?</li>
    <li> Check who you buy it from because the ones that I bought it from gave me things that didn&#x27;t have the vivo per lei logo. You could tell that they switched everything out and the only thing that was legit was he lotion.</li>
    <li> nice package and perfect manicure set.  everything you need to freshen and polish your nails.  very nice.  like the fresh green apple scent.!</li>
    <li> I had this set in a different set bought that at a mall then I found it one and I love it and got it cheaper too this makes a great moms day present</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. This product works great after taking off you artificial nails . Great buy great price. I love it.</li>
    <li> The product was just what I wanted.  With it you can have your nails looking professionally manicured by filing, buffing, and oiling them.  They shine without applying polish!  The price was so low that I gave several sets to friends, even a retired hair stylist, who all loved them!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the first set I got</li>
