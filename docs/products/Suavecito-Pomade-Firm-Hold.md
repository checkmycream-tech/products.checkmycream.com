<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> More convenient in bigger packages</li>
    <li> Great product, does what&#x27;s advertised.</li>
    <li> You can not go wrong with this product especially for the price!  My last purchase was the original hold 32 oz tub and it worked great. Great hold that lasted all day but easily rinsed out with water. If you have thick hair that&#x27;s harf to control I suggest getting the firme hold. Be advised tho, it&#x27;s a different beast! If you&#x27;re not quick with your styling it will freeze in place. But nothing a little spritz of water won&#x27;t help. You can also restyle or recomb your hair throughout the day, just spray a little bit of water in your comb or hair and it will reactivate the pomade and hold like new. Combine the great hold and awesome smell I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheaper then Layrite and has a musky smell versus a sweet smell like Layrite. Holds very well only downfall is there is almost zero shine so your have looks a little dry but no big deal. Over all if you haven&#x27;t tried this and you&#x27;re looking for a good price ( I buy the 32oz at $55 as where Layrite is $80 for 32oz ) and strong hold then this is for you!</li>
    <li> I feel like a 50s Greaser. I even went to Walmart and bought 4 packs of Hanes white Ts and a carton of Marlboro Reds.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, the firm strength means I don&#x27;t need to use much. The company is located locally to me!</li>
    <li> Best pomade on the planet. It smells the best cant get enough of it. GET IT HOMBRE!!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff !!!Awesome hold &amp; smell !Does just what it&#x27;s meant to do !!!</li>
    <li> Been looking for a great product forever that has great hold for a great price. And this nails it all ! Shelled out the money for the big tub and it was well worth the $. I have thin wavy/curly hair and this product straightens it out without using a big glob so I can slick it back.. Love it !</li>
    <li> I bought the 32 oz after trying 2 smaller containers (my stylist introduced me to the product) and am halfway thru the tub.&lt;br /&gt;The product is awesome, once in the morning and that&#x27;s it til I shower again, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments and plan to keep using this stuff until something better comes along, but I doubt anything will top it.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the added good feeling that I&#x27;m supporting a local So Cal small business in Santa Ana.... Keep going boys you&#x27;re doing a great job!&lt;br /&gt;Laguna Niguel, Ca</li>
    <li> This thing lasted me an entire year. It could have lasted longer if my hair wasn&#x27;t so long at times.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and suavecito firme is the only water based pomade that will keep it in place. I&#x27;ve used it to style several hairstyles, from a pomp to a combover. As far as the scent, I love it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair products. My review is based on the hold throughout the day. I have used other pomades, but this one holds up the best. It can be a little hard to wash out at the end of day, but this is the least of my worries.  I am about half way through the container, and have not experienced any decrease in product performance.</li>
    <li> Amazing hair pomade. Get the look that you want 100%</li>
    <li> Good pomade. Smells good, works good.</li>
    <li> The best pomade. Period!!</li>
    <li> Hold on my hair is better than any gel. I&#x27;ll only use pomade from now on and I like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I used to strictly only buy Hawleywoods Layrite pomade, honestly don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try suavecito sooner - it&#x27;s a great product. From here on out I will always keep a tub of Suavecito in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> Worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> Love this pomade. It keeps the hair stiff, yet is easily removed with water. The fragrance is good and leaves your hair looking great.</li>
    <li> I like the firm hold much better than the regular and the big can is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Best product !!! after about 6 months and theres still about half in the tub</li>
    <li> I started using Suavecito about 8 months ago and I love it, this is the best price out there and using prime to ship it it&#x27;s a great deal!!!!</li>
    <li> This pomade has a very nice fragrance and a very strong hold.  I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend wearing cologne at the same time, as the fragrance does last for a while. I don&#x27;t see this as an issue, as the fragrance is very pleasant.  The pomade holds very well and easily lasts all day, plus you can easily restyle by just slightly wetting your hair and styling.</li>
    <li> My barber introduced me to Suavecito pomade and it has since become my favorite hair product. It smells good and it holds well for being water based. I often have trouble with water based product because I have fine hair, but this has a perfect consistency. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Suavecito firm hold is  riley grate to use. Holds hare ware you put it, rinses out with water so you don&#x27;t have to degrease your hair for a few days to get all out. Smells riley good, you can re do your hair with a little bet of water and stile and go on with your day.</li>
    <li> Big jar, good value. my son uses this on his pompadour.</li>
    <li> Kind of expensive. But definitely worth it. It is a huge tub of pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I decide to keep my combover. I will use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Only stuff that works to hold my husband&#x27;s extremely coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I loved it so much I but the 32oz tub.</li>
    <li> great seller and product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this product. if you do not wash your hair everyday like I don&#x27;t then this broadcast for you it works wonders you leave it in for a day or two is fine roulette your hair you will live again no I&#x27;m very nice if they do neurons not going to say anything and who cares see you. I&#x27;m drunk thank you for your time</li>
    <li> PERFECT! This is what I need when using my favorite product at home! I literally wouldn&#x27;t even need to worry about my small 8oz going out on me since I have this bad boy around. If you&#x27;re thinking about wanting to save money in the longggggggggggg run, this is what you need to invest in.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. No problems. No complaints :).</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and keeps his pompadour intact all day. Everyone always asks what he uses and he totally sells this product.</li>
    <li> Ordered the Firme Hold but i got the original hold. Anyways its still Suavecito.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair great since I have thick hair. I have switched from Layrite to suavcito!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best pomade on the market!  Great subtle masculine scent and perfect non-greasy feel.  All-day hold power for any style.  I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;surf&amp;#34; pomades, axe hair paste, and old spice pomade; SUAVECITO is a superior product by far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for 2 years. Stop buying it in 4oz, just buy a large 32oz all at once. Saves you the time and trouble. The stuff holds amazing, I&#x27;m talking about for a whole day having a full and tall pomp or a combover and it washes out as easy as 1, 2, 3. The only issue someone might have (and I had it) is the smell. But, you get use to it overtime and by the time you get out, drive to work, the smell fades. Do yourself a favor and pocket this product NOW!</li>
    <li> Perfect I absolutely love This product</li>
    <li> Amzing product .hold my hair perfect just the way i like it and eazy to apply with no mess..washes out eazy</li>
    <li> Item was recieved quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Sauvecito is the best hair product out there for those with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Just simply the best pomade on the market.</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend it to everyone who has curly hair, tough time combing your hair to perfection and everyone who loves good with with a good scent. I&#x27;m addicted to this gel.</li>
    <li> Great product if you dont buy it your crazy!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, you don&#x27;t have to use to much, has a great hold and smells really good</li>
    <li> I purchased my 32oz of Suavecito Firme on Oct. 4 and received it on the 8th, very fast! I also got a great deal on it. Retail for the 32oz is close to $70 and Top Shelf is selling it for $54. What?! Great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suavecito Firme does the trick for me. 3 weeks ago, I bought the 4oz and I loved it so much that I got the 32oz. Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells nice, very strong hold, and it&#x27;s water based so it washes out easily. Definitely, I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer. Stick around for a long time, Top Shelf! I&#x27;ll be needing you guys!</li>
    <li> Suavecito strong hold its works and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works on the straw like hair I have. It&#x27;s amazing and has the ability to restyle half way through the day if I need to. It washes out with just water and comes out really clean too.</li>
