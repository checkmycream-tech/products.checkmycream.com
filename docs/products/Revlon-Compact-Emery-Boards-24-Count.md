      <li>Probably not even worth reviewing, but sometimes you can never be sure!</li>
      <li>I use these a lot and was glad Amazon had these available.</li>
      <li>Considering how quickly her nails grow, its great to have a large pack.</li>
      <li>It was easy to work with this shipper.</li>
      <li>Heavier gritted side, too strong for my liking.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s fine since i have 24 all together</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re cheap emery boards.</li>
      <li>Cheap emery boards that work.  </li>
      <li>These are cheap and do the job.</li>
      <li>Cheap in both senses of the word.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re</li>
      <li>Fantastic for the price.</li>
      <li>These are cheap, too cheap.</li>
      <li>These are the perfect size for your purse or small places like a work drawer.</li>
      <li>These came in the original Revlon package, true to count.</li>
      <li>I use quite a few of these right now and the product is perfect.</li>
      <li>I just need one for emergency purposes when I am out and about and don&#x27;t want to carry one of the full size board.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a great price, and work extremely well.</li>
      <li>I keep them all over the house, whenever a quick filing is needed.</li>
      <li>Excellent abrasive on both sides, short enough that the boards aren&#x27;t a problem to toss into your purse (the longer ones have a tendency to bend/break).  </li>
      <li>I have a pile of fancier ones but for the price you can set a little schedule for beautiful nails.</li>
      <li>I love that you can now add on products to complete your 25 super saving shipping order.</li>
      <li>These emery boards are of good quality and don&#x27;t rub off quickly like other emery boards do.</li>
      <li>it was worth it</li>
      <li>They are nice little emery boards at a cheap price</li>
      <li>It seems to me that these boards don&#x27;t have a true &#x27;fine side&#x27;, but both sides are coarse.  </li>
      <li>I rather have a higher quality one meant to last more than 1 use.</li>
      <li>Exactly as you would expect, as advertised and pictured.</li>
      <li>Still, I&#x27;m overall pleased with these.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure these would be sturdy enough to work, but they are!</li>
      <li>I could only find those foam ones, and they wanted more to purchase one at Kmart, CVS, Rite Aid, than it cost to buy two packages of yours.  </li>
      <li>Still on the first one I started with.</li>
      <li>They look pretty too.</li>
      <li>I suggest you spend the money and get a file that will last for more than three fingernails.  </li>
      <li>i recall first using these at Grandma&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>There are so many in the packet that you will have them for a long time!</li>
      <li>Cheap enough to throw away, strong enough to reuse again</li>
      <li>this was a great deal on these simple everyday nail files, I use them all the time, and since they are priced reasonably and a large amount I can just leave them everywhere</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I good product to begin with, but the price and free ship just makes this a nice add on item to good to refuse. They hold up wonderfully. Do not need to use a new one each time I do my nails. Still on the first one I started with.</li>
    <li> My mom always using it.&lt;br /&gt;(Not only for a nail but also many other ways..)&lt;br /&gt;and I like these boards, too.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy about these, you&#x27;ve probably used millions of them over the years. But it&#x27;s handy to have a few on hand or in a travel case.</li>
    <li> So handy and work great! I keep them all over the house, whenever a quick filing is needed. There are so many in the packet that you will have them for a long time! The price cant be beat for such a quality product.</li>
    <li> I love that you can now add on products to complete your 25 super saving shipping order. I needed these anyway, and they are just what they are, Emery Boards. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have bought the store brand emery boards, but they don&#x27;t compare to Revlon.  I had a hard time finding the real thing... so glad Amazon carries these!</li>
    <li> Cheap enough to throw away, strong enough to reuse again</li>
    <li> this product is amazing. Very easy to do and every time I can use a new one it is great-</li>
    <li> Revlon Compact Emery Boards, 24 Count  are a great deal and when you use them a lot it is good to have a subscription.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for these boards locally and they are hard to find and expensive when you do find them.  I use quite a few of these right now and the product is perfect.</li>
    <li> They are what they are. Great for filing nails. Great price for the amount. They last a long time. Great for add ons</li>
    <li> These are cheap, too cheap. I rather have a higher quality one meant to last more than 1 use. If they get wet, they are useless, make sure your hands are dry. I also think they should be a bit wider for better handling and toenails.</li>
    <li> seem like a good price for all of these Im happy with them its wasa good deal im happy with it</li>
    <li> I got these on Amazon Prime when I just ran out of emery boards and my local Target which is where I normally bought this type of stuff started carrying nothing but their cheap private label up and up brand of just about everything in the polish remover and nail file area.  The quality was terrible and I didn&#x27;t have time to run around looking for good emery boards so I hit Amazon prime, 2 day delivery and boom there they were.  Good quality boards and on time arrival Bravo Amazon prime!</li>
    <li> As a price point, these boards are excellent value for money.  They are only 3 inches tall, and small enough to throw a few into my handbag.  The rough side is strong to smooth down those rough edges or a broken nail.  I just need one for emergency purposes when I am out and about and don&#x27;t want to carry one of the full size board.</li>
    <li> Basic product from a well known company. Exactly as you would expect, as advertised and pictured. Probably not even worth reviewing, but sometimes you can never be sure! Rest assured you will be getting what you were looking for with these emery boards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy filing!</li>
    <li> It seems to me that these boards don&#x27;t have a true &#x27;fine side&#x27;, but both sides are coarse.  But they work.</li>
    <li> These are quality emory boards at a great price.  Someone said in their review they are small, I would call them &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size of about six inches long, wouldn&#x27;t want them any longer it would be a waste and difficult to use.  What else can you say, they are good quality emory boards and a half a lifetime quantity for a low price!!  Received them two days after ordering.</li>
    <li> I never know when to throw these things out.  I have a pile of fancier ones but for the price you can set a little schedule for beautiful nails.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped promptly and received. Packaged well. These are the perfect size for your purse or small places like a work drawer.</li>
    <li> Good emery boards. Not the best quality, but they do the job.</li>
    <li> One side of this emery board is too coarse, the other too soft. The coarse side tears up my nails, and the finer side is worn out after one use. But I&#x27;m patching and sanding plaster around the house... I can use the coarse side to sand the compound. Not something I&#x27;ll buy again, though.</li>
    <li> Seems like the fine side lasts much less time, than did the OLD ones.  Half dozen uses, and already need to pull out another one.  Heavier gritted side, too strong for my liking.  Decent price.</li>
    <li> Good for filing baby&#x27;s nails. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s a lot because I just have them all over the house and can file baby&#x27;s nails anywhere! Good deal.</li>
    <li> I suggest you spend the money and get a file that will last for more than three fingernails.  But these would be great to take along for camping or vacationing.</li>
    <li> this was a great deal on these simple everyday nail files, I use them all the time, and since they are priced reasonably and a large amount I can just leave them everywhere so I always have a file when and where I need one at anytime they are perfect files, they are not the fancy ones that buff ect, these are ordinaly files, but work great!</li>
    <li> I am using them on my small dog&#x27;s nails as they tend to grow in curve so I file down backside and then clip with dog nail clipper. Wasn&#x27;t sure these would be sturdy enough to work, but they are!</li>
    <li> I like Revlon, but these emery boards are very harsh and cheap-made, don&#x27;t work well, I mean you can use them, but the process is quite unpleasant. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> These are the best. I have used the Revlon brand since I was selling cosmetics at a fancy department store when in my twenties... decades ago!</li>
    <li> Love these Emory boards.</li>
    <li> I use these for sanding plastic &amp; wood items in my shop.  Great bargain for using for model-building, considering how over-priced they&#x27;d be if they were marketed as a hobby tool.</li>
    <li> I bought these nail files for my 2mo old son.  I was sick of using the baby nail files because they took forever to file.  These nail files file his nails quickly and without jagged, sharp edges.  Plus, they&#x27;re not too big for his tiny fingers.</li>
    <li> not as durable as they used to be, but good for short term use, and good for that &amp;#34;one more item&amp;#34; in subscribe &amp; save.</li>
    <li> Something is wrong with this product.  I used to use Revlon emery boards always and forever.  Now, one side of these files is too damaging to nails.  It is like coarse sandpaper.  I can only use the finer side, not the darker colored main side.  The finer side used to be for refining and smoothing the finish after you had used the other side to shape your nails.  It is the shaping side that is just too coarse and damaging to fingernails.  I can not believe this is the second package I have bought hoping these were like the old Revlon emery boards.</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this as a great 5th Subscribe and Save if needed, in order to get 15% off.  Great idea!</li>
    <li> I could not file my nails with these nor my babies.</li>
    <li> Cheap emery boards that work.  What else do you need.</li>
    <li> I love these emery boards. They&#x27;re a great price, and work extremely well. A good bargain for this many too.</li>
    <li> Good price for a lot of nail files. Glad Amazon sells it because I always forget to buy them when I go to the store.</li>
    <li> love it would buy again</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot you can say about nail files. These came in the original Revlon package, true to count. These are great to just toss in your purse and go. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Inadvertently filed down not just my nail, but also several fingers using these.  Still, I&#x27;m overall pleased with these.</li>
    <li> These boards feel more stiff and have a longer life to them than others I purchased in the past. I recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have tough nails and go through emery boards.  These are a one use emery boards for me, so for the price, it is just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect this to last and last, it really is use and throw away.</li>
    <li> I expected an emery &amp;#34;board&amp;#34;  What I got was like sand paper, wafer thin!  I guess you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These emery boards are of good quality and don&#x27;t rub off quickly like other emery boards do. This package should last you a LONG time!</li>
    <li> i recall first using these at Grandma&#x27;s.  The cardboard is firm--two sided (coarse/fine) for those that prefer to file a lot or just a little.  A great alternative to fingernail clippers for infant nails!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cheap emery boards. What can I say? They&#x27;re not great, but they ren&#x27;t horrible either. I do like that they come in a 24 pack. I haven&#x27;t had to buy any in a while!</li>
    <li> Kinda thin and lower quality than I expected from Revlon, but for disposible emery boards and the price. I will use them, but will not re-order.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re emery boards. You use them 2-3 times then you throw them away. Great for managing nails and making sure you don&#x27;t get that snagging feeling from them.</li>
    <li> Apparently, emery board qualities have declined since last I looked.  I could only find those foam ones, and they wanted more to purchase one at Kmart, CVS, Rite Aid, than it cost to buy two packages of yours.  I stocked up.  Thanks a lot....great price, great product.</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time finding this product in the stores.  The boards are not as harsh as some emery boards I have used and I really like to use them because my nails are very thin and fragile and do not split when I use these boards.</li>
    <li> What can I say these bitches can file. I have no other experiences with other nail files and very limited experience on the topic.</li>
    <li> It was easy to work with this shipper. I have no complaints about them. Everything was great and without problem.</li>
    <li> You get the quality you&#x27;ve come to expect. Good price. Very good emory boards. Always trust Revlon. I will order these again.</li>
    <li> These emery boards fit great in my purse. My nails get damaged very easily so I like to have them at all times</li>
    <li> This is a good value for the money.  They work especially well when new but does hold its usefulness over a handful of uses.  You can also use both ends when one side gets worn down.  Much cheaper than local stores and should easily last a couple of years.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use these a lot and was glad Amazon had these available. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have harder nails and these work great.  Just like the ones you buy in the store, though lately I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding them.  I like these because they are cheap and the kids keep running off with them/getting them wet.  I don&#x27;t feel bad if I loose them.  Nice size package I won&#x27;t have to remember to buy them for a while.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay it wears out more that&#x27;s fine since i have 24 all together but still it was a great purchase and I would recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I was used to a thicker style emery board, which is what I really wanted but these work well enough.</li>
    <li> they work as a emery board should work and I&#x27;m told they are more durable then the ones at the drug store</li>
    <li> The sandpaper on all the ones I got peels off when you use it.  Pretty disappointing.  Cheap in both senses of the word.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re ok if you go to the trouble of re-gluing the sandpaper back on both sides.  But one shouldn&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
    <li> I actually got these to file my newborns nails because I am too chicken to cut them. Considering how quickly her nails grow, its great to have a large pack. They file her nails well without ripping or tearing and the narrow end it small enough to get the edges of her nails. I am happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I got these because I needed to spend a couple more bucks to get the add-on item shipped that was in my cart. They are nice little emery boards at a cheap price and I would reccommend everyone have one to carry around for unexpected nail dilemmas!</li>
    <li> I love it I carry with one all the time in my purse it was worth it the price was good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years, but the product has changed, is smaller, and does not last near as long as the older ones.</li>
    <li> Excellent abrasive on both sides, short enough that the boards aren&#x27;t a problem to toss into your purse (the longer ones have a tendency to bend/break).  When using the &#x27;add on item&#x27; shipping, they are less than the cost at a local store.</li>
    <li> Bought this product because when I put nail polish on, sometimes I get the polish on the sides of my fingers between the nail and skin. Using a file removes it and makes it look profesional. These are cheap and do the job.</li>
    <li> the best thing to carry with  you at any time, my saying is alway&#x27;s be perpared for a snag, they seem to happen at the worst time..</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do - these are cheap emery boards (so don&#x27;t expect them to last forever) but they get the job done and work well.  The only downside is they are a bit small and wear out very quickly on the thicker nails (like a big toenail).  Other than that can&#x27;t complain for under $2</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t so gritty that it weakens your nail, but enough to work well. Fantastic for the price. They look pretty too. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re less than two dollars and you get 24 separate emery boards, which is more than I was expecting ( I know it&#x27;s in the description but somehow I didn&#x27;t put two and two together) I bought this pack about a month ago and I use them all the time. A single emery board doesn&#x27;t last terribly long though, but you get quite a few in the pack so you can just throw them away after they become dull. Also they are less abrasive than the metal nail files, which is nice if you have fragile nails.</li>
    <li> best value around.....at a great price....product made very well..delivery was perfect...emory boards...i would tell all to take advantage of this offer</li>
    <li> I really like these emery boards. They get the job done and last longer than others I&#x27;ve tried. A great product and I am very satisfied with the amount in the package.</li>
