    <li> they are the greatest solution for us who don&#x27;t want to have the pain of putting on a real tattoo and with colors I don&#x27;t think you can ever get on a real tattoo, beautiful and harmless.</li>
    <li> 2nd order for me! I absolutely love these, even better than the last ones! Great designs and so easy to put on! Also can be used to accessorize already existing tattoos, as you can see here!</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail a couple of days ago and they are so super cute! I can&#x27;t wait to try them out this weekend. Simple, easy instructions are included so anyone could apply these.</li>
    <li> The black really highlights the gold. These are my favorite flash tattoos I&#x27;ve ever bought and I buy a lot of flash tattoos.</li>
    <li> These tatoos are good. They come in nice packaging and are nice designs for men and women both to wear. My husband liked them a lot.</li>

    <li> Product for review: great little tattoos for any occasion.</li>
    <li> These are great and they are very easy to put on and they look so cool!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful design! My wife loves them. They look so nice on her.</li>
    <li> Very fun and they look great.  They are easy to apply.  They are exactly as they were described.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great temporary tattoos. I just went on vacation to the gulf coast and played up my look with several of these. They looked very pretty and stayed on through lots of sunshine, heat, sweat and ocean. I was honestly surprised by the length of time they stayed on. I recieved this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> These are very pretty! They&#x27;re also very temporary, which I think is great. They will last a few days if you&#x27;re careful, but if you have little girls that like to wear jewelry or put stickers on themselves, this would be a fun alternative. They come off easily with a little oil and some soapy water with gentle scrubbing. The pack has a bunch of good sizes that range from pretty tiny to ones that will wrap around your arm. I like to cut them up and use them as nail decals too, also, I put them on notebooks or other things to decorate. A friend of mine uses these as wall stickers, she creates little murals with them. The gold is bright and metallic, and all of the arrows are super pretty! I&#x27;m very please with this purchase. :)</li>
    <li> These are absolutely beautiful! I love the designs as birds are my favorite. These are a great quality brand and long lasting. I put a few on before heading over to my friends pool party and they have lasted all day in the water and out in the heat through sweat. Very pleased with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was wonderful and delivered my item right on time and packaged it properly so that there was no damaging to the item or package. I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I am very pleased with this item and look forward to purchasing more very soon.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful! It comes with two sheets that have arrow and sparrow temporary tattoos. They are applied as any temporary tattoo is and it lasts quite a long time. I have had mine on for 3 days + and it still looks great.</li>
    <li> Really love these tattoos. They are very unique and beautiful! They attract a lot of attention. Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are so fun! I love the arrows the most. Since they are temporary I knew that they&#x27;d wear off eventually. The downfall, I put the arrow on the inside of my arm. It only lasted two days. I&#x27;ve had other temporary tattoos like these that lasted longer, but they were placed in areas where there was less friction between skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy all the options I got with these sheets and look forward to using these in the future. I would recommend this product to someone who wants a very temporary option opposed to hyena or a real tattoo.</li>
    <li> I love the new designs! So pretty and easy to apply. Can&#x27;t wait for the next set!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free or highly discounted in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few different type of metallic tattoos. Some of them are great and others are not. Some of them last for a up to 2-3 weeks while a lot of only lasted a couple days. I am happy to say these tattoos go into the good pile. My sister and I love metallic tattoos, so we both tried them out, and we both love them. They are easy to put on, and they lasted our entire two week vacation at out summer home. When we got home, we did have to take them off for work, and they came off easy as well. What we did was rub in some baby-oil and let it soak in and then hopped into the shower and scrub it off. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of scrubbing; the oil and the steam from the shower do the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the tattoos were great, and the quantity was good. There were two sheets and each sheet had about a dozen tattoos, and there were a variety of designs. My sister loved all the arrows while I favored the birds. We were both happy with the selection and did not feel limited in our choices. These are great for vacation time especially when you do not want to bring jewelry with you. They lasted a long time even through sweaty days, swimming (in fresh water,) the sand, and showering (without baby-oil.) They are just fun things to have, and we did have a blast using them and got more than a few compliments while wearing them. I would definitely buy these again next summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we both recommend this product.</li>
    <li> They wear off faster than I was expecting but are still beautiful and came right on time :)</li>
    <li> Love the product llooks real</li>
    <li> Love these tattoos!!! They&#x27;re fantastic super beautiful and stay on for a good amount of time!</li>
    <li> These temp tattoos are so beautiful and they last longer than expected!</li>
