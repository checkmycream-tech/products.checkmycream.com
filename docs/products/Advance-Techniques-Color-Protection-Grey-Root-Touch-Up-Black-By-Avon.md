<li> However, it does not cover grey properly!  </li>
<li> Cover up your grey.</li>

<li> You need to let it dry before you comb your hair.  </li>
<li> When used while my hair is still wet it runs.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.  </li>
<li> so could make a mess when you sweat or come into contact w/ any liquid.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it beyond a few days, though.</li>
<li> I only use it on the roots where I part my hair, so it isn&#x27;t difficult to remove most/all of it.</li>
<li> It was like a worn up mascara which will leave nothing except small dots.</li>
<li> saw the other review which talkes about wrong instructions.</li>
<li> I wanted so badly to like this product.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product if you just want to touch up a little gray here and there, I use it for my beard and have been very happy with it</li>
    <li> still looking for a product which bonds to hair and doesn&#x27;t rub off on hands and in brush.  If someone knows of a product that washes out but does not come off when perspiring or simply brushing hair, please let me know.  In the meantime I opt for this touch up product.</li>
    <li> The consistency and brush for this product is like mascara - goopy and sticky.  So while it will cover your color eventually, you may have to try to apply to the area multiple times because the color doesn&#x27;t always adhere to the hair.  Not the most ideal to me, but works in a pinch to satisfy my sense of vanity.</li>
    <li> This product has been effective in allowing me to increase the time between professional full colour appointments, thus being a real money saver. I use it mainly to cover the grey framing my face. The brunette colour is perfect however the applicator is a bit tricky to use.  Suggestion for the manufacturer:  If the brush applicator was manufactured so it is at right angles to the part which is held during the process,ie like a \\&quot;T\\&quot; shape, the product would be much easier to apply. I would then have to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I wanted so badly to like this product.  It smells very nice and the application brush is great.  However, it does not cover grey properly!  Not worth the money.  Do not buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Temporary touch up before your next hair color.  It doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel like mascara does.  Touch up works like a mascara.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought.</li>
    <li> Works best on dry hair.  When used while my hair is still wet it runs. Good quick touch up tool though.</li>
    <li> When this item arrived, it looked like a used one. It was like a worn up mascara which will leave nothing except small dots. I wonder if the seller just collects those items at the garbage outside of the Avon store, or if the Avon reputation goes south these days.</li>
    <li> This is good in a pinch if you have to go a few extra days before coloring but can&#x27;t get out of an event/date/meeting. It&#x27;s easy to apply, just like mascara for your hair. The consistency is good, not clumpy. I wouldn&#x27;t use it beyond a few days, though. The color is only so correct and it rubs off onto your hand, a tissue, possibly a pillow case. If you want to remove it before coloring your roots, just use a damp paper towel. I have not tried to color over it, but I assume it would block some of the color, so I remove it. I only use it on the roots where I part my hair, so it isn&#x27;t difficult to remove most/all of it. It&#x27;s a bit perfumey, but not bad. I gave it five stars even though it rubs off because I wouldn&#x27;t want a product that did not come off -- how would you get the permanent color onto your hair if you couldn&#x27;t get this off? If you do want a color like that, get one of the semi-permanent hair colorings. This is just for those days when you have a last minute date or meeting and want to look your best.</li>
    <li> LOL!  Bought this and my husband took it and said to get him more.  He uses it to touch up his beard.  It&#x27;s really nice because it doesn&#x27;t give that &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; dyed color to your hair.  This stuff really is the best quick coverup for gray hair that I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s light weight yet gives nice coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Laura from http://www.womens-fitness-tips.com/</li>
    <li> This product works.  You need to let it dry before you comb your hair.  Stays in the hair for about two to three days before it wears off.</li>
    <li> this is a great great product. wonderful price. this so so great it is so easy to apply every women should have this as a backup</li>
    <li> Works well, even after 48 hrs - I went camping and couldn&#x27;t take a shower for a couple of days but this product stayed in my hair without a problem.</li>
    <li> Very good quick solution for in-between dyeing gray hair BUT it&#x27;s NOT WATER-PROOF so could make a mess when you sweat or come into contact w/ any liquid. Also brushes off easily with hands, brushes/combs, clothes, tissues... Not fond of its strong scent. PLEASE make a water-proof version which washes off w/ soap or shampoo.  There are mascaras that are like that.</li>
    <li> Cover up your grey. This product really works. I use this every day and no one sees any grey on my head. Love!</li>
    <li> it covers up my front gray hair and make me look younger without dying my hair.  i recommend it who wants a quick result.</li>
    <li> Color does not stay on permanently.  The ink would come off and stick on your face if you get sweat.</li>
    <li> It work somewhat fine by hiding the visible gray hairs but is no permanent and comes easily.</li>
    <li> Avon discontinued this in their book. I was so happy to find it online. Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product, DANGEROUS instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the other review which talkes about wrong instructions. It could be a Hazard, call the manufacture if you are changing wiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer change your installation instructions.</li>
    <li> The touch-up pen leaked dyes out all over in the delivered package so didn&#x27;t get to use it. Very disappointed. Do not buy this kind of product anymore.</li>
    <li> Works great, is a must have!!! I will never be caught without one. Makes me able to go longer between dye jobs without looking silly,.</li>
