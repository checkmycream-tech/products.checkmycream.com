### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My dental exams have been excellent since I&#x27;be been using this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>This is the best!</li>
      <li>product, itself, is great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s so great to just buy them here at a cheaper price!</li>
      <li>best customer service ive ever had.  </li>
      <li>best toothbrush system ive ever used.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Great product but deceptive advertising.  </li>
      <li>Intelligent &amp;</li>
      <li>Great product for trying to save the environment....</li>
      <li>They feel so nice to brush with!  </li>
      <li>my dentist had never seen it he loved it too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy that you now have replacement heads available for my favorite toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t tell the dentist; he&#x27;ll be sure to put a stop the production of them!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice to save plastic by reusing the substantial handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So it goes without saying that when I&#x27;m done with these brush heads, I&#x27;m switching to the more effective Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush, and I will not be doing any more business with Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>When I noticed that Amazon had the best value, I chatted online with customer service to ensure that for each [quantity of one] I would be purchasing of this item, that I would be receiving a total of six brush heads</li>
      <li>I love radius toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>The only thing that makes the best toothbrush ever better is this: replaceable heads</li>
      <li>should pay more attention to the reviews and fix the problem</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and this has been going on for many months in spite of the complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
      <li>But, in the meantime, this is important info to know!</li>
      <li>Thank you, Amazon, for making these available - and still made in the USA!</li>
      <li>But the handles that carry/hold these heads are WAY cool!</li>
      <li>I recommend Lucky Vitamin or Vitacost as they provide excellent customer service, free shipping options, and low prices.</li>
      <li>The Source and Intelligent handles that they fit are very comfortable to hold in either the right or left hand.</li>
      <li>Head feels comfortable in mouth.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t feel as though my teeth get as clean with these.  </li>
      <li>I usually happy with my Amazon purchases, and would return these if it weren&#x27;t so much trouble.</li>
      <li>I needed them right away or would have returned the item.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, if I order a pack of 2 for $10.43 it cost more for the replacement heads than to buy a whole new tooth brush?</li>
      <li>This is my first time buying replacement heads from amazon and will not do again.</li>
      <li>like many people only got 1.&lt;br</li>
      <li>By making the title a subject/verb complete sentence it serves to tell more info about the product, but ceases to be a clear descriptor of what you&#x27;ll be receiving.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep stocked up for the whole family.</li>
      <li>I explained that a $10 refund would make the 8 brush heads I received cost more than I could have purchased these same items at the local Whole Foods Market.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush bristles are soft and the head is so large that it makes it easier to brush all areas of your mouth.</li>
      <li>These brush heads really ARE soft.  </li>
      <li>First, the multiple images are misleading as they suggest that you&#x27;ll receive three 2-packs.</li>
      <li>it clearly says (3 units)but</li>
      <li>Plus, it is one of the few dental items available on the market that is still made in the USA.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Soft 2-pack FITS (emphasis added)</li>
      <li>/&gt;2 of: Radius Replacement Heads, Soft 2-pack (3 units)</li>
      <li>Radius Replacement Heads, Soft 2-pack (3 units) ...</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t last too long, and they are too soft for me.  </li>

<li> They don&#x27;t last too long, and they are too soft for me.  </li>
<li> As the other reviewers have written, when purchasing this item online it had the description of 3 packs of soft replacement toothbrush heads (each pack with 2 heads).</li>
<li> meaning that if you actually received 6 (3 units of a 2 pack &#x3D; 6) SOOOOO after a long debate with customer service</li>
<li> I usually use a soft head on a regular toothbrush or an Oral B.  </li>
<li> Note that this is for a single 2-pack replacement head set.</li>
<li> Note that this is for a single 2-pack replacement head set.</li>
<li> Source Toothbrushes\\&quot; does not adequately clarify that they are selling only a single 2-pack.</li>
<li> Well, a few weeks later, I received a box with 8 brush heads [4 x 2-packs].</li>
<li> I spent another 90 minutes on the phone with customer service asking that they please send me what was promised.</li>
<li> So after an extremely long and unnecessary episode on the phone, I finally got Amazon to agree to send me the remaining brush heads, which took another three weeks to arrive.</li>
<li> I explained that I expected them to honor our agreement and to send me the missing product as advertised.</li>
<li> Again, I explained that the refund offer was unfair and that I expected them to honor the initial agreement as I had already paid them for 24 brush heads.</li>
<li> This is a well made product and also prevents the need to replace your toothbrush every few months.</li>
<li> rated this low since it is false advertising on two accounts.</li>
<li> It has been difficult locating a decent price for these replacement heads lately.</li>
<li> (I love the toothbrush, just hate the false adverstising.)  </li>
<li> They initially asked me to accept an unfair refund of $10 for the inconvenience.</li>
<li> I was pretty disappointed when I received 1 pack of 2.</li>
<li> its so hard to find this in retailers.  </li>
<li> It leaves the number of sets very vague.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Note that this is for a single 2-pack replacement head set. You will only get a total of 2 heads per order, not 6 as depicted. Seller Misleads you.</li>
    <li> This is a well made product and also prevents the need to replace your toothbrush every few months. Plus, it is one of the few dental items available on the market that is still made in the USA. A win-win all around.</li>
    <li> Great product but deceptive advertising.  My order copied from my Amazon file:&lt;br /&gt;Items Ordered  Price&lt;br /&gt;2 of: Radius Replacement Heads, Soft 2-pack (3 units) [Health and Beauty]&lt;br /&gt;Condition: New&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Amazon.com LLC&lt;br /&gt; $10.48&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Prime: Two-Day Shipping is free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note it says &amp;#34;3 units&amp;#34;.  so I thought I was getting 3 units per pack.  Not so.  It&#x27;s 2 units per pack.  Now that they showed up I read the reviews and this has been going on for many months in spite of the complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should pay more attention to the reviews and fix the problem</li>
    <li> WARNING: As the other reviewers have written, when purchasing this item online it had the description of 3 packs of soft replacement toothbrush heads (each pack with 2 heads). I was pretty disappointed when I received 1 pack of 2. I feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful toothbrush. It has been difficult locating a decent price for these replacement heads lately. When I noticed that Amazon had the best value, I chatted online with customer service to ensure that for each [quantity of one] I would be purchasing of this item, that I would be receiving a total of six brush heads [3 units x 2-packs &#x3D; 6 brush heads] as advertised. So I placed my order for 4 items [24 brush heads] to cover my family for the year. Well, a few weeks later, I received a box with 8 brush heads [4 x 2-packs]. I spent another 90 minutes on the phone with customer service asking that they please send me what was promised. They initially asked me to accept an unfair refund of $10 for the inconvenience. I explained that a $10 refund would make the 8 brush heads I received cost more than I could have purchased these same items at the local Whole Foods Market. I explained that I expected them to honor our agreement and to send me the missing product as advertised. So they offered a slightly greater unfair refund. Again, I explained that the refund offer was unfair and that I expected them to honor the initial agreement as I had already paid them for 24 brush heads. So after an extremely long and unnecessary episode on the phone, I finally got Amazon to agree to send me the remaining brush heads, which took another three weeks to arrive. So it goes without saying that when I&#x27;m done with these brush heads, I&#x27;m switching to the more effective Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush, and I will not be doing any more business with Amazon. I recommend Lucky Vitamin or Vitacost as they provide excellent customer service, free shipping options, and low prices.</li>
    <li> Great product for trying to save the environment....</li>
    <li> best toothbrush system ive ever used.  best customer service ive ever had.  my dentist had never seen it he loved it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy that you now have replacement heads available for my favorite toothbrush.  My dental exams have been excellent since I&#x27;be been using this toothbrush.  Don&#x27;t tell the dentist; he&#x27;ll be sure to put a stop the production of them!  Thank you, Amazon, for making these available - and still made in the USA!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Only toothbrush I will ever use!  Love it!  They feel so nice to brush with!  Recommend them!  I&#x27;ll keep stocked up for the whole family.</li>
    <li> its so hard to find this in retailers.  either they sell them all &amp; dont re-order or they never order them.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so great to just buy them here at a cheaper price!</li>
    <li> I love radius toothbrushes. This is my first time buying replacement heads from amazon and will not do again. The item lists a 3 pack of two per package brush heads. Instead I only received one. I needed them right away or would have returned the item.</li>
    <li> Note that this is for a single 2-pack replacement head set. You will only get a total of 2 heads per order, not 6 as depicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product, itself, is great! Head feels comfortable in mouth. The Source and Intelligent handles that they fit are very comfortable to hold in either the right or left hand. It&#x27;s so nice to save plastic by reusing the substantial handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this low since it is false advertising on two accounts. First, the multiple images are misleading as they suggest that you&#x27;ll receive three 2-packs. Secondly, the wording is misleading. \\&quot;Soft 2-pack FITS (emphasis added) Intelligent &amp; Source Toothbrushes\\&quot; does not adequately clarify that they are selling only a single 2-pack. By making the title a subject/verb complete sentence it serves to tell more info about the product, but ceases to be a clear descriptor of what you&#x27;ll be receiving. It leaves the number of sets very vague. I phoned Amazon today, and  they will be requiring Vitamin Answer to specify the number of units and hopefully adjust the image accordingly, as well. Hopefully, my review here will soon be moot. But, in the meantime, this is important info to know!</li>
    <li> The toothbrush bristles are soft and the head is so large that it makes it easier to brush all areas of your mouth.</li>
    <li> I also fell for the image that showed 3 packages and the 3-pack logo.  I won&#x27;t order these again, even though I can no longer find them locally.  (I love the toothbrush, just hate the false adverstising.)  I usually happy with my Amazon purchases, and would return these if it weren&#x27;t so much trouble.</li>
    <li> The only tooth brush I will ever use</li>
    <li> Radius Replacement Heads, Soft 2-pack (3 units) ...DO YOU SEE THAT ? it clearly says (3 units)but like many people only got 1.&lt;br /&gt;So, if I order a pack of 2 for $10.43 it cost more for the replacement heads than to buy a whole new tooth brush? Tho, the page reads $10.43 ($1.74 / Count) meaning that if you actually received 6 (3 units of a 2 pack &#x3D; 6) SOOOOO after a long debate with customer service they want me to ship back one unit to re-send me 3...I Hope.</li>
    <li> These brush heads really ARE soft.  They don&#x27;t last too long, and they are too soft for me.  I just don&#x27;t feel as though my teeth get as clean with these.  I usually use a soft head on a regular toothbrush or an Oral B.  But the handles that carry/hold these heads are WAY cool!</li>
    <li> The only thing that makes the best toothbrush ever better is this: replaceable heads so you don&#x27;t have to keep making garbage with the discarded handle. Buy the toothbrush, then buy these. This is the best!</li>
