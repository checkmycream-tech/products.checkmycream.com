### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>IBD is the best brand for gel nail creations!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>very good quality  and texture</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t stay on very good.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color selections  </li>
      <li>The Gel Top Coat is very nice.</li>
      <li>will be buying more!</li>
      <li>love!</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and gives the color a vey nice sheen.</li>
      <li>It took about 3 minutes to fully cure this top coat instead of the 30 seconds they said.</li>
      <li>So I will be trying a better brand.</li>
      <li>I tried to use this top coat over my regular polish which does work perfectly with the CND Topcoat.</li>
      <li>love how it fills in around my stones or pearls</li>
      <li>My favorite color of all time is &amp;#34;she&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I gave a two, I think its okay to used it.</li>
      <li>It dries fast under a UV lamp and stays on great when cured correctly.</li>
      <li>I have had IBD gel put on at the salons before and it works just as good as the harmony gelish brand and soooooo much cheaper!</li>
      <li>The topcoat was shiny and seemed fine</li>
      <li>Ibd polish is fine though.</li>
      <li>This seems to work well with my UV light for my gel nail kit.</li>
      <li>I put my finger under the uv light for like 5 min, but It is still liquid.</li>
      <li>I use a LED light</li>
      <li>but it was fast shipping. :)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just as full.</li>
      <li>This top coat works really well.</li>
      <li>I was very please with the price of this product and how quickly I was able to get it in the mail.</li>
      <li>Other than that it is a great product for at home gel manicures</li>
      <li>Cures quickly, but the finish is not as shiny as I would like.</li>
      <li>of bottles is adequate.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and makes the polish really shiny when done.</li>
      <li>This top coat does not dry with a gel lamp and</li>
      <li>I will try it again, but first try was a No Go.</li>
      <li>Nice glossy finish as expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel nails for a year and a half</li>
      <li>It certainly is cheaper than the others.  </li>
      <li>This top coat is great, it is strong and shiny and is less expensive than many of the other brands.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>but I dont have much to compare it to.</li>
      <li>and it really helped make my wife&#x27;s gel nails pop.</li>
      <li>This bottle is a good bit larger than the other gel topcoats that I have bought.  </li>
      <li>I will be honest in my review and say that the lamp I use is from Sephora and I am not sure if maybe that has something to do with it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to all nail gel fans.</li>
      <li>Kind of dull.</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time last night and it was thin enough to go on well and dried perfectly with my UV light.</li>
      <li>had the polish completely peel off.</li>
      <li>Brought to my spa and had it put on by a professional.</li>
      <li>I have tried this top coat and base coat , IBD on my own nails two times before applying on my customers at my nail salon.</li>
      <li>I love IBD polishes for color, but the top and base coat do not preform as well as the Gelish brand.</li>
      <li>you want your hands under this light as little as possible so even then, it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
      <li>and i know how to treat natural nails for long- enough- lasting- gel color</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Beautiful color selections  Ease of application.  Durability and maintains appearance.  My favorite color of all time is &amp;#34;she&#x27;s blushing&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Size of bottles is adequate.</li>
    <li> I have tried this top coat and base coat , IBD on my own nails two times before applying on my customers at my nail salon. 1st apply: came off after about 2 days. 2nd apply flied away after faster than previous trying. I do nail for living and i know how to treat natural nails for long- enough- lasting- gel color but i gave my hands up with the IBD base and top coat gel products.</li>
    <li> It is a little longer to dry but all polish takes time. love how it fills in around my stones or pearls I add to my polished nails. I recommend this sealer</li>
    <li> This top coat is great, it is strong and shiny and is less expensive than many of the other brands. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Cures quickly, but the finish is not as shiny as I would like. I Will be trying another brand. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This top coat does not dry with a gel lamp and even a few days later it still feels tacky. I definantly will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I did my mothers and my nieces nails using all IBD products and I was so ashamed as the next day I saw my niece 4 of her nails had the polish completely peel off. The next day it began happening to my mother as well. I will be honest in my review and say that the lamp I use is from Sephora and I am not sure if maybe that has something to do with it.</li>
    <li> I gave a two, I think its okay to used it. but they don&#x27;t stayed on the nail longer than other gel brands.  but it was fast shipping. :)</li>
    <li> This top coat works really well. It goes on smoothly and makes the polish really shiny when done. It dries fast under a UV lamp and stays on great when cured correctly.</li>
    <li> Although my daughter&#x27;s gel manicure falls off an hour later, mine stays. I have had mine on a week. However, it&#x27;s not as shiny as I would like. Kind of dull. I even tried another coat of the op coat the next day and it&#x27;s just as full. So I will be trying a better brand.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on very good. Nails chipped the very next day! Gelish or shellac never does that! Ibd polish is fine though.</li>
    <li> Not to long ago I discovered jel nail polish at my salon but it is expensive. Now I can do them at home.</li>
    <li> The topcoat was shiny and seemed fine but the whole manicure peeled off within hours (I mostly blame the base coat) so I&#x27;m not a fan of this line.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, doesn&#x27;t stick to nails. Brought to my spa and had it put on by a professional. Polish lifted and came off a few days later.</li>
    <li> I put my finger under the uv light for like 5 min, but It is still liquid.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it was not a high glossy shine I expected.</li>
    <li> I saw this brand and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It certainly is cheaper than the others.  I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel nails for a year and a half so it isn&#x27;t my application technique.  I tried three different times letting it cure under different times.  It peels off within hours.  Don&#x27;t buy it!  If, in fact, it IS a longer cure time- you want your hands under this light as little as possible so even then, it&#x27;s not worth it.  Bad product- cheap price.</li>
    <li> I was very please with the price of this product and how quickly I was able to get it in the mail. The only complaint I have is that it says cure for 30 seconds using LED nail lamp. It took about 3 minutes to fully cure this top coat instead of the 30 seconds they said. Other than that it is a great product for at home gel manicures</li>
    <li> After visiting other beauty supply stores I found this online and it really helped make my wife&#x27;s gel nails pop. She likes this a lot.</li>
    <li> I have used Gelish at home since last October and never had a nail peel off.  I thought I&#x27;d save some money and get IBD for the base and top coats.  All of my nails kept peeling off.  I kept redoing them as a nail would fall of then finally after 3 days of that I just took them all off and redid my nails with my Gelish base and top.  I can still use the IBD colors but not the base and top coats.  I use a LED light and I also have a UV light and both failed to keep the nails on longer than a day.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this top coat over my regular polish which does work perfectly with the CND Topcoat. But this one was sticky and not at all set. Came off in icky sticky pieces. I will try it again, but first try was a No Go.</li>
    <li> I have had IBD gel put on at the salons before and it works just as good as the harmony gelish brand and soooooo much cheaper! love! will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Great product! IBD is the best brand for gel nail creations! I highly recommend it to all nail gel fans.</li>
    <li> The Gel Top Coat is very nice. It goes on easy and gives the color a vey nice sheen. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I got it on time! very good quality  and texture, I recomand it. it stays on foe atleast a week</li>
    <li> This bottle is a good bit larger than the other gel topcoats that I have bought.  I tried it for the first time last night and it was thin enough to go on well and dried perfectly with my UV light.</li>
    <li> This seems to work well with my UV light for my gel nail kit. It think it helps make them stronger but I dont have much to compare it to.</li>
    <li> Does not adhere well, peels off in a day or two.</li>
    <li> I love IBD polishes for color, but the top and base coat do not preform as well as the Gelish brand.</li>
    <li> Nice glossy finish as expected. May be user error, but it does get some thick chunky spots.</li>
