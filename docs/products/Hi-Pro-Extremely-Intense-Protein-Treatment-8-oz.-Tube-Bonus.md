      <li>It&#x27;s amazing and smells even better.</li>
      <li>This leaves your hair feeling soft and healthy!!!</li>
      <li>I have been thru so many products</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>but make sure you don&#x27;t use more than 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Satisfied</li>
      <li>I also wanted to dye my hair (yet again) and thought this protein treatment would help the color absorb more since my hair does not seem to take on color well anymore.</li>
      <li>and I love it as a detangler.</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>my hair looks so healthy and shiny</li>

      <li>so moisturized yet strong.</li>
      <li>first protein treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried on my own</li>
      <li>This is the best hair conditioner for black women.  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
      <li>I have been using this treatment for a couple of weeks now and it makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>My hair felt great after using it and a week later it is still manageable.</li>
      <li>It gives me silky smooth hair with none of the weight.  </li>
      <li>A good buy for my natural hair sistas looking for protein treatments</li>
      <li>Love this product so much.</li>
      <li>Cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>The 3 things this intense protein treatment promises are accurate.</li>
      <li>This treatment leaves my hair so soft, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>my hair was so soft and completely healthy after using the product.</li>
      <li>I believe it&#x27;s helping me maintain my healthy hair after a professional color change.</li>
      <li>I only use it twice a week because too much protein isn&#x27;t good for the hair.</li>
      <li>It works great on my african American kinky 4C hair.</li>
      <li>But overall its great especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if I use just the treatment my hair feels super straight and has no movement afterwards.</li>
      <li>saw a difference in the hair in  the sink after the first use, smells wonderful and for a protein treatment does not leave your hair hard but soft and moisturized, looking forward to the coming weeks and months using this product, have also seen some hair growth.</li>
      <li>Now I normally don;t write review just because its a pain in the butt, but this product is totally worth it!</li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t the thickest (which is my goal) but after this treatment my hair feels not only thicker but more manageable.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time tonight.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth every penny and shipped pretty fast as well.</li>
      <li>but I will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
      <li>Simply put, I love this prodct.</li>
      <li>One that was recommended and works great is Rusk/Fermodyl treatment vials and their other products in the same treatment line.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying a full sized product!</li>
      <li>Really seems to help with the breakage my hair has been going thru.</li>
      <li>It came in really fast..</li>
      <li>I feel like this product doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair.</li>
      <li>, don&#x27;t remember this much alcohol in the ingredients.</li>
      <li>but it really ruined my hair</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this protein treatment.</li>
      <li>If you really need protein this may not be what you need.</li>
      <li>This Hi-Pro is good if you simply need moisture and not much restructuring.</li>
      <li>Redken Extreme works better.</li>
      <li>sometimes what works for one person doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for another, but I really believe this will help a lot, this will be on the top of my list for a protein conditioner, in fact; it&#x27;s the only one my hair loves, I didn&#x27;t even have to do a moisture treatment after this.</li>
      <li>Well, I have to say it knocked me for a loop, my hair came out extremely soft, and the detangling was a breeze which is very rare, btw, we in the natural hair community usually use numbers and letters to describe our hair but for me I switch the numbers around because I have more type 4 hair than 3</li>
      <li>After the first use I saw a major difference.</li>
      <li>and although I didn&#x27;t feel the difference at first, within a couple weeks I did see a huge difference in the softness of my dried out ends.</li>
      <li>It really our hair really soft..</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and very shiny.</li>
      <li>Works magic on my 4b natural African American hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has been great for my damaged hair.  Loved being a platinum blond but it really ruined my hair and it was literally melting.  I&#x27;ve tried heaps of different hair products and will come back to this one.  Using it has made such a huge difference that I have stopped considering cutting all my long hair and just let it grow out.</li>
    <li> Good price and good product!</li>
    <li> I received this product in my curlkit. I looooveed it. My hair looooooved it. I have natural hair and this treatment made my hair so soft and shiny. My braid out never looked so good. A good buy for my natural hair sistas looking for protein treatments</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this protein treatment. Never before have I had a protein treatment leave my hair so moisturized yet strong. I have naturally curly hair (3C/4A) and would definitely recommend this to other naturals. I sent this to a friend who has tighter hair then mines and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I used to product on both my daughter and my self... .. It really our hair really soft.. Will take a while to see results... It came in really fast.. Satisfied</li>
    <li> I have been using this treatment for a couple of weeks now and it makes a huge difference. I have all over color and highlights not to mention damaged hair. After the first use I saw a major difference. This treatment leaves my hair so soft, shiny and healthy looking. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either! I have been thru so many products but I will be buying more of this in the future. I love this and will be giving it as Christmas gifts to all my favorite girls!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. If you really need protein this may not be what you need.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Will buy again . I was told not to use it more than once every few weeks. But it did the job &amp; I love it, I also use this brands keritin treatment works wonders on my hair love it.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair that LOVES protein and this treatment was AMAZING! I also received it in the July curlkit and am glad they put it in there! My curls popped and and my hair was so soft! I will definitely be buying a full sized product!</li>
    <li> This has made a massive difference with my natural hair. The first time I used this, my hair instantly responded. My curls were super defined and I had less shed hair. Simply put, I love this prodct.</li>
    <li> Awesome, great product. 100% recommended</li>
    <li> Great conditioner! Gave my hair a lot of strength.</li>
    <li> Works magic on my 4b natural African American hair. Smells amazing and I love it as a detangler. I&#x27;ve been using for 6 months now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying this product, since it&#x27;s the only thing that heals my hear when I damage it. If you have dry hair emergency, this is it! Even though most hair protein products smell bad, this one has a strong, perfume like smell. I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day but a few times a week is enough to bring my hair back to life.</li>
    <li> I believe it&#x27;s helping me maintain my healthy hair after a professional color change.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time tonight. My hair is soft and very shiny. I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Now I normally don;t write review just because its a pain in the butt, but this product is totally worth it! I have coarse, thick curly hair which means I have a lot of hair and the individual strands are thick… which means my hair requires a ton of moisture in order to not frizz. As a weekly treatment this product smooths my strands and leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny without weighing it down! Definitely worth every penny and shipped pretty fast as well.</li>
    <li> This product is very good...  It gives me silky smooth hair with none of the weight.  I love this stuff and will be using again!</li>
    <li> A bad hairdresser fried my hair and I had to have three color corrections done to get it back to a human color. My hair was breaking off around the front and felt like straw. I used this one time and immediately noticed a difference in the texture--I was skeptical that anything could help me, but this product was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend this if your hair is extremely damaged or even if you just want smoother hair. I have baby fine hair and this didn&#x27;t overly weigh mine down. Cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> saw a difference in the hair in  the sink after the first use, smells wonderful and for a protein treatment does not leave your hair hard but soft and moisturized, looking forward to the coming weeks and months using this product, have also seen some hair growth.</li>
    <li> My hair is damaged because of all the chemicals I put in it.  Looks 100 times better.</li>
    <li> I first received a sample of this in a Curlkit subscription box, it came in a little packet, I didn&#x27;t think much of it but I still tried, now I was thinking one this packet won&#x27;t be enough for all the thick (type 4/3) hair and two, how intense can it really be.  Well, I have to say it knocked me for a loop, my hair came out extremely soft, and the detangling was a breeze which is very rare, btw, we in the natural hair community usually use numbers and letters to describe our hair but for me I switch the numbers around because I have more type 4 hair than 3 and I don&#x27;t pay much attention to the letter part, just a personal preference, anyway; I would really suggest people giving this a try, it is amazing especially if you have really thick course hair that&#x27;s brittle and hard to detangle.  Just remember everyone&#x27;s hair has it&#x27;s own personality and sometimes what works for one person doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for another, but I really believe this will help a lot, this will be on the top of my list for a protein conditioner, in fact; it&#x27;s the only one my hair loves, I didn&#x27;t even have to do a moisture treatment after this.</li>
    <li> Best deep conditioner !! They used it at my school and I loved it :)</li>
    <li> This is the best hair conditioner for black women.  I love it my hair was so soft and completely healthy after using the product.</li>
    <li> Used the Hi PRO Pac sample in the July kit and I am in love! The 3 things this intense protein treatment promises are accurate. This treatment changed my 4C low porosity hair to normal porosity. I only had to use a tablespoon of conditioner instead of the usual 1/2 cup or more for this wash n go. My hair is absorbing product and I won&#x27;t be stuck in the house waiting for the conditioner to not be white. This is my best hair day to date since being natural.</li>
    <li> I loved this product!  It was a great find.  I have been using it ever since.  My over processed hair drinks it in.</li>
    <li> Nice size for the money, but I didn&#x27;t realize it had so much alcohol in it, purchased this at beauty supply stores in the past, don&#x27;t remember this much alcohol in the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Nice slip on my texlaxed hair. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually strengthens but my hair has no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Not that great I see &amp; feel no difference. Redken Extreme works better.</li>
    <li> This helped some, but i&#x27;ve had condtioners/treatments in the past that lent a bit more qualitly to the end results. One that was recommended and works great is Rusk/Fermodyl treatment vials and their other products in the same treatment line. This Hi-Pro is good if you simply need moisture and not much restructuring. But for the truly porous hair such as mine crying &#x27;help&#x27;, you will need something with more ommph.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;I have a pool and this brings back soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;Yep, no more straw pool hair for us!&lt;br /&gt;Love this!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My mom gave me samples for this so I already knew how great it worked! It&#x27;s amazing and smells even better. But my package arrived very damaged with holes in it, hopefully next time it won&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every expensive conditioner and hair treatment in the book, but I keep coming back to this one for my very delicate, fine curly hair. I use it as a leave-in conditioner at the end of my shower and barely need any styling gel. It leaves my hair super-soft and takes away most of the hated frizz. It seems great for my scalp, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent for hair that cannot be easily combed after a shampoo. Helped solve the dryness problem which was very serious</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it about once a week and although I didn&#x27;t feel the difference at first, within a couple weeks I did see a huge difference in the softness of my dried out ends. I would def purchase again especially for the price.</li>
    <li> it made my hair straw like</li>
    <li> My formula for that vixen Asian hair: Moisturize everyday except once a week, let this stuff soak in. Makes your hair stronger and less frail. Go forth and pretend you&#x27;re in some hair product commercial.</li>
    <li> I use this product with the moisture treatment. the combination of both makes my relaxed hair soft  and cuts down on the breakage.</li>
    <li> This is so good. My hair felt great after using it and a week later it is still manageable. My hair is super dry so it works for me.</li>
    <li> didnt see any difference... but it smelled nice</li>
    <li> Really seems to help with the breakage my hair has been going thru. It&#x27;s a nice heavy and deep conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> This leaves your hair feeling soft and healthy!!!</li>
    <li> Is excellent, leave my hair very conditioned, and soft, incredible I just use 1 time, and I feel the difference.</li>
    <li> This treatment does work, but I like to apply my regular conditioner afterwards. Otherwise, if I use just the treatment my hair feels super straight and has no movement afterwards. In my experience it works great in combination with conditioner.</li>
    <li> I feel like this product doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair. It has a nice scent to it, but after reading all the reviews and taking a shot at this product, I can honestly say that I feel and see no difference in my hair. However, this result may vary for some people. I dye my hair A TON and only purchased this product after I left a salon because the hair stylist told me how dry my hair was. I also wanted to dye my hair (yet again) and thought this protein treatment would help the color absorb more since my hair does not seem to take on color well anymore. All in all, it didn&#x27;t work, but that&#x27;s just for me!</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well on bleach-damaged hair. It saved my hair.</li>
    <li> Lovee this deep conditioner!!! I used to work at a beauty supply and we used to sell the individual packs never knew there were bottles im so happy i found it!</li>
    <li> Love this product so much. It works great on my african American kinky 4C hair. My hair isn&#x27;t the thickest (which is my goal) but after this treatment my hair feels not only thicker but more manageable. Also I was experiencing severe shedding and now that I&#x27;ve started using this after three treatments I barely shed any hair. I&#x27;m so happy! I use a lot of moisturizer and oil after I use it because protein can make hair dry and brittle. I only use it twice a week because too much protein isn&#x27;t good for the hair. But overall its great especially for the price. BUY IT.</li>
    <li> best product for bleach over damaged hair</li>
    <li> Excellent! It has made my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Great but make sure you don&#x27;t use more than 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair. With continued use, I have definitely noticed an increase in the strength of my relaxed hair. I try to use it twice a month, and before and after I chemically treat my hair. Also, it smells great (not too strong).</li>
    <li> Great company to order from, this stuff is great my hair looks so healthy and shiny</li>
    <li> first protein treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried on my own and I will probably stick with this product</li>
</ol>
