      <li>This product is wonderful, it is so easy to apply !</li>

      <li>I LOVE IT !</li>
      <li>Amazing quality</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice pencil, but she said it&#x27;s bulletproof even in the waterline.</li>
      <li>This seems like an ok product.</li>
      <li>I love amazon.com.</li>
      <li>so this is the best way to buy it because otherwise it is only offered in a set with another color.  </li>
      <li>This is maybe &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; but this eyeliner runs and smudges even on top of eye lids</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>I love Mally&#x27;s eye liner.</li>
      <li>and I loved it so much I rushed out and bought it online.</li>
      <li>GOES ON EASY.</li>
      <li>It does glide on smoothly.</li>
      <li>but I decided to sway from the norm and try Mally&#x27;s products because I had heard such great reviews.</li>
      <li>Mally is such a great product.  </li>
      <li>Great lasting product, but the product kept coming out of the casing</li>
      <li>Also it has to be applied to an oil free eyes or else</li>
      <li>It is very black and looks great!</li>
      <li>I originally received this eyeliner in a sample pack.</li>
      <li>You must wait for pencil to set  for about 10 minutes to get full effects.  </li>
      <li>I love mally, this eyeliner is so butter soft</li>
      <li>price was also just right.</li>
      <li>this pencil works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Price is excellent in comparison to my past purchases ( of different products)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a reasonable value</li>
      <li>This liner applies smoothly and last until removed.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tested it too much.</li>
      <li>and I really hope Mally continues to make this one.</li>
      <li>it is so gentle on the lash line.</li>
      <li>This pencil is nice because it stays on all day, but if you press to firmly applying the lead will break off.  </li>
      <li>The color is the most intense black I have found.  </li>
      <li>This stays put all day long and it glides on smooth.  </li>
      <li>To me it looked more like a dark charcoal.</li>
      <li>I love this pencil and wear it everyday!  </li>
      <li>This eyeliner stays wherever I put it and looks the exact same</li>
      <li>I first tried the regular pencil, purchased from QVC, but I didn&#x27;t like having to deal with sharpening.</li>
      <li>; eyeliner is better valuem at least it stays put.</li>
      <li>This winds up completely off the lower lashline and under the eyes racoon-style.</li>
      <li>So far I have purchased about 10 of these.  </li>
      <li>Not so, it didn&#x27;t even last 10 minutes on my waterline, and that was THE main reason I bought it for.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>and I only use the black, so thanks!</li>
      <li>I am pretty predictable with the makeup brand that I use</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I always see Mally&#x27;s stuff on QVC and wanted to try something of hers. I decided to start with something small. This seems like an ok product. I haven&#x27;t tested it too much. I played with it a little on my hand. It does glide on smoothly. I only gave it three stars because the black wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;blackest black\\&quot;. To me it looked more like a dark charcoal. I guess I was expected it to be almost like a black marker.</li>
    <li> I wear contacts so I need an eyeliner that does not come off on them.  I line the inside of my eyelids and this pencil works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I am the world&#x27;s worst for having eyeliner end up under my eyes and looking like a raccoon by the end of the day.  This eyeliner stays wherever I put it and looks the exact same no matter what the day brings.  Even after working out and sweating this stuff does not move! For that I give it five stars!  I also only use black so this is the best way to buy it because otherwise it is only offered in a set with another color.  It is very black and looks great!</li>
    <li> Been using Mally for a couple of years.  No tugging at the eye area and gives a great line.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I originally received this eyeliner in a sample pack. I struggle to find an eyeliner that didn&#x27;t end up under my eyes after. A few hours. This one even stays when I use it on the inside rims.</li>
    <li> I love mally, this eyeliner is so butter soft it is so gentle on the lash line. Plus it does not smear on the lower lash line. Amazing quality and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used and all the hype is true!!!</li>
    <li> I love this pencil and wear it everyday!  It is creamy and basically waterproof.  The color is the most intense black I have found.  It does not fade, chip or run and does not &#x27;pull&#x27; when you apply it.  I bought two and they arrived within 2 days! Currently the only other way to purchase this is in combination with another color and I only use the black, so thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice pencil, but she said it&#x27;s bulletproof even in the waterline. Not so, it didn&#x27;t even last 10 minutes on my waterline, and that was THE main reason I bought it for. My search for the perfect eyeliner for the waterline goes on. Overpriced for a \\&quot;bullet proof\\&quot; eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.  Mally products are very good.  Lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t pull when applying.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This pencil is nice because it stays on all day, but if you press to firmly applying the lead will break off.  You must wait for pencil to set  for about 10 minutes to get full effects.  Also it has to be applied to an oil free eyes or else it will not act as an all day waterproof pencil. Pencil last only about a month if you use it daily and that has been MY experience.  So far I have purchased about 10 of these.  Too expensive, but if you want it...you have to pay.</li>
    <li> I was sold on Mally until this one came. Now I am going back to Sisley and/or Lancome eyeliners. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am pretty predictable with the makeup brand that I use but I decided to sway from the norm and try Mally&#x27;s products because I had heard such great reviews. Well, the product didn&#x27;t disappoint. It IS a little pricey but I do like it.</li>
    <li> I love Mally&#x27;s eye liner. I first tried the regular pencil, purchased from QVC, but I didn&#x27;t like having to deal with sharpening. So I was delighted to find out she had an automatic eye liner. The product is soft and glides on nicely, no tugging. You can&#x27;t get a precision point, if you want that then may I suggest a cake or liquid liner. This liner stays on until you take it off. I like the jet black color to line my upper inner lids and then I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara if I don&#x27;t feel like it. It&#x27;s a reasonable value and I really hope Mally continues to make this one. The seller sent the product in a timely manner and it was well packaged. I will buy from this seller again. I love amazon.com. Thank you.</li>
    <li> THIS EYE LINER IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED. IT STAYS ON ALL DAY AND LOOKS JUST AS GOOD AT THE END OF MY WORK DAY AS IT DID IN THE BEGINNING. GOES ON EASY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  Mally is such a great product.  This eyeliner looks as good when I take it off, as it did when I put it on.  No refreshing necessary.</li>
    <li> Great lasting product, but the product kept coming out of the casing</li>
    <li> My sister recommend this to me and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;The price was also just right. I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product.</li>
    <li> I have used eye liners that claim to be waterproof  . This product is wonderful, it is so easy to apply ! Price is excellent in comparison to my past purchases ( of different products) I would suggest everyone to try it. I LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> Not waterproof or smudgeproof as claims.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Not suggest this product to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Can not use.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me a sample of Mally&#x27;s eyeliner and I loved it so much I rushed out and bought it online. I&#x27;ve searched for years for smudgeproof eyeliner because I was always guaranteed to look like a raccoon by the end of the day. This stays put all day long and it glides on smooth.  I&#x27;m recommending it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> This is maybe &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; but this eyeliner runs and smudges even on top of eye lids&lt;br /&gt;A &amp;#34;covergirl&amp;#34; eyeliner is better valuem at least it stays put.</li>
    <li> This liner applies smoothly and last until removed. It does not smudge, and can be applied in a thin or thicker line.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is not bulletproof, waterproof, or smudgeproof.  I read the reviews here but should have looked on qvc.com. There are lots of negative reviews on this eyeliner there.  This winds up completely off the lower lashline and under the eyes racoon-style. Awful.</li>
