      <li>she already told me to make sure I order her another bottle for Xmas!</li>
      <li>...and had to get more!  </li>
      <li>I really liked it.</li>
      <li>I just stick to applying near the ends where breakage and dryness occur most and its working perfectly</li>
      <li>Better than any mousse or gel I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I pried the top off and have just been scooping the gel out.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so smooth a touchable in this humid weather!</li>

      <li>I love this stuff.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with these bottles, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a fluke.</li>

      <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product smells great and  makes my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Got a sample at the salon and had to buy a full size!  </li>
      <li>I bought this because my hairstylist used this, but the smell is really strong.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair cut in a chin length, layered bob -</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m kind of used to it, but I still really dislike the fragrance</li>
      <li>Fortunately, the smell goes away and you don&#x27;t smell it all day (or perhaps you just get used to it),</li>
      <li>Aside from those issues, this is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Unlike gels / foams that just help with styling, this also makes my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 of this, because I originally bought it at a salon....on the recommendation of the stylist.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special about this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and my hair is so much softer, easier to manage and is in better shape.  </li>
      <li>I loved it, and when I could find it for 1/2 the price on amazon, I ordered 2 and got a low shipping rate for both.  </li>
      <li>Use just a little bit on damp hair, and your style will hold beautifully with no frizz.  </li>
      <li>KMS California Free Shape Hot Flex Creme.</li>
      <li>thanks!!</li>
      <li>This product makes my curly hair very sleek and smooth....</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is, hands down, the best product I have used to protect my hair from almost daily blow-outs and straightening iron use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but when I first started using it, I&#x27;d have to breathe through my mouth when putting it on my hair.</li>
      <li>I also use a tiny bit to spread on top as a smoothing pomade.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get any creme out of the container when I first opened.</li>
      <li>My beautician first used this on me in her shop.  </li>
      <li>3RD ORDER SHOULD I SAY MORE?</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t stay as moist but allows more curl than Flat Out.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not awful, and it doesn&#x27;t linger once your hair is dry.</li>
      <li>Now I have to go back for more instructions or a new can.</li>
      <li>This is quite a bit more than I believe many people would use on hair this length, but I have tried to use less and it doesn&#x27;t seem to control the frizz as well in lesser</li>
      <li>We used this for quite awhile but didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in our hair.  </li>
      <li>Thanks KMS</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t really see any difference in how my hair responded and ended up with a headache so probably won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair and this helps with keeping it straight.</li>
      <li>(while gently combing/brushing) and continue heat styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also seems to help prevent the color from fading due to so many washes.</li>
      <li>Very good product for thick and dry hair.</li>
      <li>Cannot blow dry my hair without KMS free shape gel.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to any one ...</li>
      <li>I found it on amazon at a far cheaper price than my over-priced salon, and it was delivered quickly at  a reasonable cost.  </li>
      <li>Cant live with out it .  </li>
      <li>I have curly hair that gets really frizzy, and this stuff and flat out work really well to soften the curls.</li>
      <li>Its amaxzing, for any one that has a natural friz, this is a must have!</li>
      <li>but good enough for my hair - long, color treated, not overly thick straight hair.</li>
      <li>last so much longer.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and only slightly wavy, but it&#x27;s dry and over processed from color.  </li>
      <li>Helps achieve desired look with heating tools, not too heavy or greasy and smells like cake ;)</li>
      <li>bottle is the first I&#x27;ve ordered by mail and the nozzle quit working after a few pumps.</li>
      <li>Tones my Indian hair down so much ...loving my hair texture since I have started using this product.</li>

<li> They stopped making Flat Out, so I tried this.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not wild about the smell</li>
<li> and it really helps tame it down.</li>
<li> hair has lots of body (read: FRIZZ); other products, when used in a quantity that actually controls the frizz and wave, make my hair look like I haven&#x27;t washed it in a week</li>
<li> That&#x27;s my experience, but I also have fairly hard water here, so that is the main cause of my frizzy hair.  </li>
<li> do not recommend ever using it on dry hair.</li>
<li> my hair is so dry from highlights</li>
<li> and I wash and dry it every day.</li>
<li> Dry</li>
<li> I have to use only so little of it to style my hair....</li>
<li> I work it into my frizzy-prone hair while it is wet</li>
<li> , even thought I&#x27;ve spent</li>
<li> She mentioned that this had happened to other patrons.</li>
<li> Just a little bit in your hand, mix it up in your hair, blow dry and your hair stays the way you want it to.</li>
<li> Yes, I&#x27;m very rough on my hair.  </li>
<li> so I can dry it and straighten it without it getting all dried out.</li>
<li> small amount goes a long way.</li>
<li> It  gives you a little body &amp; shine.</li>
<li> I am generous with it: I apply a minimum of 2-3 pumps when straightening my just-below-the-shoulder, very thick and somewhat coarse hair.</li>
<li> It is also a bit heavy on my hair.</li>

    <li> Nothing special about this product.</li>
    <li> ...and had to get more!  My hair is color treated and highlighted and I use my blow dryer and straightener.  Yes, I&#x27;m very rough on my hair.  But KMS Freeshape is AWESOME!  I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and my hair is so much softer, easier to manage and is in better shape.  Try it...you&#x27;ll love it.  (And it smells good too.)</li>
    <li> This product makes my curly hair very sleek and smooth....and it doesn&#x27;t make your hands sticky or greasy...I would order it again.. My hairdresser recommended it.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product! Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and will keep using it. I work it into my frizzy-prone hair while it is wet and it really helps tame it down. I also use a tiny bit to spread on top as a smoothing pomade. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is the first I&#x27;ve ordered by mail and the nozzle quit working after a few pumps. I pried the top off and have just been scooping the gel out. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with these bottles, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a fluke.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Got a sample at the salon and had to buy a full size!  Unlike gels / foams that just help with styling, this also makes my hair smooth and shiny.  Note: My hair is fine and only slightly wavy, but it&#x27;s dry and over processed from color.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Love the heat protectant , smells great</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this product.  Works amazing for controlling frizz, fly aways, etc.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of this, because I originally bought it at a salon....on the recommendation of the stylist.  I loved it, and when I could find it for 1/2 the price on amazon, I ordered 2 and got a low shipping rate for both.  I will definitely be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Just a little bit in your hand, mix it up in your hair, blow dry and your hair stays the way you want it to. I have wavy hair and this helps with keeping it straight. Not greasy either.</li>
    <li> Very good product for thick and dry hair. I use it with every wash. Makes my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> nothing earth shattering ... but good enough for my hair - long, color treated, not overly thick straight hair. small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> this product smells great and  makes my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  my hair is so dry from highlights so i am hoping it will help to protect it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just beware, like any hair product be careful if you apply too much or near the roots, it can get greasy.  I just stick to applying near the ends where breakage and dryness occur most and its working perfectly</li>
    <li> Works OK without being greasy, but it is not a miracle cure for frizz, it just helps somewhat.  That&#x27;s my experience, but I also have fairly hard water here, so that is the main cause of my frizzy hair.  Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hairstylist used this, but the smell is really strong.  I couldn&#x27;t really see any difference in how my hair responded and ended up with a headache so probably won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample from my hairdresser at Christmas time, and tried it.  What a difference it made on my hair!  It protects it from  humidity and my style last so much longer.  I found it on amazon at a far cheaper price than my over-priced salon, and it was delivered quickly at  a reasonable cost.  will order again!! thanks!!</li>
    <li> 3RD ORDER SHOULD I SAY MORE?</li>
    <li> I received a sample from my hair stylist that lasted only for two applications, but that was enough to make me go buy it. I have fine hair cut in a chin length, layered bob - and I wash and dry it every day. I love this product! It is weightless in your hair, yet protects it and leaves it bouncy and shiny after drying with a hair dryer. It also seems to help prevent the color from fading due to so many washes.</li>
    <li> Helps achieve desired look with heating tools, not too heavy or greasy and smells like cake ;)</li>
    <li> They stopped making Flat Out, so I tried this. I have curly hair that gets really frizzy, and this stuff and flat out work really well to soften the curls. This product doesn&#x27;t stay as moist but allows more curl than Flat Out. I&#x27;m mostly happy with this product, but I can&#x27;t stand the way it smells. Fortunately, the smell goes away and you don&#x27;t smell it all day (or perhaps you just get used to it), but when I first started using it, I&#x27;d have to breathe through my mouth when putting it on my hair. Now I&#x27;m kind of used to it, but I still really dislike the fragrance, it&#x27;s like sandalwood mixed with musk. Ew.</li>
    <li> Cannot blow dry my hair without KMS free shape gel. It is such a life saver. Tones my Indian hair down so much ...loving my hair texture since I have started using this product. I highly recommend this to any one ...esp ladies with thin and wavy hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One product I can&#x27;t do without ! Thanks KMS</li>
    <li> We used this for quite awhile but didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in our hair.  Probably would not order again.</li>
    <li> I fail to see the value in this product...and it has a very bad smell. It is also a bit heavy on my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it, no issues. she already told me to make sure I order her another bottle for Xmas!</li>
    <li> Love this Hair Product! Cant live with out it .  Its amaxzing, for any one that has a natural friz, this is a must have!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this and works in the beauty industry as a consultant.  I have to use only so little of it to style my hair....it is great stuff...</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic scent&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t coat or stick to my hair straightener&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make hair look greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t find at all salons (Amazon.com availability fixes that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, hands down, the best product I have used to protect my hair from almost daily blow-outs and straightening iron use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has lots of body (read: FRIZZ); other products, when used in a quantity that actually controls the frizz and wave, make my hair look like I haven&#x27;t washed it in a week and/or coat my straightening iron to the point that it pulls on my hair as I run my hair through it. Either way, I get frustrated and end up not using the product... so my hair still looks like cr@p, even thought I&#x27;ve spent $***.** on the cut, washing, conditioning, coloring and styling products. Grrrrrrrr!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter KMS California Free Shape Hot Flex Creme. It smells wonderful--my daughters love it. I am generous with it: I apply a minimum of 2-3 pumps when straightening my just-below-the-shoulder, very thick and somewhat coarse hair. This is quite a bit more than I believe many people would use on hair this length, but I have tried to use less and it doesn&#x27;t seem to control the frizz as well in lesser quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend ever using it on dry hair. I tried that one time and was embarrassed when I looked in the mirror at my friend&#x27;s house and saw hair stuck together with white, waxy clumps. Follow the directions and apply to damp hair. Dry (while gently combing/brushing) and continue heat styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the only cons i can think of have to do with cost and availability. Aside from those issues, this is a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Product is of good quality and as advertised. Great effect on hair. my wife has been using it for the past month.</li>
    <li> Second time I purchased this product and I couldn&#x27;t get any creme out of the container when I first opened. Brought the container b back to the beauty salon and one of the receptionists &amp;#34;monkeyed&amp;#34; with it and got it to work. She mentioned that this had happened to other patrons. Now I have to go back for more instructions or a new can. This will be the last time I purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so smooth a touchable in this humid weather! Love it!</li>
    <li> Use just a little bit on damp hair, and your style will hold beautifully with no frizz.  Better than any mousse or gel I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m not wild about the smell but it&#x27;s not awful, and it doesn&#x27;t linger once your hair is dry.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell good at all. I ordered it online because someone recommended it but next time I&#x27;m not ordering anything online that I haven&#x27;t smelled before. Otherwise it holds my curls ok. But I have to put a hairspray that masks the smell of this cream. Yuck!</li>
    <li> My beautician first used this on me in her shop.  I really liked it. It  gives you a little body &amp; shine. It smells good also. These were less expensive than the shop price.</li>
    <li> I have used this in my thick wavy hair for years.  It works great to keep my hair moisturized so I can dry it and straighten it without it getting all dried out.</li>
</ol>
