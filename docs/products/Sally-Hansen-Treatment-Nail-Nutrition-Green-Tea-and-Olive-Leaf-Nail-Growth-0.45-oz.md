      <li>The product is smooth too, I&#x27;ve tried other clear type nail polishes and they are bumpy and aren&#x27;t smooth.</li>
      <li>Keeps your nails strong and long</li>
      <li>Highly reccomended.</li>
      <li>I really like that it looks milky but goes on clear.  </li>

      <li>I bought this product because of my extremely short nails that are kinda too much of a joke to put nail polish on.</li>
      <li>Wish that would be fixed-</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any difference between this and regular clear nail polish.</li>
      <li>(my nails are naturally longer, but are fragile and have cracks from chipping away nail polish during my spare time)</li>
      <li>My nails were always so thin, and I&#x27;ve tried using top coats to not have my nails chip</li>

<li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have any unique effect at all, and after 3 coats it started chipping and peeling horribly.</li>
<li> I get the occasional peel in my nail but not as bad as it was before.</li>
<li> Not a good product for me.</li>
<li> I have really bad peeling nailand</li>
<li> I like rub in the product not wear it as a base coat</li>
<li> Terrible.</li>
<li> It has that nasty, almost nauseating smell that gives you a headache.</li>

    <li> Within a week, you could really see a change. My nails are much longer and thicker. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of my extremely short nails that are kinda too much of a joke to put nail polish on. I use this a lot and I find it to be great at making your nails stronger, I truly see no real difference in growth. The strengthening qualities are so good actually that when it starts to chip in the corner I can really see how brittle my nails are without it. Although I would love to give it 5 stars for that reason alone, I can&#x27;t because of the fact that my nails are the same length. Its not like a oil either where it soaks in, more like a polish. You can&#x27;t just keep layering it on. It does have a beautiful light peachish colour to it though. I would recommend that if you wear nail polish over it, you only put one coat of this on because it tends to chip with too many.</li>
    <li> My nails tend to be filled with ridges, fragile, and also terribly brittle.  The kind where if you bump your nail into something, a chunk will simply fly off --- and they have always taken forever to grow.  That said, I have tried dozens of &#x27;nail growth&#x27; and fortifying products over the years, to no avail.  And, some of them were Sally Hansen products, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that was before Sally Hansen&#x27;s GREEN TEA + OLIVE GROWTH.  I have given this product a good trial, to make sure that results were consistent, before reviewing.  In the last three months, my nails have changed dramatically.  And, it was no temporary fix. My nails are now strong and they grow so fast, that I have to file them down weekly to keep them a suitable length for my work as a RN.  I haven&#x27;t had any broken nails, or fly away chips off of them, either.  And they look really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very easy to use because there is no nail preparation beforehand.  Just groom your nails and apply one coat over the bare nail &#x27;every other day for a week.&#x27;  For me, I give my nails a breather for a day, or two, then just start the process over.  Your nails will have a beautiful natural shine, like you&#x27;ve just buffed them with one those expensive nail salon buffers. But unlike the buffer, your nails retain the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never discontinue this product because it&#x27;s the only thing that has given me nails to be proud of, for the first time, ever.  I know that individuals have different problems with their nails, and this product may not be for everyone, but if your nails sound like I&#x27;ve described mine, give it a try.  For the price, it&#x27;s worth experimenting.</li>
    <li> Works great My nails grow and are strong</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference between this and regular clear nail polish. It didn&#x27;t seem to have any unique effect at all, and after 3 coats it started chipping and peeling horribly.</li>
    <li> It does seem to strengthen my nails and keep from tearing so easily.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I love it my nails grow fast and strong</li>
    <li> This works great! Keeps your nails strong and long (my nails are naturally longer, but are fragile and have cracks from chipping away nail polish during my spare time) This also comes in a well-protected package, so no spill/leakage arrived. My only complaint, is this stinks so much! It has that nasty, almost nauseating smell that gives you a headache. Wish that would be fixed- otherwise, this is a great product that you should buy, just not recommended for children.</li>
    <li> Great stuff as described, made my nails more flexible and stronger. I have really bad peeling nailand this seems to help. I get the occasional peel in my nail but not as bad as it was before. Highly reccomended.</li>
    <li> Love what it does to my nails</li>
    <li> It actually worked for me, my nails are longer then they use to be. I will definitly keep using it.</li>
    <li> This was so strange. I had heard good things about this product but if anything it worked in reverse. I found my nails, peeled / broke even more. Not a good product for me.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen Treatment Nails&lt;br /&gt;Verry good asboring, fast drying and works real good. Already seeing progress. Awesom stuff, very glad it was brought to my attention.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week over using Duri&#x27;s Rejuvacote. And this works much better! My nails were always so thin, and I&#x27;ve tried using top coats to not have my nails chip but they always do. Now my nails are much harder. The product is smooth too, I&#x27;ve tried other clear type nail polishes and they are bumpy and aren&#x27;t smooth. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I used  for one week nails grow to fast you see result inmedialy.Good product help my nails.&lt;br /&gt; Now look Pretty. I&#x27;m so happy</li>
    <li> Terrible. Don&#x27;t bother with this product, it didn&#x27;t do anything close to what it promises. It was goopy and gross.</li>
    <li> I put this on and then a few moments later put on a pair of socks to do my workout.  When I took my socks off, the product had made a sticky mess and sock fuzz was sticking to my polish.</li>
    <li> Does not help with peeling nails</li>
    <li> has only just arrive... seems good... time will tell.....can&#x27;t think of anything else to write... more words don&#x27;t make a better crit!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this not water based I like rub in the product not wear it as a base coat</li>
    <li> Love the product, saw healthy results in days.  I really like that it looks milky but goes on clear.  Great for a top coat.</li>
    <li> This was a good choice for me. I ordered this and the Miracle Cure at the same time . . . this formula does not contain formaldehyde. Started by alternating the products but that just isn&#x27;t necessary. Both products help splitting and chipping for those who have thin/fragile fingernails. This has really been put to the test with litter box changes (3 cats), laundry and &#x27;after visits cleanup&#x27; for grandchildren . . .  it&#x27;s the first time that I haven&#x27;t had any problems! I am impressed with both of these products and I have chosen to use this one because it does not contain any form of formaldehyde. This is just a matter of personal preference. I would recommend both products and add that the cost is reasonable . . . worth trying!</li>
    <li> this product amazes me. i putted it on for a day and the next day my nails were harder and it grew longer! i will buy this product again</li>
    <li> I really love this growth series it helps my nails grow and it make it so much stronger! I would totally buy again it was so cheap and cool. The only thing that bothered me was it was a jail polish and I wasn&#x27;t expecting tht but I don&#x27;t care</li>
