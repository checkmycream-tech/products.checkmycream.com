<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Jetpik is a really good all in one dental system. It is the closest thing you will get to a dentist clean daily unless your obsessed with dental visits or something or are actually a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the business of keeping your mouth in tip top shape. Essentially this is a flossing mechanism that pulsates water whilst in action but includes essential attachment as an electric toothbrush so your morning is simply a matter of switching the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly though and the most basic use is as an electric toothbrush which is all I thought it was when I accepted it for review. However, this is the basic of any and all dental care and it works great here. The motor is fast the brush feels good and it gives a thorough clean! As per the system I have only used it this a bit over a week and found I needed to charge it after six days so I think that is pretty good battery life and that was both as a brush and flosser. The charging cradle is super easy to use and is no intrusive it acts basically like a Qi charger where the base unit just sits on top of a little pad. It can be a little easy to knock over but I found better placement after the first few days of clipping it and it isn’t a problem. My standard electric toothbrush up until this point was an Oral B Pro 300 and I really do like this better. Maybe its a case of the emperors new clothes but I have kept the Oral B in the case since getting this and have been quite happy with its feel and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you brush you then floss and that is the ‘point’ I guess of this system. It is very easy to set up and use and just uses a cartridge system that works like a snake sticking its tounge out and licking your teeth and in between them (Sorry its the best way I could explain this one folks) It feels a bit weird the first time but you get the hang of it and its sends little bursts of water whilst it does this. It isn’t like anything I can really describe at the dentist except maybe the opposite feeling of that little sucker thing that sucks all the water from your mouth? You do have to replace the cartridges which are about $8 on Amazon for ten and they last two weeks each so not a big deal. On that point i did notice they have quite affordable spare parts when I was tinkering with the idea of a spare charger I could just keep in my camping bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the kit includes replacement cartridges and a decent carry case. If you want the Ultra kit as opposed to this Elite the main difference is a UV sanitiser. This is NOT in this kit you need the ULTRA pack for that. I travel a lot across the US not so much international these days but for those jet setting folk that go to lands of 240 volt this will still work since the actual power connect is just USB based you can rig it up easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice system and after a week of use my mouth feels a bit like a reformed sailor so I’m sticking with this regime. I’m actually flossing way more than I would have prior to so that has to be a good thing for my own personal health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review - its just my opinionpposite feeling of that little sucker thing that sucks all the water from your mouth?

    <li> This is awesome. I just had my braces removed and now wear bonded retainers. This gets underthe bonded areas and between my teeth perfectly. I have way better results that regular flossing with less effort. This machine is a must have and well worth its cost. It is very powerful but does not make teeth bleed and its not uncomfortable. You feel like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist after using it.</li>
    <li> love this brush, works great and dose an awsome job cleaning my teeth, user friendly. I had a panasonic one before but like this one better, better fitures and technology</li>
    <li> I bought a Jekpik Elite set for my mother in law as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift.  She is 87 years old who has a few crowns.  After using for over a week now, she is also impressed with Jetpik.  She loves the power of water jet which left her teeth clean and tidy. The travel case is her favorite, she can bring it along with her everywhere she travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!  Highly recommend to all our friends and family.</li>
    <li> This has made my life alot easier and enjoyable. My teeth and gums feel extra clean and healthy. The flosser gets into areas that the regular string floss could not and by far you can feel that it cleans a whole lot better. The best part about this is i am able to floss and brush my teeth in the shower as this product is water-proof.</li>
    <li> i had bought this product only a few days ago, and it came the next day, for free! The toothbrush its self is very good, and I can tell that it is a long lasting brush. The idea to use water and floss at the same time is amazing also. My teeth had always been full of plaque, but only after 3 days of use, I am crystal clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Just bought for myself - love it!  Better than floss</li>
    <li> so far so good, my teeth have not looked this white, my gums are extremely pink and healthy, it is a amazing way to toothbrush i will recommend this to anyone looking to take there dental life seriously.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Waterpik with this product because it cleans better. Jetpik has a pulsating floss that can removes plaque, the floss creates friction required for plaque removal. The love scrapper is really useful on removing bad breath. The toothbrush is on the strong side, you might need sometime to get used to it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Super easy to use and clean up. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always bought another brand, which didn&#x27;t last long.  Now this Jetpik is a dandy.  Trust me. It&#x27;s really helpful.</li>
    <li> I am so ecstatic about this product. Been using Waterpiks water flosser for years now and wanted to try this water flosser with water pressure and a real flosser. I can tell you it is much more efficient and my teeth and gums feel healthier then ever. 110% satisfied!</li>
    <li> This product cleans much better than Waterpik! The flossing removes plaque, Waterpik can&#x27;t do that. My old oral hygiene was to floss with traditional floss then use Waterpik and lastly brush my teeth but now all I have to do is use Jetpik to do all those steps! This package has a travel case that&#x27;s very travel friendly. Now I take my Jetpik with me everytime I travel. I don&#x27;t have to skip water flossing when traveling anymore.</li>
    <li> Exactly what expecting. Professional, real thing. My mouth has never been healthier.</li>
    <li> The water flosser is amazing I have braces got all the food out of hard to reach places but the tooth brush is wwwaaaayyyy to intense slightly painful and I slid the &amp;#34;intensity&amp;#34; way down I would go with something else I am not happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Received this on Tuesday.  I let it charge &amp; used it for the first time today.  I love it.  I read the instructions &amp; looked at the video on the Jetpik website. My teeth feel cleaner &amp; my mouth refreshed.  I would definitely recommend this product..</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and my recent dentist visit showed great improvement in the depth of pockets surrounding my , as well as greatly reduced plaque.It&#x27;s very user-friendly the way the whole thing is set up with USB charger for the handle portion. I&#x27;ve also traveled with it and the way it&#x27;s set up for travel is ingenious. Oh, and yes there truly is dental floss that comes out of the nozzle when you&#x27;re using the spray function. It feels fabulous!! My mouth has never felt so clean. I&#x27;ve even had two people ask me if I&#x27;ve started whitening my teeth. Have no hesitation in purchasing this product. It shipped within specified time limits and I have nothing to complain about</li>
    <li> Within 5 days of Amazon 30 money back the battery fails and will not charge. It is useless. Buy one that you can plug in in thery clean better and more reliable.</li>
    <li> Could not even tell the difference in the power setting. Does not hold a charge at all. Would not recommend over a water pick</li>
    <li> I replaced a Sonicare toothbrush and a Waterpik with this dental cleaning system, this system has everything I need in one package that doesn&#x27;t take much counter space, unlike the Waterpik. Its travel case is perfect for taking this system on the go. Received this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, mouth feels so clean.  Recharged battery lasts weeks.</li>
    <li> Good product, the water jet part, lacks a bit.  I have to put it up on a shelf, for the water to get into the strung, poor hold up the cup.  Othe</li>
    <li> ►  JETPIK BRUSH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a big Philips Sonicare fan and admit it.  I haven’t had a cavity in years, most likely from utilizing a decent home brushing system and conscientious attention to my teeth.  My other go-to piece of equipment is my Water Pik.  Now, the Jetpik is a totally innovative space-saving system that could easily replace the both of them.  It’s also portable, one thing my Water Pik certainly isn’t.  Let’s put it this way, when I go on vacation, I leave the popcorn at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a combo system, so first I’ll go over what I think of the brush.  The Jetpik isn’t like the inexpensive spin brushes, but rather in the same field as the Philip Sonicare HealthyWhite.  There’s nothing to indicate the cleaning power, but it’s at least is 31,000 strokes per minute, if not 41,000.  The higher the speed frequencies, the more efficient a brush is in breaking down plaque.  The Jetpik brushing system is definitely a Philips contender.  I use a Philips and definitely wouldn’t mind switching were it to break down on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with many of the family brushing systems, the two included brushes are color-coded for convenience and obvious sanitary reasons.  The brushes are not interchangeable with the Philips, but I did notice that there’s a [[ASIN:B00XIS6FIM Jetpik Annual Pack of Consumables for JP200 lines]].  This is a price point that’s not unreasonable considering I need to change my brush heads four times a year with my Philips.  There are additional upkeep costs with any system I’ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist and dental hygienist have been quite pleased with the improvement of my oral health since beginning to use an electric toothbrush. The brush heads of the Jetpik are approximately 1/4” wide x 1” long, large enough to work on all of my teeth, yet small enough to get into the back of my molars. Those tend to be the problem areas for many people. If you can’t hit the back of them, you’re bound to get cavities.  The brushes are soft, something I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of a whitening toothpaste and the Jetpik will whiten your teeth. There is only one mode as opposed to the three or more on other brushes.  For example, some have a massage mode, so if you want a multi-mode system, take a pass or look at the more expensive brushes.  The Jetpik system works on an inductive charge and has a space-saving stand.  It does take 24 hours to fully charge the first time (mine came charged), but a charge will last two weeks or so.  I have a freestanding sink and there’s very little room to put much of anything on it. This system is a space-saving one and I can put the cup in my medicine cabinet if I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  JETPIK POWER FLOSS SYSTEM:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned before, I use my Waterpik all the time, but also am a big popcorn fan.  I have to leave both behind when I go on vacation.  I’m hard-pressed to haul my Waterpik on vacation because it’s way too bulky.  If I’m traveling in a vehicle I’ve done it, but it’s a total pain to put it in a box.  I still worry that I’m going to damage it.  The Jetpik is ultra-handy and ultra-portable.  It has a water cup, but with the specialized tubing I can leave it behind and use any cup that can hold enough water for an irrigation.  Everything can go into a very handy carrying case that can be tossed in a carry-on bag, into my luggage, or even my purse (I have a large one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things her that the Jetpik oral irrigator and water flosser has over my Waterpik.  They are visually quite different devices, but serve the same purpose.  With the combination Jetpik brushing and power floss system I can brush, floss, and irrigate without having bulky equipment.  Sorry to the Waterpik company, but it’s true.  I will still continue to use my Waterpik at home out of force of habit and use, but the Jetpik will go with me on vacation or travel opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jetpik has the same type of plastic my Philips and Waterpik have.  The Waterpik is charged via AC current only, but the Jetpik has an inductive charging station with an AC adapter.  If I want I can remove the adapter and charge via the USB port on my PC or even via a battery pack.  Talk about versatile!  An overnight charge with one of my 10000mAh battery packs will give me that two weeks of brushing and flossing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detachable nozzle (there are three of them) rotates 360° and is a bit wider than that of the one on my Waterpik. The cleaning is precise, just as expected.  The nozzles are color-coded, blue, green, and pink, so there will be no mistaking them if three people are using the Jetpik.  I would recommend starting off on the lowest setting and staying there until you are used to it.  The jet stream is strong and if you haven’t used a water irrigation system before, you can actually hurt your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are very good with both written instructions and visual. Of course there are the regular cautionary notes, but the troubleshooting ones may come in handy.  There’s no water tank to have to clean, a real plus in my book and it’s certainly less bulky.  No potential bacterial growth to contend with here.  There isn’t much to troubleshoot, but if you don’t have a full charge, the Jetpik simply won’t turn on.  You also have to have a floss capsule in place order for it to function.  There’s really floss in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s also a tongue cleaner for those who use one. I’m quite impressed with the entire system, especially the portability factor.  I definitely like the fact that everything can go into one small case.  The only vulnerability would be the tubing.  Now it’s similar to that of my Waterpik, but they do last for years.  In time I’m assuming that Jetpik will come up with a replacement.  Time will tell how reliable this entire system is.  I definitely love it and would highly recommend it to anyone, especially those who need a reasonably priced, compact, portable system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  2X more effective than any regular water irrigator.

    <li> Great sets of dental hygiene product! I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I had a large reservoir Waterpik and a travel (cordless) Waterpik, and after using this, I tossed them both out.  The large one was old and bulky, and the portable (cordless) one didn&#x27;t have the water power that I came to expect.  And then I found the Jetpik!!!  Amazing ease of use and portability.  I love that the one I purchased has a travel kit and can be used with any cup.  Much easier for the amount of traveling I do.  I have been telling all my friends and family about my amazing find  As for the floss cartridges, I was quite sure how that would feel, but it simply pulsates where you are aiming and feels no different than just a medium water jet,  Finally, a product I felt good writing a review on!</li>
    <li> Great product, much better and more pwerful than the waterpik brand</li>
    <li> very helpful, works great!</li>
    <li> Love it........this is the best Waterpik I&#x27;ve  every used will always stay with this one..AWSOME.......</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit because a friend of mine told me she had one and doesn&#x27;t know how she got along without it. I&#x27;ve used many different dental hygeine products over the years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a single product that fills all my needs and gives me the ability to floss without the hassle of &amp;#34;hand flossing&amp;#34;. Beyond that, it takes up very little room on my countertop and has a compact carry case to bring the entire system with me on trips.I just don&#x27;t understand why it took the industry so long to develop a single product that meets all the dental hygeine needs.</li>
    <li> The JetPik 200 Elite is the first water stream flossing device that I&#x27;ve tried. I had been using plain old dental floss which was kind of a bother and sometimes wasn&#x27;t so easy to get between certain teeth.. This JetPik does a very effective job of removing trapped food from between my teeth, even around permanent bridgework. Once I read the Quick Start instructions and figured out what all the pieces were for, flossing my teeth went surprisingly fast. Actually, first I used the power toothbrush head and brushed my teeth. There&#x27;s a low and a high speed and it did a good job of cleaning my teeth. Then I switched to the JetPik (flossing) head. It came with the power floss cartridge already in place. I pulled the plastic tubing from the bottom of the cup where it stores, coiled around inside the base. I attached it to the toothbrush. I filled the blue water reservoir cup with water and was then ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaning over the sink basin I slowly moved the JetPik nozzle around my mouth near the base of my teeth, paying special attention to places were food tends to get trapped between my teeth. It felt interesting, not painful or anything, and I could see bits of debris released into the sink when I spit the water out. I went over a couple areas several times because it didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing much but when I looked in the mirror it had made my gums bleed a little bit, probably because I stayed in that one area too long. It is a lot more powerful than it seemed at first. After I rinsed my mouth I ran my tongue over my teeth and they felt really clean. It was amazing how well it worked, even when it felt like it wasn&#x27;t. This is a good alternative to using dental floss everyday, although I&#x27;ll probably still use it a couple times a week. This is easy enough to use that I can use it after meals more than once a day. I&#x27;ve tried mixing mouthwash with the water and that works well too.</li>
    <li> Kids bad breath...Gone!  Get it if you have braces...No really, get this.</li>
    <li> Horrible, horrible product!!!  It shoots water everywhere. It washed my bathroom more that it did my teeth. I tried calling customer service on the box and they don&#x27;t answer !!! DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Came with everything you could possible use great product.</li>
    <li> Amazing! A friend of mine was recommended the jetpik by his Dentist in Beverly Hills. He mentioned it was good for people with braces so I gave it a shot. I dropped my waterpik after 2 years use. It is a lot smaller and much more easier and effective. I love the flossing feature.</li>
    <li> Nifty, handy dandy water flosser.  It&#x27;s light that I can travel with it anywhere I go.</li>
    <li> Very impressive...at first. My husband just got braces and was excited to try this out. The flossing attachment worked great with good power at first, but quickly seemed to lose its punch within a week or two. It continued to decline and we ultimately returned it.</li>
    <li> It broke after 2 months.  I think we should all wait couple months later to evaluate.  I thought it was okay but it aint!!!!!  I wrote before:  &amp;#34;It&#x27;s only okay.  What I don&#x27;t like is that useless dental floss cartridges.  It gives you the impression that it works better because of it but I don&#x27;t think so.  What I really don&#x27;t like is that the whole thing does not work without that cartridge.  If it were optional, it would be fine.  I took it apart to see how the cartridge works and it&#x27;s totally over designed for nothing. I could have designed it with a dental floss with no casings.  My guess is that their marketing guy said that they can continue to sell dental floss cartridges to make more money.  Stupid idea to make more money and it does not work. I don&#x27;t like that deceptive marketing strategy.  I read someone said it broke and stopped working.  It stopped working on mine too but when I tapped it hard, it started to work.  When it breaks, I would open it up and see how the whole thing was designed.  I don&#x27;t expect it to last that long.  The positive thing is that it doesn&#x27;t waste too much space.</li>
