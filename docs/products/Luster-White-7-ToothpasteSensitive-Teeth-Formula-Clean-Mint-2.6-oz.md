### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I really am impressed with this.  </li>
      <li>Luster alone definitely won&#x27;t win any flavor and freshness contests, but it does what it claims it will do to whiten teeth.  </li>
      <li>It tastes great, but the tube has a lot of air in it.</li>
      <li>My holistic dentist recommended it and it&#x27;s working great for me.      </li>
      <li>but it feels great when it coats your teeth.  </li>
      <li>If you have food or beverage stains on your teeth, this might be a great whitener.  </li>
      <li>So satisfied!</li>
      <li>Just wanted to say that they make it right, and I&#x27;m very pleased that in this day and age there are companies who still take care of their customers!  </li>
      <li>You will love this product, I see a difference.  </li>
      <li>Do you have more?</li>
      <li>I am more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste, but when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, I figured that they stopped making it.</li>
      <li>But it does an excellent job of keeping teeth white after using the Luster tooth whitening system.</li>
      <li>This is a better alternative to whitening strips.  </li>
      <li>&amp; it is great on sensitive teeth!!  </li>
      <li>This product gets pretty good reviews across the internet, so I chose to try it.  </li>
      <li>- I&#x27;m a true believer!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not to say there was a huge difference in whiteness, but it was a substantial improvement.  </li>
      <li>Now I use Food-Grade Hydrogen Peroxide which comes in a spray bottle, available in health food stores and perhaps here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>What I really like about it is that it does not contain sls as many do, even more mainstream toothpastes.</li>
      <li>I can see a significant difference.  </li>
      <li>I did not notice any sensitivity at all after using the product, which is quite a relief for those of us who know the unique pain of tooth sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Smile!  </li>
      <li>so maybe it&#x27;s weaker than the original one.</li>
      <li>I feel clean and refreshed after using it and have no complaints.</li>
      <li>It has a fresh minty taste, but that clean feeling that lasts all day is the biggest selling point.  </li>
      <li>The VERY FIRST TIME I used this toothpaste</li>
      <li>Being a smoker, there aren&#x27;t many toothpastes that really remove stains very well.  </li>
      <li>I just had a customer tell me that my teeth look great and asked if I recently had them professionally whitened.  </li>
      <li>Also the taste is far better than any of the Tom&#x27;s brand varieties.</li>
      <li>it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>I really like this tooth paste because your teeth feel clean even at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I normally have very sensitive teeth, so the sensitivity claim was very important to me.</li>
      <li>The tooth paste seemed to work fine as far as toothpastes go, but it did not whiten like it said it would.</li>
      <li>This product is too pricey when you can just buy a way better whitening toothpaste at your local store.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would suggest being very cautious when purchasing this product!</li>
      <li>More than what&#x27;s needed came out the next couple times as well.</li>
      <li>Funny that people are complaining about flouride, based on the ingredients listed here,</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t afford professional whitening but wanted to do something to improve the appearance of my teeth for an important occasion.  </li>
      <li>I have seen a real difference!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better Dentist checkups since I started using Luster 7, and my DH asked what I was doing differently.</li>
      <li>Best $1.75 I&#x27;ve ever spent, hands down.</li>
      <li>pretty good toothpaste but very little inside.   </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be as much as a problem with the other reviews on here, so maybe I am more sensitive than most, BUT.</li>
      <li>there is mostly air in this tube --- after about a week&#x27;s worth of use, it seems to be almost empty.</li>
      <li>That being said, it may be a good idea to blend it with your regular toothpaste to ensure you are getting enough</li>
      <li>My co-worker swears by this brand so I was thrilled to find a whitening product that was actually for sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>im not sure.. was it good?</li>
      <li>I found a disclaimer on the tube after losing a large portion of the paste, suggesting to store it on its side rather than standing up.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I discovered this TP because it leaves my teeth squeeky clean from just a small amount of paste.</li>
      <li>but you can really feel this working.</li>
      <li>It really does work though</li>
      <li>I have not noticed a real difference in the color of my teeth, yet.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is fine, but nearly half the tube came pouring out when I opened it the first time.</li>
      <li>My teeth are pretty white on their own but this added that little bit of oomph that has my customers noticing.  </li>
      <li>Normally a skeptic (my Mom taught me well)</li>
      <li>It is kind of thick</li>
      <li>Mind as well get white teeth while brushing, right?</li>
      <li>Now the texture is most likely unlike any other toothpaste you&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I was able to stretch it this long by using just a pea-sized dab on the brush plus a similar sized dab of my regular Colgate.  </li>
      <li>My teeth are nice enough, but not super white.  </li>
      <li>My teeth are less white, more sensitive</li>
      <li>7 Sensitive Teeth Formula does have fluoride, but it&#x27;s only about 40% of a the fluoride found in many other regular toothpastes (Crest Pro Health, for example - which I don&#x27;t recommend).</li>
      <li>The tube was not even half full.</li>
      <li>It definitely removed as much surface staining as a regular, professional dental cleaning/polishing</li>
      <li>After just using it for 2 days (twice a day, 4 times total) I see a clear difference.</li>
      <li>I have used the Luster Premium White 7 for Sensitive Teeth Toothpaste for two weeks.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one of those people with a glistening white smile you can see across a dark parking lot.  </li>
      <li>It tasted weird and made my teeth kind of coated.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure that would have helped entirely when the tube was still full.  </li>
      <li>Just a light brush with less than a dime amount of paste, and just for a few minutes, will get your teeth ultra-clean.</li>
      <li>Very thick and doesn&#x27;t foam much at first, but after working it on your teeth for a bit, it works up a normal lather.</li>

<li> I prefer to add a little to my regular toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride.</li>

<li> I originally combined the two in order to improve the unpleasant flavor of the Luster, and so that there would be some lingering minty freshness after brushing.  </li>
<li> No, I don&#x27;t recommend it when you can buy other less pricey products.</li>
<li> I mean OBVIOUS.</li>
<li> Anyway, the smell is something you&#x27;d smell in a dentists office, not your typical toothpaste smell</li>
<li> The price is a little high for how little product you receive but compared to white strips and other expensive whitening products it really isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
<li> I think it is a little pricey.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth the money!</li>
<li> but I just checked the label contents on a few</li>
<li> I was looking for something that would be fairly gentle but help remove stains, and it not only has done nothing to help whiten my teeth, but my entire mouth feels awful after using this toothpaste.</li>
<li> It just seems uncomfortable to be hanging out with those plastic strips straddling your teeth and pretending it&#x27;s a natural feeling.</li>
<li> My teeth do look whiter after using this product for a few weeks.</li>
<li> I was disappointed that I paid the increased cost for this product, plus shipping, and then found the same product in Walgreen&#x27;s for only $7.99!  </li>
<li> I do not smoke or drink coffee or tea, so my teeth were not stained by any of the usual suspects before I tried this product.</li>
<li> Not sure I will buy this again-</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually like to spend a lot of money on this type of thing, but the sale price roped me in.  </li>
<li> WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Being a smoker, there aren&#x27;t many toothpastes that really remove stains very well.  But this one does!  I have seen a real difference!  I will use this forever...</li>
    <li> When I saw this product on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s one day, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I don&#x27;t usually like to spend a lot of money on this type of thing, but the sale price roped me in.  I normally have very sensitive teeth, so the sensitivity claim was very important to me. I did not notice any sensitivity at all after using the product, which is quite a relief for those of us who know the unique pain of tooth sensitivity. Additionally, unlike the info provided in a previous review, the Luster White 7 Sensitive Teeth Formula does have fluoride, but it&#x27;s only about 40% of a the fluoride found in many other regular toothpastes (Crest Pro Health, for example - which I don&#x27;t recommend). That being said, it may be a good idea to blend it with your regular toothpaste to ensure you are getting enough protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the deal. The VERY FIRST TIME I used this toothpaste I saw an obvious difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I mean OBVIOUS. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I&#x27;m not one of those people with a glistening white smile you can see across a dark parking lot.  My teeth are nice enough, but not super white.  I do not smoke or drink coffee or tea, so my teeth were not stained by any of the usual suspects before I tried this product. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the thought of using strips.  It just seems uncomfortable to be hanging out with those plastic strips straddling your teeth and pretending it&#x27;s a natural feeling. If you are like me in that regard, this toothpaste is the way to go. Normally a skeptic (my Mom taught me well) - I&#x27;m a true believer!</li>
    <li> Mind as well get white teeth while brushing, right? This product works, no doubt about it. I actually bought it off her about a week ago for only $1.75 and I&#x27;ve seen the price has gone up since then. Anyway, the smell is something you&#x27;d smell in a dentists office, not your typical toothpaste smell but it&#x27;s nothing unpleasant that goes for taste too. Now the texture is most likely unlike any other toothpaste you&#x27;ve ever used. Very thick and doesn&#x27;t foam much at first, but after working it on your teeth for a bit, it works up a normal lather. I like to use my other, regular toothpaste for my tongue and then finish off with listerine as I hate the taste of toothpaste lingering in my mouth. When I brush, I actually feel the toothpaste working, my teeth tingle a bit (might be the sensitivity) but you can really feel this working. I feel clean and refreshed after using it and have no complaints. After just using it for 2 days (twice a day, 4 times total) I see a clear difference. I actually took a before picture and I&#x27;m going to compare it to the after picture when the tube is done. I am more than pleased with my purchase. Best $1.75 I&#x27;ve ever spent, hands down.</li>
    <li> I bought the product and used it for a couple days...It tasted weird and made my teeth kind of coated. It&#x27;s not worth the money! Don&#x27;t like the product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it whitens as well as they claim but it works well enough. Not sure I will buy this again-but you never know. I should also mention I got the sensative formula so maybe it&#x27;s weaker than the original one.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine, but nearly half the tube came pouring out when I opened it the first time. More than what&#x27;s needed came out the next couple times as well. I found a disclaimer on the tube after losing a large portion of the paste, suggesting to store it on its side rather than standing up.  I&#x27;m not sure that would have helped entirely when the tube was still full.  It would have been less annoying if there were a way to shove the overflow back into the tube, but instead I watched my money wash away down the sink drain.  Kind of disappointing.</li>
    <li> I used this toothpaste for two weeks, and I did not notice any difference in the whiteness of my teeth. The tooth paste seemed to work fine as far as toothpastes go, but it did not whiten like it said it would. Also, it&#x27;s quite expensive for just the small amount that comes in the package. After two weeks of use, it was almost gone. Maybe it works for other people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me, so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again</li>
    <li> pretty good toothpaste but very little inside.   keep that in mind.  after a week you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s almost all gone.  i&#x27;m looking for other alternatives to this toothpaste.  very expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> I had a problem when I went to open a tube of this toothpaste.  It just went all over the place when I opened the tube.  I wrote a review about it and the company took care of me!  Just wanted to say that they make it right, and I&#x27;m very pleased that in this day and age there are companies who still take care of their customers!  I did learn one tip though:  when you purchase this toothpaste, turn the capside up and leave it that way, and THEN open the tube!!  Smile!  You will love this product, I see a difference.  So satisfied!</li>
    <li> ***Update: I found that they started puting flouride in this toothpaste. Now I use Food-Grade Hydrogen Peroxide which comes in a spray bottle, available in health food stores and perhaps here on Amazon. My holistic dentist recommended it and it&#x27;s working great for me.      I&#x27;ve had better Dentist checkups since I started using Luster 7, and my DH asked what I was doing differently. I too, discovered Luster 7 at my local Walgreens one time when they were out of the Tom&#x27;s non-flouride paste. Also the taste is far better than any of the Tom&#x27;s brand varieties. I&#x27;m glad I discovered this TP because it leaves my teeth squeeky clean from just a small amount of paste. If your mouth is hurting from using this TP, pehaps you are brushing too hard. Just a light brush with less than a dime amount of paste, and just for a few minutes, will get your teeth ultra-clean. Funny that people are complaining about flouride, based on the ingredients listed here, but I just checked the label contents on a few I purchase just 3 weeks ago when it was on sale, and there is NO Potassium Flouride listed in the ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product is thicker than regular toothpaste amd a lot of Air in the tube. But it does an excellent job of keeping teeth white after using the Luster tooth whitening system. I prefer to add a little to my regular toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride.</li>
    <li> I tried this toothpaste as Walgreen&#x27;s didn&#x27;t have the product from the same co which was recommended by Allure magazine.  My teeth do look whiter after using this product for a few weeks. What I really like about it is that it does not contain sls as many do, even more mainstream toothpastes. As far as I can tell, it does not contain any other harmful ingredients. I brush my teeth first with a dry brush and then just use a small amount of this toothpaste and brush for the 2 min which the toothbrush does automatically.</li>
    <li> I have used the Luster Premium White 7 for Sensitive Teeth Toothpaste for two weeks.  I have not noticed a real difference in the color of my teeth, yet.  I was disappointed that I paid the increased cost for this product, plus shipping, and then found the same product in Walgreen&#x27;s for only $7.99!  If you have food or beverage stains on your teeth, this might be a great whitener.  If you are looking to actually change the color of your teeth that are not stained to a brighter, whiter color, it may not happen with this product.</li>
    <li> I can see a significant difference.  This is a better alternative to whitening strips.  I only found out about this product because it was on sale. I will def. look into products from Luster.</li>
    <li> I really like this tooth paste because your teeth feel clean even at the end of the day. It has a fresh minty taste, but that clean feeling that lasts all day is the biggest selling point.  I think it has whitened as well.  I am trying the whitening kit next.  The only drawback is the price.  I think it is a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t afford professional whitening but wanted to do something to improve the appearance of my teeth for an important occasion.  This product gets pretty good reviews across the internet, so I chose to try it.  It definitely removed as much surface staining as a regular, professional dental cleaning/polishing does.  That&#x27;s not to say there was a huge difference in whiteness, but it was a substantial improvement.  My teeth were definitely brighter within about a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at how little product I found in the tube.  I thought that kind of deceptive packaging was illegal in the US!  I bought the product in mid-April and am just now squeezing the last little dribs out of the tube.  I was able to stretch it this long by using just a pea-sized dab on the brush plus a similar sized dab of my regular Colgate.  I originally combined the two in order to improve the unpleasant flavor of the Luster, and so that there would be some lingering minty freshness after brushing.  Luster alone definitely won&#x27;t win any flavor and freshness contests, but it does what it claims it will do to whiten teeth.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would be fairly gentle but help remove stains, and it not only has done nothing to help whiten my teeth, but my entire mouth feels awful after using this toothpaste. I can&#x27;t seem to drink enough water, and it&#x27;s definitely causing some irritation and even numbness of my tongue. I am throwing my tube in the trash; and I agree with the reviewer who said it was overpriced ---- there is mostly air in this tube --- after about a week&#x27;s worth of use, it seems to be almost empty. A total ripoff.</li>
    <li> I have tried a bunch of different whitening tooth pastes, mouth washes, and whitening strips and gels and I really am impressed with this.  My co-worker swears by this brand so I was thrilled to find a whitening product that was actually for sensitive teeth.  The tube does have a lot of air in it but as soon as you get the product on your brush it is worth it.  It is kind of thick but it feels great when it coats your teeth.  The taste is a little weird, not as minty as I expected but the way my teeth look and feel is worth it.  My teeth are pretty white on their own but this added that little bit of oomph that has my customers noticing.  I just had a customer tell me that my teeth look great and asked if I recently had them professionally whitened.  I see this woman at least twice a week so obviously it was a difference for her to notice.  The price is a little high for how little product you receive but compared to white strips and other expensive whitening products it really isn&#x27;t too bad.  The only other place I have found this brand is at Walgreens but next time I think I will just order it from here to save time going to the store.  Just a side note I don&#x27;t drink coffee or red wine so that definetly helps my cause.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, but when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, I figured that they stopped making it. Amazon was the only one who still had 4 tubes left, so I bought them. They serve the purpose, but the taste is atrocious. Very old peppermint, quite disgusting, but the paste still does the job on my teeth, so I suffer. Do you have more?</li>
    <li> For me, this product works.  I see whiter teeth.  It does not whiten my two front veneers but it works on the rest of my teeth.  I&#x27;ve tried other whitening toothpastes and I don&#x27;t see any results so I&#x27;m sticking to this one.</li>
    <li> I read that whitening results are visible one week after using. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for 3 weeks and have not seen any difference in the shade of my teeth. It tastes great, but the tube has a lot of air in it. Not impressed. Stick with whitening toothpaste you find at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> What a waste of $7! My teeth are less white, more sensitive and I have a bad taste in my mouth. The tube was not even half full. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
    <li> im not sure.. was it good? cant see da difference</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be as much as a problem with the other reviews on here, so maybe I am more sensitive than most, BUT. My tongue looks like the skin has been eaten with acid. I&#x27;ve only been using this for 3 days and my tongue hurts so bad I don&#x27;t even want to talk. It also has a bad taste, lots of air (similar to other reviews) and I feel constantly dehydrated (cotton-mouth caused) since using this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest being very cautious when purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> This product is too pricey when you can just buy a way better whitening toothpaste at your local store. Beware of tooth sensitivity with it also. I had to use sensodyne at the same time I used this product. No, I don&#x27;t recommend it when you can buy other less pricey products. Even though it says &amp;#34;Sensitive Teeth Formula&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does just as it promises.  The only catch is you have to use it everyday &amp; continue to use it daily or you can tell that your teeth won&#x27;t look as white once you switch back to something else.  It really does work though &amp; it is great on sensitive teeth!!  All smiles over here!!</li>
