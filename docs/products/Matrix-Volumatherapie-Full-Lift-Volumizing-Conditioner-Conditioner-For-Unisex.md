      <li>( but there&#x27;s another product for this too :)</li>
      <li>I have used this item for several years, so I would say that I was happy with this product.</li>
      <li>product smells great, like salon brands typically do, but isn&#x27;t at all overwhelming -</li>

      <li>I have fine, straight hair and switched from Garnier Fructis Daily Care (not a volumizing shampoo/conditioner) to this shampoo &amp; conditioner, hoping to get some more volume, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s used as a preservative, but I really have no problem with it being in hair products), but more importantly: it does not contain Sulfates or Silicone, which are proven to dry out your hair.</li>
      <li>First quality shampoo, conditioner my husband used and he was amazed at the difference.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is really good but sometimes frequent use does make my hair really dry.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a whole lot difference after applying this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Much better than store brand conditioners which contain polymers that will detangle but will weigh hair down.</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend this to a friend (both brand and specifically this product).  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t comment on how this does in terms of keeping frizz down, but I did notice a big difference in the volume of my hair - even more so once I ran out and switched to a non-volume conditioner!  </li>
      <li>Bought in in Rite-Aid and returned it back, expected much better from this brand</li>
      <li>My hair is like baby hair ; it&#x27;s thin and fine and unfortunately not thick and full.</li>
      <li>It totally helps with tangles and leaves your hair very silky!</li>
      <li>product doesn&#x27;t have any parabens (controversial due to a few non-cohort studies</li>
      <li>I find it leaves my hair manageable and full of volume, so long as it doesn&#x27;t go past my shoulders.  </li>

    <li> Bought in in Rite-Aid and returned it back, expected much better from this brand</li>
    <li> Purchased many times and always satisfied.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It totally helps with tangles and leaves your hair very silky! I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used to use this product on my hair (currently has switched to the UNITE brand) and I always loved how it looked/smelled/felt.  I never wanted to spend the money on salon brands, so I was a drugstore kind-of-girl, until I found this at a local TJ Maxx.  I can never go back to drugstore brands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells great, like salon brands typically do, but isn&#x27;t at all overwhelming - usually I&#x27;ll get a whiff when I&#x27;m walking around with wet hair or I purposefully smell my hair during the day.  The consistency is a light cream, I typically use about a quarter size dollop and do not just concentrate at the ends and it has never made my hair oily or slick.  I was using this with Matrix Sleek shampoo, so I can&#x27;t comment on how this does in terms of keeping frizz down, but I did notice a big difference in the volume of my hair - even more so once I ran out and switched to a non-volume conditioner!  The volume lasts throughout the day, and when I apply heat, it still keeps.  Very pleased and I would highly recommend this to a friend (both brand and specifically this product).  I have repurchased this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t have any parabens (controversial due to a few non-cohort studies suggest it&#x27;s a carcinogen. It&#x27;s used as a preservative, but I really have no problem with it being in hair products), but more importantly: it does not contain Sulfates or Silicone, which are proven to dry out your hair. Sulfates are what cause shampoos and soaps to foam, so when something doesn&#x27;t&#x27; contain them, they don&#x27;t lather like you&#x27;re used to, but it&#x27;s still working! Better actually!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note: my hair type is a mixture of very thin and very thick strands, wavy, and has a bit of natural volume, but once I apply heat to it (I curl my hair after every wash) it lays too flat.  It&#x27;s down to the middle of my shoulder blades and I try not to wash it more than every 2 days.  (If you&#x27;re used to washing your hair every day, I suggest this dry shampoo: http://www.amazon.com/Batiste-Dry-Shampoo-Original-5-05/dp/B000N5S0KE, which I find at my local TJ Maxx.

    <li> Dried my hair. Won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> My hair curls beautifully now</li>
    <li> Great conditioner but do not use too much if you have fine hair. It does what it says, smells nice and is a great product. Just do not &#x27;slather it on&#x27; and leave it. wash it out in about 2-3 minutes and your hair will look healthy as can be.</li>
    <li> First quality shampoo, conditioner my husband used and he was amazed at the difference.  Poor guy - didn&#x27;t think he cared.  He is very pleased</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo &amp; thought I&#x27;d try the conditioner. I found my hair feels fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I had breast cancer in 2008 and still take medication, leaves my hair thining; but now my hair feels fuller.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair and switched from Garnier Fructis Daily Care (not a volumizing shampoo/conditioner) to this shampoo &amp; conditioner, hoping to get some more volume, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. I don&#x27;t really care for the scent of either the shampoo or conditioner, but the conditioner is the worse of the two. Once I finish off this product I&#x27;ll be trying something else.</li>
    <li> My hair is like baby hair ; it&#x27;s thin and fine and unfortunately not thick and full. It doesn&#x27;t help the fact that I&#x27;m also 52 and color my hair as well. Also I tourture my hair with when I blow dry it ( but there&#x27;s another product for this too :) This product amplifys my lock as well as conditions it without weighing it down!</li>
    <li> I have used this product continuously, it is great. Much better than store brand conditioners which contain polymers that will detangle but will weigh hair down. I find it leaves my hair manageable and full of volume, so long as it doesn&#x27;t go past my shoulders.  Scent is neutral but that is a plus in my book.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  I have used this item for several years, so I would say that I was happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is really good but sometimes frequent use does make my hair really dry. I don&#x27;t see a whole lot difference after applying this conditioner. Its just ok. I don&#x27;t think I ll buy another one after the one I have is over.</li>
    <li> Great value for money if you are bald.</li>
    <li> I knew as soon as I applied this it wouldn&#x27;t work for me as it really weighed my wet hair down. After blow drying, my hair was actually limper than if I hadn&#x27;t used any conditioner. So disappointed!</li>
