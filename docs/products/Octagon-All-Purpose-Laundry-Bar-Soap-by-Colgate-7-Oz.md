      <li>I tried finely grating the Colgate Octagon to use as</li>

      <li>We use it as a laundry booster as well and just love the fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Fantastic all except price.  </li>

      <li>The bar also seems to last forever and a day, which is good for getting the most bang for my buck.  </li>
      <li>Back then, I didn&#x27;t think about what kind of products I was using on my skin, and what kind of chemicals those products contained.</li>
      <li>This is perfect and worked very well last week on my trip to mexico.</li>
      <li>The price is right, you&#x27;ll be satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I clean my floors, dishes, cabinets, shower with this soap and have had fantastic results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s not marked as a body soap, it seems to work great for that, too.  </li>
      <li>I get some suds on a rag and soap up the appliances, then use a wrung out clean rag to wipe the suds off.</li>
      <li>Hurricane season is coming and I will still have clean clothes.</li>
      <li>I have used this Octagon soap for many things, and have had all positive results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good soap for keeping your face clean, and it actually does help take care of your acne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true soap.</li>
      <li>This is a terrific soap that has many, many uses.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is far better than the liquid soap available at the grocery stores.</li>
      <li>It does a superb job at cutting grease which makes it ideal for cleaning greasy or oily surfaces or extra grimy clothes.  </li>
      <li>Octagon soap by Colgate is actually a great product - one bar will go a long way when used to make your own dishwashing liquid detergent at home - will save you a ton of money on the long run.</li>
      <li>I soaked the socks in extremely hot water, let it cool, then sudsed on a washboard.</li>
      <li>Again, I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
      <li>and it also crumbled more easily(that could be because it was an old bar</li>
      <li>I use it to get stains out of clothing, especially ring around the collar; I love the feeling of being squeaky clean, so I even shower with it.</li>
      <li>RIGHT OUT</li>
      <li>If you come in contact with poison ivy and wash with this right after contact you will not break out.  </li>
      <li>It is a commodity that really ought to be pretty cheap</li>
      <li>This soap, good as it is, is not worth $2, never mind  $20.00</li>
      <li>all fairness, I found out its been discontinued and its very much in demand still.</li>
      <li>It makes cleaning pretty much anything (dishes, countertops, stoves and still is mild enough to use on hands) a snap, and is enjoyable to use.</li>
      <li>Thanks again!</li>
      <li>Octagon soap was what I was looking for and had not been able to find it locally.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not sure that purchasing this online versus plucking it off the local store shelf is going to fetch the best price.</li>
      <li>I was so thankful that Amazon had exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Octagon soap worked pretty well getting the grunge out.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is not as convenient as liquid soap, but it not only cleans better, but it is cheaper and the smell reminds me of my Grandmothers kitchen sink.</li>
      <li>, I really don&#x27;t know how fresh it was).</li>
      <li>I would shop around first though if you can.</li>
      <li>Because it is a family favorite and local businesses no longer supply it.  </li>
      <li>And the clothes don&#x27;t come out any more clean than with other soaps.  </li>
      <li>Like most anachronistic things such as old-fashioned straight razors, push lawnmowers, mechanical typewriters, etc.</li>
      <li>All I can say about this soap is it feels pure.  </li>
      <li>1 bar soap is too much $25 is too much</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t understand what everyone loves about this soap.  </li>
      <li>and it did everything but put a whole in my hand bag.</li>
      <li>I had a lot of trouble finding this soap at a reasonable price, and I love frugal and old fashioned products, so when I needed a &#x27;filler&#x27; item to bump an Amazon order for free shipping, I added a bar.</li>
      <li>and it also replaces a whole cupboard of cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(BTW, I could not afford to buy as much as we need here on amazon.com;</li>

    <li> The best soap for anything like poison ivy, poison oak,poison sumac etc., Little bit on the pricey side, but I haven&#x27;t had a break out yet best stuff ever!</li>
    <li> I had a lot of trouble finding this soap at a reasonable price, and I love frugal and old fashioned products, so when I needed a &#x27;filler&#x27; item to bump an Amazon order for free shipping, I added a bar. While it was ok in the laundry and dishes, I have been using Fels Naptha on my black fridge and oven door. I get some suds on a rag and soap up the appliances, then use a wrung out clean rag to wipe the suds off. It cleans better than any spray. When I tried the Octagon in the same way, it left a film. Good soap, but I wont buy it as often as my Fels Naptha.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for a while, and I have used a lot of drugstore acne products throughout the years. Back then, I didn&#x27;t think about what kind of products I was using on my skin, and what kind of chemicals those products contained. However, recently, I am beginning to be conscious of what kinds of things I put on my skin. After reading that this soap was good for people with acne, I ordered 6 bars online (though not from Amazon).  One bar lasts you a long time! I bought them in May, and it&#x27;s now August, and I&#x27;ve only used about 1/3 of the bar. Another thing I like about it is that it good old-fashioned lye soap that doesn&#x27;t contain anything I can&#x27;t pronounce! It&#x27;s true soap. Like another reviewer said, it does dry out your skin, but after I wash my face, I just put my olive/hazelnut oil mixture on my face, and the dryness is taken care of. It&#x27;s a good soap for keeping your face clean, and it actually does help take care of your acne. I love this soap!</li>
    <li> I bought this on several reviews that it clears acne.  After using it for a few weeks, myself and my 2 daughters found it dried our skin to the point of burning it. We&#x27;ll use it for house cleaning thank you.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would get stains out prior to washing. I was told by 1 person Colgate Octagon and another Fels Naptha. Both products have been sold for almost a century. I located the Fels Naptha at the local Walmart, but the Colgate Octagon I had to buy online. I tried both on the same type of stains on the same types of fabric and in all honesty the Fels Naptha worked better. The Colgate Octagon smelled nicer but, didn&#x27;t rinse completely out of my laundry and it also crumbled more easily(that could be because it was an old bar, I really don&#x27;t know how fresh it was). The Fels Naptha cost less than a dollar at the local Wal-mart, the Colgate Octagon cost 3.5 times that. I tried finely grating the Colgate Octagon to use as dish soap(the person who recommended it stated it was a great dish soap) and well it just clumped together instead of melting and dissolving in the boiling water. So, I&#x27;ll just go with the Fels Naptha which rinsed completely out of the laundry, did not crumble when trying to rub it on a stain and cost so much less.</li>
    <li> Because it is a family favorite and local businesses no longer supply it.  It is quite costly though but something that works you don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra.</li>
    <li> NEVER HEARD OF THIS SOAP UNTIL I FOUND ON AMAZON AND IT WORKS!!  GREAT!!  SOAP THAT ACTUALLY GETS THE STAIN RIGHT OUT EVEN ON SILK, NO PROBLEMS, NO WORRY.  SMELLS GREAT!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific soap that has many, many uses.  It does a superb job at cutting grease which makes it ideal for cleaning greasy or oily surfaces or extra grimy clothes.  I recommend it especially for hands that have been in the garden or working on a car engine.  I really like the way laundry comes out with this - not perfumed, just plain clean-looking and clean-smelling.  I would judge it relatively mild, but the same qualities that make it so tough on grease also make it fairly drying to skin - especially sensitive skin and when used often over an extended period.  It dissolves well in water when made into flakes; A knife can be used to flake this soap, but I find that a cheese grater or kitchen microplane does an excellent job and helps the soap dissolve faster by making thinner flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap makes a great alternative to harsher detergents that are full of chemicals and it also replaces a whole cupboard of cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I highly recommend this at five stars, be careful about the purchase price.  It is a commodity that really ought to be pretty cheap and I&#x27;m not sure that purchasing this online versus plucking it off the local store shelf is going to fetch the best price.</li>
    <li> Who needs 12 different things to clean yourself and stuff around the house.  All you need is this. Dishes, laundry, surfaces...even wood.  I used to use Murphy Oil Soap in the paste form, but they have stopped making that.  This is what I am using now.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could have non-liquid soap in my suitcase to use for washing laundry. I like to pack in carry-on&#x27;s so I can only have so much liquid. This is perfect and worked very well last week on my trip to mexico.</li>
    <li> Coming from a college student who is living on his own, this is a great product. It makes cleaning pretty much anything (dishes, countertops, stoves and still is mild enough to use on hands) a snap, and is enjoyable to use. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, it seems to be a very smooth product. Scrap some off onto the rough/green side of your sponge and go to town!</li>
    <li> I started using Octagon soap a few months ago in my home made laundry detergent. Since then, I have been using it on everything. I clean my floors, dishes, cabinets, shower with this soap and have had fantastic results. I grated down a half bar and dissolved it in hot water to make a general household cleaner which is the greatest thing ever. I have a white kitchen floor and this gets out stains from the floor and the floor is dry within minutes. Take a scouring sponge to the bar version of this soap and it cleans dishes, slow cookers, etc effortlessly. This stuff is far better than the liquid soap available at the grocery stores. Shower cleaner is expensive, I figured I would try my dissolved Octagon Soap cleaner on the shower and it took off the soap scum. This product smells great and is an excellent money saver. I no longer have to buy floor cleaner, household cleaner, shower cleaner, laundry detergent, dish soap and the best thing is the bar version lasts forever. This product is a must have for every household. Yes, it is not as convenient as liquid soap, but it not only cleans better, but it is cheaper and the smell reminds me of my Grandmothers kitchen sink.</li>
    <li> I have been using Octagon soap for a month to wash our dishes. (Trying to rid our home of a lot of harsh chemicals, and go &#x27;ole school&#x27; as my family would say.) The bars are a pretty good size. So after going through one rather fast I decided to cut a bar in half and let it sit out on a shelf for about a week to harden. (Just like you would cure homemade soap.) (I cook all of our meals so I wash dishes two to three times a day.....I do have a dishwasher just hate to use it.) I have to say that the half size bars last a lot longer now.          Our dishes are a lot cleaner than when I used all the big name brand liquid handwashing soaps. I will not go back to using liquid handwashing soap again! I will continue to use this and a sink full of water with a half cup of vinegar to rinse our dishes. I hope this review helps someone. (BTW, I could not afford to buy as much as we need here on amazon.com; which normally I get almost everything I need or things that are too costily other places here. Luckily I found this at a local hispanic store called Compare Foods for $0.79 a bar. A neighbor has told me of a place called Thomas &amp; Howard in my area of SC carries it for $0.59 a bar. So I will be checking them out once we run out.)</li>
    <li> I was looking all over for octagon soap to make my home made dish liquid and could not find it anywhere...I was so thankful that Amazon had exactly what I was looking for. Not only did I recieve it in a timely manner but it was just what i wanted..cleans terrific!! Thanks again!</li>
    <li> 1 bar soap is too much $25 is too much</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand what everyone loves about this soap.  It&#x27;s expensive, hard to find, and doesn&#x27;t do anything more than any other soap does.  Plus it has a weird green dye in it so when you rub it on clothes it immediately looks like it&#x27;s staining them.  Yes the dye comes out of the clothes in the wash but why put it in there to begin with?  Soap doesn&#x27;t need dyes.    And the clothes don&#x27;t come out any more clean than with other soaps.  And then there&#x27;s the chore of having to grate it either with a knife or with a cheese grater.  Kind of weird and a real pain.  This isn&#x27;t 1924.  Anyway I won&#x27;t be purchasing another bar.  Like most anachronistic things such as old-fashioned straight razors, push lawnmowers, mechanical typewriters, etc., it seems better in the imagination than it turns out to be.</li>
    <li> ME AND MY FAMILY BEEN TAKING BATHS AND SHOWERS WITH THIS SOAP FOR YEARS AND IT&#x27;s AWSOME......REALLY GREAT ON SENSETIVE SKIN FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN&#x27;t USE SCENTED SOAP an Also ACNE.... IM SERIOUS......PLEASE TRY IT....ITS NOOOOO HARM ...</li>
    <li> I have used this Octagon soap for many things, and have had all positive results. So happy that I was able to find Dobbys Deals to provide it.&lt;br /&gt;You and Colgate Octagon have made me one happy customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for personal hygiene, both for hands and body. Not much of a scent, but what smell exists reminds me of old-school clean, like how my grandparents&#x27; house used to smell.  The soap removes dirt and oil with ease.  The bar also seems to last forever and a day, which is good for getting the most bang for my buck.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> What I love about this soap is how fresh it smells, not perfume-y.  It has great cleaning power and rinses out easily.</li>
    <li> Octagon soap by Colgate is actually a great product - one bar will go a long way when used to make your own dishwashing liquid detergent at home - will save you a ton of money on the long run. The ONLY reason this review gives one star is Octagon 7oz bars go for less than one dollar in the stores! Trouble is finding it in stores anymore. I urge you not to allow yourself to be ripped off at this artificially inflated price. Try instead to ask your local grocery store to order it for you. Buying Octagon here is a complete rip off.</li>
    <li> The product was not as good as it use to be. This may be because the product was old and new fresh bars are not available.</li>
    <li> bought this because the biting bugs and mosquitos are terrible here. Seems to help the itch when I dampen the bar and rub it over the bites</li>
    <li> Highway Robbery!  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!</li>
    <li> I went to many stores, markets, hardware, drug stores and was not able to find this product locally, which I remember being in supermarkets a few years ago with the other bar soap. I don&#x27;t know why this has been removed from the shelves. It&#x27;s just soap. Plain, kind of homely looking green bar. But, well-dried! Dry soap lasts longer. It does have a strong odor, but it sudses up well. I use it for soil stains on the soles of white socks that were walked on without shoes outdoors, a bad habit! Octagon soap worked pretty well getting the grunge out. I&#x27;m not driven to go white white white, so I was pleased with the results as the socks were not new. I soaked the socks in extremely hot water, let it cool, then sudsed on a washboard. Rinsed with a tad of white vinegar, wrung em out and put on line outside to dry in sun. Smelled good, and felt and looked clean. That&#x27;s what I needed!</li>
    <li> Have a yellow collar, cuffs, etc. on a shirt you just wore? Before washing, moisten the bar, rub it on the strain to get some suds going, then rub the collar fabric against itself, let it sit, and wash normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe they discontinued this product.</li>
    <li> used when in poison ivy batch to wash off skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing I wish it had not been discontinued!!!!! I would purchase it by the case if I could find more. It is the best spot remover ever and it will clear up poison ivy in two days max!!!!</li>
    <li> My 71 year old mother has been talking about how much she loves Octagon and she couldn&#x27;t get it in the stores anymore.  It is the best thing for taking stains out of clothes without ruining the colors in the fabrics.  She opened up the two new bars that I got for her on Christmas morning - you would have thought she got a diamond ring.  :-)</li>
    <li> great soap, to pricey for regular use!!</li>
    <li> I grew up having to use bar soaps, and I always hated the scummy residue they leave behind.  All I can say about this soap is it feels pure.  I actually bought it for laundry purposes though - wet stains and rub the soap on, let dry then wash.  Again, I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
    <li> This octagon soap is wonderful for \\&quot;bleaching\\&quot; my sons organic cotton burp cloths and wash clothes. We use it as a laundry booster as well and just love the fresh scent. Wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic all except price.  I used to get this at my supermarket for arond $2  and I had to pay  over $20. from Amazone.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely a great product but the price is outrageous. I just paid 79 cents for the same thing at the local grocery store....... I understand if you live in the middle of no-where that you may have no choice but to pay this much. I would shop around first though if you can.</li>
    <li> There is someone out there trying to rip people off. The site I viewed said I would get a case of soap and I received one bar for almost $26.00, then when I complained I received a little over $20.00. Someone has a nice con going on.</li>
    <li> price needs to go down for this little gem whats old should be shared not held just for the rich what about the middle class person that loves this item! If I to harsh sorry but I use to purchase this soap and it did everything but put a whole in my hand bag.</li>
    <li> A very good product. I travel with a bar of soap in the various countries that I travel too .</li>
    <li> good soap but the cost just for one bar toooo much.</li>
    <li> This soap is great for poison ivy ! And you can take that to the bank !</li>
    <li> Totally takes the itch away from poison ivy/oak for hours at a time. Just leave a thin film of it on your skin after washing with it and don&#x27;t rinse off. Works better than calamine lotion. And of course, when you are all cleared up you can use it for your dishes, laundry, and cleaning! Awesome old remedy.</li>
    <li> Octagon soap was what I was looking for and had not been able to find it locally.  After I purchased this item, I did find it at half the price.</li>
    <li> I think the soap works wonderfully. I use it to get stains out of clothing, especially ring around the collar; I love the feeling of being squeaky clean, so I even shower with it. I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the price. $10 for this soap is a rip-off. I was so excited that I found it on Amazon first, that I immediately assumed that this was the best price. However, after doing a little research. This soap can be found as low as .99 cents. 1000% mark up is a little absurd.</li>
    <li> one bar for 20 or more bucks false advertisement</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to treat exposure to poison sumac (as well as poison ivy).  I had a little difficulty finding it locally, but purchased it online.  It relieved the itching immediately, and with repeated use over the next several days the rash was gone.</li>
    <li> I started using this about 7 years ago as an alternative to the strongly perfumed but very effective Fels-Naptha.  Local grocery stores don&#x27;t carry Octagon, so I was getting it online.  I am sensitive to perfumed products, including soap and detergents, and I&#x27;ve noticed that Octagon didn&#x27;t leave me with itchy hands afterwards like most other dish soaps and household cleaners.  I&#x27;ve started using it for dishwashing - it&#x27;s great.  Just fill your sink with warm water and lather some Octagon onto a sponge, and it&#x27;ll clean anything.  A little goes a long way, too.  Cuts grease, and rinses easily.  Great (as the wrapper suggests) for dirty stovetops and cabinets, woodwork, the kitchen table, just about anything.  I&#x27;ve even used it for stubborn spots when washing the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s not marked as a body soap, it seems to work great for that, too.  I used to work in a restaurant and after long nights and coming home greasy, this did the trick in the shower.  Excellent for hand-washing clothing, too.  Keep a bar near your washing machine, and a bar near your kitchen sink.  The price is right, you&#x27;ll be satisfied.  This is one of those things that&#x27;s been around for over 100 years for a reason.  If there&#x27;s still a demand for it, Colgate-Palmolive hopefully won&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I have not used soap as yet, but have utmost confidence that it will do the job - very happy to have it in my possession.</li>
    <li> This soap is no longer made but I can still buy it in Manhattan, the world&#x27;s most expensive  island for 99 cents. I have bought other things on Amazon that are so over priced. The price on this soap is more than gold.  Amazon let&#x27;s customers get ripped off by these vendors.</li>
    <li> Um, I bought 20 bars of Octagon at a local can food store last year, it was on sale  2 for a $1. Yes, 50 cents a bar. Why is it so expensive now. It has the same wrapper and all.</li>
    <li> This soap, good as it is, is not worth $2, never mind  $20.00&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why the extreme rip off by this seller.&lt;br /&gt;There are other soaps, and as far as making my own dishwashing liquid goes, I&#x27;ll just buy Palmolive at $2 a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Are these people crazy?????&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it, shame on YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness, I found out its been discontinued and its very much in demand still. Nevertheless, the price is still higher than a cats back, and should be lowered to the price of a small steak maybe?????</li>
    <li> Best all purpose soap ever. It&#x27;s sad it&#x27;s being price gouged the way it is. This amazing soap use to sell for one dollar</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my aunt who just turned 101.  She uses nothing but brown soap and hardly has any wrinkles.  Its getting hard to find locally now that Colgate has discontinued manufacturing it after 100 years. Hope they continue to stock it so my aunt won&#x27;t be disappointed in the future. Excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I never realize people will charge 20 dollars for a bar of home made soap before.  I would buy again but it would have to be under 5 dollars.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product.  It is good for grease removal from clothes even set in stains.  If you come in contact with poison ivy and wash with this right after contact you will not break out.  My only problems with this product is it is hard to find and very expensive when you do lol, but I guess you pay for quality.</li>
    <li> Very good for the skin</li>
    <li> This soap is extremely overpriced.  I thought I was getting two cases, not two single bars.  In my opinion, this is not at all the same soap made by octagon years ago and what I expected.</li>
    <li> For $25.00 dollars a bar Ireally didn&#x27;t! Expect a bar that had been in stock for years and had swivel and was so crusty  it still hasn&#x27;t  reached the base of the soap,  nasty brown wrapper covered with plastic.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t look like something you should use on your face, but it definitely works. I have sensitive skin that reacts to just about everything, and this soap does wonders for me, and gives me no irritation. Gets rid of blemishes too.</li>
    <li> This little bar can be used alone with hand washing your clothing or you can add it to your recipe for home made laundry detergent that can be used in your washing machine (just not the new High Efficiency ones). Just a little bit of shavings will go a long way. I have it in my &amp;#34;lights out&amp;#34; laundry kit. Hurricane season is coming and I will still have clean clothes.</li>
