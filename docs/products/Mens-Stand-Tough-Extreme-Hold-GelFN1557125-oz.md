<li> A little dab will do ya!!</li>
<li> Hair Spray is to stiff and some gels are to weak.  </li>
<li> Not sure if I was unlucky and got another customer&#x27;s fake return.</li>
<li> then Redken stand tough.</li>
<li> Of course I opened the product too late and am now unable to return or exchange the product.</li>
<li> However this one I bought from Amazon feels like a fake.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this for about a year. This is the only hair care product of its kind that I can say I would keep using. It holds well, doesn&#x27;t flake, doesn&#x27;t look like a bunch of gunk in your hair, works well when the look is short or long. It even stands up in the wind and rain.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Have been using it for several years now.</li>
    <li> only product my hubby will put on his hair.</li>
    <li> This gel is great.  It holds strong and smells good too!</li>
    <li> This is a great product either if you just put it in and comb it to your style or put it end and blow it dry and then style</li>
    <li> This gives my hair an unpleasant texture and didn&#x27;t seem to hold my hair as well as I thought it would</li>
    <li> Let my start off by saying that I have used a great deal of different hair gel products in my time and this product, without a doubt, is the best I&#x27;ve come across.  There are so many products these days which claim to have \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; but very few live up to their promise.  Redken provides a fantastic hold which will last throughout the entire day.  It also creates a nice shine and one that you won&#x27;t have to worry about flaking off either.  There is no other hair gel that can compare to the quality of it.  Redken is very much in a league of it&#x27;s own and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a superior hair gel.</li>
    <li> The best gel ever . No sticky resedue, firm hold.</li>
    <li> Good price and best gel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair gels or pomade for over a decade now. I like to spike my hair (no I&#x27;m not from Jersey). I don&#x27;t like waking-up in the morning and having flakes all over my hair. This product doesn&#x27;t flake my hair. This product smells good and it holds the spike. Also, you only need to use a small amount, like a dime or nickel sized amount, for short hairs. Because of its size, you may have issues traveling and boarding a plane, due to airport restrictions. So my wishlist is a smaller size for carry-on. I was introduced to Redken from my local Supercuts.</li>
    <li> i liked it a lot and I never go out home without using it. I have very lite soft hair and which was trouble my whole life time. This is the only product which hold it in right place !</li>
    <li> A clean and hip styling gel, pleasant masculine scent and holds all steady all day long. I keep my hair short and somewhat messed-up appearing, so this product works just fine.  Not sure about longer hair styles since I don&#x27;t wear mine with length.</li>
    <li> A bottle of this lasts me 3 months.  With damp dry hair, I use 1/4 a dime in my hair and it holds it&#x27;s shape all day.  I let it dry, then run my fingers through it.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for approx. 6-8 years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find on the shelves, unless you can find a hair salon that sales the product.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I order several tubes when I place my order.&lt;br /&gt;This is such a great price that it&#x27;s hard to pass up.</li>
    <li> I prefer gel over pomades,pastes, fibers,waxes, etc.  The only problem is I have thin hair and in the sun my scalp tends to show.  This is the ONLY gel I have ever tried and I have tried hundreds that does not expose my scalp.  I makes my hair look full.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  I can go on and on.  Absolutely, the Best!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair gel for men.</li>
    <li> it helps me look like donald draper.  who doesn&#x27;t want to have donald drapers hair.  the fancy comb works well with it.</li>
    <li> Great hold for a great price, what else is there to say?</li>
    <li> Product is clean, not sticky or stiff, easy hair care, scentless, excellent professional appearance.  A little dab will do ya!!</li>
    <li> Its the only gel I have used since i discovered it four years ago. It hold your hair perfectly and its not greasy</li>
    <li> This gel is the best in the market hold your hair in place all day long and washes off with no effort</li>
    <li> I use the Redken Stand Tough Extrem Hold when I know the weather requires some extra protection.  Hair Spray is to stiff and some gels are to weak.  Extreme Hold takes a windy day out of the equation.  Between home and your destination, be it work or play, a lot can happen to mess with your hair. A quick &amp;#34;brush up&amp;#34; and you look like you just left home. A little dab will last all day. DON&#x27;T OVER DO IT!</li>
    <li> Oh man,  this is the one.  Ive tried many hair products and i just couldn&#x27;t be satisfied, until i found this.  I have curly hair so its a mess. This product does the job. It keeps my hair just where it needs to be before coming messy. I definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a hard challenge.</li>
    <li> On time and packed well husband loves this stuff</li>
    <li> This gel is for guys who needs a lot of hair control.&lt;br /&gt;Works great with straight hair. Gives a little bit of shine.  Used it for many years and so far can&#x27;t find anything better then Redken stand tough.</li>
    <li> This great stuff but wholesale to professional price is around $7.  Redken is not scarce - get with you stylist and see what they will do, if you are a good customer you might be surprised what you could get it for.</li>
    <li> excellent product and have ordered many times!</li>
    <li> Very sticky when applying, but holds very well all day.  Like glue for your hair!</li>
    <li> Very stiff and great for hair that lacks body. Don&#x27;t use too much, though!</li>
    <li> All day hold, nice scent too. I have used this product for a few years now, tried others but always come back to it.</li>
    <li> I previously bought this product from a store and the product smelled and worked great! However this one I bought from Amazon feels like a fake. First it smells really bad. Second the label does not look the same as the one I got in store (not as shiny and label was misaligned). Not sure if I was unlucky and got another customer&#x27;s fake return. Of course I opened the product too late and am now unable to return or exchange the product.</li>
    <li> This is the only gel my husband will use.  But it is much cheaper if you can find a salon that carries it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff! Won&#x27;t use anything else. He&#x27;s just a regular guy, not a hipster, but is picky about how his hair looks.</li>
    <li> This is industrial strength hair goop.  It will last all day in &amp;#34;firm helmet&amp;#34; mold unless you run your hand through it - then it softens.  I have tried many products and this the firmest I can find while at the same time allowing itself to become more natural if the user wishes</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell of this gel.  It gave me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the product worked well.&lt;br /&gt;I use Redken 16 which has no smell, and I will go back to it again.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and as described.  Works really well without leaving my hair feeling like plastic or looking like an anime character.</li>
    <li> Been using this gell for years and I love it and it works as advertised!</li>
    <li> Fantastic hold and great Armani scent. I&#x27;ve used this for years. Makes a great aphrodisiac when mixed with alcohol too!</li>
    <li> this is the best product for any man with a crew cut or a military Flat Top haircut. It works great!  The Cure for the Flat Top Haircut.  Buy it NOW!</li>
    <li> This product works great. I will hold all day and does good. Will buy this product again. Doesn&#x27;t take much product.</li>
    <li> This works good for thick and thin hair. It holds your hair in place all day.</li>
    <li> Yes. The product shipped as I ordered and was exactly what I was looking for. Medium bodied hold with a matte finish.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this and I use it to.  I like the male fragrance and it is not too heavy in my hair.</li>
    <li> Use it in moring and unless I go to the gym, I do not have to recomb or restyle the rest of the day. Great  product!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is a little thin.  This gel works great at holding it in place, but is a little bit intense.  Having never tried the medium version of this gel, I can&#x27;t compare it to that, but I&#x27;d imagine it would be better for thinner hair.  This was still a great product though!</li>
    <li> Great hair gel, shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I&#x27;m female but this product is terrific.  If you have short hair that needs a nice lift try this on.  So easy to freshen your style late in the day by just running your dampened fingers thru your hair.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> This product does what it is intended to do. It allows me to quickly get my hair in place and myself out the door. You won&#x27;t have to fool with your hair again, whether indoors or outside.  A little goes a long way.</li>
