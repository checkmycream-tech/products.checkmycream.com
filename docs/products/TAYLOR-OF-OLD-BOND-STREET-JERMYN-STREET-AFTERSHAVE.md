      <li>Its pleasant and not overpowering, and it was a smell</li>
      <li>Great after shave, smells amazing.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;ve all had good consistency.</li>
      <li>Good manly scent.</li>
      <li>Theres a cologne spray as well which its amazing, the scent is so good you wont need to put cologne.</li>
      <li>Good smell, nice skin feel but</li>
      <li>The scent is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Really good product I tried so many cause of my ingrown hairs</li>
      <li>Great stuff, mild scent that requires you to get close to appreciate.  </li>
      <li>(Honestly, Art of Shaving aftershaves are better than this.)</li>
      <li>It leaves a lovely scent which it is amazing,</li>
      <li>you wouldn&#x27;t think the combination would go, but the coral skin food Rose scent lightens the Jermyn just enough and the result is perfect!</li>
      <li>like most others say, it&#x27;s a bit too watery for what I&#x27;m spending.</li>
      <li>but besides that I love it.</li>
      <li>As with most of their shaving creams, the scent is a bit understated.  </li>
      <li>does what it&#x27;s supposed to beautifully, it soothes any razor burn you might have, smells AMAZING, and when used in just right amounts, leaves my skin feeling super smooth and irresistible.</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
      <li>I only use English/UK shaving products because they are superior to anything we have in the States -- except this!</li>
      <li>The aftershave cream feels cool and refreshing on my face.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light ,perfumy, and  </li>
      <li>Leaves the skin smooth, soothed, and refreshed after shaving.</li>
      <li>so I enjoy</li>
      <li>besides that buy this without regret and confidence you will enjoy this.</li>
      <li>Ive been using this product for quite some time, it leaves your skin so smooth and clean that I dont even have to apply lotion.</li>
      <li>My face feels smooth and clean .</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite!</li>
      <li>Combined with the same shaving cream, it is a really nice aftershave. :)</li>
      <li>But Taylor of Old Bond is simply the best.  </li>
      <li>The scent is sweet but not cloying.</li>
      <li>They smell great and the value compared to other so called high-end products is unbeatable.</li>
      <li>it is easy on the nose and the ladies really seem to be attracted to it.</li>
      <li>I love Taylor of old Bond Street products, even get my haircut on Jermyn St when I&#x27;m in London.</li>
      <li>The stuff went from a crean to a liquid right after I started using it.</li>
      <li>Its a good product though my skin seems to be a little more sensitive for it.  </li>
      <li>and when you open the top it will just come out so you have been warned.....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so runny that it honestly feels like a watered down lotion, not even</li>
      <li>to calm razor burn and seems to have no styptic action.</li>
      <li>I think I much prefer their gel aftershaves.</li>
      <li>so I cant really ignor ingrown Hairs</li>
      <li>My girlfriend really loves the way it smells too which id&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
      <li>but someone who really doesnt suffer so much from it wont regret it.</li>
      <li>Yes, I know it&#x27;s without alcohol, but so are many other aftershaves I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>This is also more of a lotion, mine was kind of runnier than i expected, and if i leave it open upside down it will drip out.</li>
      <li>The main issue I had with this is that doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
      <li>If it stayed exactly the same, i wouldn&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is a moisturizing, easy to apply a little</li>
      <li>an absolute total flop.</li>
      <li>The scent is a young scent think early 20&#x27;s</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s harsher for sensitive skin than parabens or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is advertised for sensitive skin and has lived up to the product claims.  </li>
      <li>The quality of this product is everything that I have come to expect from Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
      <li>Oh, and the ingredients in this do not tailor (no pun intended) to a sensitive skin&#x27;s needs.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, like me, I would take a look at Castle Forbes&#x27; Lavender Aftershave and L&#x27;Occitane Cade Aftershave.</li>
      <li>So if you are young or just like me young at heart</li>
      <li>Must have been old stock.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten into TOBS products in a major way.  </li>
      <li>Second, it cools down your face after shaving and stops razor burn quickly.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product I wish it was a little thicker</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve gotten into TOBS products in a major way.  </li>
<li> Second, it cools down your face after shaving and stops razor burn quickly.  </li>
<li> I really like this product I wish it was a little thicker</li>
<li> I like the scent, not a huge fan of the consistency, it&#x27;s like a very watery lotion.</li>
<li> this will not only make it last longer, but when you use too much i find my skin feels a bit greasy to the touch, which is something i have not experienced with my TOBS sandalwood aftershave gel.</li>
<li> goes a very long way balm.</li>
<li> My only complaint is it is more like a milk than a balm very thin</li>
<li> /&gt;Use as LITTLE as possible.</li>
<li> But, the aftershave is a total waste of time and money.</li>
<li> And absolutely no product residue feeling or greasy feeling</li>
<li> It is very soft and subtle.</li>
<li> There is absolutely no chemical or alcohol feel to this or a medicine cabinet feel like other aftershaves.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> have used other TOBS, Geo F. Trumpers, Castle Forbes, ect.</li>
<li> cost about 25.00 to get it to my door which is 15.00 over other brands that I could have</li>
<li> a typical aftershave is expected of: close pores, stop bleeding and moisturize the skin among other things.</li>
<li> This was so runny, it wouldn&#x27;t even sink into my pores -- it quite literally just ran down my face.&lt;br</li>
<li> If it were a little thicker i wouldn&#x27;t mind.</li>
<li> It does seem a little watery</li>
<li> Im an everyday shaver and have tried almost every product you find int he super-market.  </li>
<li> There is very little smell</li>
<li> I combined this with Coral Skin Food and the result is unbelievable both for skin comfort and for the resulting scent.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other Taylor aftershave balms that have been very thick and creamy, this one is so runny</li>
<li> I am positively shocked in regards to the performance and consistency of this &amp;#34;cream.&amp;#34; The aftershave cream I bought was directly from the flagship store in England.</li>
<li> The consistency of this cream is thick and takes some doing to rub it into your face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> aftershaves and this Jermyn Street Aftershave &amp;#34;Cream&amp;#34; was so pathetic, I almost want to buy an airline ticket to England just to return it.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten into TOBS products in a major way.  Their shaving creams are excellent and so is this aftershave.  As with most of their shaving creams, the scent is a bit understated.  The aftershave cream feels cool and refreshing on my face.  A great way to end a shave and start the day.</li>
    <li> The stuff went from a crean to a liquid right after I started using it. Must have been old stock.</li>
    <li> The scent is AMAZING. Its pleasant and not overpowering, and it was a smell i just enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use as LITTLE as possible. this will not only make it last longer, but when you use too much i find my skin feels a bit greasy to the touch, which is something i have not experienced with my TOBS sandalwood aftershave gel. This is also more of a lotion, mine was kind of runnier than i expected, and if i leave it open upside down it will drip out. If it were a little thicker i wouldn&#x27;t mind. If it stayed exactly the same, i wouldn&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does what it&#x27;s supposed to beautifully, it soothes any razor burn you might have, smells AMAZING, and when used in just right amounts, leaves my skin feeling super smooth and irresistible. Buy this now!</li>
    <li> The consistency of this cream is thick and takes some doing to rub it into your face. The scent is sweet but not cloying. The main issue I had with this is that doesn&#x27;t do anything to calm razor burn and seems to have no styptic action.</li>
    <li> Number one this is a great great company TOBS is one of the best brands anyone could ever buy period. The scent is a young scent think early 20&#x27;s but hey I&#x27;m 36 and still like to feel like I&#x27;m 25 so I enjoy it&#x27;s light ,perfumy, and  playful scent and it is easy on the nose and the ladies really seem to be attracted to it. So if you are young or just like me young at heart this is a moisturizing, easy to apply a little goes a very long way balm. My only complaint is it is more like a milk than a balm very thin and when you open the top it will just come out so you have been warned..... besides that buy this without regret and confidence you will enjoy this.</li>
    <li> Luxury after shave.  Im an everyday shaver and have tried almost every product you find int he super-market.  But Taylor of Old Bond is simply the best.  It refreshes my skin and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite! I combined this with Coral Skin Food and the result is unbelievable both for skin comfort and for the resulting scent. you wouldn&#x27;t think the combination would go, but the coral skin food Rose scent lightens the Jermyn just enough and the result is perfect!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, mild scent that requires you to get close to appreciate.  Combined with the same shaving cream, it is a really nice aftershave. :)</li>
    <li> Great aftershave balm with a great scent that is identical to the Jermyn Street shaving cream.  Although this is identified as for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;, I prefer the &amp;#34;Mr. Taylor&#x27;s&amp;#34; balm simply because the Jermyn Street can sometimes be a bit astringent after a shave  with a too-dull razor.</li>
    <li> Leaves the skin smooth, soothed, and refreshed after shaving. The scent isn&#x27;t too over powering and women seem to like it. The quality of this product is everything that I have come to expect from Taylor of Old Bond Street. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great after shave, smells amazing. It does seem a little watery but I don&#x27;t mind. Goes great with the jermyn shaving soap</li>
    <li> I really like this product I wish it was a little thicker but besides that I love it. My girlfriend really loves the way it smells too which id&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
    <li> Its a good product though my skin seems to be a little more sensitive for it.  I like the scent.</li>
    <li> I like the scent, not a huge fan of the consistency, it&#x27;s like a very watery lotion. I think I much prefer their gel aftershaves.</li>
    <li> I am positively shocked in regards to the performance and consistency of this &amp;#34;cream.&amp;#34; The aftershave cream I bought was directly from the flagship store in England. So, it&#x27;s not like it was tampered with along the line. I only use English/UK shaving products because they are superior to anything we have in the States -- except this! It&#x27;s so runny that it honestly feels like a watered down lotion, not even a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other TOBS, Geo F. Trumpers, Castle Forbes, ect. aftershaves and this Jermyn Street Aftershave &amp;#34;Cream&amp;#34; was so pathetic, I almost want to buy an airline ticket to England just to return it. Not only is it runny, but it doesn&#x27;t even perform. Yes, I know it&#x27;s without alcohol, but so are many other aftershaves I&#x27;ve used and they&#x27;ve all had good consistency. This was so runny, it wouldn&#x27;t even sink into my pores -- it quite literally just ran down my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also just a junk performance product. It did not do ANYTHING a typical aftershave is expected of: close pores, stop bleeding and moisturize the skin among other things. Oh, and the ingredients in this do not tailor (no pun intended) to a sensitive skin&#x27;s needs. Sure, it&#x27;s paraben free. But, it contains parfum/fragrance. That&#x27;s harsher for sensitive skin than parabens or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an absolute total flop. I&#x27;m disappointed. Although, I will say the Jermyn Shaving Cream lathered and shaved well. But, the aftershave is a total waste of time and money. If you have sensitive skin, like me, I would take a look at Castle Forbes&#x27; Lavender Aftershave and L&#x27;Occitane Cade Aftershave. (Honestly, Art of Shaving aftershaves are better than this.) It is just a watery, runny, lotion-y product that does 0 to help post-shaving.</li>
    <li> Good smell, nice skin feel but like most others say, it&#x27;s a bit too watery for what I&#x27;m spending. I like it, but I&#x27;ll probably continue my search for the perfect aftershave after this.</li>
    <li> I love Taylor of old Bond Street products, even get my haircut on Jermyn St when I&#x27;m in London. They smell great and the value compared to other so called high-end products is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for quite some time, it leaves your skin so smooth and clean that I dont even have to apply lotion. It leaves a lovely scent which it is amazing, no iratation whats so ever. Im Latino so I cant really ignor ingrown Hairs but someone who really doesnt suffer so much from it wont regret it. Theres a cologne spray as well which its amazing, the scent is so good you wont need to put cologne. Its actaully an after shave. Look for it. I assure you, u wont regret it. Really good product I tried so many cause of my ingrown hairs but this is the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Taylor aftershave balms that have been very thick and creamy, this one is so runny it&#x27;s almost like water. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Real nice aftershave lotion.</li>
    <li> Great! Soothing. Good manly scent. Stops nicks in their tracks. A little goes a long way. Would buy again. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Feels great after a shave and smells awesome.</li>
    <li> I am only giving this 4 stars because I think this is over priced.  All said and done it cost about 25.00 to get it to my door which is 15.00 over other brands that I could have bought.&lt;br /&gt;This is advertised for sensitive skin and has lived up to the product claims.  It is very soft and subtle. There is very little smell so no dies or perfumes that irritate.  Second, it cools down your face after shaving and stops razor burn quickly.  There is absolutely no chemical or alcohol feel to this or a medicine cabinet feel like other aftershaves.  My face feels smooth and clean . And absolutely no product residue feeling or greasy feeling either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again but am trying to find cheaper price.</li>
