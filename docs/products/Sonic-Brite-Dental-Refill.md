      <li>I have been using Sonic Brite for many years and absolutely love it for my dentures.</li>
      <li>There is NO WAY that this refill costs more than a couple of dollars for SonicBrite to manufacture.</li>

      <li>It works beautifully and I&#x27;ll use it as long as it remains available.</li>
      <li>Since the original device comes with the cleaning powder (the refill costs $20)</li>

      <li>So I bought a different cleaner that was cheaper and works better.</li>

      <li>Will certainly purchase again when needed.</li>

      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Use the product in my little sonic machine every morning to get my invisible braces clean and fresh for the day</li>
      <li>Rather than purchasing the refill, you&#x27;d be better off buying the entire system again and reselling only the machine on an auction site to someone who only needs the machine and make up some of your money.</li>
      <li>This stuff cleans them fast and there is no after taste left by chemicals.</li>
      <li>Sure wish I knew about this last week before I spent $40 on a different product!</li>
      <li>B0014ST5Y4 SonicBrite Professional Cleansing System]]</li>
      <li>the way, Sonicbrite charges $12.95 for their refill if you purchase from their site directly.</li>
      <li>I have just a few spots that still do not get fully clean from my teeth in the back, but this cleans my braces very well.</li>
      <li>I wear partials and was having a difficult time keeping them completely clean and free of buildup along the edges, even though I used the tablet cleaners.</li>
      <li>At the end of my 4 weeks wearing a set of aligners I do notice a &#x27;clouding&#x27; effect making the aligners looks slightly opaque instead of the transparent condition when first worn.  </li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DO ANY MORE THAN WHAT OTHER PRODUCTS I HAVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST</li>
      <li>We use this product to clean &#x27;invisible&#x27; style &#x27;braces&#x27;, commonly called Aligners.  </li>
      <li>I feel this is a very small price to pay for the pristinely clean feel of my aligners.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with dentures or other dental contraptions that need cleaning.</li>

<li> and that is the EGREGIOUS price of $16.99 that Amazon charges for the refill, which is almost HALF of what the entire system costs.</li>
<li> This works well on my Invisalign and AOA aligners, but it does have a slight chlorine like smell to it that can last an hour or so.</li>
<li> The cleaner is rather expensive, but worth it.</li>

<li> Just a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I have been using these crystals along with the Sonic Cleaning machine religiously for the past three years.</li>
<li> Product is as expected and the only complaint I would have is that it is costly.</li>
<li> and I no longer have the taste of food previously eaten.  </li>
<li> Let SonicBrite stick to making these little machines.</li>
<li> I use it everyday.  </li>
<li> It took a few soakings and all the stains</li>
<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s too harsh for the orthodic</li>
<li> ADVERTISING IS NOT TRUE IN THE LEAST</li>
<li> With this they are sparkling everyday!</li>
<li> I was skeptical about this product actually removing all stains from my dentures.  </li>
<li> Ingredients are sodium thiosulfate and ammonium sulfate--NOT expensive ingredients.</li>
<li> If the denture feels oily, like after fried chicken, then I take about a 1/2&amp;#34; sized dab of toothpaste and rub it on like soap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works great.  I have used it for years and wouldn&#x27;t change for anything.&lt;br /&gt;I use the machine that goes with it.</li>
    <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.  Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or funny taste.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased the refill of the powder to use with the $50 Sonic Bright device.  The device stopped working a week after I got the refill.  Since the original device comes with the cleaning powder (the refill costs $20) I emailed Sonic Brite asking since I have the refill could I get the cleaner for $30.  Nothing, nada, no reply at all!!!!  So I bought a different cleaner that was cheaper and works better. The other problem I&#x27;ve had (hence the title of this review) is that the powder, if you&#x27;re not careful, will bleach your towels!!!</li>
    <li> This product works great! Did you know that you don&#x27;t need to discard after each use? I soak my dentures in 40/50 apple cider vinegar and water. That&#x27;s my go-to solution. I do not have odor or scale build-up on my dentures. They stay fresh. However, when my denture needs whitening, I use Sonic Brite for 15 minutes. It works without the ultrasonic cleaning machine if you don&#x27;t have one.  I brush the denture lightly, and keep it in the vinegar-water when not wearing, and that&#x27;s that. If the denture feels oily, like after fried chicken, then I take about a 1/2&amp;#34; sized dab of toothpaste and rub it on like soap. Cuts any greasy film perfectly, and leaves a slight mint taste. The vinegar doesn&#x27;t always eliminate the greasiness like toothpaste does.  I found this product online just now at sonicbrite dot com! Sure wish I knew about this last week before I spent $40 on a different product! They have the solution refills for $13.95 each, as well as the clearing units which are battery operated.  You only use 1/4 teaspoon at a time for dentures and retainers, and needn&#x27;t discard it after each use, so this little bottle will last a LONG time.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time on my dentures and they feel so great when they are finshed and they stay that way for day the item arrived in great shape and for that I say Thank You</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; teeth.  I have been trying many different products to see which I like the best.  This is one of them.  I bought it with the &amp;#34;sonic brite machine&amp;#34;  I use it everyday.  Am on the second refill.</li>
    <li> We use this product to clean &#x27;invisible&#x27; style &#x27;braces&#x27;, commonly called Aligners.  Both of us have been extremely satisfied with the resulting clean feeling AND the deodorizing effect having used this product in conjunction with their Ultra-Sonic battery-operated cleaning device.  We have used this product for over 2 years and it has consistently performed well (follow directions carefully).  We use Sonic Brite once per day to thoroughly clean the aligners (which are worn 20-22 hrs./day).  For the first few weeks of wearing Aligners, I forgot about this product and was so frustrated with the &#x27;fuzzy/furry&#x27; feel of the aligners regardless of what I used to clean them with my toothbrush (e.g., toothpaste, liquid soap, etc.).  However, using the cleaning device with Sonic Brite solves this &#x27;fuzzy/furry&#x27; problem and I no longer have the taste of food previously eaten.  There is some kind of  &#x27;bleach-like product&#x27; in Sonic Brite as it has permanently stained some towels, but once we realized this was happening, it was easy to avoid.  At the end of my 4 weeks wearing a set of aligners I do notice a &#x27;clouding&#x27; effect making the aligners looks slightly opaque instead of the transparent condition when first worn.  I feel this is a very small price to pay for the pristinely clean feel of my aligners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for several years. It works beautifully and I&#x27;ll use it as long as it remains available. I also have the Sonic Brite electrical unit. It works too, but I wish it was AC.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DO ANY MORE THAN WHAT OTHER PRODUCTS I HAVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST THERE ADVERTISING IS NOT TRUE IN THE LEAST</li>
    <li> Using this product along with Sonic Brite cleaner, works very well. Product is as expected and the only complaint I would have is that it is costly.</li>
    <li> Use the product in my little sonic machine every morning to get my invisible braces clean and fresh for the day</li>
    <li> I wear partials and was having a difficult time keeping them completely clean and free of buildup along the edges, even though I used the tablet cleaners. I bought the SonicBrite Professional Cleaner and was absolutely impressed by the results the very first time I used it. It is so easy to use and does a super job! Thank you, SonicBrite!!![[ASIN:B0014ST5Y4 SonicBrite Professional Cleansing System]]</li>
    <li> This works well on my Invisalign and AOA aligners, but it does have a slight chlorine like smell to it that can last an hour or so. I only use this once or twice a week, and I use Retainer Brite tabs the other days. I use both with the sonic container that vibrates.</li>
    <li> I have been using these crystals along with the Sonic Cleaning machine religiously for the past three years. This is an excellent product that works extremly well. I highly recommend this for anyone with dentures or other dental contraptions that need cleaning.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product actually removing all stains from my dentures.  It actually works!  It took a few soakings and all the stains were gone...I love it!</li>
    <li> got what I wanted and was at my door quicker than they said it was going to be here&lt;br /&gt;xxxxx</li>
    <li> This cleaner works well; however,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ONE issue and that is the EGREGIOUS price of $16.99 that Amazon charges for the refill, which is almost HALF of what the entire system costs. Rather than purchasing the refill, you&#x27;d be better off buying the entire system again and reselling only the machine on an auction site to someone who only needs the machine and make up some of your money. There is NO WAY that this refill costs more than a couple of dollars for SonicBrite to manufacture. It is a persulfate cleanser. Ingredients are sodium thiosulfate and ammonium sulfate--NOT expensive ingredients. If you&#x27;d like the MSDS report, you can find it on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many alternatives to supporting SonicBrite&#x27;s greedy up-charging. Google this and you&#x27;ll find many simple recipes for cleaning your mouthpiece (night guard) with household items you probably already have. Do yourself a favor and save the money. Yeah, everyone has to make a buck, right? But if you don&#x27;t want to pay their over-over-inflated price for the refill, just make your own. Let SonicBrite stick to making these little machines. Don&#x27;t support the greedy inflated prices on the refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Sonicbrite charges $12.95 for their refill if you purchase from their site directly.</li>
    <li> This the BEST dewnture cleaner I have EVER used. I had a dentis clean my dentures and two days later they were stained again. With this they are sparkling everyday!</li>
    <li> Great product for cleaning your teeth. Sonic washer is great and powder keeps your teeth sparkling and non-yellowing.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a week and a tablet in between. Clean dentures also help to give you clean breath after you use mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Keeps my dentures super clean and very easy to use in their denture bath product.  Will certainly purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT, I USE IT 2 TO 3 TIMES PER WEEK. I AM A COFFE DRINKER AND SMOKER AND THIS STUFF GETS THE STAINS OF MY DENTURES WONDERFULLY, EVEN MY DENTIST COMMENTED ON HOW CLEAN THEY WERE WHEN I SAW HIM LAST TIME. WOULD DEFIANTLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonic Brite for many years and absolutely love it for my dentures. Nothing keeps them cleaner. I even take it with me when I travel. My dentist was so thrilled with the appearance of my dentures, she now recommends the cleaner system to all her patients.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad.  He really likes the denture machine and cleaner.  The cleaner is rather expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> When used with a battery powered vibrating machine, also purchased via Prime, you too can flash a bright smile! The product lasts quite a time because you need only sprinkle a quarter teaspoon of it into the machine.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. Works as promised, very easy to use. I would highly recommend this product. I have had dentures for over 42 years. I have tried polident, and many other products. This stuff cleans them fast and there is no after taste left by chemicals. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Cleans better than the tablets but I only use once or twice a week. Not sure if it&#x27;s too harsh for the orthodic so I use it sparingly just in case.</li>
    <li> This has been the only cleaner that I&#x27;ve tried for my Invisalign braces, aside from Invisalign&#x27;s product. It works well. I have just a few spots that still do not get fully clean from my teeth in the back, but this cleans my braces very well.</li>
    <li> This keeps my retainers clean.</li>
