      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or crunchy once the set is dry and brush out is pretty much the same.</li>
      <li>It took me a couple of tries before I got the water to Lottaboy proportions right, but now that I have, I use this product every time I wet-set my hair.  </li>
      <li>Often it is hard to find a spray / lotion tha t works well with blonde hair to make sure it &#x27;holds&#x27; this spray works well with blonde hair.</li>
      <li>I have long, very fine-textured hair that tends to be dry.  </li>
      <li>I think I used a little too much though because my hair was harder than normal.</li>

    <li> Works just fine. I think I used a little too much though because my hair was harder than normal. I will use less next time.</li>
    <li> Great for quick sets, and it will hold your style for hours!  Does not flake!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my type 1 hair unless I mixed it with a mousse or gel.  Works well for my mom&#x27;s 2b hair though.  Will repurchase for her</li>
    <li> I use this with an overnight foam roller set.  I have thick, straight, smooth hair and have struggled to achieve the curl and bounce I desire.  Much better results than with any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  Non-offensive smell.  No crispness or dullness.  Easy to brush out.  Lasts 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> I used this on my daughters thin blond hair and it worked pretty good. I used it with soft pink rollers so I was not heat damaging her hair. I need to figure out how much water to mix with it and a better way to apply it (I had a squeeze bottle then combed it through...) You would mix it differently for different hair types, of course. It smelled nice and did not leave her hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; and the curls stayed all day!</li>
    <li> This product is great if you follow the instructions, and use it for setting your curls or pulling your hair back for a great smooth and shiny looking pony tail. Do not over use the product dilute it as instructed, it only takes a small amount to set your hair.</li>
    <li> They put this setting stuff on me one time in the beauty salon and its the bomb. you can have this one when you wash your hair , then apply your conditioner. then wash off conditioner and then apply the amazing  setting lotion. Please keeps it realz with all your answers,</li>
    <li> Got this product for grandma so she could set her hair. According to her it&#x27;s awesome :) Will def buy again when she&#x27;s running out!</li>
    <li> Timely shipping. Product as described.</li>
    <li> I just started using rollers for my hair and this provides amazing soft curls with no flaking.  It smells good, too!</li>

    <li> This stuff is great! If you roll, pin curl, or rag roll your hair this stuff is just great. My hair is very long and thick. This stuff makes my curls come out shiny and soft with great ends. Too much though can make it somewhat crisp and flaky though so you have to test until you get the right concentration. My boyfriends hair has a cowlicky life of it&#x27;s own. I mixed him a weak batch and it helps keep him from sporting the vagrant style all the way through to the next morning.</li>
    <li> I love this setting lotion. I have long, very fine-textured hair that tends to be dry.  In a 1:4 concentration this gives me great waves - very soft, good hold, zero frizz.</li>
    <li> Perfect..i love my purchase</li>
    <li> I looked far and wide for something that would curl my Asian hair for my wedding (being the DIY bride that I insisted on being), and have it STAY that way! After going through numerous kinds of curlers, sprays, and irons, I had just about give up hope and figured I&#x27;d leave my hair straight for that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days before, this was my hail Mary. I diluted it as directed, sprayed a little just to get my hair damp, and put the flat iron through it. Gadzooks, was that...was that a bouncy curl?!?! IT WAS. Giddy, I went through half of my head, and was pleased that the curls stayed when I finished the other half. Seriously the bar was set THAT low, to be ecstatic that a curl stays for longer than 20 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did more than stay for 20 minutes, it stayed for the entire day! I will never look at another hairstyling product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 oz is more than enough for someone who only curls their hair occasionally. As it happens, the wedding (and the related test day) was the only time I&#x27;ve used it, and I&#x27;ve maybe gone through half an oz of the undiluted stuff. Whereas it seemed that I went through half a bottle of hairspray for curls that fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m reviewing this product on Amazon since Amazon is pretty much the place to go to read reviews, but definitely buy this at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. It&#x27;s just a little over $5 there. Quality for a low price, what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Love this product! Definitely has great hold without your hair flaking or looking too hard. I do dilute mine with 1:3 lottabody to water. Having natural hair gives me versatility to have any kind of hairstyle. Lottabody helps with that straight look with body for my roller sets and flexi rod sets. However, I would purchase at Walmart or BSS. Much cheaper for 8oz bottle. Like 2-5 dollars</li>
    <li> Super strong and Great for stating .</li>
    <li> Mixes well with water. Really helps my wet-set get staying power. This awesome stuff is making my pin curl sets last 3-4 days with minimum upkeep. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or crunchy once the set is dry and brush out is pretty much the same.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOD I can&#x27;t believe I never used this stuff before. This product is insane...my curls last for ages and my sets are always glossy and shapely as opposed to frizzy and yucky. I use it before I pop in curlers, before I use a curling iron, and it makes really fabulous beachy waves if you spritz it in damp hair. You have to dillute this bottle, which is great because you get more &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; than what&#x27;s in the actual bottle. I had heard about this stuff for years and only finally started using it and I wish I&#x27;d have started sooner...another advantage of this is my hair is healthier and growing faster as a result of not using heat tools on it as frequently!</li>
    <li> Worked great for keeping long hair curly!</li>
    <li> Pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve bought the setting lotion. Either I can&#x27;t get the water/formula mixed correctly or it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> For fine hair , you will need to dilute more than the directions indicate.</li>
    <li> I like this as it makes my hair sparkle (it was looking so dry)!  I delute with 1/2 water in a spray bottle and light-med spritz&lt;br /&gt;as curling. It makes my set last longer and my hair is not the electric company!</li>
    <li> Awesome for settin pin curls</li>
    <li> As an african american woman with natural hair, its great having a product that I can do roller sets with that will actually straighten my hair along with having lots a body!!</li>
    <li> We use this with curl formers.  We mix the setting lotion with water in a spray botttle before we use the curl formers.  This doesn&#x27;t get hard like many sprays, this stays soft but holds the form of the curl very well.  Often it is hard to find a spray / lotion tha t works well with blonde hair to make sure it &#x27;holds&#x27; this spray works well with blonde hair.</li>
    <li> great setting lotion. Really holds curls inmy baby fine staight hair.</li>
