      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Hasn&#x27;t worked as quickly as Anthony Logistics Ingrown Hair Treatment, but this product doesn&#x27;t come with the hefty price of Anthony&#x27;s either.</li>
      <li>It does calm the skin, and prevent ingron hairs and bumps.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s pretty stingy to apply, but worth it.  </li>

      <li>The smell is a little punget ( alcohol) but it fades away and my skin is so smooth after applying.</li>

      <li>Tend Skin you get directly from the manufacture......</li>
      <li>Only rarely do I get an ingrown or curled hair that grows back into the skin.</li>
      <li>It has taken a few days to clear up the issue, but is working very well.</li>
      <li>This product completely resolved the issue within 1 week and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>A friend recommended this to me awhile back because I like to shave, ehem, down there, and it really works to reduce razor burn and unsightliness.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this on my bikini line and it works great. It should be used multiple times (ie: twice a day) for max results.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this after shaving. She swears that it prevents skin irritation and ingrown hairs. I don&#x27;t argue or ask questions, I&#x27;ve learned to take her word for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping, as always with Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> Works as it should- keeps away the razor bumps and helps prevent ingrown hairs.  I use this product on a daily basis and it has really improved my razor burn.</li>
    <li> It was good. It arrived on time and it works like it said it does. My salon recommended it. So get it.</li>
    <li> if you have ever had razor burn or ingrown hairs, this product is for you. works great. comes in a roll on bottle too. i use this with a cotton pad or refill the roll on. great great great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tend skin for over ten years and will never use another product!  The smell is a little punget ( alcohol) but it fades away and my skin is so smooth after applying.</li>
    <li> Great price! I love this product.  It&#x27;s great for pre and post shaving.  I have used it for years and it&#x27;s the best on the market that I&#x27;m aware of.</li>
    <li> I am a woman with PCOS so I have excessive chin hair growth. I use Nair which results in tons of bumps because of ingrown hair. I have used other products that haven&#x27;t worked but Tend Skin worked over night!! The sting is not bad at all but even if it was terrible, my bump-free face would be worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and was ecstatic that Amazon sells it. Bought a bottle for myself and a friend at work who shaves his head. He&#x27;s now a believer too.</li>
    <li> This is ok.  I continue to compare these to the Bliss ingrown pads.  I don&#x27;t like this as much because you have to use a q-tip or a cotton swab.  Also, this container is 4oz so you technically can&#x27;t travel with these in a carry on bag.</li>
    <li> Product has been helpful for my razor bumps on my neck. It has taken a few days to clear up the issue, but is working very well. No irritation like I had with a tea tree oil product. Hasn&#x27;t worked as quickly as Anthony Logistics Ingrown Hair Treatment, but this product doesn&#x27;t come with the hefty price of Anthony&#x27;s either.</li>
    <li> The product is fast acting but even better when used as a daily regimen.  This works on all types of bumps.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to help alleviate those awful red bumps after shaving my bikini area and this is the only one that&#x27;s worked! After just a few uses I noticed a difference (using twice a day) and now I don&#x27;t have any redness or bumps. Seriously works if used as directed!</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR ANY SKIN TYPE</li>
    <li> Helps with razor burn quite a bit. I&#x27;ve not found a better product for the price. I recommend and will continue to reorder!</li>
    <li> I am usually plagued by ingrown hairs due to my super sensitive skin- but no more! This stuff is like magic. I recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin that wants to prevent ( or get rid of ) those pesty bumps that come after shaving senstive skin!</li>
    <li> I use this product every time I shave. It&#x27;s particularly good in the delicate areas, stopping that recently plucked chicken look. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s bias or not, but I &#x27;think&#x27; it works and so for me, it does. It does sting at first, and then cools. I love it.</li>
    <li> The many large, red bumps are gone from my chin area. I&#x27;m a female user.  It&#x27;s pretty stingy to apply, but worth it.  The cooler weather may be helping also, and I&#x27;m hoping for and expecting continued positive results when warmer days return.</li>
    <li> I have fairly coarse facial hair that tends to curl and get ingrown, causing red marks/bumps that are very irritating.  I have been using Tend Skin for several years now and I helps a lot.  Only rarely do I get an ingrown or curled hair that grows back into the skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product when I developed a terrible case of red razor bumps just below the abdomen and above the groin. This product completely resolved the issue within 1 week and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. The only issue I had was that the rollon dispenser seems to be prone to leaking .... unless I am using it incorrectly. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This works, I use is everytime I plug my chin hair or wax my chin. It does calm the skin, and prevent ingron hairs and bumps. Always apply at night before sleeping, and you will see the area has calmed down.</li>
    <li> As you see I gave it a 5 star. I have been using it for at least 6 or 7 years and I don&#x27;t think there is any thing else on the market that can come even close to it. Yes, I would recommend it to anyone, and have. I&#x27;m also happy I bought it on amazon.  It afforded me the best price since  I&#x27;ve been using it. I hope I can continue buying it from amazon. I love it</li>
    <li> Hace used product for years on face, chest, groin after waxing or shaving. Prevents or heals ingrowns. A little expensive, but it works. Get a cotton ball or pad that doesn&#x27;t shed when using.</li>
    <li> I get this for my daughter and she loves it.  She askes for it for every birthday and Christmas, and buys it herself.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! I normally have a very tough time with razor burn, this product makes it so I can shave everyday if I wish to!!! I highly recommend tend skin to use after shaving and also waxing!</li>
    <li> This stuff works perfect on my very sensitive skin. I used to break out everytime I would shave, and if I rub this on I have no rash at all.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me awhile back because I like to shave, ehem, down there, and it really works to reduce razor burn and unsightliness. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have tried exfoliating, waxing and plucking. Tend Skin reduces my ingrown hairs on my legs. I use it every day- except right after shaving. It&#x27;s a summer staple</li>
    <li> This has made a huge difference on my skin after shaving, I can&#x27;t live without it now.  I use it everywhere I shave and just bought a roller and a refill.</li>
    <li> I bought the Tend Skins to deal with the hair bumps I could see and feel on the back of my arms, just below my elbows. Most of the hairs bumps are gone now. I plan to order the big bottle to get rid of the hair bumps on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and it does not leave a smell in the room</li>
    <li> product is nothing like the real Tend Skin you get directly from the manufacture...... total waste of time and money!</li>
