      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>This is a favorite of mine - Inis Moonlight.  </li>
      <li>A lovely fragrance for the evening.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very light and airy, and has an odor almost of a light body lotion.</li>
      <li>have received many compliments while wearing the perfume and will be certain not to run out!!!</li>
      <li>Other than that issue, great product and good price.</li>
      <li>Very sweet and feminine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and it seems like people try to wave the smell of it from me, toward them so that they can smell it more.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is perfect for a warm or even hot day because it has such a light fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance, it has become my absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>but with this she is fine with it.</li>

      <li>Smells like cheap Avon cologne.  </li>
      <li>so light it can be</li>
      <li>The original Inis is a very fresh ocean scent.</li>
      <li>Familiar fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is unique and feminine.</li>
      <li>Still, I will buy it again, because I love it so much.</li>

      <li>Cal. Inis isn&#x27;t as strong as I normally  wear.......</li>
      <li>I already have to other Inis parfums that are loved, and this is up there with the others.</li>
      <li>Sometimes, I try layering first with the body lotion, followed by the Eau de Parfumerie and that does extend the product fragrance a bit longer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That said, it does not last more than an hour at a time</li>
      <li>Also, reasonably priced!  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife after smelling it at a local store wanted to find a better deal.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes the fragrance, as do</li>
      <li>Light scent, I would like it to last somewhat longer as it seems to fade by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>Great but arrived a little late.</li>
      <li>I really cannot describe the smell, only know that i dont care for it.</li>
      <li>I have all of the Inis fragrances and I have to say this is my least favorite.  </li>
      <li>Not as strong as I have had in the past.</li>
      <li>I tested this scent when I was in an old irish shop in Pennsylvania.  </li>

    <li> I tested this scent when I was in an old irish shop in Pennsylvania.  It&#x27;s very light and airy, and has an odor almost of a light body lotion.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, musky, lingering fragrance...fresh and unlifting!  Just one spritz will do!!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised and happy with the perfume. It was wonderful.</li>
    <li> Gifted for Christmas - she loved!</li>
    <li> I have never been dissatisfied with inis products.  They always smell great and arrive in a timely manner. I do wish they were less expensive but I suppose they&#x27;re averagely priced with other perfumes of today.</li>
    <li> Not too strong a great day to day option if you like Armani code for going out at night like I do</li>
    <li> I choose this gift as a request from a Christmas wish list.  Cannot rate it because it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Moonlight is a wonderful fragrance and I get a lot of compliments when I where it.  I only wish it would come in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> It seems a bit &#x27;watery&#x27;! Not as strong as I have had in the past. Still, I will buy it again, because I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I do like this perfume, but it is definitely different from Inis or Inis Or. The original Inis is a very fresh ocean scent. This moonlight scent is a lot different. It is more powdery and floral, and it&#x27;s a lot stronger than the original Inis, so the scent definitely lingers. I do like it and do intend to buy the matching lotion. It is unique and feminine. The bottle is also very pretty.</li>
    <li> Light but great scent.</li>
    <li> Very sweet and feminine. I already have to other Inis parfums that are loved, and this is up there with the others. In addition to a beautiful and floral scent, it lasts for hours and is not heavy. It smells as described online. I receive many compliments on this parfum. Love it!</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought I was ordering, but it has a pleasant scent and the price was good.</li>
    <li> Love It! Love it! Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after smelling it at a local store wanted to find a better deal. it is a beautiful  scent and very sexy yet still refreshing. Excellent seller arrived promptly will buy from again</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, it has become my absolute favorite!</li>
    <li> Loved this scent along with all. INIS is like a piece of home with me even though I&#x27;m not there.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite of mine - Inis Moonlight.  I have worn it for several years.  It is very subtle and a fragrance so light it can be&lt;br /&gt;worn anywhere, anytime.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This perfume has a very light, feminine fragrance and I really like it.  The only downside for me is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long enough on me.  Everybody is different though so it may last longer on you!</li>
    <li> I have all of the Inis fragrances and I have to say this is my least favorite.  Smells like cheap Avon cologne.  I really cannot describe the smell, only know that i dont care for it.</li>
    <li> Everytime I wear this, I get so many compliments.  It&#x27;s light and it seems like people try to wave the smell of it from me, toward them so that they can smell it more.  I love the smell of this.  The compliments alone make me recommend it.</li>

    <li> Absolutely unique makes me smile. Familiar fragrance. Impressed with seller, shipping was timely. Irish girl here &#x3D;) Great for a beautiful summer evening in So Cal. Inis isn&#x27;t as strong as I normally  wear.......that&#x27;s probably a good thing tho. LOL</li>
    <li> Soft and subtle fragrance!  Great for any occasion!  What a great gift for any holiday!  Also, reasonably priced!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells very nice. My wife really likes the fragrance, as do I. My wife has allergies and most odors bother her (like scented  candles, etc) but with this she is fine with it. Not an overwhelming smell. Very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great product, it is in my top five favorite fragrences.  Great staying power, I will use this after my shower and I can still smell the fragrence into the next day.</li>
    <li> Light scent, I would like it to last somewhat longer as it seems to fade by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> My wife works with the public, and loves this perfume. She says her patients love it too, so all are happy.</li>
    <li> A lovely fragrance for the evening.  I like all the Fragrances of Ireland.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift and was well received. I first saw this on a TV advertisement and thought that it would be great.</li>
    <li> Great but arrived a little late. Other than that issue, great product and good price. Cheaper than any other site</li>
