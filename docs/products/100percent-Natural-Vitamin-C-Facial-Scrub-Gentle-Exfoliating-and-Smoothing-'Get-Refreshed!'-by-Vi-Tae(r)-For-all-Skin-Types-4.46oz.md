<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> refreshing and helps to clear up dry skin</li>
    <li> This product has a great earthy smell and the right amount of exfoliants where you get a great scrub without being too harsh on your skin.  My skin was so soft after using this.</li>
    <li> Reviewed by my wife: I love this facial scrub! First of all, it smells like delicious lavender. Second, it is gentle on my sensitive skin while still doing a great job of exfoliating. I have been using it every 2-3 days on my face, neck and back, but it could probably be used every day. My skin usually gets very red and irritated when I use other scrubs, but not this. A little goes a long way when used on a damp wash cloth. I got this bottle during a special promotion, but would definitely buy again at full price.</li>
    <li> I have purchaised the product More than clean,it was a great cleanser and i want to try the jojoba scrub!</li>
    <li> I love every product this brand has. I already own a couple and want to try them all. When i saw thus facial scrub and the great price i had to buy it. Its absolutely wonderful. The smell is very pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my face like most scrubs. I can feel that my face is clean now. My skin has never been so clear and nice looking before. As always this brand has another amazing product that i will be reccomending to everyone.</li>
    <li> Get Refreshed is just that! For all skin types, crueltyfree,and made in the USA. I am 41, have TZone and very sensitive skin. This is a very fine scrub/exfoliatant. Perfect for daily or every other day! It takes only a quater size, so a little is all you need so 4oz will last you a good while!&lt;br /&gt;It has EIGHT natural essentail oils and jojoba seed powder. The small exfoliant are natural...not cyrstals or beads.&lt;br /&gt;I wet my face with warm water to open pores. Rub in circular motions all over. I let is sit for 5 minutes as dirrected. Thoroughly rinse with warm water and pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nuce herbal scent. It cleans out all impurities and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily,greasy,or too strippe! Did not cause break outs or any type of issues. Your skin feel baby soft and has that very refreshed! Perfect for in the morning or a week bath spa refresher! Recommend to anyone,any age!</li>
    <li> Exfoliating is an important step in skin care, and this Jojoba Facial Scrub is outstanding.  We received this Exfoliating scrub in a discount promotion to sample and review.  This is an excellent product, made with Organic ingredients.  It smells fresh, it feels fresh, and makes your skin look fresh.</li>
    <li> This facial wash &amp; scrub is wonderful!  It goes on easily and gently scrubs the skin.  My skin is sensitive, so I used this in a gentle motion and it worked perfectly!  Did not make my face all red like so many others have.  I really like this scrub and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> quick shipping. works great!</li>
    <li> I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am not usually the type of girl to use all the face scrubs and makeup, but I have been having problems with breakouts lately thanks to my current pregnancy. So when I saw this item up for review I thought it would be worth trying. I used it for the first time the other night and it was a great experience. The scent is nice and not overpowering and the scrub was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. After I removed it my skin did feel and look better already. I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since using the scrub so I will be continuing to use the scrub every few days. I would definitely recommend the product to others people who struggle with breakouts or just want to feel revitalized.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my mom, she likes it.</li>
    <li> Great wake up face wash. Left my skin feeling good and soft. Like the texture, it&#x27;s not too hard on my older skin. Plan on re purchasing this wash</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Jojoba Oil and I wanted a scrub that was natural and I could use a few times a week for exfoliation. I really like this scrub and feel like it does a good job making my skin smooth and clean. The bottle is a little small for the price but I really love that it  has NO Parabens; NO Phthalates; NO Sodium Lauryl Sulfates; NO Sodium Laureth Sulfate; NO Petroleum; NO Acrylamide; No Phelon Carbolic Acid; NO Dioxane; NO Toluene; NO Artificial Colors; NO Artificial Scents. If you are looking to add an Organic scrub to your skincare line then this is a great one. You can use it a few times a week instead of everyday to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> The exfoliaters are a good size &amp; quantity.  Sometimes you get one were there are very few &amp; they scratch your face.....not the case with this.  The smell is pleasant &amp; not overpowering.  You are left feeling relaxed &amp; fresh faced.  This is a keeper. &amp;#34;I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review.  Regardless the opinions found herein are based on my experiences with this product.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The jojoba facial scrub feels like a delicate pumice. The smell is pleasantly earthy but not overbearing: much better to wake up to in the morning than something astringent or too fruity! It leaves my face feeling light without any oily residue nor laden with any coating. I only wish it came in a bottle that would squeeze better so I could get it al out.</li>
    <li> This is not your drugstore exfoliating scrub!  I tried it for the first time and was truly impressed.  The bentonite clay in it was a finer consistency then other exfoliating scrubs I have used and felt wonderful.  The scent with this product is pleasing..  As I finished my skin actually felt softer.  I was surprised to experience such immediate results and also curious as to why.  I researched bentonite.  For those like me who had never heard of this ingredient, it is a healing clay used to help detoxify.  It is able to draw out  toxins which increase immunity and reduces inflammation.  It does this because it has a naturally occurring  negative charge when it  touches fluid.  This binds the  toxins and heavy meals which have a positive charge.  This is the second product that I have received from this company at a promotional rate for my honest opinion.  All I can say is that their products are spa like and top of the line.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this product and she thinks it works great. It helps get all of her makeup off after a long day. She is excited to try the other products in the line as well. She has been telling all her friends how good this product smells and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve been known to splurge at the local LUSH store for premium quality facial soaps, it would take a lot of convincing for me to spend $30+ on a 4 oz fash wash. Fortunately I was given a sample bottle to review... and now that I&#x27;ve tasted heaven, it will be hard to go back to the cheap stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is very, very good stuff. Part of me wants to give it 4 stars due to the price tag, but it&#x27;s actually worth it. The texture is just the right amount of creamy and exfoliation, with little beads that actually exfoliate but aren&#x27;t too rough for sensitive skin. The smell is fresh and natural, not perfumey, and invigorates the senses. I literally feel like I have a new face after I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions recommend using it only 2-3 times per week, which is hard for me to obey since it feels so great, however it probably is for the best. I have very sensitive skin and have not had any adverse reactions to it, but since it&#x27;s a very thorough cleanse that would probably be too extreme for the usual twice a day routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: this is a great product that puts a little spa pleasure into the daily facial routine. The ingredients are raw and natural and all are designed to improve the texture and beauty of your skin. I admit the price may be more than what you&#x27;d usually expect for a exfoliating facial scrub, but it is so worth it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Skin feels so clean after using this. I like using it with a face massage tool.</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub a lot. It smells great, it doesn&#x27;t lather up like crazy, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a coarse grain exfoliant, meaning you can feel the particles that are roughly the size of sand grains. I&#x27;m always torn between the fine grain and coarse grain products. Fine grain seems to take less rubbing and is generally more aggressive - everywhere you rub, you loosen skin cells. The coarse grains are nice because you can really feel where they are working and know when they are completely rinsed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a fairly thick green / brown gel. It doesn&#x27;t take too much for my face, about the size of two pea&#x27;s works. As I rubbed my face, I could feel the individual grains. That helped to rub the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing, I could feel a soft residue or moisturizer left behind. My skin felt smooth. The scrub is refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> This jojoba scrub is great with the oil and scrub it is a good exfoliating leaves you skin smooth and dewy..good product..</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when I received my complimentary sample of this Jojoba facial scrub was how nicely it was packaged. The bottle itself was shrink  wrapped in plastic, then there was a safety seal that also needed to be removed under the cap. Since this product is advertised as being organic with all natural ingredients, these extra steps the company took to make sure the product arrived in pristine condition was a welcome change. I noticed the other products I received from Vi-Tae were also packaged the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the bottle I noticed this also smelled very nice too. The instructions said to use a small amount and rub over your face in small circular motions and to leave on for 2-3 minutes before rinsing. It didn&#x27;t seem to be doing much of anything as I was making my little circles  until it started drying a bit, then I could feel the Jojoba Seed Powder do it&#x27;s magic as I finished cleansing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had used a little bit too much I used what was left on my hands onto the backs of my hands  while I waited the 2-3 minutes. My face looked like I had pepper all over it but it felt clean and tingly as I rinsed it off. It might be a bit easier to use in the shower so you can make sure all of it gets rinsed off. I think I will try that next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face (and hands) are now silky smooth after using this jojoba facial scrub. My skin feels &#x27;light&#x27; and does look a bit polished. My skin type is sensitive and a bit on the dry side. This facial scrub would be perfect tucked into a gift basket or holiday stocking.</li>
    <li> Love this exfoliating cleanser.  Face feels clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Another Winner!!! This Facial scrub is simply wonderful no moisturizer needed after using this leaves my skin completely hydrated, smooth and beautiful. This is my first purchase of the Jojoba Facial Scrub and I  will purchase this again, After washing my face I use this scrub, rinse and no other products are needed. It does NOT dry your skin out or cause any breakouts. AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL Vi-Tae products are superior and customer service is exceptional!!</li>
    <li> This facial scrub is just as refreshing as the name suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample to use and test and I have used it for the past week and am quite pleased with the results.  The jojoba seeds provide a wonderful exfoliating and scrubbing effect.  Being gentle is the key!  This ingredient is very effective.  A wonderful formula that helps to get the dirt and dead skin off.  It smells lovely and leaves skin smooth and revitalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a little spa in a bottle.  Seriously good stuff.</li>
    <li> They say you can’t judge a book by its cover and no where is that statement more true than with Vi-Tae’s Jojoba Facial Scrub.  It’s color (army fatigue green) made me question whether I wanted to put it on my face or not.  Fortunately, I was attracted by the wonderful smell (probably the lemon peel and cedarwood oil) and decided to chance it.  Well, all I can say is that I’m glad I took the leap of faith because my skin has never looked better.  Not only do the exfoliating properties gently get rid of all of the old, dead skin cells that made my complexion look so dull and lifeless – it also tightened my skin and helped hide the fine lines that are a plague to all women as we get older, giving my face that youthful polished look I had at nineteen  Best of all, while this product definitely does the job it is gentle and does not contain any of the beta-hydroxy or glycolic acids present in so many of the other products on the market. (I had a bad experience with one of those and ended up at the dermatologist’s office).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have begun using Vi-Tae’s product I wondered how I ever lived without it.  It’s almost like having a professional facial in your own home – at a third of the cost.  I’m sold on this product.  Thank you to Vi-Tae for the opportunity to use and review their Jojoba Facial Scrub.</li>
    <li> I am so pleasantly surprised by this product.  The main thing that I love is the scent.  It reminds me of what they use at a facial spa I could never determine what exactly the ingredient was that made it smell so good!  The consistency is totally on point and it scrubs away dead skin and leave your face looking rejuvenated.  There is a lot of product in this bottle it&#x27;s well worth the cost  I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest feedback</li>
    <li> I got this a few days ago, I like the texture of it, it&#x27;s gritty. It&#x27;s earth tone colored greenish brown. It has small gritty brown specks in it. I cant figure out that aromatic smell but none the less it smells very good! Its not an &amp;#34;awaken&amp;#34; scent more of a &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; scent but a fresh relaxing scent. Confuse ya?.., didnt mean to, just trying to describe it. I like how the gritty texture didn&#x27;t scratch my face! it didn&#x27;t burn nor make me red. I love the fact that pure cleaning doesn&#x27;t have to be harmful chemicals, this has alot of natural herbs/extracts/oil in it. I had make up on while I used it and I thought there might be some left but I was wrong. It stripped it off, not a trace left behind AND again I say it didnt scratch my face. My face feels tighter and my pores are clean.Im very impressed. Whats even more suprising is when I put on my Vit C face serum it didnt burn. I was left with a pure freshly clean face. I have a smooth face but this was like a polish. I really feel like I polished my face in earths finest. This is a great combination of natures purest organic herbs/oils. Im in love!!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this for a discount on my honest feedback- honestly this is very beneficial and works very good and healthy for your face!</li>
    <li> I am in love with these products, I have acne, oily and dry skin in different areas of my face. I started with the scrub then the cleanser and now the product for black heads and all work beautifully, my skin loves them!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really excited about this product.  I&#x27;ve become super picky about products that I use on my face, having recently developed adult acne. So I love the natural ingredients. After using this face scrub for the first time, my skin was noticeably softer and brighter.  It left my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized.  I love the scent as well. I will continue to use this, and update after a week or two!</li>
    <li> Very good facial scrub. The smell could be better but I guess the smell is the way it is because it&#x27;s all natural. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Awesome Scrub, Feels and Smells Refreshing, my face felt tingles during the two minute wait. My Face felt Smoother. Will continue using every other day.</li>
    <li> Love it..  great scent, and not too rough on the skin ... using it twice a week, now skin is more radiant</li>
    <li> Love the refreshing feeling of this Facial scrub!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this as a weekly at home spa &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34;, but if you have remotely sensitive skin, I would not advise using this as a daily scrub. The &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; can be abrasive, and after using this four days in a row (I had hoped it could replace my current oily/acne relief scrub), my skin looked irritated and puffy.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, as a &amp;#34;once in a while&amp;#34; product, this is great! I love that this product has no parabens, no pthalates, no other gunk. The scent is pleasant to me (although it can be a bit strong, I could see someone being turned off by the level of scent) and reminds me of a great facial I had a couple of months back. My first trial with this turned out great - my skin felt tighter and very clean after use. It really only takes a small amount to scrub your entire face, and the greatest point is, it rinses off easily! I didn&#x27;t feel like there was any residue left over.&lt;br /&gt;Based off of my experience, I would try other Vi-Tae products. This scrub did what it promised - my skin just needs its&#x27; powers a little less frequently.</li>
    <li> This scrub is amazing! I smells like you are at a spa and didn&#x27;t feel like it was scratching my face. My face feels clean and refresher after using it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this facial product, because my face either break out even more and clear up and then breaks out. I can honestly say I love this product, especially how my face feel once I wash the product off. It have cleared up a lot.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best scrub ever.  I think this is probably the best facial scrub I have ever used.  It shrinks your pores, and your skin comes out  feeling fresh and clean - and so smooth.  This is my favorite facial scrub that I have used to date, and I know I will order it again.  I have to admit that it is a little pricey, but I would still order it again. Thank you Vi-Tae.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Apricot Scrubs as my scrub of choice until now.  This product is now a clear winner.  Exfoliating is so important because the dead skin  creates a barrier on your skin that traps dirt and bacteria and doesn&#x27;t absorb products well.  You may very well be wasting good product if you&#x27;re just putting it on the dead skin.  What I do is first wash face with a cleanser to remove all the dirt and makeup.  Pat dry so skin is damp but not wet.  Apply this scrub and gently work it over entire face and next in small circles.  Take time with this so it can really remove the dead skin and reveal the smooth, beautiful skin underneath.  I could feel my skin tingling and the smell was so earthy and therapeutic.  Leave it on for a few minutes.  Rinse clean.  Your new skin is now uncovered and thirsty for whatever moisturizer/product of your choice.  I could really feel products soak into my skin and it feels so much smoother and cleaner.  Without exfoliating, I can actually feel my skin as being rough and dark.  I have oily skin and this product is perfect for it - makes my skin feel rejuvenated and clean.  I definitely recommend this product.  It&#x27;s like something that would be applied at a nice spa.  Perfect for treating yourself at a bargain price.  A little goes a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The apricot scrubs I used to use was ONLY an exfoliant.  This Jojoba Scrub is a lot more therapeutic overall.  Apricot scrub has large/coarse granules - this product has very small/fine granules.  It&#x27;s smooth, but still has enough &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; to be completely effective.  I&#x27;ve used scrubs that didn&#x27;t feel like they were scrubbing anything, either because the granules were few and far between, or they were too small to even be felt.  This product is a perfect medium.  There is no soap in this product so it won&#x27;t sud up.  It waters down very easily, so it&#x27;s best used on a damp face, not a wet one.  Definitely a must have for every woman!</li>
    <li> This Jojoba Facial Scrub is refreshing, exfoliates and smooths my skin, leaving my face soft, soft, soft!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I exfoliate my face in the shower at night. This scrub has a subtle &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; scent that whispers...&amp;#34;relax and slow down&amp;#34; add to that the earthy-brown color and scent and I have that personal spa treatment!  The scrub is thick and has a moderate amount of granular (not certain what they are but the slowly dissolve while on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use 2-3 times a week, shake well and apply evenly to the face/neck, use gentle circular motions, and then leave on for about 2-3 minutes before rinsing off.  I concur that it is best to not use every day.  I did not read the directions on the bottle when I got my sample, I just rubbed it on then rinsed it off!  The second and third day I did the same thing and I noticed a mild sting on my face.  Nothing serious, no worries, it was just I was aware that I was overdoing it.  So I looked at the bottle and low and behold... &amp;#34;Use 2-3 times a week&amp;#34; was right there!  hehe  so.... I skipped a day, used Vi-Tae&#x27;s Get Lathered Up instead on my face as I am really liking the Pampered Feeling I am getting from the Scents and softness of my skin. On the forth day, I used the scrub once more and it felt as I expected...a great exfoliating scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being happy with this I continued to use it every other day for about three weeks then.... I grabbed the bottle to write my review and re-read the bottle... OMG!!!  I overlooked the &amp;#34; Leave on for 2-3 minutes&amp;#34;  part!!!!!  So I was like &amp;#34;really?  Did I use it incorrectly AGAIN?!?&amp;#34;  lol  So... for the past week I have been using it every other day AND leaving it on my face for about 2-3 minutes.  Let me tell you... I am VERY impressed with this scrub!!!  It made my face smooth and soft with just the quick scrub and rinse but after I leave it on for a couple of minutes... my face is SOFT SOFT SOFT can you hear me??  SOFT!!!!!!  All the next day too!!!!  No lotions, nothing added to my face at all!  I am caressing my check now and I just want to sigh and cuddle up next to myself!!!!  (okay...that last part might be a bit of an exaggeration...or is it?!?!?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line...  AWESOMENESS Lives in this bottle!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 4 weeks now and it looks like I have only used up approximately 1/3 of the bottle.SOFT!!!!!!  All the next day too!!!!  No lotions, nothing added to my face at all!  I am caressing my check now and I just want to sigh and cuddle up next to myself!!!!

    <li> Just started using it. It does its job of exfoliating quite well. Easy to use. Good texture. I like it!</li>
    <li> I love the smells of this companies  products. I also love knowing I am putting quality products on my body. This face wash is thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This natural facial scrub really improved my skin texture.  After few applications, I have noticed my skin is tighten, smooth and has a glow to it.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products I reviewed (free sample received) that exceeded my expectations.  The first thing I did was read some of the other reviews (which is something I don&#x27;t normally do) to get an idea of how to use this product correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it in the shower and only to use a small amount (1/2 tsp.) based upon the advise of my fellow reviewers.  The first thing I noticed was the Spa smell.  It&#x27;s hard to describe but it just remind me of being at a Spa.  The next thing is the tingly feel.  It&#x27;s almost like a very mild mint or menthol but doesn&#x27;t smell like either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gently scrubbed it in and waited a few minutes before rinsing.  I experienced smoother skin instantly with no reddening or discomfort whatsoever.  After a thorough rinse, I shaved and moisturized with rosehip oil and my face feels like a babies bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t ask for more in an exfoliating scrub.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  Thanks again!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic cleanser and has a very pleasant scent.  I really like how it exfoliated my skin.  I felt I my skin rejuvenated after cleansing because it felt so refreshed, and cool.  You need a good amount on this as it does not lather, and the small micro beads inside really get the skin off, but gently.  I would recommend this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided For Review</li>
    <li> This has been working like a charm and I recommend you try it if you’ve a hard time like me finding a REAL all natural facial scrub that is gentle but also does a fantastic job of cleaning my skin.  The name ‘Get Refreshed’ is perfect!  My skin was clean and fresh and felt so soft – felt like my face had a blast of pure oxygen!</li>
    <li> Like the product but the smell is something else...  Not real appealing.</li>
    <li> Anyone know where i can buy this vitae. I cant find this in wallmart</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!! It smells like when you walk into a spa. You know when you arrive at a spa and there&#x27;s that smell that you just want to bottle up and take home, well this is it!  I also like the texture because its not too heavy or clumpy. Sometimes products can be so grainy that they are a little harsh on your skin. This one is just perfect! It leaves my skin feeling + looking so good, clean and fresh, without any tightness. I also love the fact that all of the ingredients are natural, these days there is so many harmful chemicals in cosmetics - this one reassures me that I am doing whats best for my body and overall health. I can&#x27;t wait to try Vitae&#x27;s other products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of all natural beauty products and makeup as I find they usually make my skin feel much better and I generally just feel better about myself - like I&#x27;m making the smarter decision choosing something natural over another product. This scrub is absolutely amazing. It gives my skin and my pores that wonderful tingly feeling and it really feels like it&#x27;s doing its job well. I love the scent of it and the texture of the scrub as well. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple days so I cannot comment on any real results yet, but I really do enjoy this scrub very much and I look forward to being a continued customer.</li>
    <li> This is good. It gives you a tingly sensation that may even resemble burning, and couldn&#x27;t be kept on for two minutes because of the feeling. However, the end result was that I enjoyed the smell and my skin looked and felt great. So, this product is great for those who can handle a little bit of work to get to their beauty result.</li>
    <li> When it comes to promises made by cosmetic companies I am an avowed skeptic, but this product delivers just what is claims. The scrub is effective and after using it my skin is not only softer to the touch, but it actually looks better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is hard to define but decidedly herbal. Using the product feels indulgent - like part of a professional facial. This is an efficient and extremely pleasant way to remove dry skin cells. I immediately moisturized after the scrub to protect the newly exposed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After feeling the incredible softness and seeing the refined texture on my face I decided to go slightly \\&quot;off-label\\&quot; and try some on my hands. The result was every bit as impressive. I used a small glob about the size of a pea and followed the same directions on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After gently rubbing the top of one hand for a minute I left the product in place for three minutes and rinsed and then completed the same procedure on the top of my other hand. My hands, like my face feel wonderful and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A genuinely impressive product, I plan to make a regular part of my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided by the manufacturer for testing and review.</li>
    <li> Used tonight and my face felt so good and clean.</li>
    <li> It smell sooooo good. Like you comes to the forest! I use it at my left hand to be compare with my right hand. After use it and clean, my left hand becomes more bright and white! Very nice!</li>
    <li> Very nice, great packaging. Leaves my skin smooth like a baby&#x27;s bum</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.... I have never seen my skin as smooth as after using this for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the bottle, I was thrown by how strong the scent was. I thought this wasn&#x27;t going to work for me because of that. Very stron scents drive me nuts. Thankfully the smell dissipates after a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing on the skin. It exfoliates, but it is not harsh at all. It scrubs, but it&#x27;s fine at the same time, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re using a pumice stone on your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if this product rocked my socks off why did I only give it 4 stars? Here it is. It concerned me that the product description stated that it has organic ingredients, but the bottle has no organic ingredients listed. I am in the process of replacing all my non organic products with better for you organic ones. That&#x27;s why I purchased this one. It is made with natural ingredients, and is a wonderful product, but does it, or does it not have organic ingredients? I will continue to use this because I love it, but if I happen to come by a similar product made with organic ingredients, I would be tempted to give it a try</li>
    <li> Feels so nice on my skin</li>
    <li> I kept going back and forth four stars/five stars.I love the effects of this scrub so I gave it a 5 rating. The reason I was considering a 4 is the price is a little high. But the product is excellent and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Bought this after I was pleased with Vi-Tae&#x27;s Better Than Clean. Will be searching for a more effective options.</li>
    <li> works great!I really like this scrub, It smells really good,definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Wow! Just…wow! Let me start by saying I’m a big fan of all-natural skin care products, so when I heard about Vi-Tae, I couldn’t wait to try their products. “Get Refreshed” is the first Vi-Tae product I tried, and I was blown away by the results.  The formula smells earthy and natural, and you can actually see the little grains of face-cleaning silt when you open the bottle. I have combination skin—oily T-zone with a bit of dryness on my cheeks—and this scrub worked wonders. A little bit goes a long way, so you can expect this bottle to last for quite awhile. I dampened my face prior to applying “Get Refreshed,” then followed the directions to scrub in circles around my face. The first thing I noticed when I rinsed my face was how easily the scrub washed away. I’ve used some scrubs in the past that left my face feeling oily or like there was a film on it, but “Get Refreshed” left my face feeling exactly that—refreshed! I also noticed that this formula helped bring impurities to the surface of my skin, making it easy to get rid of whiteheads I didn’t even know were there. This scrub definitely left my face feeling soft and supple without making my skin tight or leaving any sticky or oily residue behind. My husband even commented on how soft my skin felt! “Get Refreshed” has a permanent place in my skin care regimen, and I can’t wait to try some other Vi-Tae products!</li>
    <li> Excellent, excellent product.  The amount of grit is perfect for manual exfoliation.  Many beauty products have plastic microbeads which, first, are not good for the environment and, second, don&#x27;t (in my opinion) do a great job really sloughing off dead and dull skin.  This, however, is absolutely fantastic. and leaves my skin wonderfully soft and ready for serums or heavy-duty moisturizing.  I use this both on my face and on my hands and feet.  I absolutely love this stuff, and will order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Leaves your skin soft and supple.  Skin also seems more receptive to products (as in, it seems to &amp;#34;receive&amp;#34;/soak in products better).  Great, natural ingredients.  Beautifully scented with natural ingredient (ylang ylang oil).  Made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Obviously, keep this out of your eyes.  The grit alone would be a terrible irritant.  Using this product daily could cause skin irritation, peeling, tenderness and redness- so stick to the recommendation of 2-3 times per week.  Doing it more than that could cause permanent damage as you&#x27;re not allowing the cells to recover from the trauma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: purified water, alumina, freshwater colloidal silt, glycerin (vegetal), simmondsia chinesis (jojoba) seed powder, bentonite, PEG-150 distearate, aloe barbadensis leaf juice powder, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, glyceril stearate &amp; PEG-100 stearate (from palm kernel oil), citrus medica lemonum (lemon) peel oil, helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil, PEG-16 macadamia glycerides, cedrus deeodara (cedarwood) oil, pelargonium graveolens (geranium) flower oil, aniba rosaeodora (rosewood) oil, canaga odorata (ylang ylang) flower oil, disodium EDTA, polyisobutene &amp; polysorbate 20 (from coconut)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!  It feels incredible on the skin and the more important thing make my skin feels clean, healthy and radiant!</li>
    <li> Lemon zest, herbs, and an undefinable something that is just sublime--the fragrance of this product is divine.  The texture of this scrub is excellent, too.  It&#x27;s not hugely gritty, nor clumpy the way a lot of facial scrubs are that come in a jar.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to work, either.  It&#x27;s best used after regular cleansing, I found.  I&#x27;ve been using it with a Clairisonic-type gadget , and it &#x27;s a verrrrrry pleasant experience that I look forward to.  Mmmmmmmm....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fingertips should work just fine as well, and the more you work it, the more of that heavenly aroma is released.  I&#x27;m tempted to dab some under my nose so I can smell it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all facial exfoliating scrubs worth the name, this Vi-Tae product left my skin soft, smooth, and ready to accept treatment.  After using it at night, my morning skin looks and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the dispenser built into the top of the bottle didn&#x27;t work for me.  The product comes in a flexible container so it&#x27;s not a big deal to squeeze out the right amount.  I&#x27;ve dropped a lot of glass cosmetics in my day, and love that this one comes in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with the product which Vi-Tae provided for review.  If they&#x27;d just come out with a fragrance like this one, I&#x27;d be their first customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited on 4/24:&lt;br /&gt;My bottle of Get Refreshed fell off the counter and crashed into the sink.  The top part of the lid popped off and is now working perfectly.  I&#x27;m not suggesting anyone else fling bottles around the bathroom (even if they are PLASTIC!), but the initial lid failure was caused, I believe, by the extraordinarily secure shipping packaging. The top part of the cap must&#x27;ve gotten wedged.  It&#x27;s fine now, and I continue to love this product.</li>
    <li> This is a natural exfoliating facial scrub that works. It has a delightful texture and smell. Just a little of the it produces skin that feels and looks clean, soft, glowing, fresh, and younger. The product is perfect for removing dead skin and opening pores. It washes away easily after using it without leaving an oily or grainy feeling.</li>
    <li> So glad I chose this item when the company contacted me to do a review. I initially wanted to try their body scrub but after reading the description for this item, I was curious. My go to brands are typically the Peter Thomas Roth Laser Free Retexturizer Exfoliating Scrub and the Kate Somerville ExfoliKate Intensive Exfoliating Treatment .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the natural ingredient list when I got it, I was eager to get to testing. I made sure that I followed the instructions to get the maximum results. You use this almost as a mask/scrub hybrid. If you do, you will be impressed. My skin fell baby soft, smooth and with a hint of moisturizing (due to the Jojoba). I waited till today to make sure I had not breakouts before writing my impressions. Having oily skin, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the Jojoba content was going to cause issues. As I waited, I went and researched Jojoba and this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Jojoba (pronounced ho-HO-ba) oil is a botanical extract of the seed of the jojoba tree (Simmondsia chinenis). Technically it is not actually an oil, but rather what is called a wax ester. Why do we care? Because out of all of the compounds in nature, this wax ester is the most similar to human skin oil (sebum). It is theorized that applying jojoba to the skin can \\&quot;trick\\&quot; the skin into thinking it is producing enough oil, thus balancing oil production. The bottom line for acne-prone people is that jojoba oil is non-comedogenic so you can use it without fear.\\&quot;(Acne.org.com0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means those of us with oily skin can use this without worries. How great is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rare to find moisturizing products that work well with oily skin. One more thing I would like to mention is the texture. The product is thick and when it comes to the exfoliating granules, it doesn&#x27;t cause microscopic cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The only thing you may find a slight nuisance is the gritty stuff the mask leaves behind. But all masks do that, especially all-natural ones. Just make sure everything goes down the drain when you&#x27;re done with a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this in my rotation of skin care now.t make sure everything goes down the drain when you&#x27;re done with a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this in my rotation of skin care now.</li>
    <li> The jojoba seed powder is too sharp for exfoliation, so I must massage my face extremely gently to prevent abrasion. I would not recommend this for sensitive skin,  I would also not recommend daily use (maybe once per week is okay).</li>
    <li> Clean smooth feeling skin.  Made facial skin look 10 years younger and feel 20 years younger.  Or maybe its all just mental and felt so refreshed  just felt 10 years younger.  Either way it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Nice facial scrub. My face does feel very clean and soft after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about this yet. I&#x27;ve used this several times and I don&#x27;t really have anything negative to say about it but I&#x27;m not really WOWed by it either. It has an herbal like scent which isn&#x27;t overpowering and I do feel that the scrub is gentle to my face. I will continue to use this as long as it does not break me out and if I notice a change I will update my review.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel so smooth and clean. Love this product.</li>
    <li> A bit hesitant at first, I read the description and some of the reviews on this facial scrub, and decided to give it a try. The aroma is quite strong, but I grew to enjoy it the more times I used the product. It left my skin feeling very smooth and fresh. I used it about once every 4 days, which is around the recommended use. There is enough product in the bottle to last quite a while, especially when there is no need to use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My SO also tried this, and she enjoyed it as much as I did. Her being more of an expert on this stuff, approved of it. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple facial scrub that is focused on have few and healthy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these as a sample to test, however I pride myself on writing honest and objective reviews.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell:/</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin so the review is biased to that. The smell really is spa heavenly but it gave me a red, angry rash when I used it. I tried it on my face and then tried it as a foot scrub but I broke out both times wherever it touched my skin. It&#x27;s just not the product for me. I liked the texture and loved the fact it&#x27;s all natural. I&#x27;ve used other products from this company with great results so I was pretty disappointed when my skin freaked out, I really wanted this to be my go to scrub.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 days but I felt the need to write a review early because of the results. I used this product as directed and I used a cloth with hot water one face first to open up my pores. The first day I used it, I immediately noticed how soft my skin was after the first use and even notice some blackheads on my nose looked fainter. The second time I used it, my blackheads literally melted away. It&#x27;s not 100% this early but I am really amazed.</li>
    <li> Has a very strong smell to it that I just don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;donated&amp;#34; this item to my guest bath when we have visitors because I can&#x27;t stand the smell. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin though.</li>
    <li> Stinky. Overpriced. Built upon their review request system. Don&#x27;t be fooled as I was. Product affected my skin negatively.</li>
    <li> First time using and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good and feels really good as your rubbing the product on your face. I let the product sit on my skin for 2-3 minutes before washing it off and it gives off a slight tingling feeling. Really makes me feel relaxed. I also like that this product is organic and uses natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels wonderful and soft after using this scrub!</li>
    <li> great size and benefical</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a problem with dry skin this winter and when I saw this, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. First thing first, this jojoba facial scrub smells wonderful. I used it to exfoliate my skin and after first use, I noticed right away that my face has less dry peeling skins. I use this products 3x a week and it made such a huge impact on my face. My face feels smooth and it gave it a real nice glow. I love this product that I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to love this scrub! But, it burned my face each time I used it. I have had things done to my face (surgeries, etc.) So I&#x27;m not sure if that had something to do with it. I tried it 4 separate times and each time it burned my face the whole time I had it on.</li>
    <li> work great! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it really clears my pores well, and feels amazing....unfortunately mine didn&#x27;t come full :(</li>
