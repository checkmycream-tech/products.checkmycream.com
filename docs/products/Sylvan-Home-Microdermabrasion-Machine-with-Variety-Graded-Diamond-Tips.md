    <li> I purchased the Sylvan Home Microdemabrasion Machine to help with my wonderful acne scars that I have received back in high school. To begin I have horribly oil skin as well. I have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on other products that guaranteed results. And they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this particular one is that it comes with different tips which is great because I have oily skin. They also have different size tips where you can reach the harder to reach spots on your face. The machine helps remove dead skin which is what your skin needs to repair your imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine itself is very easy to use and not complicated at all. Within minutes after receiving I was able to get it set up and right to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way my face looks today is almost back to what I would consider flaw free. I get complimented all the time about how wonderful my face looks. I feel more confident as well. This was the best money well spent. No more frequent spa treatments, no more being a guinea pig on trying to find something that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am confident that the Sylvan Home Microdermabrasion machine will work for you just as it has for me. It meets everyones needs as they may come. Oily skin, dry skin, rosacea, you name it. There is a diamond tip that will get the job done. I still continued using my daily moisturizers along with the machine 2xs a week. I have nothing but good things to say. As it meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. It has helped with some scars and removed a sunspot. I have better lotion than it came with though.</li>
    <li> I used to use those little at home microdermabrasion machines (I got a Nu Brilliance that conked out after a few weeks and another similar machine that lasted a while longer) but was so disappointed with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finally trying a professional microdermabrasion session, I realized how poorly those home units compared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this Sylvan machine a try. I took a chance on another at home unit out of sheer desperation and I&#x27;m glad I did. This machine is worlds better than my previous purchases. It&#x27;s still small enough to not eat up so much space in my tiny apartment and even though it has powerful vacuum force, it&#x27;s not noisy. It truly delivers. I particularly like the various diamond wand tips that go from coarse to fine, it allows me to treat the more delicate skin areas and also handle spots other than my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the machine twice and I have no complaints about its performance. However, as others in have noted, the instructions are abhorrent. Thank goodness for the Q&amp;A where someone asked the question about the filters, I couldn&#x27;t figure out where they go (at the base of the machine? on the end of the wand?) and there is nothing describing what each tip would be best for. You also have to sort of guess which tip is more abrasion by feeling them, and then guess again. I stil don&#x27;t know what these little inserts with the sticks are fore, hopefully nothing important since I can&#x27;t figure out where to put them. For that reason, and given this product has had many comments on nthe lacking instructions, I can only give 4 stars and almost want to give only 3. But it is a good price and the machine seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to if you can piece together the instructions from various questions as to how to use it.</li>
    <li> Unclear directions as to how to use the filters. Machines works well so far.</li>
    <li> Just received the micro dermabrasion machine made by sylvan  Missing 3 diamond tips . the label on the machine looks like it was peeled off and put back on several times . The filters don&#x27;t stay put . There were no instructions . Very disappointed in this purchase . I haven&#x27;t been able to get ahold of the company for assistance. Ready to ship it back  I didn&#x27;t receive the bonus light either</li>
    <li> I have used it one time, it does work from what I can see in short time with the gadget...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it only came with 3 diamond tips, four plastic, no orange tip... The two little tip tubes that seems made of metal are plastic and the cord its not white its translucent.... It doesn&#x27;t look that pro like the picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The led light came in different pakage diffierent day later...</li>
    <li> If I had any idea how much easier and cheaper (in the long run) buying my own microderm machine would be compared to going to a spa or clinic, I&#x60;d have done this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a diamond microderm machine by dumb luck. I looked at this Sylvan machine even before I got the difference between the crystal and diamond types. With this machine it&#x27;s a plug and play situation. No messing about with crystals necessary. And for me, that&#x27;s probably the safest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this machine for almost 2 months and do a treatment about 1x a week. It feels very similar to the professional treatments I&#x27;ve gotten in the past. I was afraid that this home unit will not have as much power as the professional ones but if that is the case, I have not felt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid of buyer&#x27;s remorse and with this product, I very happy to say that I don&#x27;t have any at all. It&#x27;s actually the opposite. I&#x27;m giving myself a face palm for waiting so long.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this machine after 2-months of treatments (1xweek). My skin now has an ageless glowing appearance with scars and fine lines gone. So, if you want straight up, no muss, no fuss effective diamond microdermabrasion at home, then this is the one to buy. It is really useful to have 5 differently graded diamond tips for the different parts of my face. For example, skin around the eyes and mouth require a finer grade and smaller tip than the one I would use for over my cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels the same as the ones I got at my dermatologist&#x27;s but more telling are the results. After using only twice I even notice a marked improvement in the feel of my skin. It&#x27;s definitely smoother now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe with continuous use, my skin will improve even more. I&#x27;ve noticed that my pores seem smaller and maybe less oily. My wrinkles are gone! The biggest difference from getting it done outside is that since I have it at home, I can get my \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; anytime. My biggest challenge now lies in not overdoing it. I&#x27;m loving the results so much that I&#x27;m tempted to do it more than once a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure this out. The instructions are very limited. Plus, no videos.  I&#x27;ve been trying to determine if I&#x27;m going to return it or not.</li>
    <li> The led photonic shocks &amp; it feels like ur being electrocuted the dermabrasion suction was powerful but after changing the filter it no good.</li>
    <li> Got this expensive machine with worthless instructions.  Contacted the company three times and they tried to be helpful but didn&#x27;t really know how to use it. Never received the bonus lights that were supposed to be shipped separately.  I&#x27;m sorry I purchased it. Now I see it&#x27;s no longer available.  I guess I was the last fool to buy it.  Thanks Amazon. NOT!</li>
    <li> not good quality cheap made</li>
    <li> Used it about 5 weeks,  Can&#x27;t see any difference.  Tips seem dull.  Dissappointed in instructions, or lsck there of.  For me it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The unit performs well -- my face feels almost as good as a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; job.  It&#x27;s easy to use and store.  My only complaint is that the instructions for use are minimal and leave lots of unanswered questions.  I&#x27;m hoping to visit their website and learn more.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m using the parts I understand.</li>
    <li> Yes! Great product. This makes my skin feel great, and also makes me feel fresh and young again. I do recommend to anyone who wants a clean face, and essentially a new start when it comes to facial beauty. Thanks again for this wonderful product. All equipment work and are ready to go out of the box.</li>
    <li> Love it! So much so, that I&#x27;ll say it again. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this machine, I was so happy that it met the simple but important requirements that I set. It had to be nothing complicated. I didn&#x27;t want all those buttons and knobs and assorted controls. Those just tend to overwhelm me. This one is straightforward and I got to use it with minimal instruction from the get go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone on many microderm treatments at the doctor&#x27;s and at spas over the years and my biggest downfall with them is that I could never go consistently (something I needed badly because of recurring acne) either due to scheduling or cost or both. After trying out a friend&#x27;s home microdermabrasion unit, I knew that investing in one is the best way to go for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of shopping around online and settled on this one. Thank goodness that this purchase turned out to be winner. As soon as my machine arrived, I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from its simple controls here are other things I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;*The 5 gradated tips. I can use finer tips for areas around my eyes and the coarser ones for the chin or neck area.&lt;br /&gt;*The easily adjustable suction (by the way, the suction force of this baby is nothing to sneeze at).&lt;br /&gt;*The price. It&#x27;s cheaper than 4 of the other models I considered and one of those so-called microderm machines does not even have suction feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted by another Sylvan microdermabrasion machine model but I&#x27;m glad I went with this. I&#x27;ve had this machine for 4 weeks now and have used it once every week since and the results are great. I have softer and \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; skin (if one can describe skin like that). My acne scars have lightened considerably and I expect them to improve more with time. My pores are smaller, perhaps because they&#x27;ve all been de-clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, like I said, winner!</li>
    <li> This is a great machine &amp; well worth the investment! My pores are minimized just as was hoping for!</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning out my pores and scrubbing skin</li>
    <li> No intructions came with this machine and I have not seen results. You have to basically figure everything out yourself</li>
    <li> The multiple tips are a joke. There are 3 diamond tips, all the same size,  the additional tips are plastic.</li>
    <li> It works fine, just didn&#x27;t come with better instructions</li>
</ol>
