    <li> It makes my hair feel very clean also my scalp feels a lot healthier.</li>

    <li> Not sure if its acutally making my hair grow, or if its just making it frizzy so it looks like its growing ... I have lost probably 75% of my hair, I had long, thick, fine hair... so the hair loss was very noticable.. my hair loss was due to being sick with unknown illness and then having a reaction to medication that put me in the hospital for a week, I started losing my hair in December and now, May 2nd I feel like its just starting to grow back.</li>
    <li> I am only giving it three stars now, because I have not had enough time to review it.&lt;br /&gt;However my hair seems to feel less fine, so after the thirty days I really hope it works</li>
    <li> I have no doubt that it may not work for everyone, but it certainly worked/works for me. Not only do i now have more hair, not as thick as when younger, but MUCH more than before using it, and more importantly I no longer get hair in my hair brush. I use it together with thier conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a long time.  It is a nice vitamin shampoo that makes for healthy, shiny hair.  I had some regrowth, but not much.  But it is definitely good for your hair and scalp.  Nice, shiny hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I defenitely see improvements in hair growth and most importantly maintaining the hair I already have. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hair has good feel after using this product.  Very good for hair that is tending to be dry and split ends.</li>
    <li> Love it and hair feels and smells good.  Was recommended to me by my doctor for excessive hair loss.  She said it would help and between this and the hairomega definitely having less hair loss.</li>
    <li> Okay. Takes alot to lather.</li>
    <li> Really helped the texture of my fine hair</li>
    <li> Nothing special for the price.</li>
    <li> So far, it leaves a very nice shine and that was basically what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Energizes my scalp. My hair was falling out at an alarming rate, but that has almost ceased. I can&#x27;t say I have seen any regrowth, but I have only been using it for just over a month. Great product, so glad a professional recommended it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I noticed results in a matter of a couple of weeks.  When I run out and have to use another shampoo, I notice a big difference.  The only downside is that if you dye your hair, it will strip the color out much faster than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered it again for the 3rd time.</li>
    <li> After 4 battles and 2 times fully hair cut...i got some new hair on my bald sports... I feel good...</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming. I&#x27;ve started to thin at the top of my head so I&#x27;m hoping this shampoo slows down that progression. I can&#x27;t definitely say it&#x27;s working or not but I&#x27;ve noticed less hairs falling out after showering so I&#x27;m hopeful. Any little bit helps.</li>
    <li> Excellent.... Love this product.... It absolutely is helping the regrowth of my hair.... Alhumdulillah....:) I am loving the new me.... I am actually respecting my hairs more then before... Thanks DS Laboratories.</li>
    <li> for something so pricey i expect a miracle....to be fair i only had this product for a month or less but... i havent notice anything &amp; my hair still falls out as much as my regular shampoo. I really dont notice anything extordinary bout this product. i will not be purchasing this prodcut again</li>
    <li> On my second bottle. About my hair... I have fine , thin hair .. in my 30&#x27;s male. I have pompadour hairstyle. I wash and blow my hair every single day. It works for me.. less breakage and my hair is fuller and thinker. I have noticed this after about 1 month , i use every day and leave in for 5 min and rinse. I just purchased the conditioner and ill use it now on. If you read this please read your shampoo ingredients and your body wash. mine were almost the same. Im sure helps in long term.</li>
