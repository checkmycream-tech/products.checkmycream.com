<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> it smells very good and glides on the skin, it dries matt,however after i finished the bottle,i did not have any noticeable results,i dont know if maybe it needs a bit more time,but i dont think i would repurchase given the price and lack of any result.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I have tried all the major eye products with poor results. This is the first product that works well and I have no adverse reaction. This is the second time ordering this product and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of LaNouvel Cellular NutriSerum with Hyaluron. I was first attracted to the organic label of this brand because my skin&#x27;s melasma was getting worse from using some harsh brightening creme. I also read its excellent customer reviews in Amazon, so I decided to give it a try. After a couple weeks applying the serum, together with their mask, the skin on my face became much softer and the pores also became tighten. My girlfriends even noticed the change and all wanted to know where they could purchase the same. I love this serum and plan to continue using it for a long long time.</li>
    <li> Everybody seems to love sweetsation and I have to say I LOOOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 27 and I am a health nut. I love to take care of skin, body and mind. I will age with dignity and being stubborn I will defeat the ugly signs that come with aging. This product not only smells amazing, but it&#x27;s so light on your face and neck and you&#x27;ll start feeling a slight tingle on your face. : )!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone, at any age!</li>
    <li> I am so in love with all the Sweetsation Products. These products have made a HUGE difference in the appearance of my skin. I love the fact they use natural ingredients too. The packaging is very nice as well.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I bought it because I was breaking out and needed a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t oily.  It feels really nice when you apply it and it absorbs really fast (you still need a regular moisturizer).  The only problem is, it goes so fast. Maybe I was applying too much, but I used it way  faster than the corresponding moisturizer that I purchased at the same time.</li>
    <li> This has really improved my skintone and has helped with fine line when used along with the aqua tica it has done wonders for my skin.Look forward to using other products I have not tried from this brand.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product and it works. Smells good, feels good, my face looks fresh and bright. I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the LaNouvel Cellular NutriSerum with Hyaluronic acid, Collegen/ Elastin &amp; Peptides.  I use it on my face  with Vitamin C twice a day . The bottle lasts quite a while.  Fine lines have diminished and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> Love this serum , very effective ... a lil dry but it moisturize very well . Actually is great for summer time because is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions and potions and have to say that I really like this serum.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now and I am really happy with the product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this skin care line to anyone who wants glowing skin. I would recommend using the serum with both the day cream and night cream! your skin will thank you.. trust me!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works - I have always had enormous pores under one eye and this serum is the first product I have ever used that seems to tighten them us!  I am so pleased and it lasts forever - I got a small sample size and when it&#x27;s empty I use the container to transfer from the larger bottle and that works so well for me.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this company and I was eagerly anticipating the release of this product and it was well worth the wait. My skin has been super dry from a combination of nursing and just being so freaking busy trying to keep the kids from literally climbing the walls that I forget to hydrate. With  its Hyaluronic acid, the LavNouvel NutriSerum is a well needed drink for my thirsty skin as it pulls in moisture. I use it with the Q*Lumi&amp;egrave;re Day or the Aqua*Tica Night cream and it has perked my skin up immensely in just the first week alone.  This serum positively glides on and has a light scent that mixes well with their other range of products. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens to my skin as I continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidebar: my husband surprised me with a birthday visit to a spa and the esthetician who did the facial couldn&#x27;t find fault with my skin care routine (albeit she did remind me to drink more water) and she said that hyaluronic acid was one of the best things you can do for your skin.</li>
    <li> OMG,you all should try it, feels so good on the skin,it really is like your face infused with callagen ,skin so much tighter and smooth.Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yana</li>
    <li> I am a faithful customer of sweetsations therapy. I absolutely love their products. My skin has never been so fresh and moisturized without the burning/stinging feeling I get from other products. My skin used to be so sensitive and adult acne prone. I&#x27;ve been using the products for at least 4 years and order it religiously even though I&#x27;m in Canada. I can&#x27;t thank you enough for your beautiful line and the lifetime of irritation and eczema that they soothe and take away, even throughout my pregnancy. The sunscreen was a lifesaver for myself and my son. The smells are amazing. Make a purchase and you won&#x27;t regret it! Their customer service is also top notch. I recently reordered the serum, like I said before, their company if spectacular!!!!</li>
    <li> I just love the way it works on my hands. I used to have a lot of little cracks on the back of them and now they are gone. I am getting another bottle when this one is done.</li>
    <li> Great product. Nice smell. Chock full of fabulous herbal&lt;br /&gt;And natural ingredients that are only seen in other high end couture&lt;br /&gt;Facial products for a fraction of the price. I&#x27;m a fan and will&lt;br /&gt;Rebuy. Can&#x27;t afford department store prices and love how it refined&lt;br /&gt;My skin for a great price!</li>
    <li> I received a sample size. I fell in love with it! My skin feels and looks so much better! I am on my second order.</li>
    <li> I am updating my review and rating it 4 stars instead of 3.&lt;br /&gt;Since the previous review I have been putting this serum on my skin MORNING and NIGHT&lt;br /&gt;rather than just once a day and I am seeing a definate improvement in skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I use it under a SPF30 Zinc sunscreen during the day and under a moisturizer at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;This was my previous 3 star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed to dry out my skin and my skin would burn when I&lt;br /&gt;started excercising and sweating.&lt;br /&gt;I used this with Ponds moisturizer during the night and with Blue Lizard sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;during the day. I will use it until the bottle is empty to see&lt;br /&gt;if it just needs more time for my skin type.</li>
    <li> A lot of the 5 star reviews (and there are many of them) were short and sounded similar to each other, so I checked out the reviewers.  These reviewers had only reviewed other LaNouvel products and given them 5 stars each.  Seems to me these are fake reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  My skin feels really good.  It&#x27;s absorbs quickly and feels very fresh and clean.  The scent is nice and light.  I like the ingredients as it seems to give my skin a glow.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product - it&#x27;s like magic.  When considering the ingredients it&#x27;s no wonder - thank you, Sweetsations!! . . . for making pure and true ingredients a highest priority.</li>
    <li> They sent me a sample of this product with another purchase I made. After using it, I couldn&#x27;t be without it so I had to purchase it. Great product for a great price. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used a better product for my face and now it is a part of my daily skincare routine, along many other sweetsation products. Super in love with this skincare line.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This is my second time ordering this because I have seen the difference in my skin.  You just have to make sure that you put a good moisturizer after applying this and it does work.  I love love love this product.  Will continue using this.</li>
    <li> I’m 30 years old and I’ve always had hormone related acne. With that being said, I always need to use a sunscreen on my face as the scars could be noticeable. Before applying it, I like to use a serum. Unfortunately, the ones I’ve used clogged my pores, broke out my skin, where extremely drying or generated a layer that (once it was dry) mixed with the sunscreen, leaving little crumbs on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum smells good, absorbs quickly and most importantly, it makes my skin feel nourished. For the first time in a long time, I can apply sunscreen on top of a serum and no crumbs appear on my face and hands.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great :) I really enjoy using it - I wish there was a bit more in the bottle but It&#x27;s comparable with every other product out there that has hyaluronic acid in it :) I have to say that this product, though pricey, had a huge effect on my skin - so its worth it!</li>
    <li> the serum smells light/clean and glides on matte. I use less than a dime-sized amount &amp; let it dry before applying an organic SPF face cream. sometimes i use stand-alone if i will be indoors all day.  I&#x27;m 37, look young for my age despite a fair amount of sun damage from when i was a teenager and thought I&#x27;d never regret a deep tan. 4 weeks after using the serum and my skin feels plump &amp; hydrated throughout the day, fine lines are less apparent and I&#x27;ve received several compliments on how young I look and that my skin is \\&quot;radiant.\\&quot; I wash my face with the sweetsation very berry masque and scrub, use an occasional organic pineapple peel, and the I*bright under eye cream from sweetsation. I also just began taking collagen supplements for skin hair and nails. it&#x27;s difficult to pinpoint which products are doing what, but I am happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this product based on the reviews and it being natural.  However, it almost instantly started clogging pores all over my face, I even had blackheads in wierd areas.  This was followed by a week long breakout all over my face that I am still recovering from.  I don&#x27;t recommend if you have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as soon as it came out and am very pleased with the results on my now-dry and aging skin.  Added to my regular Sweetsation Therapy regimen, it&#x27;s helped the skin around my eyes and the lines around my mouth (those are more like crevasses!) firm up and become less prominent; the skin on my face is brighter and tone much more even.  The many dark spots I have are slowly, slowly fading and my skin feels soft, not dry and scaly.  Nothing in this line of skin care products is a quick fix - consistent, diligent use is the key to the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Addendum 6/7/2013:  I continue to use this product; combined with a regular regimen (especially when I remember to wash, tone and moisturize twice a day as recommended) my skin tone (fraught with dark, light and in-between patches!) continues to even out.  The deep creases on the sides of my mouth have lessened, even though I&#x27;ve lost about 25 lbs. since I began using Sweetsations and have lost fat from my face and neck.  Extending the use of LaNouvel Cellular NutriSerum LIGHTLY onto the throat area has helped erase some of the \\&quot;crepe\\&quot; effect of the now-loose skin.  I remain a dedicated Sweetsation Therapy fan!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Serum, it is wonderful product and I will definitely recommend it to everybody! It is wonderful on so many levels: I love that this company using all natural and no chemicals. I was looking for a long time for Organic skin care product, and Sweetsation is the winner so far&#x3D;) I am using this Serum once a day, and the best way was combination of VeryBerry scrub/masque, and after that apply the Serum....Ah, you skin will be really very happy after that! This Serum will make your skin look younger and refreshed, also I love that it absorbs into the skin immediately,  I always applying moisturizing cream after Serum and there was not problem with that! I can be very tired, but skin will stay looking very vibrant and fresh! Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it definitely makes your overall skin look much younger. Big plus that is all natural. love it. just don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
    <li> All time favorite serum!!! A miracle serum for a very very dry skin!!! I get instant result from this serum!!!</li>
    <li> I also tried the LaNouvel Cellular NutriSerum.  This is also another wonderful product!  It is full of ingredients like Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid and more.  So what exactly does this product do?  It helps provide wonderful moisture to the skin.  My skin felt amazing after using it.  The product helps do a number of things, but I am in love with the brightening effect and intense moisturizing that it provides.  I also love that this product will not clog pores.  Moisturizing is super important to me, but sometimes it can cause me to break out.  This product does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample was provided for my blog review.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a very long time. The Product is awesome. I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not one complaint about this stuff.  It is awesome.  I use it along with 100% night balm and couldn&#x27;t have a better routine which I searched for years.  Also bought the Very Berry Masque which again is awesome</li>
    <li> I luckily inherited good skin to begin with, but after using this product for six weeks, it&#x27;s even better (just ordered my second bottle). When applied (to clean skin of course), you can feel the tightening. It leaves no residue. Once dried, apply your moisturizer. This product is worth every penny you pay for it. Highly  recommend it to help preserve as much of your youthful appearance as possible.</li>
    <li> is my favorite product!! you see the difference in your skin at the moment that use it!!!!! and smell so good!!!</li>
    <li> LaNouvel is a great serum. It goes on light (not sticky or greasy, like some other serums), but is still super moisturizing. It is great for making my skin toned, even, and perky and it smells wonderful. I love that it is made with high-quality, natural ingredients :)</li>
    <li> After trying so many product on the market, I can say that I finally found the one and the perfect one,  it feels really good on the skin LOVE IT</li>
    <li> First, I am 38 years old with pretty dry skin, I only have fine lines on my forehead and eyes. I am coming from this as I write my review so keep that in mind if you have very oily, sensitive skin, or deep wrinkes. I use this product in the morning before I moisturize. I would say I do notice my skin looks more plump, dewy and glowy. It smells fantastic and I&#x27;m a big fan of products being as natural and chemical free as possible. I think the price is fair if you compare to other similar products. A little goes a long way too, the dropper may not be full, but that&#x27;s all you need. Two or three drops should cover your face, neck and chest.</li>
    <li> Love the product!! Very nice!! On time!! Perfect condition!! Thank you very much!! The product works really well!! Recomend it to others!!!</li>
    <li> My skin just soaks up this serum like it&#x27;s its favourite drink of the day. Skin is sooo smooth and plump. The smell is heavenly and so is the result. This product is my choice for a serum in my daily facial routine.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it! She said that the serum absorbs quickly and easily into her skin, and it leaves her skin feeling soft, with no oily residue. This serum is very hydrating, and combats any dryness in her skin from being in air conditioning during the summer. This is a repeat order on this product for my wife, because she loves it so much. And it will not be the last!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this, and after using it for a couple of weeks now, I am so afraid to run out, I ordered a full size and it is scheduled to arrive today (just tracked it)...2 days earlier than the earliest promised date, I would like to add! I was also surprised to see the price was lower than I had anticipated for this kind of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed several other SweetSation products, as I ADORE them and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. They are very clever, sending free samples of other products with each order, and I keep getting hooked with each sample - though I am not complaining!!! My skin is glowing thanks to these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before talking about LaNouvel, I want to mention LumiEssence. I am over 43 and have a bit of sun damage on my skin, most recently from a road trip when I didn&#x27;t think to reapply sunscreen in the late afternoons for the setting sun. I know, stupid. And my skin was showing it. Until I started using LumiEssence (free sample struck again! You can read my full review of this if interested...) LumiEssence, used once a day at night immediately started to brighten my skin and diminish the sunspots. They didn&#x27;t go away right away, but they softened to look more like slight tan rather than dark, hard edged spots. And my skin really looked brighter right away! I didn&#x27;t even know any products would do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO then I started using LaNouvel about a month ago...I have recently begun to get some wrinkles...the beginning of wrinkles. I am lucky that they have come later to me than most of my friends my age, I think largely due to my diligent use of SweetSation products. But eventually we must all get wrinkles, and mine finally started. I am THRILLED to report that since I started using LaNouvel, in these 4 weeks, my wrinkles have actually lessened! My skin seems to be making more collagen or something...it looks so great and feels wonderful. I keep seeing myself in the mirror w/o makeup, and thinking, wow, I look younger and so good! And that is not a normal thing for me. It seems to be boosting the effects of the LumiEssence, also, as my skin looks even more fresh and bright. I am sure to put it on my \\&quot;decolette\\&quot; also, where my age had really started to show, and wow. That looks younger, too! YIPPEE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And LaNouvel smells SOOOO good. It has a light, sort of rose scent, but there is something else in the smell I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint. It glides on after my toner, and as soon as it dries, I put either QLumiere (day) or LumiEssence (night) over it and my skin feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you SweetSation for yet another fantastic product that is helping me to keep aging skin at bay! I LOVE YOU! :-)</li>
    <li> I am 65 years old and have been using only natural products for my skin for over 45 years.  I have been using Sweetsation products for several years and highly recommend their product line.  Recently I added the LaNouvel Celluar Nutriserum to my daily regime and I can see a visible improvement on my face.  I love the Sweetsation products for the following reasons:  1)All the products I have purchased do exactly as advertised and do it excellently, 2)these products are well-priced and are much finer than several higher-priced products I have purchased over the years; 3)the entire line of Sweetsation contains components that are good for your skin&#x27;s health and the health of our planet.  Well done!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I came across the reviews of Sweetsation&#x27;s products on Amazon!  I am now in love with this line of skincare!!  I like that the products are made with great, all-natural ingredients and the fact that they actually work.  I have been using LaNouvel Cellular NutriSerum for about 2 weeks and my face already looks so healthy and glowing.  I will continue to use all Sweetsation items!</li>
    <li> Just received this product because it was recommended and I wanted to try it.  I LOVE IT.  As an older women with little tiny spider veins, I was wondering what I could use to help.  When I first applied it, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  This is the little edge that I needed to complete my complexion.  Each day I apply it, I see a little more difference.  The spider veins will not totally go away, but hopefully they will soften.  It appears that the collagen is rejuvenating my complexion.</li>
    <li> overall you can not go wrong with hyaluronic acid, this product is definitely the best smelling on, but for the price I will do without the smell and buy from timeless skin care a big bottle with a dropper</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I think it is on par with other serums and of course the huge benefit is that it&#x27;s not full of bad chemicals.  It&#x27;s not an earth-shattering product or anything, but I&#x27;ve never found one that is.</li>
    <li> Feels very good and smells great, I love this serum and definitely will purchase another one.  I have used different, more expensive serum, by far, this is the best!</li>
