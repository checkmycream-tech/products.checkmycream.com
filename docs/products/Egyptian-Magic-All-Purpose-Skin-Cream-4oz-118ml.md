      <li>Magic~</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me that I had better start using Vaseline...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll have a pretty good size scar on my neck afterwards.</li>
      <li>let others enjoy the magic~~</li>
      <li>This cream is very oily, so it&#x27;s good for my very-dry skin type.</li>
      <li>Other than that its awesome.</li>
      <li>but if you rub it in well, it absorbs very quickly.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural and so good for you.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Its really works at my scar, however, its a bit oily, better use at night time, and my mum love it too.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, you&#x27;ll undoubtedly find many, many uses for it.</li>
      <li>No bad smell, it absorbs well</li>
      <li>I had high expectations for this product considering the many reviews and Youtube videos raving about it.</li>
      <li>Made my face smooth first day I tried, but no effect after.</li>
      <li>Well worth getting and using.</li>
      <li>My cheeks actually hurt even an hour after putting on stuff that is advertised as \\&quot;the most moisturizing super moisturizer of all time.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>Great all natural, unscented, all-over moisturizer for very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>consistency isn&#x27;t the greatest at first, and there is a faint smell, but the results are worth it.  </li>
      <li>and I bought it almost exactly a year ago.</li>
      <li>There is another similar product, Bee Magic, and I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
      <li>This also works on pets, itchy skin, hot spots etc.</li>
      <li>I finally purchased it and am glad I did.</li>
      <li>My makeup settles in perfectly, my face is soft again, and little red spots I had are fading.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband told me the first few days he used Egyptian Magic it worked, just like it was \\&quot;Magic\\&quot;!  </li>
      <li>more dry skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not surprising that more allergies occur (for more info about what harmful ingredients are in YOUR cosmetics, soaps and shampoos go to safecosmetics.org.  </li>
      <li>Egyptian Magic works very well for dry cracked skin which occurs in the winter time.</li>
      <li>I hope it does well for what I really purchased for.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I like the way it feels on the skin and dries fast.</li>
      <li>I do not know what is in here which make it work fast</li>
      <li>Egyptian Magic has only natural ingredients</li>
      <li>Since the cosmetics industry is not regulated and they can put any kind of harmful ingredients they want to in things we use everyday</li>
      <li>I have a whole new face now.  </li>
      <li>I feel like a whole new person.</li>
      <li>It really keeps your skin soft.</li>
      <li>I have also used it on my 9 year old son&#x27;s face and lips!</li>
      <li>natural ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using for a good.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>The ingredients are all natural and there is no fragrance.</li>
      <li>but it never fails in the winter time when the skin gets too dry.</li>
      <li>It actually melts into your skin leaving it feeling extremely soft.</li>
      <li>if you use it to deep condition your hair, make time to wash out completely.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure if it has other magical effect though...</li>
      <li>It is a little greasy when you first apply it</li>

    <li> I heard about this product in a magazine, recommended by some famous actress.  Egyptian Magic has only natural ingredients so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  My poor husband suffers from very sensitive skin and is allergic to almost everything they put in moisturizers these days.  Since the cosmetics industry is not regulated and they can put any kind of harmful ingredients they want to in things we use everyday it&#x27;s not surprising that more allergies occur (for more info about what harmful ingredients are in YOUR cosmetics, soaps and shampoos go to safecosmetics.org.  My husband told me the first few days he used Egyptian Magic it worked, just like it was \\&quot;Magic\\&quot;!  It is a little greasy when you first apply it but if you rub it in well, it absorbs very quickly.  I will be keeping this stuff stocked in my house from now on.  \\&quot;Thanks\\&quot;, Egyptian Magic for ending my husband&#x27;s skin problems!</li>
    <li> My son has acne that scars and this is a product that helps the scarring to heal.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> I left half can of this cream in my aunt&#x27;s home.&lt;br /&gt;She continued to use, and expecting me to bring her a new one.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream back in July. I have used it daily day and night for both my face and hands. I am now only 1/2 way through the jar! It is also great for feet. It really keeps your skin soft. I have also used it on my 9 year old son&#x27;s face and lips! The ingredients are all natural and there is no fragrance.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product considering the many reviews and Youtube videos raving about it. I cannot say it changed my skin in any way, still have occasional to severe acne and other issues. However it is still one of the best moisturizers and I love that it is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;Also it lasts about a year, so don&#x27;t let the price scare you. I am almost out of mine and I bought it almost exactly a year ago.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll use this product much due to the fact it really smells atrocious which makes it hard to put on my face!</li>
    <li> I heard about Egyptian Magic thru a friend on YouTube &amp; figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s amazing stuff! Can be used for scars, dry skin, irritated skin, stretch marks, rosacea, you name it, it does it. Even good as a light hair mask! I have scars on my leg from a bad car accident &amp; they are actually fading. This product is all natural containing royal jelly &amp; propolis which are very good for you. I put it on my cheeks where I have slight rosacea and it&#x27;s faded, and I&#x27;m finding my skin is much less oily than before I used it. This also works on pets, itchy skin, hot spots etc. I use it on mosquito bites &amp; it gets rid of the itch. There is another similar product, Bee Magic, and I&#x27;ve tried it. Egyptian Magic is superior, it may cost more than Bee Magic, but it&#x27;s worth it. A very little goes a long way. I highly recommend this product, you&#x27;ll undoubtedly find many, many uses for it. I&#x27;m buying the 8 oz size when I run low on my 4 oz!</li>
    <li> I found  this product by searching for scar cream. I&#x27;ll be having surgery soon and I&#x27;ll have a pretty good size scar on my neck afterwards. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and hands. I really like it. No bad smell, it absorbs well and it feels nice on my lips. I hope it does well for what I really purchased for. I will update later. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Magic~ magic~ magic~ just 2 weeks~ great positive effect ~~ repair my skin~~ i will recommend it to my friends~~ let others enjoy the magic~~</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product for your skin!  It heals my dry, cracked winter hands overnight! It&#x27;s all natural and so good for you.  I will never be without this product ever again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I have extremely dry skin on my face, and no creams work.  My cheeks actually hurt even an hour after putting on stuff that is advertised as \\&quot;the most moisturizing super moisturizer of all time.\\&quot;  My crows feet were pronounced and making me feel like the Crypt Keeper, and I was dreading trips to dry climates because of the pain my face would be in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me that I had better start using Vaseline...but that creeped me out.  I had a jar of EM sitting in my closet that just popped out at me, and without hesitation, I slathered it on.  I have a whole new face now.  My makeup settles in perfectly, my face is soft again, and little red spots I had are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency isn&#x27;t the greatest at first, and there is a faint smell, but the results are worth it.  I feel like a whole new person.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product long before Madonna touted it.  I use it for my hair - which tends to be dry and frizzy.  It tames it down and shines it up.  I use it on my lips and any scratches or burns I get.  Also on rough spots on my skin from living in a very dry climate.  Be careful about clothing around it - it is an oil and will stain some clothes. I use it almost daily and a jar lasts me close to a year.  Well worth getting and using.</li>
    <li> Bought this product couple months ago. Completely useless to my skin because mine is very sensitive. Made my face smooth first day I tried, but no effect after.</li>
    <li> if you use it to deep condition your hair, make time to wash out completely.  Great for cuticles and elbows</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for dry, cracked or chapped skin.  Also promotes healing of burns, scrapes and minor cuts.  A small jar lasts forever even with two people using it daily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive vasaline.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything.  If you put it on your face, it&#x27;s so greasy you have to wipe it down before you stain something.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom who is going through radiation treatments, per a recommendation of another friend who had radiation.  My sister is staying with my mom during the treatments and is using it all over for herself (and she is NOT in radiation)  so it&#x27;s got the stamp of approval from most of my family.</li>
    <li> This product is good for skin.&lt;br /&gt;All natural ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using for a good.&lt;br /&gt;No more dry skin. It&#x27;s oily but next  morning my skin is softer than before.</li>
    <li> This cream is very oily, so it&#x27;s good for my very-dry skin type. I used this cream all over my body and face. It helps to moisturize the face and create a good base before putting on makeup. I am not sure if it has other magical effect though...</li>
    <li> I recieved my item as scheduled. I heard about this item from a kate hudson interview and wanted to try it for so long. I finally purchased it and am glad I did. It actually melts into your skin leaving it feeling extremely soft. The only disappointment is that its odorless, I was expecting it to smell like vanilla lol don&#x27;t ask why i just did lol. Other than that its awesome.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this product after reading that it was a long trusted beauty secret to celebs and models.  I love it!  Great all natural, unscented, all-over moisturizer for very dry skin.  And a small amount goes a long ways.  This product is a heavier cream and does not contain SPF, so I would not recommend for day time use.  However, I use this product everynight before bed and all over the bosy wherever I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Its really works at my scar, however, its a bit oily, better use at night time, and my mum love it too.</li>
    <li> Egyptian Magic works very well for dry cracked skin which occurs in the winter time. I like the way it feels on the skin and dries fast. I do not know what is in here which make it work fast but it never fails in the winter time when the skin gets too dry. Price is a little high though.</li>
