      <li>I personally experienced much better hair from using Pantene products and recommended them to others.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I used the Beautiful Lengths line from Pantene Pro V about 2 years back with great results.  </li>
      <li>Love Pantene hair products.</li>

      <li>I am 54, but my hair looks more like teenager hair when I use Pantene.</li>
      <li>My hair always looks better when I have been using Pantene on it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, and noticed my hair grow.</li>
      <li>I love the clean feeling and the shine!  </li>
      <li>I used Pantene Time Renewal and then their Beautiful Length line of products over anything I could get through the professional line of products.</li>
      <li>It really makes my hair feel good.</li>
      <li>This was great at first for like the first 3 days, then after that is when the grossness started to seap in.  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair and tons of it.</li>
      <li>I thought maybe i&#x27;m not rinsing it out good enough,</li>
      <li>I am done being a loyal consumer.</li>
      <li>I always go back to this product, so I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>This product really works!!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m definitely getting a refund for this one - had to shampoo my hair with a different shampoo to make it feel clean again.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner complement each other and my hair feels soft and stays clean with these two products.</li>
      <li>and I have had less breakage and my hair is starting to look healthy again.</li>
      <li>The rest of the world is steering clear of Sulfates except for Pantene.</li>
      <li>My hair felt soft and silky.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this product! The shampoo and conditioner complement each other and my hair feels soft and stays clean with these two products. I have tried many other shampoos and conditioners over the years, but I always come back to these. My hairdresser says they are crap, but I use them anyway and he always remarks on the health of my hair! Go figure...&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works great for my hair and scalp. I love the clean feeling and the shine!  Less breakage and fewer split ends, too.</li>
    <li> I just recently discovered I had thyroid problems. I was losing a lot of hair and was trying to find something that would help. This product has helped a lot and smells great!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and I have had less breakage and my hair is starting to look healthy again.</li>
    <li> Used this for my fine shoulder length thin hair a for about 3 times, my hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for WEEKS!!  This shampoo from Pentene GOT TO GO!!  It&#x27;s the WORST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> Normally, I like this stuff, but when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, I ordered it on amazon.  I got a bad batch and the maker of it wouldn&#x27;t let me return it or give me a refund.  Ordering it from Amazon doesn&#x27;t make sense since you&#x27;d have to pay to return it if it&#x27;s bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair greasy and feel dirty.</li>
    <li> Got it for a great price. it&#x27;s shampoo and it cleans my hair. What else can I ask for.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and noticed my hair grow.</li>
    <li> I have hair down to my backside. This product keeps it strong and healthy with very few split ednds</li>
    <li> Love Pantene hair products. My hair always looks better when I have been using Pantene on it. I am 54, but my hair looks more like teenager hair when I use Pantene. Without it, it can look limp and thin. It is a little bit more money than some other grocery store brands, but worth every penny, and it is a lot cheaper than most salon brands but performs every bit as well.</li>
    <li> I really like Pantene shampoo and conditioner. This one does seem to make my hair stronger as I have less split ends and my hair can grow longer before I need a hair cut. I also have the conditioner and I have been using both for a few months.</li>
    <li> It did not clean my hair, I was expecting it would really clean since Pantene shampoo tends to strip hair but this felt like I was washing with conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like Pantene, but this is my favorite. It really makes my hair feel good. It&#x27;s soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> I used Pantene Time Renewal and then their Beautiful Length line of products over anything I could get through the professional line of products. I personally experienced much better hair from using Pantene products and recommended them to others. However, NO MORE! They keep changing their hair products and now all of their shampoos contain Sulphates. The rest of the world is steering clear of Sulfates except for Pantene. They actually have changed for the worse. Who are they marketing for anyway? The products are very drying and are not good. Just look at the horrible reviews from other loyal frustrated Pantene users. Who in the world is making the decision to re-vamp Pantene products? I am done being a loyal consumer. I am looking for another brand.</li>
    <li> I have very long thick hair.  This product made my hair feel sticky and dirty.  No matter how much I rinsed it, my hair still felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in days.  I&#x27;m definitely getting a refund for this one - had to shampoo my hair with a different shampoo to make it feel clean again.  I would never recommend this Pantene product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair that&#x27;s sensitive to the humidity and has been dyed just a few times.  This shampoo is great for my hair.  I use it pretty regularly (although sometimes I&#x27;ll try something on sale), and I don&#x27;t feel like I ever have a lot of build up.  I always go back to this product, so I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product really works!!</li>
    <li> I used both the shampoo and the conditioner.  And in the beginning I loved it.  My hair felt soft and silky.  And I seemed to have fewer fly aways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a week I noticed that my hair was almost gummy.  It felt like it hadn&#x27;t been rinsed.  But no matter how long I rinsed, the feeling didn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using a clarifying shampoo and conditioner for a week to get all of the gunk out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work, if you want to use it for a day or so.  But long term, for long hair, it isn&#x27;t a good option.</li>
    <li> I am 29 yrs old Female.  This was great at first for like the first 3 days, then after that is when the grossness started to seap in.  I thought maybe i&#x27;m not rinsing it out good enough, so i hopped in the shower lathered my hair up with this sick stuff, and I made sure to spend extra time rinsing it ALL out, but to no availe, it just got worse.  I waited till maybe my hair dried, and Nope!  it just got worse., it felt like someone dumped glue on my hair!!! DON\\&quot;T BUY THIS PRODUCT, ITS NASTY!!!</li>
    <li> They definitely changed their formula.  I used the Beautiful Lengths line from Pantene Pro V about 2 years back with great results.  Now the shampoo especially made the roots of my hair super greasy/waxy feeling.  You can feel this immediately after rinsing in the shower - feels like product build up/dirtiness!  And I do not use styling products on my hair!  Once your hair is dry, it looks flat, dirty, and greasy - it also gave me light dandruff :(  The conditioner (I only use on bottom half of hair) left my hair soft but the ends dry.  I hate their new formula and will be calling Pantene for a refund!!</li>
    <li> This cream style shampoo really weighs my hair down. I have baby fine hair and tons of it. This product makes my hair feel very heavy. I really don&#x27;t care for the texture or creaminess of this shampoo. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
