      <li>But for $10.00 it is worth</li>
      <li>( besides, you can always reapply it ) ; These are probably one of the better alternatives and a pretty good choices IMO for people on a budget who want smell like they&#x27;re wearing more expensive fragrances.</li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast.  </li>
      <li>Sure it&#x27;s not as refine and strong as the real deal, and It won&#x27;t last on your skin as long as 1 Million, but good enough for the price</li>

      <li>and I got quite a few compliments on what was that I had on that smelled so good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it is the first time that I buy it good colony his smell it is soft and also agreeably and durarero I recommend good product and he would buy the whole line of the fragrance cuba</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a fragrance that smelled like tobacco. This won&#x27;t make you smell like a cigar at all. More like a hairy Cuban guy with a mustache who smokes cigars. It is quite nice and I can easily see myself wearing it (I am 24 years old). But I wanted something that smelled like tobacco and more old manish (I am also peculiar in that I shave with antique safety razors) so I kept the Cigar by Remy Latour that I ordered together with this and gave the Cuba Royal to my dad of 50 something years. He likes it and my mom likes it.  I don&#x27;t know who is this Paco perfume people keep mentioning about but this one is quite nice and I can smell it the whole day though it is subtle. It seems cheap at first  spray but after 15 minutes dry down it smells very good and smells just like an expensive cologne. The morning after I sprayed it on my wrist I could still smell this-- though very very faint.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. I love 1 million but it&#x27;s kind of pricey. I found this and was a little skeptical but ordered it anyway. I paid ten dollars after shipping for a huge bottle and it&#x27;s identical to 1 million. It may only last around eight hours compared to the almost all day scent from 1 million, but it is definitely worth saving the extra forty or so dollars. Will for sure buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this. Very pleasant smell. My wife enjoys it, just with it lasted a little longer. Overall a very nice cologne. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Just as Cuba Gold is to Le Male, this one is to Paco Rabanne 1 million... Sure it&#x27;s not as refine and strong as the real deal, and It won&#x27;t last on your skin as long as 1 Million, but good enough for the price ( besides, you can always reapply it ) ; These are probably one of the better alternatives and a pretty good choices IMO for people on a budget who want smell like they&#x27;re wearing more expensive fragrances.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much the product arrived successfully</li>
    <li> Love the cuba collection. I have three different ones.</li>
    <li> The product is a nice size....cool packaging and it smells pretty good i like it so far. I haven&#x27;t worn the scent out yet but im excited to. (Update) I&#x27;ve really fallen in love with this scent. Men like it and women like it. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments this past month. Great buy.</li>
    <li> smells great, yes like 1 million and for me lasts just as long.</li>
    <li> This could be an everyday Cologne for me,, smells great and for the price, its all good..&lt;br /&gt;I always have at Least 3 Cuba styles Colognes on my list as I think they all smell great..</li>
    <li> I feel like an idiot for buying 1 Million from Sephora.  Cuba Royal copied it P E R F E C T L Y.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I sprayed my Dad&#x27;s Cuba Royal I was thinking \\&quot;this is probably gonna smell cheap as hell\\&quot;.  1 second later I was shocked.  I have 1 Million on my right arm and Cuba Royal on my left arm and I can&#x27;t tell the difference 6 hours later except for the potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 24 hours later I can smell the 1 Million.  Cuba Royal disappeared around the 8 hour mark.  It still makes more sense to buy Cuba Royal.  Carry one cigar in your bag and keep one at home.  The price is incredible for the EXACT smell of 1 Million.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Doesn&#x27;t have the rich scent I was anticipating. I will give it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love to smell my husband when he uses it lol. Good quality!</li>
    <li> this is a must have. smells great. not too heavy or over powering. makes a perfect gift, and travels well with the metal containers. also come in range of great smells.</li>
    <li> Smells just like Le male....maybe even a little better.  I didn&#x27;t really like Le male very much but this isn&#x27;t a bad sent its kind of nice.  Like sexy baby powder.</li>
    <li> well good, I recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my boyfriend for Christmas as a gift, he says he loves this perfume, is his favorite, he tried before with One Million, as they&#x27;re really similar, but this one is better and a LOT cheaper, also gives him a good scent when he smokes :).</li>
    <li> Very good scent just like one million for a good price.</li>
    <li> One Million smells great.  Oh wait, I&#x27;m reviewing Cuba Royal which is the same for $10! If you paid $80 for One Million, I know it&#x27;s hard for you to accept.  BTW, Cuba Prestige &#x3D; A*men/Angel and Cuba Gold &#x3D; JPG LeMale.</li>
    <li> This stuff is better than Million Dollar that sells for $65-$75.Love it Love it Love it !!!!</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I have way too many colognes.  But I like choices, and I like to experiment with layering favorite scents.  I have several different eau de toilette sprays by Cuba, and I have found most to be reliably interesting and appealing - and they are absolutely always a great value.  Manly and spicy without being loud and over-bearing.  Cuba Royal offers some attractive notes at an attractive price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an ex smoker of 1.5 years so my smell is coming back and I just love this stuff!  I purchased the 1.7 for 5 bucks at a clothing place in phoenix and so glad I did!  The little one stays in the car!  The fragrance smells so good and strong at first (Great Atomizer Helps That) So the big burst that goes up your nose aids in you thinking it&#x27;s not working in four hours but my Wife says it&#x27;s working just fine!  I&#x27;ll spay another shot just cuz I like it so much and the price allows for &amp;#34;Use All You Want&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> not real cigar! it&#x27;s cigar shaped spray! Do not buy it if you want cigar! it is not returnable! bad luck!</li>
    <li> This is such a great product my wife absolutely loves this and its a great deal this is far better than the price this could easily be a $65 value as it smells just as good as any designer fragrance out there !</li>
    <li> Simply two words: THE BEST.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes,long lasting,,smells great,highly recommended.great shipping as well.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Fantastic Xmas present for my husband</li>
    <li> This is just amazing. A lot of similarity with One Million. Would be excellent if this last longer, but generally very good for the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my honey a happy man! Great smell and great price! I love pretty much all of their scents! They make great gifts!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a  gift the smell is really good, loved it.</li>
    <li> Just saw the reviews for this cologne and decided to order some for myself.  It smells great and has lasted for about 6 hours so far with only a few sprays.  It is definitely something that attracts attention and very nicely priced.</li>
    <li> Cuba royal cologne is a unique scent,very minty like scent.Not one of my favorites.But for $10.00 it is worth it.projection is projection is subtle and longevity is 6plus hours.</li>
    <li> Stuff smells just like 1million. I cant get over how much it smells like it.  I bout 3 bottles and it gets&lt;br /&gt;The ladies to turn heads all the time .whenever they ask what im wearing I just say 1 million lol this stuff is awsoms&lt;br /&gt;E  I even had several women ask me am I wearing 1 million I just say yes I mean why not lol do your self a favor guys and save your cash on that expensive stuff nobody has to knowe you paid under 10.00 I gove this fragrance 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Sweeter scent, but great price!</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m quite impressed, smells like one million and worth it for the amount of juice you get</li>
    <li> YESSSS!!!!! BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AND IT DRIVES ME WILD EVERY TIME HE PUT&#x27;S IT ON!!!! ;)</li>
    <li> Great scent and for only $9 how can you pass it up?? I will be getting more soon.  I&#x27;m a new huge fan!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my friend and he absolutely loves it. Shipping was very fast.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Did not last as long as expected.</li>
    <li> The scent is very exciting and perhaps a bit on the sweeter side. I would recommend it for evening/date wear as opposed to wearing it to work. The price is excellent too.</li>
    <li> I loved the scent.  It was long lasting and I got quite a few compliments on what was that I had on that smelled so good.</li>
    <li> A gift to a friend how told me he just love this stuff. The ladies always ask &amp;#34;what he&#x27;s wearing that smell so goooood&amp;#34;???</li>
    <li> excellent product, thanks</li>
    <li> $10 cologne, smells like $30 cologne. So I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> As close as you&#x27;re going to get to 1 million. Interesting bottle, it does have a powdery note in there that makes it a little less masculine than 1 million. The longevity and projection definitely isn&#x27;t up to par as the real deal. But it&#x27;s great for the price!</li>
    <li> Good cologne but short lasting. I guess ok for work.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t really complain. It smells good and comes in a cool bottle. Doesn&#x27;t last very long though. I will always say spend the extra money and get the good stuff.</li>
    <li> Brought this home and my wife immediately loved it. She said that out of all the cuba scents so far, this is her favorite.</li>
    <li> TIENE BUEN OLOR, ME HAN DICHO QUE ES BUEN PERFUME.</li>
    <li> A very good alternative to 1 Million.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long and doesn&#x27;t project as much as 1 Million, but that could be a good thing if you&#x27;re the type that doesn&#x27;t want to bomb a room with fragrance and could get annoyed smelling the same thing for 12 hours.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this purchase and the seller&#x27;s concern for my feedback. I give this seller high KUDOS. This is the second time we&#x27;ve purchased from them and plan to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;Joe Richard</li>
    <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this cologne, Cuba colognes are fantastic, affordable, cool bottles and all of them smell AWESOME!  I bought my husband every kind they offer!</li>
    <li> Smells great. I will continue to get this product.</li>
    <li> ausome spary for half the price great product and recieved it on time.</li>
    <li> cuba royal smells amazing. the package arrived on time and when i unpacked it and put some one in front of the family they all loved it. when this bottle is empty i would defenitely purchase cuba royal again.great scent for low price</li>
