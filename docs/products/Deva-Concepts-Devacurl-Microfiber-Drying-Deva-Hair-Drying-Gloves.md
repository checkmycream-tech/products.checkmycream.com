      <li>Great invention!</li>
      <li>I love it!!!</li>
      <li>These are ideal over a towel to get the best looking curls.</li>
      <li>They are sturdy and scrunched my hair beautifully.</li>
      <li>But they are great for scrunching my curly hair to get the excess water and product out when i do my Curly Girl hair routine.  </li>

      <li>The material works great.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THEM!!  </li>
      <li>LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
      <li>With these on, wherever I move my hands to scrunch, it scrunched my curls in the shape of my hands/fingers and got out the water nicely!</li>
      <li>I use them to scrunch my hair while using a diffuser and they help prevent frizz fairly well.</li>
      <li>good to know.</li>

      <li>OK... so I have been using the Deva Curl system for 6 months... and was going on vacation.  </li>
      <li>I just purchased many of the Deva products to start trying out on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Ingenious idea for curly hair</li>
      <li>and I love it...</li>
      <li>My favorite.....</li>
      <li>Please come up with a more earth-friendly package.</li>
      <li>I use deva curl every thing in my hair and I love all the products.</li>
      <li>So I wasn&#x27;t sure about these, but I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I LOVE the gloves though.</li>
      <li>I gave used many microfiber type towels in my hair over the years and they never got moldy.</li>
      <li>Works better anyway.</li>
      <li>I use them much more often than the towel</li>
      <li>I love the gloves.</li>
      <li>but I really love the ease of use.</li>
      <li>Just OK, stick with the towel version.  </li>
      <li>more absorbent.</li>
      <li>They work better and are easier to use than a microfiber towel.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about these.  </li>
      <li>Did I mention I absolutely LOVE these??????</li>
      <li>I have medium length hair, and it works, but the Deva towel works better for me than the gloves.</li>
      <li>and I love the gloves!&lt;br /&gt;I am able to remove the excess water easily while scrunching my hair close to the scalp with no frizz whatsoever.</li>
      <li>, I stop and stare at it in the mirror often since I was almost certain I&#x27;d lost my hair for good.</li>
      <li>Has made a great difference in my natural curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Styling my hair has never been more easy and really fun.</li>
      <li>great for getting the extra water out of hair before applying get.</li>
      <li>Frizz free Afro for me.</li>
      <li>It is amazing how much water they absorb</li>
      <li>These work great on short hair.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re super comfortable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>These seems like a great idea to save on using paper towels to dry my hair.</li>
      <li>They may just end up absorbing most of the gel.</li>
      <li>...for the same price you can buy 2 packs of 8 men&#x27;s 100% cotton white t-shirts and they work great!</li>
      <li>They do the job quickly and naturally!&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Downside... I have shoulder length hair and they saturate quickly.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly plus they are like the towel but are gloves so they are easier to travel with because they aren&#x27;t mistaken for a hotel towel.</li>
      <li>I have corkskrew curls that would get REALLY frizzy and the gloves mixed with the products have made a HUGE difference!!!</li>
      <li>At first I would have given these 5 stars!</li>
      <li>Fun to use, too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are worth the money.  </li>
      <li>They were definitely worth the price for me.</li>
      <li>, I put my gloves on and pull the excess water out and start designing right then.</li>
      <li>- I use the towel for my hairs right after the wash.</li>
      <li>Gentler on your hair (follow the Curly Girls Handbook to know how to care for your hair with these products) and dries them the right amount before applying your DevaCurl gel.</li>
      <li>just right with the towel.  </li>
      <li>These gloves look kind of weird, but they totally do an effective job of removing excess water from my hair without making it frizzy!</li>
      <li>But since I air dry for the best curls, getting more of the water out of the hair with the gloves has cut my air dry time down and that is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Even though they&#x27;re large, they&#x27;re not awkward once on</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is they have to be taken off if you need to put more gel in your hair.</li>
      <li>It could have been there the first time I used them, I just didn&#x27;t know it because my finger didn&#x27;t go thru it.</li>
      <li>That it can look as healthy and lustrous as it now does is nothing short of a miracle for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Work exactly as needed.  </li>
      <li>Since this Curly Girl process requires gently \\&quot;scrunching\\&quot; the hair and never combing or brushing it, the gloves play a major role in keeping your curls frizz free and super shiny.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not super-absorbent, but they worked very well and they&#x27;re very large.  </li>
      <li>My hair is pretty fine and not long, but I did expect the gloves to absorb more moisture than they actually did.</li>
      <li>I took them off, added in my ArcAngel (now the UDG/Ultra-Defining Gel) mixed with the Styling Creme - put these back on, scrunched, clipped my roots and used my DevaFuser to get gorgeous</li>
      <li>So much so that I drilled a hold in my bathroom wall to put up a special hanger for them (because they have cute little tabs</li>
      <li>You could easily use a man&#x27;s Hanes undershirt and get the same result</li>
      <li>If you need them more than once a day, they may not be dry when you need them.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re okay, but get so wet that I end up having to use paper towels anyway.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>And I use the gloves later for additional drying before applying DevaCurl Light Defining Gel.</li>
      <li>Very absorbent and no hair damage.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easier than the towels because you can really grab onto the curls and scrub your roots (gently, of course).  </li>
      <li>My curls are soft, shiny and so healthy, I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
      <li>i hang them right outside the shower and find it easier to scrunch and get the excess water out of my hair right away.</li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Plus, I live in humid Houston and we&#x27;ve actually been enjoying some cool, dry weather, so I can only imagine that things will just as normal when summer is here...</li>
      <li>Would have to say it&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault tho, they were newly packaged.</li>
      <li>I tried using regular microfiber towels on my wet hair but found that these Devacurl gloves are much better.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like these gloves and using them is a bit easier than using the towel. Since they are one size fits all they&#x27;re a little big but they get the job done!</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly plus they are like the towel but are gloves so they are easier to travel with because they aren&#x27;t mistaken for a hotel towel.</li>
    <li> I use these and a microfiber towel to dry my curls. These are ideal over a towel to get the best looking curls. Gentler on your hair (follow the Curly Girls Handbook to know how to care for your hair with these products) and dries them the right amount before applying your DevaCurl gel. Get a few pairs or a spare towel as wet gloves won&#x27;t dry curly hair properly.</li>
    <li> These work great on short hair.  A heavy towel is damaging to hair and pulls at the roots.  Keep the towel on your body and these gloves are perfect for the hair you have to live with.</li>
    <li> The microfiber fabric works well and absorbs water from my wet hair but I would prefer it as a towel. Since my hands are wet after getting out of the shower, it is very difficult to put the gloves on. Consequently, I don&#x27;t even try to wear them but I just use them flat, as I would a towel.</li>
    <li> These gloves look kind of weird, but they totally do an effective job of removing excess water from my hair without making it frizzy!</li>
    <li> Great invention! no frizz Frizz free Afro for me.</li>
    <li> Love my gloves! Fun to use, too.</li>
    <li> These work well but are a pain to use. The gloves are hard to get on when your hands are wet, get white all over your hands, and get too wet to use rather quickly. I prefer using a microfiber travel towel instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been trying products for my curly hair my entire life-30 years and FINALLY found some products that work! I use the gloves in combination with the difuser. When I travel I&#x27;ll probably just bring the gloves only. The material works great. I do get a little frizz still but I&#x27;m practicing on the use of combo with this and Devafuser</li>
    <li> Gloves seem to run a little small - I have a hard time getting my hands in.  It would help if there were elastic around the wrists.</li>
    <li> Much easier that using the DevaCurl towel, wish I would have gotten them a long time ago. Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I also have the Deva towel, I think the gloves are equally as good.  Quality is little off on these as I needed to re-sew some of the stitching but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I just figured I would give it a try since the Deva line works so well for me.  Thought the glove shaped microfiber towels( MF towels that I can  buy in giant bags for just $12)  were just a gimmick.  But since I air dry for the best curls, getting more of the water out of the hair with the gloves has cut my air dry time down and that is fantastic.  I did not give 5 stars since I think these are overpriced.  FYI, when I read the instructions, I saw that microfiber towels should not be washed with other items in the washing machine as the lint reduces efficiency of the MF towels. good to know.</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty fine and not long, but I did expect the gloves to absorb more moisture than they actually did.</li>
    <li> I love the gloves. They look ridiculous and may seem unnecessary, but i find them so much easier to use then the deva towel and  more absorbent. i hang them right outside the shower and find it easier to scrunch and get the excess water out of my hair right away. They were definitely worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> I guess I was looking for something to buy when I ordered these, because when they arrived I thought they were ridiculous.  But when I used them I was astounded to see that they have made it possible for me to style my hair the way my hairdresser does (and he just uses a towel). I don&#x27;t know why, but I have more control over scrunching and my hair comes out looking great.  (BUT A NOTE TO DEVA: The packaging is horribly wasteful!  Please come up with a more earth-friendly package. They&#x27;re just gloves!)</li>
    <li> OK... so I have been using the Deva Curl system for 6 months... and was going on vacation.  I didn&#x27;t want to bring my expensive full-sized microfiber towel because I was only taking one carry-on suitcase AND I was afraid of losing it if it was accidentally picked up by housekeeping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus - I decided to try the gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OHMYGOSH!  I LOVE THEM!!  No maneuvering the towel. They do the job quickly and naturally!&lt;br /&gt;They have a little loop on them so I can hang them to dry.  I wash them once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside... I have shoulder length hair and they saturate quickly. Sometimes I take them off and put them on the other hand to use &#x27;both sides&#x27; to get my hair dry quickly.  They also take awhile to to dry.  If you need them more than once a day, they may not be dry when you need them.  I did have this happen once on my vacation.  I usually do not wash my hair twice a day but we had been swimming and I had to get the chlorine out.  Since this is not &#x27;typical&#x27;, I don&#x27;t see this as an ongoing problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like them enough that I will be ordering a second pair for the rare &#x27;extra washes&#x27; and to have one hanging - and one pair in the closet to ensure I always have a clean dry pair on wash days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THESE!  LOVE THESE!  Did I mention I absolutely LOVE these??????</li>
    <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed in these, for the price. I bought them from ULTA and have not noticed a bit of difference in using them, vs. just using a soft cotton t-shirt to dry my hair. Note: I have thin, curly / wavy combination hair. Not sure if that has anything to do with it, but thought I should mention in case it has something to do with texture(?)</li>
    <li> These are ok, but are not really necessary... and therefore, not worth the money.  It works just as well to use an old cotton tee shirt.</li>
    <li> These gloves crunch your curls at the same time as squeezing out excess water.  They work better and are easier to use than a microfiber towel.</li>
    <li> These are nice gloves. I bought them in addition to the DevaCurl towel - I use the towel for my hairs right after the wash. And I use the gloves later for additional drying before applying DevaCurl Light Defining Gel. But you definitely can live without these gloves. It&#x27;s just nice addition to the line.</li>
    <li> The gloves were constructed very poorly so the seams split after 4-5 uses. I like using the gloves to reduce frizz after washing my hair, but the poor quality makes me feel very disappointed with the purchase. For $20.00, the gloves should have held up to squeezing water out of hair. I would recommend getting a microfiber towel instead of the gloves.</li>
    <li> Item as expected …fast shipping.. love the way they work on my curly hair!</li>
    <li> Work exactly as needed.  Helps create and preserve amazing curls.  Love them!</li>
    <li> These gloves work well with the Deva products.  Keeps frizz out when using instead of bare hands.</li>
    <li> These are a must ....i have curly hair and they just soak up the water and there is no frizz involved...I wish these were around 20 years ago!!!</li>
    <li> These work as described; however, they leave their own microfiber lint in my hair. I washed them first without fabric softener and hung them to dry, but still -- lint.</li>
    <li> I tried using regular microfiber towels on my wet hair but found that these Devacurl gloves are much better.  Very absorbent and no hair damage.</li>
    <li> I love these gloves!  Although I have to admit they make me feel like Mickey Mouse when I put them on.  But they are great for scrunching my curly hair to get the excess water and product out when i do my Curly Girl hair routine.  They&#x27;re easier than the towels because you can really grab onto the curls and scrub your roots (gently, of course).  I have the gloves for home and I take towels with me to the gym.</li>
    <li> ...for the same price you can buy 2 packs of 8 men&#x27;s 100% cotton white t-shirts and they work great! Just a tip.</li>
    <li> My favorite.....don&#x27;t let your kids steal them!</li>
    <li> Ingenious idea for curly hair</li>
    <li> I have both the towel and the gloves and I love the gloves!&lt;br /&gt;I am able to remove the excess water easily while scrunching my hair close to the scalp with no frizz whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I just purchased many of the Deva products to start trying out on my hair.  These gloves are one size and a bit large for my tiny hands.  However, they are well-made, soft, and absorbent. I like that they each have a loop on them so you can hang them to dry. I use them to scrunch my hair while using a diffuser and they help prevent frizz fairly well. Trying to scrunch hair w/ a towel while diffusing would be very awkward. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is they have to be taken off if you need to put more gel in your hair. However, I may try to see what happens if I try to put gel in my hands while they are on. They may just end up absorbing most of the gel.</li>
    <li> Just OK, stick with the towel version.  The gloves just don&#x27;t have enough mass to soak up all my wet hear. I find I am taking them off and turning them around so I can use both the front and the back. Too much trouble.</li>
    <li> I got these wonderful gloves and used them as described. Styling my hair has never been more easy and really fun. I look forward to every morning after I get out the shower, I put my gloves on and pull the excess water out and start designing right then. It holds water well like microfiber towels</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking--gloves in the shower? My hands are average size and these gloves are too long for my fingers and tight on my wrists. It is awkward to put them on, so I just hold them in my hands and use them like two small towels. I have medium length hair, and it works, but the Deva towel works better for me than the gloves.</li>
    <li> these are alright, i prefer using a tshirt and find these to get wet quick.</li>
    <li> My daughter - in- law loves them.</li>
    <li> Would give them 5, but they need to be washed after a few uses or they don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Works just as described!</li>
    <li> I used my Deva Gloves for the 1st time yesterday and I notied a HUGE differance already! I have corkskrew curls that would get REALLY frizzy and the gloves mixed with the products have made a HUGE difference!!! Great buy!</li>
    <li> use these gloves every day after using the DevaCurl products.  great for getting the extra water out of hair before applying get. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These seems like a great idea to save on using paper towels to dry my hair. They&#x27;re okay, but get so wet that I end up having to use paper towels anyway.</li>
    <li> At first I would have given these 5 stars! I use deva curl every thing in my hair and I love all the products. I used them for about 2 weeks. Washing my hair every other to every 2 days. I always put them somewhere to dry. Within 2 weeks I noticed black spots on them. I washed them. Turned out to be MOLD!!! I gave used many microfiber type towels in my hair over the years and they never got moldy. Money wasted, I threw them away. Do NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Use an old  T-shirt. Works better anyway.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about these.  I am a strict-Deva follower from the time I wash it to the time I dry it (DevaFuser).  I have used the Deva towel and I love it...but it&#x27;s not very large.  My Deva stylist told me to use cheese/flour cloths instead, so I bought some of them.  They&#x27;re not super-absorbent, but they worked very well and they&#x27;re very large.  So I wasn&#x27;t sure about these, but I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll use my cheese cloths for (dusting?)...I am in love with these gloves.  So much so that I drilled a hold in my bathroom wall to put up a special hanger for them (because they have cute little tabs so you can hang them up!).  YES, they are snug on the wrists - you could probably cut out that band if needed, or make a slit just to get the band to not be tight.  For me, they&#x27;re fine, but I know it was a complaint.  They are sturdy and scrunched my hair beautifully. The Deva Towel did, but it was hard to get your hands just right with the towel.  With these on, wherever I move my hands to scrunch, it scrunched my curls in the shape of my hands/fingers and got out the water nicely! I took them off, added in my ArcAngel (now the UDG/Ultra-Defining Gel) mixed with the Styling Creme - put these back on, scrunched, clipped my roots and used my DevaFuser to get gorgeous curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are worth the money.  I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing another pair so I have back-up when I travel since I travel a lot for work.  Even though they&#x27;re large, they&#x27;re not awkward once on and you start scrunching.  I recommend them! They came super-fast.</li>
    <li> These gloves help remove the moisture from my curly hair without causing frizz.  They are a little awkward because they are very wide and the closure is tight on my large hands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27; works beautifully! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Has made a great difference in my natural curly hair.  It is amazing how much water they absorb</li>
    <li> The second time I used the gloves I found a hole in the right glove between the pointer and middle fingers.  It could have been there the first time I used them, I just didn&#x27;t know it because my finger didn&#x27;t go thru it. Would have to say it&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault tho, they were newly packaged.</li>
    <li> Forget the towel, get these gloves! I&#x27;ve had the towels for years and I use it intermittently. I&#x27;m not a great fan of the fact I have to wash it separately because it collects lint like crazy. I LOVE the gloves though. I use them much more often than the towel and I use them correctly to get just enough water out of my hair without damaging my hair like I would with a regular towel. They&#x27;re super comfortable and easy to use. Are these a necessity? No. You could easily use a man&#x27;s Hanes undershirt and get the same result but I really love the ease of use.</li>
    <li> Though equal to the towels that are similar products, and much easier to use then a towel, I still find that it makes my thick, dry, curly hair too frizzy.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been healthier than it is since I&#x27;ve begun using the Devacurl system. I&#x27;ve read the \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; book and I follow the system religiously. My curls are soft, shiny and so healthy, I&#x27;ll never go back. I was recently very ill, and I lost a great deal of my hair. What was left was a horror. I mean, it was the stuff of nightmares. Thin, straw-like strands of sad,little wisps was all I had left. I got most of it cut off and started using this system, and my hair looks so good now, I stop and stare at it in the mirror often since I was almost certain I&#x27;d lost my hair for good. That it can look as healthy and lustrous as it now does is nothing short of a miracle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably, I have an abundance of good reviews for stuff I have purchased here. There is a reason for that, though. I research everything exhaustively before I spend money on it. Money is too darned hard to come by to throw any of it away if you can avoid it. I can honestly say that the research has paid off in spades with these hair products. The gloves seemed excessive until I got the towel free with a kit and saw that the microfiber, and these are a thick, lush form of it, really does make a difference in the gloss of the hair. Since this Curly Girl process requires gently \\&quot;scrunching\\&quot; the hair and never combing or brushing it, the gloves play a major role in keeping your curls frizz free and super shiny. So, my twenty bucks isn&#x27;t wasted at all. I use these even in between washings when I spritz or rewet to refresh my style.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and frizzy. I&#x27;ve tried every product out there, including this one, to try to tame the frizz, but none have worked. Maybe it&#x27;s a little better, but if so, it&#x27;s not enough to tell.  Plus, I live in humid Houston and we&#x27;ve actually been enjoying some cool, dry weather, so I can only imagine that things will just as normal when summer is here...even with the use of these gloves.</li>
    <li> delivery was on time and product was great  I use them often</li>
