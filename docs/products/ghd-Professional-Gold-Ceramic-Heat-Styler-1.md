      <li>I had a CHI Turbo before and thought it was good, but this blows it away.  </li>
      <li>those were good</li>
      <li>Because the majority of reviews on this product are good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good, but it&#x27;s 3, almost 4 times cheaper considering I bought the Chi for $65 and the GHD $230.</li>
      <li>It MUST be good.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this iron.  </li>

      <li>They also arrived quickly and in good order :)</li>
      <li>so I start at the bottom and work my way to the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that the replacement one is authentic.  </li>
      <li>For a better idea of my comparison, I&#x27;d say that the Chi is 60% better than the conair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this GHD and was crossing my finger that I was getting the real thing, and I am happy to say that it was a real GHD Flat Iron.  I made sure that my purchase was from Amazon directly and not a seller and that made the difference.  This works great and I am so amazed the price I paid for it was almost $100.00 less than Sephora wanted.  Make sure to use a guard on your hair even if it&#x27;s not GHD brand to protect it.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about buying a ghd from Amazon after reading all the reviews.  However I ordered it directly from Amazon and not a third party.  Even when I got the iron, I looked at it to make sure it met all the criteria people had listed.  It met all but one, it does not have  a hologram on the plug.  It is a circuit breaker plug, with the re-set buttons.  When I enter the serial number in the website, it told me I was a chosen one.  I guess this means it&#x27;s real.  I will call tomorrow and ask the ghd people if it&#x27;s legit, but if they accepted the serial number than it is real.  Let me know if anyone has registered a fake one. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this iron.  It does exactly what it should. I ordered it from Amazon (just be aware, it seems that there are lots of fake versions, look for a credible seller and once you receive it, check that it has all the stickers and the monogram of ghd).  It came with video instructions on a DVD which were really helpful!  I never knew I could do beautiful curls with this thing as well. I got it for strengthening of my hair and works perfect!  My hair is naturally wavy.  A week before I got the iron I had a haircut done (changed the style of my hair, not so much the length) - nobody at work noticed. Once I made my hair with this iron, even guys who usually don&#x27;t notice things like that were complementing my \\&quot;new\\&quot; haircut :) It looks very professional when I use the ghd iron.  Like I just walked off the hair stylist salon!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that you probably would want to know (and I didn&#x27;t) prior to buying this iron is that it doesn&#x27;t have an option to regulate the strength of the heat.  It only has one strength and it&#x27;s really hot!  But I&#x27;ve never burnt my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have that standing piece to secure the iron on the counter.  So you basically need to lay it down sideways, otherwise it will roll.  But it&#x27;s covered with some isolation so it won&#x27;t burn the surface of the counter.  I just was surprised that ghd didn&#x27;t design it to be able to stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, it&#x27;s worth the money and I really recommend it!  My hair stylist actually uses the same one.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I ordered a GHD from amazon itself.  I got the product today and registered it with no problem.  I called GHD but they could not confirm it&#x27;s authenticity.  They told me that there were fakes that were still being registered through their website, but amazon GHDs are not part of their 2 year warranty.  Well, I was not sure of it so I returned it.  There were a couple of things that were off in my opinion.  First of all, the product was not sealed. Red Flag.  Second, it did not come with a product manual, just 2 little one paged books.  Lastly, in the one of the books (was not the manual since I didn&#x27;t get it) it said manufactured in China, which I have read that GHDs are not manufactured in China.  I tried it on my hair and was not convinced it was the real GHD, although it looked like it.  So ultimately, I sent it back today and am considering my purchase from another website later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I forgot to add something: mine didn&#x27;t come with a Cd like they are supposed to either.</li>
    <li> I am really shocked at Amazon&#x27;s quality control on this one.  I am a LONG time amazon customer and will continue to be because I believe this to be an honest mistake on their part but boy did they get duped and in turn the customer is getting duped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that SOME customers have gotten authentic irons from Amazon but their latest batch is big time bogus.  There isn&#x27;t even a made up hologram code on the tag to even TRY to make it look legit; just a warning about getting it wet like you&#x27;d find on any old hair dryer or curling iron from wal-mart.  The box wasn&#x27;t sealed at all. (huge red flag)  It was in a janky, molding that split the moment you took it out of the box to try to get to the cord.  No DVD, no booklet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me repeat, I do not think this was intentional by Amazon, I think they were purchased by a buyer that was clueless about this item just as I would be about buying a leaf blower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just relieved that I bought it from somewhere reputable like Amazon that I could return it easily.  HOWEVER, you may have to call them to get them to email you a no charge return label....good luck!!</li>
    <li> I have only had the product for a month and have used it several times. This product had been recommended by a friend whose daughter is a beautician and rated it very high. Of course, it will take a little time for me to get the straightening routine down. I have very thick and curly hair so I start at the bottom and work my way to the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very thorough in checking the authenticness of this product and also successfully registered it. It pays to get this higher priced item compared to other low priced ones you find in beauty stores. It heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> Pros: the best straightening iron out in the market. Whether you have long or short hair, it takes like 5 minutes. You dont need to run thru you hair twice. Does not burn your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: Does not come with a warranty &#x3D;o(&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going to damage your hair twice as fast.</li>
    <li> This review is for the ghd MK4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely works, it will straighten your hair. It only has one setting and I would prefer more. It dried my hair out like another girl mentioned. I used it twice and my stylist said I had \\&quot;flat iron hair\\&quot;. I have very long silky hair so this was not a compliment.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using it and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. Maybe if you have short hair and don&#x27;t abuse it, this would work for you? If it&#x27;s going to dry and burn out your hair for that price...look somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;I had an iron I got at Sally beauty store and I preferred that one. My hair actually stayed silky! It also had different settings and it never dryed my hair out like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s way over priced.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used and I have owned many.  The chi is good, but the GHD is excellent.</li>
    <li> I got this for a steal of a price, considering Sephora&#x27;s discounted price is still over $200.  This iron is phenomenal, and the one that Amazon ships is authentic.  I registered it online with no issues.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I had several reservations about buying a ghd 1\\&quot; \\&quot;heat styler.\\&quot; I finally decided that I \\&quot;had to have it\\&quot; and bought it for myself for Christmas through S ephora, as they are an authorized seller. The price then decreased through Amazon and I snapped it up for a price almost 50% lower than what I paid at the authorized dealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews online and through Amazon that stated that Amazon sold counterfeit flat irons. I was able to compare the two, and they were the exact same product but at a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, naturally wavy (on one side, of course!) hair. I have used a HAI 1.77\\&quot; straight iron for over 5 years, so I was nervous about the 1\\&quot; size, but intrigued by the possibility of being able to use the straighter as a \\&quot;heat styler\\&quot; for curling or straightening (you can watch the videos on you tube!)It works great for both uses. My hair feels soft and healthier than before and I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple of weeks. I do not mind the 1\\&quot; size, it still works just as quickly as my larger flat iron and heats up in under one-minute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are ready to spend $150+ for a hair tool, this is the one that you should buy. Do not waste your money on one that will not last and damage your hair. This product is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t even in the market for a new flat iron, but I read a review somewhere, that talked about how this iron heats up in 20 seconds, and how the ceramic is better for your hair than the older models of flat irons.  Since I use a flat iron several times I week, I thought I would give this a try, and see if there was really a difference.  My old flat iron was a T3, so it was a high end flat iron from 6 or 7 years ago, but it was old technology and bulky and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ghd is amazing!  It doesn&#x27;t seem possible that it can heat up as fast as it does...15 - 20 seconds from the time you turn it on, until it is fully heated!  It is light-weight, easy to handle, and leaves my frizzy, wavy, fine hair, silky smooth for days.  It has caused no burning or damage to my hair, and leaves it super shiny.  It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 and a hlf years, it works great and I still use it regularly. I use it to do drop curls in my daughter&#x27;s hair or to straighten it. Expensive but worth the money</li>
    <li> This is the best iron ever, I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect iron and tried Conair, Remington, those were good but then my sister insisted I have to try this GHD, I should have done it before, this is truly a piece of technology, it leaves the hair amazingly shiny and soft, perfectly straight and the curved edges works great if you want soft and natural tips. I recommend this product 100%, don&#x27;t even hesitate.&lt;br /&gt;Be certain to buy this from amazon, and I mean Sold and Ship by Amazon.com, this is the only way to get an original product, I got mine in 2 days and got it registered in GHD page without issues.&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and buy this today, it works on any kind of hair and results are amazing, this is an investment on yourself no doubts!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s crazy that this is still a problem when it is so widely known.  Amazon - as always - is being very customer service oriented with regards to getting a replacement and making it easy to return the knock off.  I&#x27;m hoping that the replacement one is authentic.  It&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t QC each of these units before they go out, knowing that there are a large number of fakes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my teenage daughter for Christmas last year because I already had one and I loved it.  I actually bought two for both of my daughters.  One is working fine and has had no issues, but the other has continuously had a short in the connector from the power supply so it goes on and off and can&#x27;t be used.  When I received these in for Christmas, I did register both of them at that time.  There is a product warranty of two years on this product, but when I called the company today to see how to get another iron since it is under warranty, they told me that if it was bought from Amazon, the warranty is automatically voided.  They said they have no way to prove what is real and what isn&#x27;t so they don&#x27;t accept anything from Amazon since it isn&#x27;t an authorized dealer.  I really believe this is one of their authentic products, but they won&#x27;t touch it so I&#x27;m now out $150+ for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me reemphasize that the GHD irons are great products and we own three of them, but beware if you buy from Amazon because GHD will not authorize the warranty under any circumstances.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed in this product and the lack of support by the GHD company.  We bought this unit because it was advertised to have international capability (compatible with all major currents).  After arriving in a foreign country it immediately failed so I was without a heat-styler for the remaining two weeks.  Upon arriving home (months ago) I have tried to be reimbursed for the defective product with no success.  If you will be traveling to foreign countries I recommend you find a different product.</li>
    <li> Everytime I go to get my hair cut, my stylist uses this exact hair straightner on my hair.  It heats ups fast and works!  It is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen and I use a CHI.  If they were not so expensive; I would have one.</li>
    <li> Obviously, with all the knock off&#x27;s seemingly floating around the internet; I was a little nervous in ordering these. But having had such good experience in the past with Amazon, and getting great discount prices on other &#x27;genuine&#x27; articles... I thought I&#x27;ll give it a go and if they&#x27;re not what they seem to be, I&#x27;ll send them back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned GHD&#x27;s before when overseas so am aware of the difference that they make when styling your hair. Yes you&#x27;re hair comes out shiny, and polished looking.. but really it&#x27;s the ease in which it happens that impresses me. I&#x27;m no hair stylist, but my hair does look as pristine as it does when I leave the salon... and best, I can achieve the look in no time.&lt;br /&gt;I registered my set on GHD&#x27;s website easily... and have given my temporary &#x27;CVS&#x27; doo-dahs the heave-ho!</li>
    <li> Purchased GHD Professional Advanced Ceramic Heat Styler-1\\&quot;. Instead it received a Classic GHD ceramic heat styler. Then I was told by sender that classis is the new name for professional. I have already two professional GHD at home; the one  sent to me does not perform as the professionals I have at home. Actually worked like a $19.99 styler. I was told I could return it.  The sender, One Stop Beauty Source, received the styler as confirmed by tracking number, but they never gave me the refund. Worst and only bad experience I have ever had with Amazon.Com. Don&#x27;t recommend anyone  to buy from One Stop Beauty Source In Beverly Hills, CA.</li>
    <li> I used it one time during that it melted and the ceramic blade was separated from the strainer. ITS FAKE IT&#x27;S NOT THE ORIGINAL GHD DONT BUY IT FROM THIS SELLER</li>
    <li> I have ordered a great deal of products from Amazon for over 10 years, and I believe this is the first item I&#x27;ve had to return. As a previous reviewer found with hers, mine had no hologram on the tag so I could not register it with [...], and the plates were not aligned properly. I&#x27;ve sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Caution...this product is more than likely a FAKE.  I found out the hard way that the item I purchased here through Beauty 4 You was not genuine.  It no longer works, and of course when I went to GHD I learned this is a fake.  Amazon.com is NOT an authorized retailer for the product and others have said they have been burned even buying direct from Amazon (vs. Amazon sellers).  Do yourself a favor and go direct to GHD&#x27;s website to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and it is authentic.  I even registered it with [...] and it worked so that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s real.  Others that bought counterfeit ones probably bought them from amazon sellers and not amazon.com.  So don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this here.  You will save a chunk of money.  This hair iron is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried many.  Plates are so smooth that just one slide over and instantly your hair will be transformed into nice and smooth shinny straight hair.  YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.  YES, TOTALLY WORTH THE $$$.</li>
    <li> This could not be easier to use, cuts my hair straightening time to 1/4 of what it used to take me.  Very light and can take a dropping or two. . .</li>
    <li> Our unit broke after 2 years.  The manufacturer will not repair the unit... PERIOD, because we purchased it from Amazon and not an authorized retailer.&lt;br /&gt;The customer support department from GHD was completely uninterested and completely unhelpful.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought me this \\&quot;styler\\&quot; for Christmas when my CHI died.  I have noticed that my hair is getting more damage and split ends with this iron than with the CHI. I do use product prior to applying heat (the same product I used with the CHI) but it hasn&#x27;t seemed to help.  I am going to try the GHD product line and see if this helps resolve some of my issues.  Overall, its a good flat iron that gets the job done. Just wished that it was a little gentler on my locks!</li>
    <li> I bought an FHI iron to get the straight look at home- did not turn out straight. So I decided to find out which iron my Dominican stylist uses which always straightens my hair perfectly. It turned out to be GHD- and so I bought one- and it works great</li>
    <li> I was really worried about spending so much on an iron.  I mean come on, how could it be worth that kind of money?  But it IS.  It works great, gives me salon-pretty hair, and is easy to use.  I had a CHI Turbo before and thought it was good, but this blows it away.  My hair looks naturally beautiful rather than made up and the effect lasts for days.  I flat iron my hair once a week, either flat or curled, and it stays nice until I wash it.  LOVE IT.  If it broke I would not hesitate to buy another.</li>
    <li> I am sooo happy that treat myself with a good device for my hair. before, I had a lot of problem with my hair and after taking my flat Iron I got a lot of compliments. It takes me just 5 minutes to do my hair.</li>
    <li> Ok...so you&#x27;re probably thinking..&#x27;are these ppl nuts for paying that much for a heat styler??!&#x27;  If you are on the fence about this...GET IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only 2 settings, OFF and ON (which I personally like. I noticed that was a compliant from other individuals). Heats up sooo quickly, and straightens in 1 pass and stays frizz free and straight until I wash it and WHOA! Curls fabulously, with my curls lasting much longer than traditional heat rollers or curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have WAIST LENGTH hair (fine to medium) and I use this straighter! Typically to get a smooth look I would blow dry, and then straighten. However this styling tool allows me to skip the blow drying step if need be and I still get that polished look. I still use a heat protectant product (whether its hot rollers or my ghd...just for added protection) and then a shine serum once I am done with the ghd for an extra oomph!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will NOT be sorry. Even several of the high end salons and spa recommend ghd stylers, so why can&#x27;t you have the same tools they use??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: Make sure you purchase from Amazon (as the seller). I have noticed other friends of mine purchasing theirs from other sellers on Amazon after hearing my raves, and trust me when I say those were counterfeits! Amazon has the real thing (as I double checked with my cousin in London where ghd is all the rage, for comparison and also checked out the units at Bliss Spa in NYC).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will love this product!</li>
    <li> Review for the item - wife&#x27;s happy with her gift, so I&#x27;m happy :) I did a fair bit of research before buying this for her. Given the growing counterfeit GHD&#x27;s floating around online, I would absolutely recommend that you buy only if the item is sold and shipped by Amazon itself, even if their price is a little higher than other sellers or websites. At least you know you&#x27;re getting a genuine item. The first thing I did when I received the item was register it with GHD, checked out just fine. No complaints with this purchase.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000UZXWPU GHD Original Ceramic Styling Iron - 1]]&lt;br /&gt;Great product!  Makes my hair look shiny and perfectly straight.  Definitely worth the investment.  Other irons dried my hair out and damaged it.  This iron is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair &amp; had tried cheaper irons. My stylist uses this iron anytime I want straight locks &amp; the results are fantastic! My sister bought one before me &amp; absolutely raved about it as well. I did order from Amazon &amp; received an authentic ghd iron so hopefully the counterfeit issue mentioned by others has been resolved. It still takes me around 20-30 min to straighten, but my hair is very thick, I have lots of it &amp; I tend to be slow. It&#x27;s amazing how straight my hair gets after one pass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: heats up quickly, one pass straightening, long cord&lt;br /&gt;Cons: hefty price, but worth it</li>
    <li> Amazon offered the lowest price compared to Sephora, [..] and Folica. The shipping was fast and the customer service was awesome. Received the product day after I ordered it. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, including Babyliss which recently died. I found other flatiron styler to pulls my hair or fried it, ending up with lots of split ends. The GHD heats up quickly. One pass is all it takes to straightened my locks. I find the GHD easier to use than most. It feels very ergonomic in my hand. I have thick course hair. I was able to straightened my hair in 5 minutes instead of the usual 20 minutes. With 3 kids, time is priceless. Love it! I have no regrets. I recommend this product through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I actually bought the purple indulgence one, but it&#x27;s still a GHD and I thought I&#x27;d share my love for the GHD with you guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved my Chi more than anything...until the GHD. I thought it was the best and straighteners couldn&#x27;t get any better. I had decided to purchase this because I was moving and my sister loved my Chi. I was kind of skeptical about purchasing this straightener because of the price and the fact that the plates only touched each other at one end which I had initially thought was cause a lot of snagging. But after some intense debate I decided I would purchase this straightener anyway and I don&#x27;t regret it. This is truly the best straightener I have EVER used. It is highly technologically advanced. It has something in it..which I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called, but it makes the straightener distribute heat evenly which I believe works really well. My hair feels warm after straightening my hair, but less hot than what I have experienced with my Chi. It straightens better than my Chi, but not too much, maybe about 20% better. Enough to get me hooked. For a better idea of my comparison, I&#x27;d say that the Chi is 60% better than the conair. I do probably go over my hair less times than I do with my Chi. Apparently it also shuts off after 30 minutes of discontinued use. Although I don&#x27;t really use this feature since I never forget to turn off my straightener, it is definitely a reassuring feature. It also comes with a really cute pouch which is great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con I&#x27;d say is that it is built really lightweight. Most people prefer this, but I feel that if it was heavier it would less likely fall off the table. I&#x27;ve never personally dropped it on the floor, but since it&#x27;s so lightweight, I always feel like it would with a slight accidental tug of the cord. Oh and..the cost, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the spare cash and straighten your hair everyday, definitely invest in this. If you&#x27;re on a lower budget, I&#x27;dsay invest in a Chi. It&#x27;s not as good, but it&#x27;s 3, almost 4 times cheaper considering I bought the Chi for $65 and the GHD $230. But in my opinion if you&#x27;re going to straighten your hair everyday, paying more would be worth it. It&#x27;d probably save you some time straightening your hair that you could spend making more money ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;previous straighteners&lt;br /&gt;-conair&lt;br /&gt;-solia (don&#x27;t purchase this...worse than my conair and more damaging)&lt;br /&gt;-chi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m asian with asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE: When you read reviews, look at the ones that are more personal rather than a couple of words. A lot of the times, the site selling the product or whatever are faking those reviews to make them look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not referring to Amazon. Amazon has wonderful reviews :)&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE YOU AMAZON &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I must say, I&#x27;m really picky with hair tools. I have not curly, not straight frizzy kind of hair... and this iron worked wonderful in my hair... I bought it at amazon (not the market place) and its real (I registered it at [...]) ... its worth every penny...</li>
    <li> I was unsure if I wanted to spend that amount of money on a hair styler but I read the reviews and everyone was so pleased with it so I decided to give it a shot.  When I was comparing stylers, I especially wanted one that would not only straighten but curl as well.  I got my wish!  This thing is wonderful!  I would most definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quality styler/straightener.  Worth the investment!  If I should ever need to replace mine in the years to come I will only get a ghd!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this and I love it. It heats up very quickly (10 to 15 seconds) and works like a magic - for someone like me who is always in a hurry, it&#x27;s a perfect product. A bit pricey but worth the money.</li>
    <li> I first hesitated on buying an expensive straightener, but that totally worth it. Have been using it for more than a months now, works like a charm. Registered on [...] website - it was the authentic one!!! happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> So I have been wanting the ghd for some time and finally had some extra money so I went to sephora and splurged the $240 on it. Im actually kind of ashamed now to even admit I was willing to spend that much on a flat iron. But for that price I was expecting something pretty darn awesome,especially since alot of the reviews rave about it. I&#x27;ve had the CHI turbo for about 2 years and honestly I dont see any difference between the two except for the fact that it costs way more and has damaged my hair so bad already. In the 2 weeks Ive had it my hair has become even drier,damaged and is hard to even brush. This was even with using the ghd theraml protection on it everytime.Yes me CHI damages my hair (what flat iron doesnt) but the ghd did it at such an accelerated pace. I&#x27;ve had my ghd for about 2 weeks now and plan on returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still had to run the flat iron over my hair several times to get it straight...just as much as with my chi. And I dont have that thick of hair. Its the kind of hair thats not straight yet not curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe its just my hair? Because the majority of reviews on this product are good.</li>
    <li> I recently tried my sister&#x27;s GHD which she brought over from Australia and was impressed with how quickly it heated up and how easy it was to create different hairstyles. I was persuaded to get my own, especially when I saw what a great price it was on Amazon (cheaper than what my sister bought hers for in AU). It has worked very well so far, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. I&#x27;ll be traveling to Australia soon so I&#x27;ll be able to test the universal voltage, however I&#x27;m not anticipating any problems as my sister&#x27;s worked fine in both Australia and North America.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It worked without a hitch in AU :-)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my GHD - I have an earlier version with 1.5 inch plates and I decided to get a new 1 inch plate GHD. It is fantastic, heats really quickly, straightens my wild hair and is really easy to use, especially for someone like me who cant blowdry. Love it Love it Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon delivery was super. I ordered it to be delivered next day when I arrived in the US. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Amazon as always just gets it right.</li>
    <li> Best Flat Iron ever had. I have coarse  curly hair and it glides through easily. Heats up quickly and very smooth. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of irons, including chi, and this is the best by far that I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thick, frizzy, coarse, curly hair - and this leaves it soft, sleek, shiny and super straight. It&#x27;s light weight and easy to use. It does not have an adjustable temperature setting, but I&#x27;ve not found that to be a problem. It heats up quickly (w/ indicator/beep to tell when hot).I&#x27;ve not found it to be damaging, even with daily use (but my hair can take a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This works at 110-220 V- so it&#x27;s great for travel, which is why I originally bought it).</li>
    <li> Knowing GHD are the best in the hair straightener range, I purchased a pair for myself and was not disappointed with my decision! They also arrived quickly and in good order :)</li>
    <li> I havent been much into straighteners so I got the CHI at first..I needed something which curled well at the same time....Chi did all that but I ended up burning myself at times as the rim of the ceramic plates cud touch ur skin...Also I travel quie often and wanted to have something that wud be sueful everywehre...and so I returned the Chi and got this Super Expensive GHD...I cud actually cancel a star for that reason...but i think it does deserve 5 stars..its doesnt touch my skin...so no more burns...DUAL VOLTAGE...and its curls my hair better than anything else ...i am not sure if the new round barrel design helps...but it think it does help me hold it well...It comes with a DVD for different styles...something CHI doesnt do..&lt;br /&gt;Its Complete! ITs website does the rest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love It!</li>
    <li> I have used a variety of flat iron&#x27;s: Conair, Remington, Chi, &amp; Sedu are the four most recent.  Out of all of these the GHD is truly been the best for my thick, long, healthy, slightly wavy, middle eastern hair.  The GHD doesn&#x27;t snag my hair like my Chi did and it curls better than my Sedu did. [I say &#x27;did&#x27; because  those other irons died on me.]  My mother who had never used a flat iron to curl her own hair loved it instantly because it was so easy to use.  (She&#x27;s always been a hot rollers kind of girl.)  The roundness of the styler gives great curls and it&#x27;s near impossible to burn your hands while doing them!  The training video that came with it was very helpful not just on showing techniques but also showing what types of products are best to use with the different looks.&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus the automatic shut off safety feature is great for peace of mind. It&#x27;s truly a beautiful piece of machinary.  Expensive, but frankly I&#x27;m worth it and if you care enough about taking care of your hair [and fingers!] while you style with heat then so are you.</li>
    <li> I bought the ghd styler because my hairdresser recommended and uses it.  If you&#x27;re wondering if it is worth the price--IT IS!  My old curling iron died and since receiving the ghd styler, my life has changed--it is SO much easier to use and will do either straight or curly hair.  It is such a time saver because it heats up in seconds to the perfect temperature and even comes with a DVD, although that isn&#x27;t necessary.  I would not hesitate to use the Amazon.com service/provider--they got the order here in just a few days in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eying this straightener for a while now and so glad I finally spent the money on it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife, who is not the easiest person in the world to please, RAVES about this hair thing. It MUST be good.</li>
    <li> I did not think that ceramic staighteners could be so different, but my daughter told me this one was. She was right. There really is a difference!!! This one heats up fast, leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky, instead of dead. It really glides through my hair without pulling and tugging.I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The iron works fine. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had so far. I was very happy until I contacted GHD North America about a warranty inquiry and I was told my iron doesn&#x27;t qualify for the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized seller!!!!! so buyers, buy this iron elsewhere!&lt;br /&gt;I got so upset and contacted amazon by e-mail (I live in Europe) but they were unable to give me any explanation about the warranty thing and only gave me the possibility to return the iron, but I couldnt because I had already thrown away the box and as I said, the iron works fine so I decided to keep it but I just cannot believe Amazon is selling something without proper authorization from the manufacturer and is even sending buyers all warranty papers when their irons don&#x27;t qualify for this!</li>
    <li> My son uses this straightener and it works very well.  It doesn&#x27;t burn him or the counter.  It also doesn&#x27;t split the ends of his hair.  We had a much less expensive one before this one and I think it was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This ghd styler does a really good job of straightening my fine hair, and it stays straight until I shampoo, but it DOES create huge static in my hair. I bought it because it claimed &#x27;static-free&#x27;. I hate static.</li>
    <li> Over priced. I have very thick long hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem as dry but I haven&#x27;t been able to master the curling technique that us supposedly one of the unique functions of this particular flat iron. I bought it because it supposedly last longer than Chi..... Only time will tell.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used! I was skeptical at first and was hesitant to fork over the money, but it is worth it. It doesn&#x27;t snag or pull at my hair like some other irons I have used. There is no temperature control, but I think it works fine the way it is. It heats up and is ready to go in 10-15 seconds and stays hot no matter how thick my sections are. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how shiny my hair is since I&#x27;ve started using the ghd, and I haven&#x27;t changed what styling products I use. The long, flexible cord and swivel where it attaches to the iron makes it easy to use. If I don&#x27;t have time to go through my whole head in the morning, I just use it on the ends and it still makes a big difference. I&#x27;m definitely believing the hype now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my GHD.  My hair always flips out at the ends but the GHD straightens it very nicely. The best item i&#x27;ve used so far to do the job.  And the best part is I got a really good deal from Amazon.  I saw the same iron at Sephora for $240.  The reviews say to be careful for GHD fakes but my Amazon GHD is ligit... I was able to register it on their offical website.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> At first I loved the GHD flat iron.  It was comfortable to hold, heats in a flash, and did a great job of styling my hair.  However, after about three months of using it I started noticing my hair breaking.  I had some minor breakage while combing and blow drying, but as soon as I use the GHD IV flat iron my hair snaps off all over the place.  No amount of anti-snap or thermal heat protectors has improved the situation.  My sink is full of snapped off hair, and I have very fine thin hair, so this has caused a huge concern.  I&#x27;m not kidding I think I have only half my hair left.  When my stylist uses his flat iron my hair does not do that.  The conclusion I&#x27;m coming to is that the lack of heat control is a big problem.  I&#x27;m buying another flat iron but one that has temperature control.</li>
    <li> I love this hair iron! I purchased it based on my friend&#x27;s suggestions and Amazon reveiws. The CD detialing how do style your hair in other ways besides for straightening, is a little difficult to follow, but straightneing is a breeze and your hair comes out very smooth. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Having used this GHD flatiron since July 2008, I do NOT like it at all, should have stuck with my Chi after all! Does not heat like it should, but I&#x27;m sure they will never give me a refund or a new flat iron!</li>
    <li> If you are on the fence about buying this styler, DO IT!!!  It is so easy to use and creates the most perfect curls that literally last all day.  Usually my curls fall out after a few hours.  I used it this morning on my hair and my curls look just as good as they did when I did my hair!  It also actually saves time from using a traditional curling iron because you don&#x27;t have to sit there holding it on the hair for the curl to set.  All you do it clamp it on you hair near the roots, turn it 90 degrees and slide it to the end of your hair and you will have a perfect ringlet curl every time.  It also curls all the way to the ends of the hair, so you don&#x27;t get a frizzy, non-curled piece at the end.  I would recommend watching the video (they also have it on their website) for instructions, but once you see it, you will see how easy it is to use.  Also, it is so fast heating up, only 15 seconds!  It beeps when it&#x27;s ready so you know when it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is well worth the money. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use my curling iron again!</li>
    <li> I found out after I received this GHD Ceramic Heat styler that it is counterfeit. I called GHD, and they told me what to look for in order to tell whether it was a counterfeit. This one is definitely counterfeit since the plug is a simple two-prong one. The genuine GHD has a reset/test switch on the plug that looks like the one that is on a hairdryer. They also told me that there should be no hologram on the label on the cord. This one did have a hologram on the cord label.I needed it for a trip, so I was very disappointed. The GHD Ceramic heat styler that I bought was shipped from Amazon, but was sold by EBeautyElectronics.</li>
    <li> The GHD straighteners are an amazing product!  It heats up in less than 30 seconds, and even if you don&#x27;t have the time or the skill, it can still do wonders to your hair just casually pulled through one or two pieces at the front of your face.  Curls are a challenge but look supurb.  So far not too impressed with the GHD &#x27;thermal protector&#x27; product - seems to make the hair feel thick and causes it to knot up easily.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron...however, it was stated that it was an &#x27;advanced professional&#x27; iron and it&#x27;s GHD&#x27;s classic iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very thick and wavy.  The drugstore straighteners just weren&#x27;t doing it.  The ghd works great - her hair is smooth and very straight and isn&#x27;t being damaged by those cheap straighteners!</li>
    <li> I received my GHD just recently in the mail and right away plugged it in and used it! OMG! was it great or what?? I have thick, curly hair. The GHD heats up super fast and straightened my hair so well I couldn&#x27;t believe it! It makes my hair smooth, soft, and silky! I have spent more money on another straightener before but the GHD blows it out the water! I have never seen or used a hair straightener that worked so well on my thick, curly hair. I have even got complements on my hair after I styled it. Yea it is a little expensive, but well worth the money!!! I highly suggest that whoever is reviewing or reading this to most def buy it! My mother bought it for me for my 21st bday! It was the best bday gift EVER! You can do so many more things to your hair with the GHD than just straightening it! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> After spending sixty dollars every two weeks at the hairdressers, I welcomed this product with open arms, and open wallet! The price is definetly worth it. I have typical African American chemically treated hair, so heat can be very damaging. But this hair styler is perfect. My hair is shiny, healthy and smooth after use. I have noticed alot less breakage and less frizziness when exposed to humidity. My niece, who has no relaxer, recently asked me to do her hair for school. I thought it would be impossible to make it look professionally done but her hair turned out smooth and flowing without any damage. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> After a week of nail-biting anticipation, my ghd IV styler arrived ahead of schedule today to my complete delight. I tore it out of the box only to be deflated when I realized that it was a 2 prong outlet with no hologram on either the inside of the unit or on the power cord. After all the time I spent researching online and thinking that Amazon.com was an approved retailer, I was duped and wanted to throttle Amazon for selling counterfeits. I did NOT buy through the marketplace, but from Amazon directly, since I thought it would surely be selling the real thing. WRONG! I called up the ghd North America hotline and spoke with a representative, who confirmed that mine was a fake and Amazon.com is not authorized in the US. I had seen Amazon on an approved list of stockists on the ghd UK website, which it is....in the UK only(amazon.co.uk). Some reviewers have reported that theirs have been successfully registered by ghd, which is why I think that both real and fake stylers are mixed together in the shipments. Too bad that mine turned out to be one of the fake ones. As a product (however counterfeit it is), I would still rate the iron as a 4 or 5--it does straighten as well as others have reported. Because it is NOT the product I expected to receive and there is no warranty because I can&#x27;t register it, I give this review an overall 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Buy at your own risk--if you want to take a chance of getting a real one shipped to you, that&#x27;s your call. Personally, if you don&#x27;t care whether or not you have a real ghd or not, you can find a cheaper one ($70-80) on other sites---no use paying double for something that&#x27;s just as fake! I&#x27;m returning mine and buying a cheaper iron (not ghd) elsewhere. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> What a great piece of equipment! It heats up in about 20 seconds, doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, and is extremely versatile. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a good flat iron, look no further. this one gives a nice quick result and heats up really fast and therefor is big on saving time. i don&#x27;t like to spend big bucks on hair tools but anything under $100 isn&#x27;t going to take you far.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi for about 5 years and then gave it to my friend after the plates started getting chipped and you could see the metal underneath. I guess GHD is all ceramic so you don&#x27;t have to worry about that. It takes less time for me to do my hair... about 5-10 minutes, whereas before it used to take hours. Never thought too much about it, but GHD is really better on my hair. I don&#x27;t smell burning hair anymore and it&#x27;s not breaking off at the ends like it used to. Glad I have a GHD, but I didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon. I think I spent about $250 (not sure about that--it was a few years ago) and bought it in a store that sells to licensed hair stylists. My friend has a license. Heats up in about 10 seconds, no joke. It&#x27;s a great product. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Worth the price,as it is a great quality flat/curling iron. My hair is wavy and this iron makes it stick straight or with bouncy waves, depending on how you use it. GHD is a very good brand. This version can be used abroad and has a 1 hour auto shut  off.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this; I could never understand why my hair never came out as great when I did it with my Sally&#x27;s model.  So I bought the GHD - worth absolutely every penny.  I have very wavy, somewhat frizzy hair - not any more!  It&#x27;s smooth as glass, looks healthy and shiney, and the tool is very easy to use.  The lack of temp control doesn&#x27;t matter at all.  Further, the dual voltage will come in handy when we leave the country in the fall.  My biggest complaint is that I didn&#x27;t really understand the difference between a cheap flat iron and an expensive one!</li>
    <li> Instantly straightens hair.  Heats up in a sec!!  But it does get very hot!  So sometimes I would just unplug it and use it when it gets too hot.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a gift because I&#x27;d heard her and her friends raving about GHDs for ages.  It took me a while to summon the fortitude to pay such a crazy amount of money for something that doesn&#x27;t look much different to other models selling for 90% less.  However, once I gave it to her it was clear that she loved it (and still does).  It gets more use than I ever imagined (although guys, the effect is that it can add another 30 minutes to her getting ready to go out so be prepared for that), I got huge kudos for the idea and it does actually produce some very nice looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how it compares to other models or versions but I can tell you that it gets rave reviews from my wife and is one of her prized possessions.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these , 1 from Coles Salon and 1 from Amazon.  The both broke about 2 years after I bought them .I tried to get them replaced/fixed through the sellers without luck so am out over $400.&lt;br /&gt;There is allegedly a 2 year warranty.  The one I bought from Amazon broke less than 2 years after I bought it but GHD won&#x27;t honor the warranty because they don&#x27;t consider Amazon an authorized seller. They told me to contact Amazon. I did and Amazon only warranties them for 30 days.  The one I bought from Coles cost more but broke just after the 2 years were up so I was out of luck there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work well, but for $200 I&#x27;d expect them to last longer or at least be replaced or fixed if they don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have one for me, my daughter and now my niece, we all love it. We all have curly hair and this straightener is the best on the market, I have been using straighteners since i was 16 an this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer is great, fast and never had a problem.</li>
    <li> I found out that the one I order was a counterfeit item. I strongly recommend you purchase the product either on GHD website or certified dealer who are licensed to sell GHD products. Given the high price, you just don&#x27;t to chance it being a fake!</li>
    <li> worked great for about 8 months; started having issues getting it to heat up in the 9th month and at 10 months it completely stoped working - made multiple attempts to contact the company with no success.</li>
    <li> Ordered GHD professional 1&amp;#34; styler but received the classic version witch is cheaper than what they were advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wrongly advertised.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have owned a GHD Professional Styler before. I had it for 3 years before it blew when I went abroad. So I ordered this thinking it would be the same thing. I get it in the mail today only to discover I was shipped the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; instead. Then I noticed it was 2 prong instead of 3 like my other one. So it&#x27;s obviously a fake. Don&#x27;t fall for this. Apparently Amazon isn&#x27;t a legitimate or approved retailer of ghd.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron at the recommendation of my hair dresser and I am so glad I did.  Aside from the ease of use, and how quick it heats up, I love all the compliments I am receiving.  Although it was pricy, it is so worth it.  I have yet to try the curl capability, but I am enjoying the silkiness of the straightening for now.</li>
    <li> I bought a ghd iron about 3 years ago and paid over $200 for it. It recently broke (from me dropping it) and I had to have another one. This has been by far my favorite flat/curling iron! I purchased my new one thru Amazon despite some negative reviews about them being knock-offs. It&#x27;s perfect! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightener that heats up really fast and makes hair smooth and straight without damaging it!</li>
    <li> I have tried many flat irons and spent varying amounts but I must say that my GHD is still my styling tool of choice.  I have had it for a few years an d it&#x27;s still going strong and styles my hair as good as my stylist.  I recently bought a babyliss titanium ultra thin flat iron because my stylist had it but I didn&#x27;t like the results i got at home and I did not feel that it styled as well as my GHD.  When this goes out I will replace with another of the same Ghd brand. I gave the babyliss away.</li>
    <li> I think it is good, however its cable is faulty. I have to adjust the cable into a specific side for it to work. the power keep disconnecting.</li>
