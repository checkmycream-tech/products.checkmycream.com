### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best product ever!</li>
      <li>so I was very happy when it arrived</li>
      <li>After a body wave it is marvelous to control your hair and keep it shiny.</li>
      <li>the amazon price is the best i have found</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this for styling and flyaway strands!!!</li>
      <li>this product is the best if your hair is sorta of kinky makes very good curls.</li>
      <li>Loved this product because it does not leave hair greasy or sticky!  </li>
      <li>As always a great product</li>
      <li>Great service and price.</li>
      <li>The jar lasts forever and it works great on my hair.</li>
      <li>I tried this molding mud after reading reviews that it&#x27;s great for pixie haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I have to use a bunch to get it to hold, but it is generally a great product</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS LIKE A SALON STUDIO PRODUCT...GIVES GREAT BODY AND DOES NOT LEAVE HAIR TACKY...</li>
      <li>This works great for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great that they&#x27;re still making this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>great product for locking hair</li>
      <li>After trying more products than I can even think of I found this one while searching the web for the best products for a pixie cut.</li>
      <li>It has a sublte pleasant smell, nothing flowery or fruity.  </li>
      <li>I looked forward to receiving this product, but when it arrived, someone already had stuck their fingers in the mud and had taken a good size chunk out of it.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go for the day.</li>
      <li>Good seller.</li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I love it and would recommend it for all hair textures!</li>
      <li>Best non-greasy hair product for natural curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It is by far the best molding product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I have medium textured, longish hair now, and I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years and have tried many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i LOVE this for my hair...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s happened so many times that I haven&#x27;t been able to find a jar that doesn&#x27;t get the clumps.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;For a stronger &#x27;non-wax&#x27; product (something that feels more waxy and super-strong, but not as oily as others), try Sebastian Craft Clay.</li>
      <li>It sure doesn&#x27;t act like Sebastian products.  </li>
      <li>You add more, and it begins to add volume and a bit of wave to your hair.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product and the consistency it leaves my hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>gave me a huge amount of texture and body.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant fragrance which is barely noticeable and</li>
      <li>Apparently discontinued - can anyone recommend a good alternative?</li>
      <li>You can clean it out eventually; it just takes a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;Aside</li>
      <li>Seemed kind of old but was out !</li>
      <li>it is kind of like crew pomade, which I like much better as it gives the hair a little more shine.</li>
      <li>Only giving 4 stars because I can&#x27;t replace my beloved Alterna hemp putty that was discontinued.</li>
      <li>Really nice and natural.</li>
      <li>just a quick product review....</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s far better than its competition.</li>
      <li>When I buy a fresh one from the beauty supply store it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This package was similar to the original produc, it even had a removeable safety seal inside the top, product was fresh.</li>
      <li>Try KLM products or if you&#x27;re in New England, &amp;#34;Mud&amp;#34; from Fantastic Sam&#x27;s hair salons.</li>
      <li>from that the product is still good, it&#x27;s just a big issue that needs to be fixed.</li>
      <li>This used to be my favorite product, but the last two I purchased were inferior.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>and I tried it for the first time</li>
      <li>I love it because it works so well with my short spikey look.  </li>
      <li>Been using solely this stuff for about 2 years now, if you want a more solid hold try the &amp;#34;Matte Putty&amp;#34; from sebastian, its similar to this, but provides much more hold.</li>
      <li>Takes out the frizz in seconds and does not leave hair dry or filled with lots of product!  </li>
      <li>It came much faster than the projected shipment time.</li>
      <li>I really like the consistence and definition</li>
      <li>i REALLY LIKE IT...</li>
      <li>i really appreciate it.</li>
      <li>You do not have to use much of it to spike your hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take too much product, but just work it through</li>
      <li>As a guy with curly hair this product really helps get those molded curls instead of just being a frizzball.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keeps hair in place nicely without leaving heavy residue feel.</li>
      <li>It is more fibrous and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; in the same fashion as the old formula.  </li>
      <li>The mud smells and looks exactly like the old formula</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and find this particular mud product to be too a bit too heavy for my taste in looks &amp; feel.</li>
      <li>Sebastian Molding Mud is a great product especially for hard to lock</li>
      <li>I am on day 2 of the new product and am not liking it as much.  </li>
      <li>In the container, it sits sort of solid and moist, but breaks down so easily and becomes a bit sticky, with cool &#x27;micro-strands&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I have used this product in the past and love it...</li>
      <li>I also have my hair bleached to a pure platinum blonde to the scalp every 10-12 weeks</li>
      <li>Love the control it gives to my styling but the product has always had little gritty pieces that end up in your hair.</li>
      <li>the product dries soft not stiff and works well with a hair dryer as well...also not an over powering fragrance ....</li>
      <li>I thought it was maybe just because it was old</li>
      <li>Style will last all day and night and any adjustments you need to make to your hair can be done as the product is so pliable and shapeable there really isn&#x27;t anything like it that I have found to date</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find the old stuff anywhere.  </li>
      <li>Conclusion, old mud.</li>
      <li>Product was old and out dated or expired.  </li>
      <li>It seems to disappear into the hair, enhancing its natural characteristics.</li>
      <li>I received Appeared old, the Mudd was like SAND grainy and soupy as if it was spoiled.</li>
      <li>It leaves you with a completely held yet natural hold which sees opposing</li>
      <li>dab really will do you as I am still working off of the same original 2.6 ounce container purchased from Amazon this past January and will reorder in May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what expected.</li>
      <li>This is a great base product to use when going for elaborately large goth hair styles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is no other product like molding mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thee product was not properly milled to be smooth or the supplier had changed something in the product, so now there are little white bits of something that doesn&#x27;t dissolve in your hand.</li>
      <li>Apparently, Sebastian Molding Mud has re-vamped it&#x27;s formula and packaging since my last container.  </li>
      <li>Weak hold and moderate shine, which is okay if your hair is somewhat long.</li>
      <li>soft and allows my thick hair to do exactly what i want...</li>
      <li>Although the former version was a little too heavy, this is way too light and airy, seems just to sit on the hair vs. enrich and moisturize it.</li>

<li> You can see the box was crushed on one side and the container was greasy outside.  </li>
<li> I have used several similar products, but this one is a total waste of $$.</li>
<li> I think it would be an expensive product for long hair, as the price has always been expensive for such a small amount( to me, a guy),but for me it is perfect.</li>
<li> This mud doesn&#x27;t dry my hair at all in fact it softens and conditions it</li>
<li> but this was a big turn down.</li>
<li> Blow dry using either your fingers or a wide toothed brush and then finger style the rest; blast it with a shot of my hairspray and your done.</li>
<li> and then you spend the next five minutes trying to get these little white pieces out of your hair and they never break down over time.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective product, but mine came with a lot of white little balls that when the product dries, makes it look like you have dandruff.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product.  The jar lasts forever and it works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product has changed from times I previously purchased it.  It has less substance.  Although the former version was a little too heavy, this is way too light and airy, seems just to sit on the hair vs. enrich and moisturize it.</li>
    <li> As always a great product</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and love it... the product dries soft not stiff and works well with a hair dryer as well...also not an over powering fragrance ....the amazon price is the best i have found</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. The packaging changed, unfortunately so did the produce. The Containers of HAIR MUD I received Appeared old, the Mudd was like SAND grainy and soupy as if it was spoiled. Wasted a lot of money. This package was similar to the original produc, it even had a removeable safety seal inside the top, product was fresh. Now I hear Sebastian has discontinued the MOLDING HAIR MUDD.</li>
    <li> I tried this molding mud after reading reviews that it&#x27;s great for pixie haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;I beg to disagree. Either I got a lousy batch, or this stuff really is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Once you work it through your hands, you get a bunch of hard little balls, that leave clumps of visible product in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Never again.</li>
    <li> This product is just o k it is kind of like crew pomade, which I like much better as it gives the hair a little more shine.</li>
    <li> I ended up using this twice and getting so frustrated, I tossed it!  It sure doesn&#x27;t act like Sebastian products.  It doesn&#x27;t hold the hair and if you have a spiked haircut like I had just gotten, this product will NOT help you out!</li>
    <li> Loved this product because it does not leave hair greasy or sticky!  You do not have to use much of it to spike your hair.  I love it because it works so well with my short spikey look.  I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a spikey look or lift/separation style.</li>
    <li> just a quick product review....i LOVE this for my hair...&lt;br /&gt;have been using it for over 10 years....&lt;br /&gt;very soft and allows my thick hair to do exactly what i want...:)&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Stay way.  This product is no form to be considered a molding mud.  You might as well put axle grease in your hair; since, that is what this product closely resembles.  Leaves hair greasy, does not give it the molding mud volume.  And, just horrible for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and have tried many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no other product like molding mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get hard (that&#x27;s what she said) , not sticky, and it washes out fast.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews complaining about the small white particles that get in your hair from the molding mud, but until I tried it I didn&#x27;t realize how bad it is. The mud smells and looks exactly like the old formula so I was very happy when it arrived and I tried it for the first time, However, The white gets All over your hair and looks like the worst case of dandruff ever! You can clean it out eventually; it just takes a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that the product is still good, it&#x27;s just a big issue that needs to be fixed.</li>
    <li> It feels and acts a little bit like sugar paste.  Not particularly great for at least the two hair types in our house.  Try KLM products or if you&#x27;re in New England, &amp;#34;Mud&amp;#34; from Fantastic Sam&#x27;s hair salons.</li>
    <li> OMG I think I&#x27;ve been using Sebastian Molding Mud for over 20 years now! There definitely is nothing like it. It is actually something between &#x27;honey&#x27; and &#x27;mud&#x27;. In the container, it sits sort of solid and moist, but breaks down so easily and becomes a bit sticky, with cool &#x27;micro-strands&#x27;. You put a little in your hair, and it just keeps moisture, but not too wet. You add more, and it begins to add volume and a bit of wave to your hair. Really nice and natural. It never cracks or feels heavy. It seems to disappear into the hair, enhancing its natural characteristics. It&#x27;s great that they&#x27;re still making this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a stronger &#x27;non-wax&#x27; product (something that feels more waxy and super-strong, but not as oily as others), try Sebastian Craft Clay.</li>
    <li> This is a worthless product. Does not do what I was told. I have used several similar products, but this one is a total waste of $$.</li>
    <li> Love the control it gives to my styling but the product has always had little gritty pieces that end up in your hair. Too bad because I would give it five stars if these were gone.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and find this particular mud product to be too a bit too heavy for my taste in looks &amp; feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it works wonders for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Every batch of the this mud has had little mud pellites. When I buy a fresh one from the beauty supply store it doesn&#x27;t. Conclusion, old mud.</li>
    <li> Works well and performs as it&#x27;s supposed to. I just use a dime size portion and sculpt throughout hair. Keeps hair in place nicely without leaving heavy residue feel.</li>
    <li> Product was old and out dated or expired.  It works but leaves visible &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; of product in your hair. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this for styling and flyaway strands!!!</li>
    <li> Best non-greasy hair product for natural curly hair.  Takes out the frizz in seconds and does not leave hair dry or filled with lots of product!  Been using Sebastian&#x27;s Molding Mud for over 35 yrs!</li>
    <li> Weak hold and moderate shine, which is okay if your hair is somewhat long. But I just don&#x27;t understand why they put these little pieces in the molding mud that look like dandruff. You put this stuff in your hair and then you spend the next five minutes trying to get these little white pieces out of your hair and they never break down over time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what expected. Thanks! Best product ever!</li>
    <li> As a guy with curly hair this product really helps get those molded curls instead of just being a frizzball.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take too much product, but just work it through and you&#x27;re good to go for the day. Been using solely this stuff for about 2 years now, if you want a more solid hold try the &amp;#34;Matte Putty&amp;#34; from sebastian, its similar to this, but provides much more hold. This stuff doesn&#x27;t hold your hair, it just gives it texture.</li>
    <li> Sebastian Molding Mud is a great product especially for hard to lock hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has a tight curl pattern and is very soft, I could not get the look I wanted to achieve until I started using this product.  I love it and would recommend it for all hair textures!</li>
    <li> Apparently discontinued - can anyone recommend a good alternative?</li>
    <li> I looked forward to receiving this product, but when it arrived, someone already had stuck their fingers in the mud and had taken a good size chunk out of it.  I am very disappointed that this was even sent out like it was.  You can see the box was crushed on one side and the container was greasy outside.  When I saw this I knew that the product was used.  I guessed correctly.  I took photos of this mess.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff back when I had short short hair (9 years ago), and I recently went back to it again after trying mousses, sprays, etc.  I have medium textured, longish hair now, and I love this cream.  It controls frizz and gives me just the right grip and texture for styling or leaving my hair loose without it getting all crazy on me.  It has a sublte pleasant smell, nothing flowery or fruity.  I definitely recommend it for similar hair types.</li>
    <li> Two dime-sized amounts worked through my waist-length hair gave me a huge amount of texture and body. This is a great base product to use when going for elaborately large goth hair styles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. My hair is short and typically dry. I use very little of this to moisten my hair enough to style it. I love the smell of this product and the consistency it leaves my hair. I think it would be an expensive product for long hair, as the price has always been expensive for such a small amount( to me, a guy),but for me it is perfect. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> After trying more products than I can even think of I found this one while searching the web for the best products for a pixie cut. I also have my hair bleached to a pure platinum blonde to the scalp every 10-12 weeks so it takes a beating and breaks off easily following each color. This mud doesn&#x27;t dry my hair at all in fact it softens and conditions it instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian&#x27;s Molding Mud is still to date the only styling product that shapes, holds and gives my hair definition and seperation without weighing it down terribly or making it stiff at it. It leaves you with a completely held yet natural hold which sees opposing but it just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dab really will do you as I am still working off of the same original 2.6 ounce container purchased from Amazon this past January and will reorder in May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant fragrance which is barely noticeable and what I do is add an amount the size of a green pea to the palm of my hands rub them together to melt the mud and work it into my entire head of hair. Blow dry using either your fingers or a wide toothed brush and then finger style the rest; blast it with a shot of my hairspray and your done. Style will last all day and night and any adjustments you need to make to your hair can be done as the product is so pliable and shapeable there really isn&#x27;t anything like it that I have found to date and I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
    <li> this product is the best if your hair is sorta of kinky makes very good curls. thank you i really appreciate it.</li>
    <li> It is by far the best molding product I have ever used. It actually has fiber in it. Not oily at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective product, but mine came with a lot of white little balls that when the product dries, makes it look like you have dandruff. I really like the consistence and definition but this was a big turn down.</li>
    <li> I have rather thick hair so I have to use a bunch to get it to hold, but it is generally a great product and it&#x27;s far better than its competition. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Seemed kind of old but was out !So using it!!!</li>
    <li> Its a fake product, smells like an industrial chemical and the consistency is completely different to the real product. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for years but the last few times I&#x27;ve gotten it, it has little lumps/hard balls that stay clumped on my hair after I use it. I thought it was maybe just because it was old but it&#x27;s happened so many times that I haven&#x27;t been able to find a jar that doesn&#x27;t get the clumps.  Is that just the way it is made now?  I can&#x27;t find any other product that gives me the same results but it is embarrassing to have these little clumps of product in my hair.</li>
    <li> Apparently, Sebastian Molding Mud has re-vamped it&#x27;s formula and packaging since my last container.  I am on day 2 of the new product and am not liking it as much.  It is more fibrous and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; in the same fashion as the old formula.  I can&#x27;t find the old stuff anywhere.  Kinda bummed.  I will continue to give this a chance, since I have it.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite product, but the last two I purchased were inferior. Thee product was not properly milled to be smooth or the supplier had changed something in the product, so now there are little white bits of something that doesn&#x27;t dissolve in your hand. Then it looks like dandruff in your hair. It can be scraped off your hands dot by dot, but that&#x27;s a pain.</li>
    <li> Great service and price.</li>
    <li> After a body wave it is marvelous to control your hair and keep it shiny.</li>
    <li> I think they changed the formula,but I still like it.</li>
    <li> great product for locking hair</li>
    <li> Only giving 4 stars because I can&#x27;t replace my beloved Alterna hemp putty that was discontinued. This works great for me. It came much faster than the projected shipment time. Good seller.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS LIKE A SALON STUDIO PRODUCT...GIVES GREAT BODY AND DOES NOT LEAVE HAIR TACKY...i REALLY LIKE IT...hAD LOOKED ALL OVER TIL i FOUND IT ON aMAZON.....</li>
