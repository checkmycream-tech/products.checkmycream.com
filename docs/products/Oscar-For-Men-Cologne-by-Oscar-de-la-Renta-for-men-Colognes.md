    <li> I purchased this product for the first time and I like it. I like the smell of the cologne and it&#x27;s hard to explain. Sometimes it reminds of baby powder but with a touch of something else. My wife likes it too. Bottom line I like and will buy again.</li>

    <li> I love how this smells on my husband!</li>

    <li> WOW!!!..This stuff is great I happened to read a review on Calvin and the person mention Oscar described the scent and I though I would try it..I&#x27;m glad I listened to that review as they said this was just as good as Calvin at a better price. that I do not agree with I love Calvin&lt;br /&gt;R. Williams&lt;br /&gt;Bergenfield NJ</li>
    <li> This spray has a smoothe and relaxing smell and isn&#x27;t too strong and is long lasting.  I would recommend this product to anyone smell good but not overberring.</li>
    <li> It is hard to get this in my country, but now that I have it im really satisfied, I got one of theese as a gift and I liked it. The only fragrance I liked that much is Fahrenheit by CD.  I really love this fragrance. it lasts a whole day, I received it today and I applied it once in my wrist and it still smells as fresh as the first hour. (about 8 hours ago, having my hands washed like for 3 times)</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my fiancé. He loves the scent. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Scent is good, but not as I remember when I was younger. I believe that I have changed some tastes from when I was a teenager, so now is different for me, I wanted to remember but now the smell is too strong and sometimes getting a bit like cinnamon smell. Is a great product, but not as a I remember.</li>
    <li> Good smell, good size, but the smell does not last long. For the rest it is an excellent option, arrived very fast</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s new favorite cologne. It is soft and subtle yet not weak, it lasts a long time. I enjoy when he wears it and breath deeply to savor the fragrance. Mmmmm. . .</li>
    <li> Great cologne; bought it for my dad and likes it.</li>
    <li> This perfume had already used above, I had searched with no luck ... now I found it on Amazon at a great price, the box is simple but what is important is the product itself. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, a mixture of green, woody notes, citrus, pepper put together in a fantastic way.The guy or girl who blended this is a genius...And the longevity +8 hours. My new favorite fragrance!</li>
