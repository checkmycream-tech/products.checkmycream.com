<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product has a lot of benefits which to me is a great deal. I searched the web and couldn&#x27;t find a better deal for this price. It also eases, reliefs the pain of arthritis, joint pain and stiffness and fibromyalgia pain. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. I also bought a bottle for family and friends who suffer with these aliments and they find it very helpful in relieving, easing the pain also. I will be buying more!!!</li>
    <li> Better priced than others offered on Amazon. Helps keep skin and hair moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love this emu oil. It&#x27;s high quality and is slightly less viscous than the Naturals New Zealand brand pure emu oil. Better value and both are excellent products.</li>
    <li> This is one of my best purchases this year.  I have used it now for about 2 months and I do see a difference in my skin texture and even dark circles over my eyes.  You only use a drop or two each day and with the size of this bottle, it will last for months.  Also the pump is perfect for getting just one drop at a time.  Would highly recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> FALSE ADVERTISING!  Wrong if you think you are getting 100% Emu oil.  You are getting 100% Pure oil.  Pure is the brand name not a description of the item you are getting.  DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM if you want Emu oil.</li>
    <li> This emu oil is the only thing that worked for my aunt&#x27;s severly damaged skin after her chemo and radiation treatments.</li>
    <li> love it,  one product for all  my needs</li>
    <li> Still waiting on the effect.</li>
    <li> Got this per my Dr. and my husband uses it on his balk head.</li>
    <li> This oil was recommended for aging skin and it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited to report that this stuff is really a miracle. Though I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 days now I notice my skin looks healthier tanner and I got that glow back that I haven&#x27;t had in such a long time! My skin was dry and pale and to make it even worse I have mild rosacea along with it too where you can see small visible broken capillaries on my face if you look up close that looks like acne from a distance. So I ordered this along with Lysine because I heard mixing Lysine and Vitamin C together can be a great combo for skin sufferers of all types. Though I just started taking the Lysine today, this product just adds to how great my skin already looks now! Thank you please don&#x27;t stop selling this.</li>
    <li> without getting in to detail, this bottle was perfect because I could use it with one hand. unlike the small bottle that has an eyedropper lid. I also feel that this oil is smoother, less viscous or clumpy than the other brand I had. this one, though, I tend to get a scent of rancid oil occassionally, but since my surgery was on my nose and my olfactory senses are off, that may just be my faulty sniffer.</li>
    <li> Emu oil is one of the few oils that can be put on open sores.  I had 2nd degree burns and applied Emu Oil on the burns as soon as I discovered them.  No scars and no problems</li>
    <li> I highly recommend EMU Oil as a moisturizer to everyone. This also lasts a very long time so it&#x27;s cost effective.</li>
    <li> Seems to works, relieving wrist pain.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The price was great and product was better than other products  (same) I have been purchasing. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Emu oil in my Birchbox and loved it.  Went to order the sample brand and it was $ 80.00 !!!  Found this on Amazon and it works just the same and a lot less money.  I use in the AM and PM on clean skin and it absorbs beautifully.  Using all of the same makeup products I used before.  No more dry skin!!!  My skin looks and feels wonderful.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Lists itself as PURE emu oil, but it isn&#x27;t.  it&#x27;s watery, fast running dribbly DILUTED emu oil.. and I feel effing ripped off.  Having used this s*** and thrown away the packaging, I&#x27;ll keep it and mix it with something else and set it out for houseguests with the warning that it&#x27;s got something from emus in it, in case they think they&#x27;re allergic, but if they&#x27;re looking for pure emu oil, it isn&#x27;t.    DON&#x27;T BUY THIS STUFF.    IT&#x27;S NO BARGAIN.  IT&#x27;S BAIT AND SWITCH.</li>
    <li> I never understood the hype about emu until I tried this brand. A few years ago I sampled emu products that were gross, but this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I used to have reallydry and tough skin. I would put different types of oils and lotions and nothing helped until this.Emu oil is easily the best thing I have ever done for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to all of my friends and family and they love it. If you are not using this product you are missing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of everything else the price on this is outstanding.I would easily pay twice this amount for the results I get.</li>
    <li> I apply this lightly under my makeup in the morning and before going to bed at night.  It works wonders on the lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.</li>
    <li> Oil itself is good quality , but once i opened the box i seen that the oil was all over the inside of the bag . So the 8 oz of oil i ordered was now about 6. Hope they look into this because i know I&#x27;m not the first . Maybe plastic seal the top or something.. Wouldn&#x27;t order again just for this reason alone.</li>
    <li> Very pure Emu oil, clear &amp; absorbs into skin very quickly.  It&#x27;s the real deal!  I use it for dry skin (I&#x27;m pushing 70) and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love this oil and use it for my hair and skin, but it is pricey. It soothes dry skin and scalp.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need moisturizer or conditioner.  This stuff has helped my skin and hair not look so weathered.  Great stuff, and cost effective.</li>
    <li> Great value for high quality emu oil. Granted, as long as it is properly processed, most emu oil is excellent, but this is the best value I have found. You should buy two botttles.</li>
    <li> Did not do a lot for me.</li>
    <li> This is a reorder for me. I have previously used 2 bottles of this brand and tried 2 different brands prior. I like this one the best for it&#x27;s clarity and lack of smell. I found it to be one of the best emu oil values out there. Emu oil is a great moisturizer and many healing properties. However, it is not a miracle product. Use it properly and regularly and you will see positive, noticeable results. It won&#x27;t, however, solve every issue you have. That said, if I could only have 1 moisturizing product this would be it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The ACTIVE ingredient in this product is Pure Emu oil. The product also contains 2 other plant based oils which are listed on the label as Olea Europaea and Glycine Soja, which are the Latin scientific names for OLIVE OIL and SOYBEAN OIL. The quantities of each oil are not listed so this product could very well have only a trace of Emu Oil present. This product is NOT pure Emu Oil by any means. Olive oil is expensive but not THAT expensive! I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Have ordered this before and it always comes well packaged and in good condition. I love the pump bottle so I ordered a pump and then ordinary replacement bottles. I love Emu Oil!! This one is very healing and gentle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the emu oil since it is suppose to help with inflamation. We&#x27;ll see how it works. The lid wasn&#x27;t on tight and cause some leaking while it was mail, so was a bit messy when I got it. Not too much leaked out though.</li>
    <li> It is very effective &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell. It makes a big difference in the condition of my skin. Worth checking out if you have similar issues.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it at night to fight exceptionally dry skin from an autoimmune condition. It is gluten free and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out from any ingredients. No problems with the scent either. I will definitely reorder--though a little of this goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic, and received it fast. Face ,body and hair this stuff is the best. I will be back ,Thank you , Theresa Delcimmuto</li>
    <li> first time user and the reviews were true. leaves my skin soft and removes all ruffness. this was not a disappointment at all!</li>
    <li> Seems to relieve some pain, very smooth and easily rubbed into the skin.  Nice texture, much like a massage oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. Moisturizing last quite a while, and skin seems to respond well.</li>
    <li> This oil is pure gold and was needed to make a quantity of hair and body Oils for our whole family&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping and packaging was great and got here quickly.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t absorb and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try it on my face again. I do like what it does for my hands and feet.I won&#x27;t be throwing it out but I won&#x27;t buy it again. It&#x27;s pretty expensive for a hand/foot oil.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good price. I love Emu oil, works so well for so many things.. You can even use it on your pets.</li>
    <li> I got the emu oil based on an article that I read about dry skin. I purchased the oil and it does help, but it is difficult to apply so I used a cotton ball and that helped. Every time I applied it my cat tried to lick it off, I don&#x27;t think that it would hurt him, but it is amusing.</li>
    <li> This emu oil is excellent quality and very soothing to my skin.  I also think is helps with my arthritis pain.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dry skin and psoriasis for years and this oil has made a huge difference!  The price may seem a little high but this bottle lasts quite a while even with everyday use and a little oil goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The only problem with this one is that it is too runny. The other brand I get is thicker, therefore its easier to apply without the mess. This product does work for what it is meant for.</li>
    <li> the best for dry skin</li>
    <li> This oil far exceeds my expectations.  Buy it and you will see.... dry no more..... the oil pumps out beautifully... :)</li>
    <li> The oil has been very beneficial on healing my wife&#x27;s feet. Cracks and dryness have improved a lot since she started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, however be warned as some other have commented, it is oily. It takes some time to massage into the skin, much longer than say a lotion does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: when my wife started using the product, at first her skin started to peel before revealing healthy skin under it. I read some other comment about the same problem, so it&#x27;s likely due to the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it works really good on the feet.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping. Really works well for dry skin this time of the year although I do use it year round</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle. It&#x27;s the little things it does that keeps me using it. It helps the healing process both for cuts as well as bruises. It also reduces those brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair though, I should also mention that I also use a retinol cream (vitamin A) 100,000 IU per ounce in conjunction.&lt;br /&gt;But the nicest thing about using these two items is that I have to show identification to prove how old I am (73).</li>
    <li> It says Pure Emu Oil--not 100% Emu oil. I fell for it and a lot of other people will as well. This product actually has two other ingredients in it one of which is olive oil and the other is a soy product. There is no way to know how much of this is actually Emu oil and how much is filler. Number one way to tell this product is a fake is by sticking it in the fridge. 100% Emu oil will solidify, while this product stays a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still good for your skin however. It&#x27;s just a scam representing itself as Pure Emu oil. It isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Not greasy . It gives a beautiful healthy glow .  Last a long time . Leaves your complexion perfect alone or under make-up .</li>
    <li> Great for scars, softens the bumps</li>
    <li> I had never heard of emu oil until recently.  A cosmetician recommended it because I won&#x27;t use sunblock and I don&#x27;t use make-up.  I also don&#x27;t trust the ingredients in regular body lotions, etc.  I rec&#x27;d this oil in Dec, and am amazed at the improvement in my complexion.  I use it for cuticles, feet, body, skin bumps, etc., etc.  The stuff really works and has no chemicals.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> THATS WHAT MY WIFE WANTED AND NO COMPLAINTS</li>
    <li> My son has dry skin and using emu oil was the best ever for my little guy. Easy with the pump too.</li>
    <li> it really works my husband is useing it for hair and seeing if his hair gets thicker he likes it as hair dreesing also</li>
    <li> I purchased this on the suggestion of a friend and my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;The process of getting the oil went well.  (I was concerned because, well it&#x27;s oil) Amazon did a real slick packing job and of course it got to me before I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like using this oil in my shampoo.  I see the difference.  I live in AZ, so my hair justs beat up by the heat.&lt;br /&gt;This oil made my hair softer, shiningand more managable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindajft</li>
    <li> What a bargain this size Emu Oil is. Looked at many sites and no one could compare to Amazon&#x27;s price. It is a wonderful oil that can be used anywhere on your skin and in your hair as well. Use sparingly, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I buy emu all the time............I got this one as it was cheaper but a bit too oily for me.&lt;br /&gt;I use another brand and I think for the extra 10 bucks, I&#x27;ll  buy it next time.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad product, but not as penetrating................</li>
    <li> love this.  Inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Thank you,very good product I will recommend you to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful - just some kind of oil. It could be grape seed oil for all I know. Very messy... doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin. I bought it because I fell for the reviews. I&#x27;ve bought real emu oil before and it&#x27;s thick and slightly opaque and this is not at all like that. Very disappointed and won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This oil is lovely! I makes my skin and hair SILKY SMOOTH AND SOFT!!!! I&#x27;ve used coca butter, Shea butter and African butter in the past religiously. None have made my skin softer than this emu oil. The only reason I wont give it the full 5 starts is because the company is somewhat deceptive in its marketing of the oil. I don&#x27;t think this oil is 100% emu oil. That&#x27;s fine but they need to be up front about it. On the back it says Active ingredient is emu oil and doesn&#x27;t list what the filler oil is. That being said its still a really good quality oil. I recommend it to anyone looking to get smoother softer skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this item. My son and I both have moderate psoriasis. My son has it in his hair. He uses this on his scalp before he washes it. Let&#x27;s it sit for 15 minutes or so and viola! NO MORW FLAKES! I mixed some with my favorite lotion and use on mine on my arms. Scales and itching are gone!!</li>
    <li> My skin loves this oil. Makes it so soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as promised.  It makes the skin exceptionally soft -- especially feet and hands. It is even a good moisturizer for the face. I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product Emu Oil is used for helping ease the pain of Arthritis, skin moisturizing, and helps thicken hair. It is an excellent product, in fact have recommended this to family and friends and they also agreed this is an outstanding product,</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it does not contain and salicyclic acids.  I use it on my face at night and my skin is so much softer, the dryness and flaking is gone.  I live in arid Colorado so this is critical.  I have also begun to use it as a hair conditioner before I shampoo, it washes out easily and works very well.  The only negative was in the shipping.  Some of the product leaked out.  The cap wasn&#x27;t on tight enough and  it may be a poor seal or design flaw.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> this probably works well if you can get past the fishy smell, sorry it is a mild smell, I do not understand why it smells like fish.</li>
    <li> I buy it all the time for myself and my mom. She really loves it, great for her skin and her eyebrows started to get thicker as we wished they would(overplucking when she was young did not do any good to her aging face).</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Emu Oil and this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I do love my emu oil.  I like the pump and I like the idea that it might work to really, really moisturize my hands and cuticles.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great, I&#x27;ve got to tell you.  But, in the moment, it does moisturize the cuticle.  It just doesn&#x27;t really last, and it doesn&#x27;t really strengthen the nail.  BUT, it works really, really well on my hair!  Use it on your nails but really use on the ends of your hair while damp, right out of the shower.  Pivot.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells like 100% olive oil. Not what I wanted or expected.    EDIT:    I changed this from one to three stars because regardless of how much emu or olive oil it has in it, it works really well to stop my stomach from itching during my pregnancy! Thanks emu oil, you may contain practically no emu oil at all (I will never know because of your sketchy labeling,) but you are providing me with some small service.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the consistency of the oil.  What I like about it is that it is light and absorbs quickly into my skin.  I used it on my face.  My skin feels healthier. I notice an improvement in my complexion and toner. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I like it, but the pump can get a little messy.  The oil however is refreshing and not filmy. Good for ashy skin.</li>
    <li> A very light, fragile, excellent, penetrating topical body oil. Good shipping time and good packaging.</li>
    <li> This product is OK - it does soften the skin - but they worn about getting it in your eyes, so when you put in on your hands, it difficult to remember to not rub your eyes - this is the only draw back I have found thus far.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, easily-absorbed emu oil... I add other skin products to it in order to get them to absorb deeper. Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for cuts scrapes or all kinds of skin issues.</li>
    <li> love this product!! Will buy more!</li>
    <li> Emu oil is referred to as oil, but the skin absorbs and stays moisturized.  I had a spinal radiation and my skin over the spine was totally affected - looked like and felt like an intensive sunburn.  The Emu oil, quickly cured the skin and I still use it because it is truly comfortable skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> like it a lot.  Greasy at first, but absorbs quickly.  I like the shiny look it gives my skin (use if on my neck and chest area)</li>
    <li> All items were good as expected</li>
    <li> So surprised people say it has no scent, as I was smelling a distinct odor of olive oil. Looked more closely to see the label says  Olea Europaea - seems a sneaky way to list  olive oil. I don&#x27;t mind olive oil, but I thought I was buying emu oil &amp; have to wonder how much is really in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It keeps my skin smooth and it absorbs really well. A little goes a long way, too!</li>
    <li> This oil is nice, and I will enjoy it I already know!  Thick on arrival, thaws well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was emu oil or not, but it didn&#x27;t absorb like the real thing. It smells and looks like vegetable oil.</li>
    <li> I love Emu oil. It&#x27;s great for healing various skin ailments (burns, cuts, scrapes, acne, scars) and great for hair growth.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but this is a really good product. I purchased to use on my feet but have found many other uses for it. It works well after a bath or shower particularly for you feet. I also use it on my dog; yes I said dog. It is good for her skin as well. It is pricey but a good investment.</li>
    <li> I love the pump and it works great! I use the emu oil all over and it absorbs quickly. I will buy this product again! Reasonable price too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, and if you want to know, it is fragrance free.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have a strong opinion.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Have used it for 3 years and works very well.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my sons eczema! Tried it for a month and nothin, no changes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. Did nothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really impressed with this.  It didn&#x27;t do anything that a good lotion doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> I do not know this vendor, but at least I have found emu oil in general to be very useful.</li>
    <li> Works well as a &amp;#34;Deep&amp;#34; penetrating moisturizing oil. Works well on helping people with thin skin. Use it sparingly, and follow the instructions on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Wife very happy with product!</li>
    <li> This product works great and is the best chances to find a larger selection on. I use this product a lot.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product came Packaging was great no issues there.. And so far so good!  Keeps my skin soft and my hands feel great:)</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a makeup artist for use after a pedicure. It truly does make your feet so smooth, and it virtually disappears into your skin, no greasy feel, no weird smell. I love this product and will order it again, thanks Wholesale Trade!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. (I am assuming no Emus are hurt during the oil extraction?) It works well as a facial moisturizer at night. It is excellent as an all over body moisturizer as well. It is especially good as a hand and cuticle oil. I could not get by without Emu Oil and this is a very good brand.</li>
    <li> I really like that it has no smell, I add it to my body lotions to give them a little boost!</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted and superior quality</li>
    <li> very smoothing and mosturizing</li>
    <li> I live in NY and this was an extremely cold and dry year.. my skin got so dry at one point that I was itching like crazy. Even my fav lotions weren&#x27;t doing the trick.  Three days after using this, I would put it on after the shower, I was like brand new.  It kinda has a slight smell at first, its not offensive, but not pretty either, i only really noticed it while i was applying it.  Other then that i think this is a miracle product</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; is their name / trademark not referring to &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; emu oil. It even says in their ingredient list right here on this page that the emu oil is combined with other oils -  &amp;#34;Pure EMU OIL consists of the oils joined in a process known as eClarified, a process of combining 100% EMU OIL and Olea Europaea with Glycine Soja&amp;#34;. Olea Europaea is OLIVE OIL and Glycine Soja is SOY. Both oils are good for the skin by the way.This may very well be a great product but it looks to me like they are being sneaky and hoping people don&#x27;t read the whole description. Nowhere does it say how much of the combined oils is emu. Here is their website address emuoilpure dot com to see for yourself and it explains more about their process. I just don&#x27;t like people being taken advantage of.</li>
    <li> awsome product,fast service.</li>
    <li> I have very, very dry skin on my face and this is the only thing that can get it make-up ready.  Great protection from the elements in the winter time.</li>
    <li> Great size and I love the pump bottle.  The product is soothing and is great for dryness and can be used anywhere!</li>
    <li> This emu oil soothes my irritated scalp like a miracle. I usually leave it on overnight for best results. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok oil if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. I wanted emu oil for it&#x27;s anti-inflammatory properties. This emu didn&#x27;t give me that, it is very refined and I believe that much refinement took out the good stuff. This emu is clear oil. Other oils less refined were whitish and thicker. When I used Swanson&#x27;s emu oil it helped my itchy red flaky skin. The &amp;#34;Psoriasis Hall of Shame&amp;#34; claims Emu does not help psoriasis and that it&#x27;s a hype to sell more Emu oil. My experience is, the right Emu oil does help it. There may be others out there besides Swanson&#x27;s that work, it&#x27;s just the one I found that worked for me, where as this one did not. It is however a nice oil for dry skin, which I will use it for until it&#x27;s used up, but I still keep the Swanson&#x27;s for my Psoriasis patches.</li>
    <li> this is a really great product.  i will most definitely be ordering it again also.it goes on so smoothly and my skin feels wonderful after i&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> I find as I get a little older, my skin gets a little drier.  I had read about emu oil, so I ordered some.  It was way too expensive!  I didn&#x27;t find that it absorbed very well.  It didn&#x27;t do as well as the inexpensive lotion I was using from the drug store.</li>
    <li> I have used this on sore muscles, etc and it has really helped.  recommend this emu oil and think it is a good value</li>
    <li> Love Love Love ...Very Moisturizing..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years and NOTHING works like this does.  I had been plagued by winter dry skin dermatitis and nothing else helped but this.  Also, I use it to clear up flaky red patches on my face.  Works on sunburns, burns, insect bites.  Just great stuff and a little goes a long ways.  Plus it soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t stay oily on the surface.</li>
    <li> about to buy more thank you great price and great product all natural approach to problem skin I swear by emu oil!</li>
    <li> I doubt there is much pure emu oil in this, because when it showed up, it was cold outside, around fridge temps and it sat outside for awhile.  Previous emu oil that I have purchased from another company would start to solidify a bit even at just cooler room temps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  \\&quot;Active ingredient\\&quot; emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Inactive ingredients\\&quot; are olive oil and glycerin (from soy).  Even cold pressed, extra virgin olive oil starts to solidify a bit at colder, fridge like temps, and so it seems they were using a cheap, refined version of even that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  No way to know how much or how little actual emu oil is in this blend. But from the properties shown when cold, doubt there is much emu oil overall.  No wonder why it&#x27;s cheaper than most of the other ones here, it is quite cut/blended.  There is a very definite reason of why I wanted pure or near pure emu oil  is because emu oil is one of the only oils out there that deeply penetrates into the skin.  For the issue I would be using this for, this is very much needed.  While olive oil and glycerin will pretty much only absorb very slightly into the very top layer of the skin i.e. mostly sitting on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is why, I&#x27;m guessing, that some reviewers here found it more \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; than other emu oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you&#x27;re looking for more truly \\&quot;pure\\&quot; emu oil, I would skip this product by and go for one of the more expensive and non blended ones.  There is nothing \\&quot;pure\\&quot; about this product.</li>
    <li> I usually have very dry skin in the winter.  I use this when I get out of the shower on my face and arms &amp; legs and at first it looks oily, but shortly after it all absorbs and doesnt feel greasy at all.  I will continue to use, but not sure if it&#x27;s fighting any wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I used to use vitamin E oil.  This is similar.  I think I like it better.  Seems a little thicker.  It lasts for a long time and goes a long way.  But then all the oils do.  The push pump is convenient.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful , I have 57 year old skin, it helped with wrinkles more than any other moisturizer  I have tried!  Will buy again. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought it was, as the label and description stated, 100% pure emu oil.  It is not.  The company calls itself &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34;,  which according to the dictionary means &amp;#34;free from anything of a different, inferior, or contaminating kind; free from extraneous matter; unmodified by an admixture; simple or homogeneous&amp;#34;.  This company is obviously not aware of the definition of this word as this oil contains soybean oil and something else.  How much, I couldn&#x27;t tell you.  But pure emu oil is thick and whitish in color and this oil is clear and thin.  I rarely ever return anything, especially stuff ordered online, due to the hassle.  However, since this company would blatantly lie about this product being pure, who knows what else might be in it, or how much actual emu oil is in the &#x27;mixture&#x27;.  I&#x27;m returning this immediately!</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised, and very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Took a minute to get used to the smell but i like the way it makes my skin look</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I use it every day on my face. It helps with healing and wrinkle repair.</li>
    <li> Received Emu oil and I tried it on a very sore arthritic finger.  It worked so fast I thought I must have imagined it.  A couple days later I tried it on a sore knee (over-exercise), I walked around a little and  forgot about it, when I next  thought about it, the pain was nearly gone.  Subsequently I tried it on a very sore shoulder, with great results.  It even helped my bad back.  Amazing stuff and best of all, it works in with very little massaging and leaves no oily residue to get on clothes.  I have already recommended it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  I tried it because i heard about it on a TV show.  I am normally pretty skeptical.  This oil has actually cut down on the times I need to take pain medication.</li>
    <li> It went on nicely, but didn&#x27;t really absorb as I hoped or last as long as it should.  Easy pump bottle was convenient.  But, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Very clean product.  Love pump.  Def buy again</li>
    <li> It really has made a difference after using  it on my feet.  Just one push on pump is enough for my feet and the cat has quit biting my feet and  now  licks them.</li>
    <li> Very good product, worked very well for me, great moisturizing qualities, very easy to apply, a little goes a long way and a very good price for the amount you get, relative to other similar products on Amazon, it&#x27;s a great buy. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This items is great!! I use it on my skin every day.  It cleaned my face and my scars.  I saw a difference within 2 weeks.  Great product.  Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair mostly.  Soaks right in and no greasy residue.  I have tried all other kinds of oil but nothing works like this.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. One of the best pure emu oils on the market</li>
    <li> The perfect companion for a pair of 80 year old feet that have been used to the maximum. As a Child in Washington I remember running in the streets when the temperature was 95-100 degrees(air temp)and the asphalt and concrete was much hotter. Spending 20 years in the Military,nine of them in the Infantry as a Medic carrying heavy back packs and Medical supply bags. Hiking and camping in the state of Washington in all types of weather(being wet for days). When I was 79 years old I suffered a bad second degree sunburn of both feet while visiting in the High desert of California. My skin was rancid looking to say the least however after using Emu Oil two to three times daily my skin is back to normal. I also emuOil for the anti-inflammatory and anti pain properties,which has helped Me reduce the number of Vicodan I was taking for Arthroritic pain in both knees,both hands. My wife is currently using Emu Oil to clear brown age spots on Her face,arms and hands.Her skin once again has a healthy and vibrant appeal to it. We have a number of friends that are having the same results.</li>
    <li> This Emu Oil is just fantastic.  A little goes a long way and it makes my skin feel fantastic.  I also use it on my sons uber dry skin and we are seeing great improvements.</li>
