      <li>The wig itself fits perfectly on my head, but the way the hair was sewn into it (perhaps to add volume?)</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS!!!</li>
      <li>So I tried this wig today and I am really happy that the texture and the volume is just perfect.</li>
      <li>I bought this wig for an Aurora Costume and it was great.</li>

      <li>I wear wigs every day and this is a very nice addition to my collection.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure once I put it on with the rest of a costume, it&#x27;ll be perfect!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a nice wig to add to my collection.</li>
      <li>The curls are nice, and it got her after about two weeks.</li>

      <li>It is of nice quality and is very full.</li>
      <li>as with all 5 of my x &amp; y angel wigs, they look best with a beanie or headband because there isn&#x27;t a very natural hairline on the top other than that they are perfect!</li>

      <li>, I didn&#x27;t once overheat and I can easily wear it for hours at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I will say though that the rest of the hair is beautiful and a honey blonde.</li>
      <li>It is a very pretty wig!</li>
      <li>downfall of this wig is that it makes my head look huge.</li>
      <li>light blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I learned that night that Yes, blonds do have more fun.</li>
      <li>But I was overall happy with</li>
      <li>Do order it early though, because it takes a good 2-3 weeks to arrive from China.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to be, for this was my first X&amp;Y Angel wig.</li>
      <li>This wig is defiantly worth the money!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and stays on very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super excited.</li>
      <li>The only thing I was happy with was the shipping, it came here lightening fast.</li>
      <li>Worth the low cost for a good quality wig.</li>
      <li>I am so excited to be the first to review this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and a great quality wig, thick, with beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;Color is a bit more yellow than in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;Bangs are long, but they can be swept to the side.</li>
      <li>The color and style is true to the picture and no weird shine, at all.</li>
      <li>Wow, another favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>My husband was kind enough to be my Ken.</li>
      <li>I got this wig quickly and i was really surprised at how nice and soft it was.</li>
      <li>Smelled Funny at first, and the bangs stuck out in all directions, but after washing, No problems!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very soft, it feels as soft as my own hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s slightly more yellow than te picture, but still very pretty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m lucky I was wearing this wig with a headband and ribbon because the crown sticks straight up and the bangs were not hiding the cap well at all.</li>
      <li>It looks like real hair!</li>
      <li>The cut and color look exactly like the pic.</li>
      <li>The wig I received was more of a honey blonde.</li>
      <li>The color and length were true to photo, but the straight across bangs would really only fit a slim face.</li>
      <li>It is a nice wig, especially for the price, but in no way looks natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent 4 times as much on wigs before and this one was just as nice as those wigs.</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s a certain man that just wants me to wear it ALL the time!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn it numerous times over the past month and it still looks good as new and is one of my favorite wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wig is very soft, but it is very light blonde, not like the picture.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
      <li>It got here early which is nice, but it is grey</li>
      <li>makes my head look abnormally large.</li>
      <li>the wig is very pretty and very soft, but its much lighter than the picture, looks very unnatural-</li>
      <li>Goldie Locks.&lt;br /&gt;The hair feels real though and super soft.</li>
      <li>Worth the splurge, high quality realistic and just heavenly.</li>
      <li>(They even go together to make a large curl that looks very nice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But that doesn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
      <li>It looks so real.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t tangle TOO much, and doesn&#x27;t get very frizzy.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Looks like real hair-</li>
      <li>Not as cool blonde as the picture,</li>
      <li>The curls are bouncy, the wig fiber are soft and manageable, and the over all look of the wig is matte and looks like real hair!</li>
      <li>It is okay if I wear a hat or a headband to squish it down, but that&#x27;s why I take a star away.</li>
      <li>The pic shows a different kind of blonde then what you&#x27;ll get; really light yellow blonde.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s full and long, curls are entact.</li>
      <li>It is very long and full.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this wig for an Aurora Costume and it was great. I&#x27;ve spent 4 times as much on wigs before and this one was just as nice as those wigs. The wig cap fit great and the hair was soo soft. It didn&#x27;t tangle either and the hair looked real.&lt;br /&gt;The only con was that the color was a little different from what the pictured showed. It was a little blonder. But that may have just been because of the colors of my computer screen.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying wigs from here again.</li>
    <li> I got this wig quickly and i was really surprised at how nice and soft it was. I&#x27;ve had very bad experiences with wigs in the past. I asked if this would frizz and was delighted to see that many people said it wouldn&#x27;t.  Anyway, back to the wig. It was packaged nicely and i was REALLY excited. But it&#x27;s only been a day and it&#x27;s already REALLY FRIZZED!!!! I am NOT happy.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and a great quality wig, thick, with beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;Color is a bit more yellow than in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;Bangs are long, but they can be swept to the side.</li>
    <li> so yellow, returning it!</li>
    <li> The wig is very soft, but it is very light blonde, not like the picture. The bangs went past my nose and were hard to cut because of how straight the hair is, you could see any flaw in the cut. It feels very soft but you can&#x27;t run your fingers through it.</li>
    <li> I am so excited to be the first to review this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this wig in an order of five wigs. This one and one other was for my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is AMAZING. The curls are bouncy, the wig fiber are soft and manageable, and the over all look of the wig is matte and looks like real hair! The color is very true to the picture. When my friend tried it on, it makes her look a lot like Princess Aurora! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying from this company again! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this item! Very pretty very soft looks real, great cosplay wig</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s long, and pretty. The wig on the model in the picture makes it look like the wig is a dirty blonde (blonde mixed with a bit of ash brown) , but it&#x27;s true color is a very pale, light blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone whose natural hair is short, I enjoy the length of this wig...makes me feel like a mermaid! Beware because it does get tangled very easily, especially at the nape of the neck. Brush it out before and after wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downfall of this wig is that it makes my head look huge. The wig itself fits perfectly on my head, but the way the hair was sewn into it (perhaps to add volume?) makes my head look abnormally large. It is okay if I wear a hat or a headband to squish it down, but that&#x27;s why I take a star away.</li>
    <li> So I tried this wig today and I am really happy that the texture and the volume is just perfect. I wish this wig with the same style comes in platinum blonde! The actual color of this wig is much darker than the picture. But that doesn&#x27;t bother me so much. It is a very pretty wig!</li>
    <li> This wig looks nothing like the picture. I was expecting a nice, thick, honey blonde, I got a super thin platinum that looks very unnatural. Looking through the reviews it seems the color of the blonde varies immensely. As soon as I put it on you could see the cap through the bangs. I&#x27;m lucky I was wearing this wig with a headband and ribbon because the crown sticks straight up and the bangs were not hiding the cap well at all. The only thing I was happy with was the shipping, it came here lightening fast. Too bad I won&#x27;t ever wear it again.</li>
    <li> I got this wig in about 9 days from China. I was semi hesitant because the price is so cheap but its a lovely blonde color (less ashy than the photo), its really thick and you can&#x27;t see the netting. The bangs we very long I did trim them about an inch and a half to fit my face. It looks fairly natural and not very shiny. Super soft, it did tangle a little after wearing it out to dinner but it&#x27;s easy to brush. Happy with it and I would purchase from this company again!</li>
    <li> I received this wig about a week before the estimated delivery date. The cut and color look exactly like the pic. It is of nice quality and is very full. This wig is defiantly worth the money!</li>
    <li> Color/lighting in the photos is NOT accurate. This is a yellow blonde wig, it absolutely does not look like the ash blonde wig in the photographs. It is a nice wig, especially for the price, but in no way looks natural. This is definitely a cosplay wig, and not one to wear in everyday life.</li>
    <li> If I could give this more stars I would.  So pleased with this wig! The color and style is true to the picture and no weird shine, at all. It&#x27;s full and long, curls are entact. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and it almost goes down to my waist. Doesnt shed that much and looks great. I got lots of compliments on this wig, very believable.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to be, for this was my first X&amp;Y Angel wig. But I was overall happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;It is very soft, it feels as soft as my own hair. It is very long and full. The curls can be brushed through and they go right back to their curliness (They even go together to make a large curl that looks very nice.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was that the bangs are pre-cut, which surprised me, because normally wigs are have base bangs, so you can cut them to fit your face, but this was not the case. They were already cut, and were very full and thick. They are at the right length where it barely hits my eyes, so I still have to trim them down, but not by much. And also, for some reason, the beginning of the bangs (On the crown) are very prickly, it is weird. You don&#x27;t see them, but you feel them, and it just feels weird.&lt;br /&gt;I have already worn this out and it stays very cool, I didn&#x27;t once overheat and I can easily wear it for hours at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this wig greatly for every use, either wearing it for normal use, or as cosplay (I am using it for Elsa), it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Not as cool blonde as the picture, but I love the color sent (more platinum) even more! The curls are nice, and it got her after about two weeks. I&#x27;m super excited. Only problem is that even with the straps fully undone, the wig is a bit snug on my head. Nothing too obvious, though. Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for my Alice in Wonderland costume. The wig was a lot darker than the picture represents. The wig I received was more of a honey blonde. It&#x27;s a better color if you are going to play Goldie Locks.&lt;br /&gt;The hair feels real though and super soft. Worth the low cost for a good quality wig. I just wish it was the same color as the picture. Plus the bangs are super long but they can be trimmed.</li>
    <li> I love love love this wig. It looks so natural on. Everyone thought I was a natural blonde when I wore it for Halloween.  Great price and good customer service.</li>
    <li> Wow, another favorite of mine. Absolutely GORGEOUS. Worth the splurge, high quality realistic and just heavenly.</li>
    <li> This wig is gorgeous, to be honest, i wasn&#x27;t expecting this wig to look as good as it does. it&#x27;s very long and doesn&#x27;t tangle at all. the color is almost exactly like the picture (only slightly off) i would recommend this wig to anyone looking for a long blonde wig.</li>
    <li> It got here early which is nice, but it is grey so I look like an old lady with it on only reason for being 3 star, i thought it would be brighter than grey</li>
    <li> First off, I received this wig much later than expected. Apparently it got lost in the China mail and the sellers were not cooperative with helping me find it so I just had to pray that it got here. I was going to use it for a Halloween costume and after receiving it much too late, I decided to give it a try. The bangs are much much too long. I began cutting them and the shape was off, like I was starting to cut into the main hair part. I will say though that the rest of the hair is beautiful and a honey blonde.</li>
    <li> Very soft and natural ^^&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for blonde wavy haired cosplay, its not very suited for cosplay as its a bit short (id say around 60-70cm) and the colour is a platinum blonde, not very yellow, or is it the lighting?</li>
    <li> very nice for the price.  I wear wigs every day and this is a very nice addition to my collection.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s slightly more yellow than te picture, but still very pretty. And a little bit less full. My only beef with it is the fact that it made me realize I do NOT pull of blonde hair haha. It is very long, past my ribcage, and the bangs come a little longer so that you can cut them to fit your face! The cap is also adjustable and you can&#x27;t see it at all. It&#x27;s very comfortable and stays on very well. You can hardly tell its a wig. Doesn&#x27;t tangle TOO much, and doesn&#x27;t get very frizzy. Love it :)</li>
    <li> I wear this wig often and I love it! I ordered it back in September- came on time, if not earlier. I&#x27;ve had it for months now and it&#x27;s still beautiful and totally heat resistant, at about a low-medium temperature. It looks like real hair! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This wig is adorable and people always tell me how beautiful my hair is when I wear it! as with all 5 of my x &amp; y angel wigs, they look best with a beanie or headband because there isn&#x27;t a very natural hairline on the top other than that they are perfect!</li>
    <li> Okay So if you&#x27;re looking for a fake, nappy looking blonde: look no further. The hair looks like a Barbie doll. The pic shows a different kind of blonde then what you&#x27;ll get; really light yellow blonde. Is compare it to dolly pardon blonde. The bangs are super long and needed to be trimmed.</li>
    <li> The color and length were true to photo, but the straight across bangs would really only fit a slim face. Did nothing for my round face.</li>
    <li> Love this wig. It looks so real. I wore it on the Halloween night and went out as Barbie. My husband was kind enough to be my Ken. We received plenty of complements from friends and strangers. I learned that night that Yes, blonds do have more fun. I would totally recommend it. Do order it early though, because it takes a good 2-3 weeks to arrive from China.</li>
    <li> the wig is very pretty and very soft, but its much lighter than the picture, looks very unnatural- plus the part looks very awkward and styling it wont help. its also very thin and tangles easily, after a month of infrequent use the netting was extremely visible. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this</li>
    <li> Smelled Funny at first, and the bangs stuck out in all directions, but after washing, No problems!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig to add to my collection. I&#x27;m sure once I put it on with the rest of a costume, it&#x27;ll be perfect!</li>
    <li> This is such a beautiful wig ! it&#x27;s a little bit thin but it&#x27;s amazing. The curls don&#x27;t fall or get out of place and it&#x27;s super soft. The only qualm I have about it is the bangs. I had to cut the bangs to get them like the one pictured on the model for it. Without cutting the bangs, they are kind of side swept and stick to the side. It still looks nice that way, but I bought it because it was pictured with bangs. It wasn&#x27;t that big of a problem though and was easily fixed. Since it&#x27;s really thin though, it can get easily tangled if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall through, it&#x27;s really great. I&#x27;ve worn it numerous times over the past month and it still looks good as new and is one of my favorite wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I provided how it looks before I cut it and after I cut it to help illustrate what I meant about the bangs</li>
    <li> OMG!!! LOVE THIS!!! Looks like real hair- NO tangles and SOooo soft. I got this to dress up as Babydoll from SuckerPunch and I swear- there&#x27;s a certain man that just wants me to wear it ALL the time!</li>
