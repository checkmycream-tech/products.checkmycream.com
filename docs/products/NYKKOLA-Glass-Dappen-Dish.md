<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Slow  shipping .&lt;br /&gt;happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Saw a few comments about the various dappen dishes being too small. Well, its meant to be used with acrylics and for that use (and based on my many years of having acrylics) its exactly what its supposed to be - a small glass dish used to hold powders or liquids. Arrived with no chips or breaks so very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Wayyyyy smaller then I expected, both can fit in the palm of my hand and I have small hands. They will work but I still have to go buy bigger ones now. But they came in good condition and nothing wrong with them.</li>
    <li> Although I like this tiny - tiny - glass dish, those of you looking for a cheaper dappen dish for brushes to use with acrylics and monomer should look elsewhere - preferably one that tells you the dimensions. Now, I don&#x27;t use acrylics, and haven&#x27;t gotten into gels either, but this seems way too small for a monomer liquid. As soon as the brush would be dipped into the liquid, it would spill over the sides. Perhaps there are some people who do use this for that very purpose, but I honestly don&#x27;t see how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for my usage - which is simply to tip some nail polish remover into it for an easy clean up for whatever I&#x27;m doing - it&#x27;s perfectly fine. For a dollar and some change, I can&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. Has decent weight to it despite it being small, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be sliding around. I just wanted something glass to put remover into so I don&#x27;t distort the plastic lid to the bottle, as well as something I can clean my brushes and dotting tools in quickly so I don&#x27;t ruin nail designs.</li>
    <li> works great for the acrylic nails and mixing all the colors.  allows you to utilize a little amount of liquid and not waste it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so small and perfect that words can&#x27;t even describe it. It&#x27;s perfect for it&#x27;s purpose. It&#x27;s so small though. I haven&#x27;t figured out yet what else it can be used for. But regardless, I love it!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but does the job</li>
    <li> Great! I&#x27;m using this for doing my nails.</li>
    <li> Good to hold polish remover in when doing french manicure on nails. ;-) I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This is one of those little details that put me one step closer to turning my living room into a salon while watching tv!</li>
    <li> No lacquerista should be without this, makes cleanup so much easier and less likely to accidentally fall over (unlike the plastic cap to the polish remover bottle!)</li>
    <li> This product came about 5 days before it was due! It was due to arrive from july 1- 20 and arrived around June 20th!</li>
    <li> The only thing about this item that I didn&#x27;t like was the fact it was so small I mean you can do a full set of nails with the dish full and it&#x27;s an amazing I product the size just got to me</li>
    <li> This is so helpful when I want to make my nails look perfect. I pour in some acetone, dip a small brush in, and use it to clean off polish around the cuticles. Especially helpful when I stamp my nails since that can get pretty messy.</li>
    <li> i will be using for my cuticle clean up</li>
    <li> Love this dapper dish :)</li>
    <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose. A nice small glass for me to put acetone. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great little item, for the price it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> This is really cute and teensy, also very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Perfect for holding your remover to soak off a nail or perfect your French manicure smiles.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2, only received one.</li>
    <li> I order this glass two days ago, and today I got it! It was wrapped really good and the glass dish was new. Also they included a free gift, a nail art butterflies. They are so cute and I&#x27;m very happy !!!!</li>
    <li> there ok but there way to much money after i order them i saw some at the store way cheaper but there very good there two of them</li>
    <li> Very cute, but easy to lose track of!</li>
    <li> This works okay but is a little too small for my needs. I can; even turn my finger 180 degrees when making bullseye water nail art.</li>
    <li> Great product. The packaging was appropriate for this item. It came right on time as informed. I already have one of these so I knew I needed another one.</li>
    <li> Good I recommend buying this dappen dish</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful tiny glass dish perfect for nail art use or whatever else.  And the price is great.  This order was shipped immediately, was expertly packaged, and arrived in perfect condition an impressive 20 days from the day I ordered it by (what I usually term) &amp;#34;a slow boat from China&amp;#34;.  I am very pleased with this seller and this product and will use them again.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Really helps when I need somewhere to put my acrylic liquid in</li>
    <li> This dappen dish does the job. It just arrived almost two months after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using my glass on my liquids. It is a big help, Making sure you don&#x27;t use a lot of your liquids. EXtremely awesome, and will get much  use out of it. Thanks Amazon, for using this seller</li>
    <li> Product was a good deal.  Very sturdy, thick glass.  A little smaller than I thought, but still is great for what I needed.  The price was great at under $2, which included shipping.  Shipping takes a while, but it did arrive well within the estimated time frame.  It came from China or Hong Kong or somewhere around there, so it&#x27;s going to take longer.</li>
    <li> received this today ahead of the expected delivery time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the item however is not as pictured. the one I received was very small and clear glass. however for the small cost and free s&amp;h I will make it of some type of use. I was hoping it would be larger. for the low price and free s&amp;h I wont be returning it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  it would be helpful if the sellers added the size in their description please.</li>
    <li> I use it to mix baking soda and hydrogen peroxide together as an at home teeth whitener. it&#x27;s a lot cheaper</li>
    <li> This second time I had to buy these as the first just fell apart...will see how long these hold up but just in case I bought five of them this time.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast ship-</li>
    <li> I guess I was a little shocked at how small this was when I received it, but seems large enough to serve it&#x27;s purpose. It does seem to be good quality and I would probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this  little dish! It&#x27;s small, portable, and practical for what I use it for. Great price and great usage I get out of it.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m a pro. I love using this dish for removal of gel polish and also for home manicures. Just like the salon.</li>
    <li> i use this dish for my acrylic nails. to put the acrylic liquid in. Its a really good product nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> This is little and cute. It&#x27;s just what I needed for my manicure setup. Shipping took a while, but the price was decent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tiny little &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; - maybe the size of a bottle cap in diameter. Perfect for holding a small bit of acetone to use for apres manicure clean up.</li>
    <li> Excellent glass dish used with acetone to clean up my cuticles when I do my own manicure.</li>
    <li> Exactly as stated in description, heavy won&#x27;t tip over very easily.</li>
    <li> So tiny! Cute! A great use for dipping manicure brush in acetone. Not too big to get in way of your nail kit. I like it.</li>
    <li> this little jar comes in handy while I do my manicure cleanup.  it cleans easily and is sturdy.  just what I needed.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! Arrived quickly too.</li>
    <li> Took forever but serves its purpose</li>
    <li> Great for acrylic liquid or mixing glitter pigments with acrylic</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it&#x27;ll be just enough for my acrylic liquid when doing nails. Arrived nicely wrapped in bubble wrap and envelope. USPS however, delivered a day AFTER they told Amazon they did....They are notorious for doing stuff like that :/. I&#x27;m pleased with the product. If you&#x27;re looking for something to hold the liquid while you do your nails without much hassle it&#x27;s great. Would&#x27;ve loved if it had a cover though. I&#x27;m looking into getting low odor acrylic liquid.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected!</li>
    <li> It really has helped me clean up my nails and I don&#x27;t have to worry about distroying my nails with cotton balls...</li>
    <li> Just the right size for my polish remover to clean up edges of finger nails. Not too much product poured.</li>
    <li> Small,but useful, and I don&#x27;t even do acrylic nails!</li>
    <li> This is a handy little cup to have when doing gel nails. It makes cleaning the brushes I got much easier and doesnt create a mess.</li>
    <li> Is it smaller than a bread box?  It is tinier than a mouse&#x27;s bread box!  I guess it will work but it would be easier to use if it was a bit larger.  See the picture someone loaded (after I purchased this) to see if it is what you are looking for.  Had I known the dimensions, I would have purchased something else.</li>
    <li> well its awesome! and tiny and cute,likee the shappe,works for me doing acrylic nails&lt;br /&gt;and it came how it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> I think the quality was a bit shabby; however, it&#x27;s usable. I&#x27;d get a shot glass before I bought this again though.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, heavy duty glass dish, great for holding fingernail polish removers (for quick touch ups). Most nail techs use dappen dishes and I decided to get one for home. Very good price.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I know it&#x27;s just a little glass dish, but it does the job and I now have a dedicated dish to use for my at-home manicures.  Geez, I&#x27;m sooooo organized and put together now.....</li>
    <li> this came pretty quick. its small i may order more cuz you can use them for different things when u do your nails thanks</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and in good condition.  The dish is very small than I thought it would be, but turns out to be the right size for what I wanted it for.</li>
    <li> I ordered three items in a pack, I received only one and it was broken. Not a very happy with this</li>
    <li> Price is right and you can never have too many of these!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for tanning eyelashes and Brows!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to  work with the other items for nail care</li>
    <li> I use this glass to put my brush cleaner in and it is the perfect tiny size.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This glass dish was delivered on time and will help me when doing my nails that way I don&#x27;t have to use the caps of my finger nail polish remover. No more spills!!!!</li>
    <li> I received my product before the estimated time and I was very pleased ..Thank you</li>
    <li> I mixed a paste in this , and when I picked it up to use it , it cracked in half it didn&#x27;t fall or anything it just fell apart right in my hand. Also I could tell this was used before it was sent to me , because it had something at the top that I couldn&#x27;t remove.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an add on since it was recommended with the DL Professional French Manicure Brush. It is much smaller than I had imagined, which is not a problem, but I was simply surprised! Seems to be a decent cup to pour acetone in, and would easily be stored along with my nail polish and other beauty supplies as it is so small. It is about an inch tall and an inch across. It holds 10 ml when filled to the brim.</li>
    <li> Small and convenient to get the job done!</li>
    <li> This glass dish was very small yet cute. Since I am a beginner in learning how to do acrylic nails, it was acceptable. My only advice is to get the actual size of a product or a comparison to other things when making purchases, but it works for me.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS IT APPEARED ONLINE.</li>
    <li> This came to me well packaged and exactly what I wanted. I use it for acetone when I paint my nails to clean around the edges. But I am sure there are many other ways to use this. Lol</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL!! GREAT for clean up on nail art!</li>
    <li> I received this item quickly and there were no shipping &amp; handling charges.  It&#x27;s a small container, but perfect for handling either acetone or water as needed in the manicure. Thank You!</li>
    <li> This little guy is just right for the job. Just like the ones they use in the salon. I use it with nail polish remover for cleaning up the edges of my gel manicures.</li>
    <li> I like this product it does what is suppose to do. I only wish it had a lid, because they solution used to do nail and clean brushes evaporates easily and quickly. I still like this product.</li>
    <li> Good quality highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy having this. Was packaged great and I will definately be using this product a lot, really awesome</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this product. It was a bit smaller than i thought to was going to be, but it will work just fine. Packaging was great. Will buy again from this seller. :)</li>
    <li> Great item, but it&#x27;s only for dunking your brush and not to sit in container.  You have to lean your brush on something in order to keep it in the solution in the glass.</li>
    <li> This is a great company to deal with.  They are very considerate and will easily resolve any issues.  Great products too.  I will order from them again.  These little glass dishes are so so cute and useful with doing my own nails at home.  Love them!!</li>
    <li> Sent from China, had to have a signature on a 2 dollar item, it was probably sent back to China. Thanks so much for selling me something really cheap that I am not going to miss a whole day of work to receive. Took forever too, plus I was never credited back for the items I didn&#x27;t receive and I had to go to Sally&#x27;s to buy it.</li>
    <li> This dish is good quality but small. It is a little bigger than a thimble. No waste of product if you use this lil guy.</li>
    <li> Great product,  thanks for being a good seller !</li>
    <li> Works as per the product descriptions.  I have bought three more of these and found them all to be a quality product</li>
    <li> I received this item lightening fast!! I got it at a very reasonable price and think it is a very useful tool for acrylic nails</li>
    <li> Dish is exactly what I expected.  It was packaged great, and it arrived fast.  Perfect size.  I recently saw this exact dish at a store for twice the price as it was on here.  It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Nice small size, yet big enough... Very sturdy and does not tip over</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Valentine&#x27;s Day and got it around March 13. Works fine and I use it a lot!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Quality made.</li>
    <li> I bought this dappen dish along with a short little nail brush - and the two together have me doing my own french tip manicures at home for a fraction of the price. You must use glass with pure acetone or you risk a melted puddle of plastic - acetone is STRONG stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a real glass mini bowl. Exactly as pictured, nice quality. Arrived really quick. I plan on using it to clean nail polish off around the edges of my nails. I can use it for manicures &amp; pedicures.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought.  Smaller than a shot glass.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, great deal. shipping was quick and it came in one piece. Dropped it a couple times and it hasn&#x27;t broken</li>
    <li> I decided to start doing my own nails, instead of paying someone else. I ordered this dappen dish, but did not pay any attention to the size. It works ok, but would have been better for me if it had been a little larger.</li>
    <li> This dappen dish is durable and lasts up to what I need. Would be nice if it came with a lid but it&#x27;s perfectly fine this way, too!</li>
    <li> Loved the size, and while trying to unwrap it, I accidentally dropped it, (MY fault totally) but the dish was perfectly fine!!! Thank goodness!! I do my own nails and needed a replacement one so I chose this one. Honestly, I love working with this one SO much better!!! I am NOW A REPEAT customer for life !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NONE&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: size, durability, quality, Octagonal shape on the outside and round on the inside makes it so much easier to work with!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to beginners just learning to do nails, the DIY&#x27;ers to the advanced tech!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize just how tiny this was, but it actually works pretty well. I normally don&#x27;t have to refill it for a set of nails so it works.</li>
    <li> This is the tiniest little dish I&#x27;ve seen, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing and is clearly stated in the description. I think I was expecting it to be as large as the one in nail salons. However, it fits the bill and is the perfect size for touching-up manicure accidents. Because it is so small, I found myself having to refill it 3-4 times--not because of use but because of evaporation while I was doing my nails.</li>
    <li> Nice but the glass had been chipped off when it came, well I shouldn&#x27;t be too hard on them because it Is glass, glass can break or can chip due to traveling.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for dipping your brush in to clean up french manicures.  I would recommend it if you&#x27;re doing a lot of them.</li>
    <li> cutest thing ever so small and compact I would really buy this product again....well I just might have to because I lost it...but I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size to put the ink in, for my Calligraphy dip pens.</li>
    <li> I use this dish to pour acetone in and it&#x27;s held up nicely. I do worry about dropping and breaking it, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This dish is sooooooo much more handier than I thought. And for the price....come on! Little price to pay for a biiiiiiig convenience.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my nail salon uses. It helps me do French Manicures and clean-up before putting it under the LED light. It also saves on wasting too much acetone. Great seller too!</li>
    <li> Great quality for the cheap price, small but manageable.</li>
    <li> its very small but its cute</li>
    <li> Nice glass and very easy to use. It may have been used before because it smelt a bit like acrylic liquid but still very nice.</li>
    <li> Great little dish; about half the size of a regular tequila shot glass. I was expecting it to be a little wider but it won&#x27;t interfere with what I intend to do with it. The item came in excellent condition. No stains, cracks, or breaks. It came in a padded envelope but was not wrapped in anything else. USPS was able to fold the envelope in half for it to fit in my mailbox (I have a small box at an apartment complex).</li>
    <li> Even though its alot smaller then i could have imagined im very pleased with this. i will be ordering many more shortly</li>
    <li> ok got this so late and when it arrived to my house it was so small it doesn&#x27;t look like the one from the picture.</li>
    <li> Good size for getting Acrylics done and i also use it for acetone and dip a brush to clean around the nails after applying the nail polish.similar size to the cap of the nail polish remover. But shipping took forever! A month</li>
    <li> I bought two of these they were very tiny but I really like them.  They do save time and are very functional.  They also came very fast.</li>
    <li> I love this little cup.  It is sturdy and does not tip over.  It holds the perfect amount of polish remover for clean up around my cuticles.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and great product!</li>
    <li> Great little thing. Took a long time to arrive but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> A waste of money. Much too small. You are better off using a shot glass to soak your gel brush.</li>
    <li> I use this with acetone while doing my own gel nails.  Its great for dipping and cleaning my brushes.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Its excellent for a Glass Dappen Dish for use when doing acrylic nails etc...  Much cheaper as well. Well worth the wait.  Highly recommended. 5++</li>
    <li> Cute in person! Struggled using the nail polish remover cap and it continually falling over. Good essential for at home nail artists.</li>
    <li> I needed a mini cup to hold acetone for working on false nails. This did the job. I wish it was slightly bottom heavier, but otherwise it was small and worked well. Made of glass.</li>
    <li> Basically this is just a short shot glass.  It will do what it will do, but a dollar store shot glass would do the same.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what they say it is. Im very satisfied with it. Came very fast and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Perfect size to clean up nails</li>
    <li> I use this dappen dish Everytime I do my acrylic nails. It holds just enough monomer without the wasting it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product cause i will be using it all the time because i do my nails a lot but it is smaller than i thought it would be</li>
    <li> Glass dish was okay but very dirty, it was gross.</li>
    <li> Very usefull, i like it !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this to put a little rubbing alcohol in when I&#x27;m doing my nails.  I use a brush and dip it in the alcohol to fix mistakes as I go.</li>
    <li> when you&#x27;re looking at it on the web site you might think it&#x27;s deep enough for a any type of finger.&lt;br /&gt;it is tiny, fragile, and the worst thing is I receive the package broken. it&#x27;s useless to me. the seller did not put enough detail about the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a glass dappen dish - used for monomer.  Product is exactly as described - no chips or scratches.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I uploaded an alternate pic of this item so you can see the actual size. Although $4.XX may seem pricey for such a small item, the seller is providing free shipping, so just keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is perfect for what I want - a small dish to put acetone or other nail polish remover in when I&#x27;m working on my nails. Doesn&#x27;t get much simpler than that.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it&#x27;s really cute and for the price I purchased it at, I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Item fine, but terrible shipping.</li>
    <li> just the perfect size</li>
    <li> I purchased this when I decided to be cheap and try to do my nails at home myself instead of going to the nail salon but I will never do that again. This little glass is neat though and is just like the ones in the nail salons.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but nt wat expected to small nt enough shallow</li>
    <li> Its very small but does the job</li>
    <li> This is a good dish. What more can I say.</li>
    <li> This is just the perfect size glass so you don&#x27;t waste a lot of  solution.  I thought of using a shot glass, but felt that you would waste almost twice the solution so I got this .</li>
    <li> Too small and looks dirty. Nothing like that is pictured. Maybe they&#x27;re made out of recycled glass. I constantly knock mine over when I&#x27;m dipping my brush.</li>
    <li> bought this for a friend she loved it, and she got exactly what was advertise on the picture, thanks happy customer</li>
    <li> This is  a great little product.  I use it for using my eye make up to dip my brushes in for eye shadow and brow powder.</li>
    <li> The shipping took a long time, around 2 months almost, but I received it today. It was wonderful regarding its price. Perfect for acetone:) just make to you also get brushes</li>
