      <li>They emailed to make sure I received it when I was supposed to.</li>

      <li>This ointment comes in a lovely tin</li>

      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very cautious about what we put in and on our bodies and the ingredients in Sanarom could not be better if I made it</li>
      <li>Do you guys remember the Lever soap commercial, it was good for everybody part;</li>
      <li>When applying, it melts and liquefies really quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>scraped healed quick</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used soap to wash my hands during the day, but has been well absorbed instead.  </li>
      <li>I love this natural balm.</li>
      <li>The really exciting part is how it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>Took it right away.</li>
      <li>I dare say it&#x27;s better because it&#x27;s all natural with no weird chemicals.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a paste that melts into your skin without being greasy and it has a slight scent of something you know is good for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time but the results are remarkable.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>it ended up being more like a sore and prevented him from shaving for several days.</li>
      <li>My skin felt so soft and smooth with no irritation at all.  </li>
      <li>The next day, the rash was much better.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth without leaving an oily residue.</li>
      <li>She is sensitive to chemicals, so I&#x27;m glad she found something natural that works so well for her.</li>
      <li>i also used this on my dry cuticles as well as some minor cuts and it worked great.</li>
      <li>I would certainly order this product again and would recommend it to friends.</li>
      <li>Since receiving this &#x27;moisturizer&#x27; a week ago I have found that I really enjoy using it daily.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really help,</li>
      <li>Sanarom gets the job done its the natural way to go!!!</li>
      <li>I used it 4 days ago and my skin is still as soft and shiny as it was the first day.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone, especially older adults who need extra moisture for their skin as they get older.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Sanarom Moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The results are far better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>It seems like it is much more than many of the moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past in that it feels like it is actually healing my facial skin and making it healthier.  </li>
      <li>many creams streroids creams anti fungle and plain itch cream</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to tell my family about it since several are very interested in all natural products.  </li>
      <li>so i decided to put Sanarom on one leg and the steroid cream on the other well in just 4 days putting them on 2x a day the leg with the Sanarom had compleatly gone away with skin smooth  and the leg with the steriode cream was just about gone</li>
      <li>so i thought why no try something new</li>
      <li>When people complain about symptoms like, itch, scraps, super dry skin</li>
      <li>This product has a very strong smell, at least to me.</li>
      <li>my heels&#x3D; now baby soft feet&lt;br</li>
      <li>My 6 year old twins ask for this when they get a scrape or cut.</li>
      <li>Within a couple days it was completely healed.</li>
      <li>Both my son &amp; I have eczema and this has been very helpful with our dry</li>
      <li>I expected it to help but was really surprised at how fast his skin healed up.</li>
      <li>She read on the package that it&#x27;s soothing and healing, so she decided to try it on a red, itchy rash that had just developed on her face.  </li>
      <li>I like how this ointment feels soothing on the broken out spots, and how my skin feels better and the affected areas are calmer in the morning after I&#x27;ve worn the ointment on it overnight.</li>
      <li>and I love that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients, no harsh chemicals or anything dangerous.</li>

<li> but then the dry patches went away by themselves anyway.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m a gutter installer, so my hands are cracked cut and dry.</li>

<li> Not really worth the money, if you ask me.</li>
<li> My 2 year old has eczema behind the backs of her legs</li>

<li> on some recent flare ups, i applied the moisturizer and within a couple days, the eczema patches started to improve instead of progressively get worse.</li>
<li> -mosquito bites&#x3D; healed no more itch</li>
<li> I use it only at night because the smell might be unpleasant to other people if I use it during the day time.</li>
<li> The irritation and redness had cleared up and you could hardly tell it was there.  </li>
<li> I have some exczema issues, and it&#x27;s worse in the&lt;br /&gt;dry weather.</li>
<li> but it leaves horrible splotches and discoloration afterwards.</li>

    <li> I love this natural balm. We are surrounded by so many toxins that it is refreshing to have a natural and effective product to use. The consistency of the balm is nice,and the ever-so-light scent is pleasant.  I have been using it on mosquito bites and occasional scratches I get when gardening.  It is antiseptic as well as moisturizing and healing. The packaging is very nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sanoram healing moisturizer for a week or so.  I have been using it on a rash that I have had for over a year due to diabetes.  The rash is finally going away!  I have also used it on insect bites.  It helps to reduce the stinging.  I like the fact that the procuct is all-natural.  I am avoidng chemicals in makeup and skin care products.  I am very happy with this product and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I got this product and have only used it a little to test it out.  It has such a strong scent, not horrible, just really overwhelming and it lasts and lasts.  I put it on my knuckles and elbows as those areas get the dryest and I try to moisturize them the most.  I usually use Eucerin or Aquafor and feel those do well, but this product left my skin feeling dry and I ended up needing to use lotion soon after, however I could still smell the scent of this throughout the day even after washing my hands several times.</li>
    <li> my eczema problem comes and goes but it leaves horrible splotches and discoloration afterwards. i was at my wit&#x27;s end when nothing helped and then i tried the Sanarom Moisturizer. on some recent flare ups, i applied the moisturizer and within a couple days, the eczema patches started to improve instead of progressively get worse. i also used this on my dry cuticles as well as some minor cuts and it worked great.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but nothing truly special.  I keep the jar in my car because the heat makes is easier to apply. I bought it to help me with my pregnancy-related skin condition. Didn&#x27;t really help, but then the dry patches went away by themselves anyway. Not really worth the money, if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! This moisturizer has won me over. My skin felt so soft and smooth with no irritation at all.  I will definitely keep this on hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this skin treatment to have on hand to use as needed  - it&#x27;s not something I would need to use every day as I don&#x27;t suffer from skin problems. I was so happy a few days ago to have this on hand - my husband had a nasty zit or ingrown hair on his chin and couldn&#x27;t stop messing with it and made it worse - it ended up being more like a sore and prevented him from shaving for several days. Then I remembered I had bought this healing cream and told him to try it. I expected it to help but was really surprised at how fast his skin healed up. Just overnight the improvement was amazing. Within a couple days it was completely healed. Definitely a product to keep on hand just in case - and I love that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients, no harsh chemicals or anything dangerous.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old has eczema behind the backs of her legs we had gone to the doctor several times and recived many creams streroids creams anti fungle and plain itch cream you get over the counter so i thought why no try something new so i decided to put Sanarom on one leg and the steroid cream on the other well in just 4 days putting them on 2x a day the leg with the Sanarom had compleatly gone away with skin smooth  and the leg with the steriode cream was just about gone but had some spots of dryed looking skin still. I can say that i will use Sanarom on my 2 year old myself and would HIGHLY recomend this to friends and other moms frustrated with having there child with dry skin and everything you try only works half way or not at all Sanarom gets the job done its the natural way to go!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the gift! My 6 year old twins ask for this when they get a scrape or cut. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and works so well. I appreciate a great product and the service was exceptional. They emailed to make sure I received it when I was supposed to. Excellent sellers!</li>
    <li> Both my son &amp; I have eczema and this has been very helpful with our dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very cautious about what we put in and on our bodies and the ingredients in Sanarom could not be better if I made it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making such a quality product. You have 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I had to use it as soon as I got home due to a sunburn. Took it right away.</li>
    <li> This ointment comes in a lovely tin so it would make a nice gift. It is not a run-of-the-mill moisturizer! The scent is not flowery, it is reflective of the tea tree oil in the ingredients. When applying, it melts and liquefies really quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy. The really exciting part is how it makes my skin feel. I have problem areas due to rosacea so I have very specific skin care needs. I like how this ointment feels soothing on the broken out spots, and how my skin feels better and the affected areas are calmer in the morning after I&#x27;ve worn the ointment on it overnight.</li>
    <li> I have some exczema issues, and it&#x27;s worse in the&lt;br /&gt;dry weather. This helped with the itchiness within the&lt;br /&gt;first day, and it looks like (third day) the skin (blotchiness/redness/etc.)&lt;br /&gt;is clearing  up. Hopefully this will help with other skin issues in&lt;br /&gt;our household as well...We&#x27;re definitely going to keep experimenting wtih&lt;br /&gt;it on other stuff. that comes up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 67 years old and used the healing balm on one hand to see how it works against dryness from lots of yardwork and the usual inside chores.  I&#x27;m retired, so I&#x27;m outside working in the flower/vegetable beds a lot.  I used it 4 days ago and my skin is still as soft and shiny as it was the first day.  It amazed me that it didn&#x27;t wash away with dish washing, yardwork or the many times I&#x27;ve used soap to wash my hands during the day, but has been well absorbed instead.  I can&#x27;t wait to tell my family about it since several are very interested in all natural products.  I would recommend this product to anyone, especially older adults who need extra moisture for their skin as they get older.</li>
    <li> Sanarom Moisturizer is one of those things you discover and you gotta share. When people complain about symptoms like, itch, scraps, super dry skin you tell them get Sanarom, it works like a miracle.  Do you guys remember the Lever soap commercial, it was good for everybody part; Well this is the equivalent, but as a moisturizer. I dare say it&#x27;s better because it&#x27;s all natural with no weird chemicals. It&#x27;s a paste that melts into your skin without being greasy and it has a slight scent of something you know is good for you. The scent disappears after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the ways I have used Sanarom:&lt;br /&gt;  -moisturized my heels&#x3D; now baby soft feet&lt;br /&gt;  -mosquito bites&#x3D; healed no more itch&lt;br /&gt;  -my daughter scraped her knee&#x3D; scraped healed quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she loves it. I had to hide my bottle until I get another one. I only wish this company would have a carry size for my purse. I highly recommend Sanarom Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a gutter installer, so my hands are cracked cut and dry. This product improved my dry cracked hands. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time but the results are remarkable. I will recommend this product to anyone with skin issues. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This product has a very strong smell, at least to me. I use it when I have an itch that I don&#x27;t want to notice anymore (cause if I notice, I will scratch!). It gets the job done. I use it only at night because the smell might be unpleasant to other people if I use it during the day time.</li>
    <li> I love Sanarom! I&#x27;ve used Sanarom on my terribly dry cracked hands and feet for about one week. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and melts right into your shin. The results are far better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used and I have used them all! It leaves my skin soft and smooth without leaving an oily residue. I would recommend Sanarom to anyone with skin aliments. The results are incrediable!</li>
    <li> Since receiving this &#x27;moisturizer&#x27; a week ago I have found that I really enjoy using it daily. It seems like it is much more than many of the moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past in that it feels like it is actually healing my facial skin and making it healthier.  At nearly 60 years of age keeping ones skin well tended is a necessity to keep the wrinkles and lines away as well as other aging issues. Sanarom balm sure seems to be helping with those tasks with a very pleasant aroma to top it off. Also, as a very unexpected bonus they included some lip balm that has a very nice cooling feeling.  Nice product that I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible...!!! I&#x27;ve had it for a week tops and I have used it for a razor cut. I put it on my face for acne on my chin, dry skin and on my daughter with a sun burn. Everything I tried it out in it healed, practically over night.! I&#x27;m so impressed.!!! I can&#x27;t wait to find out what else I can use this for..!!!!</li>
    <li> So, I just returned from a business trip to Boston. Upon my return, and to my pleasant surprise, Wifli had already shipped out the Sanarom ointment I had ordered just days before.  Coming home from the trip I was a bit sunburned on my face and had chapped lips.  I instantly decided to put Sanarom on my face and Bolibalm on my lips....Voilà after applying both, my face and lips felt great! I have especially liked the Bolibalm lip balm that came with the healing oil.  I would certainly order this product again and would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I had surgery on my wrist several weeks ago, and&lt;br /&gt;while I don&#x27;t still have the bandage on my incision site,&lt;br /&gt;there was still some sensitivity at the site.  I started applying&lt;br /&gt;the Sanarom healing moisturizer to the healing incision&lt;br /&gt;site, and noticed the next day that it wasn&#x27;t as sensitive&lt;br /&gt;when something brushed up against my wrist. I&#x27;m going&lt;br /&gt;to continue to use it there and see if it helps it to heal faster.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> A friend of my wife&#x27;s was visiting from out of town when this moisturizer arrived from Amazon.  She read on the package that it&#x27;s soothing and healing, so she decided to try it on a red, itchy rash that had just developed on her face.  The next day, the rash was much better.  The irritation and redness had cleared up and you could hardly tell it was there.  She asked us to send her a link to the listing so she could order some of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife also likes Sanoram for its moisturizing properties.  She is sensitive to chemicals, so I&#x27;m glad she found something natural that works so well for her.</li>
