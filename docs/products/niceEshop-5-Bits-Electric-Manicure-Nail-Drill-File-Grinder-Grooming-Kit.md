<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter loves it!!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work with press on nails at all. So if that is what you use, there&#x27;s no need to purchase.</li>
    <li> Arrived from China far faster than stated when I ordered. I had high hopes for smoothing sharp or rough nail edges that snag my socks, but this is a very under-powered tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any pressure on the nail with a grinding tool bit stops the motor dead. Bits are very low quality and badly wobble in the chuck. Grinder does fit the hand very well with an easy to hold ON button. I know I&#x27;ll have better access to manage my toes between Diabetic Footcare appointments.</li>
    <li> using it twice a month</li>
    <li> I received this early and was exited to try it... I placed in the batteries and it worked! I stuck in one of the attachments and started to file one of my nails. I apparently was not being careful enough because I had almost burned a hole right through my nail!! ~It hurt very badly. I learned my lesson and kept a close eye on it the whole time. Overall I am very satisfied with this product but do not recomend leaving it around small children.</li>
    <li> I use this on my real nails before I put on my fake nails. But used all the time and works perfect every time.</li>
    <li> I felt like the delivery was taking too long so I wrote a note to the distributor and they wrote back. I failed to notice the item was coming from China. The product was only 5 dollars and change and it was worth the wait. I have rough hands from years of Ironworking. As rough as they are, the nerves at the end of the fingers show no one mercy. This device allows painless cuticle removal and the attachments are very useful. I like it and recommend it. I don&#x27;t use the polisher but for the ladies..it&#x27;s a must!</li>
    <li> This item works really well to bring down my nail. I use this on my toe nails because I have a couple of toe nails that are rough.</li>
    <li> Very little oomph! I guess you get what u pay for</li>
    <li> Is not for professional nails</li>
    <li> Love packaging! Very excited to start using this</li>
    <li> Very convenient.  Don&#x27;t like the fact you have to hold down the pink button to use.  Unless I&#x27;m using it incorrectly.  Seem as though you should be able to push the button down to stay and it works.  However, for the price I won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> It was oki. But me not being a professional I runined my nail and cut in to them too much. oops!</li>
    <li> Works great! I bought this one because one of my friends had one and it lasted her 7 years!!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wanna push my luck but let&#x27;s see! So far so good! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Pretty useless. Buy something with power or don&#x27;t buy anything at all, use a nail file instead.</li>
    <li> Horrible!! Its cheap right?</li>
    <li> good product for the price</li>
    <li> Useless.  It likes a toy for kid.  I already dumped it and not bother to return it.</li>
    <li> The item really deserves its cost. Or, should I say &amp;#34;you got what you paid for&amp;#34; - very mediocre device performance: The bits rotate with wobbling and the grip of the bits is so week that they come out of the device while you are filing your nail.</li>
    <li> I received the Nail Decorator free for testing.  I don&#x27;t think it is built real well and will last too long. The files don&#x27;t stay in very good. But it does file the nail and gets into hard to reach spots</li>
    <li> All I can tell is the product is really worth the price! If you want better, pay more. But I used this for my own nails and acrylics and it works for me. It comes in a lil bag. I just really liked the price.. Thanks to those who actually make them in factories! And fast delivery!</li>
    <li> would have liked more instructions re which tip for what purpose</li>
    <li> Wish I could put negative stars. First, I waited a month for it to ship. Then none of the drill bits will stay in. Still I tried to make it work. Bought this for doing my own acyrilic nails, but it doesn&#x27;t work for that. I made my purchase for only $2.99, and seeing the price has raised, be warned. Save yourself the waiting time and money.</li>
    <li> This works really well for shaping nails and buffing them to a high shine. Great product</li>
    <li> This is about as underpowered as the price would indicate.  It barely has enough power to do the job, and then only if you are very patient, and use a light touch.  But at least it is cheaply enough made, to be disposable.</li>
    <li> Timely shipping, good price, and it all worked. Will do business again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Was only able to use once</li>
    <li> Cute and convenient for nail care.  My family loves it.  You can even use it to groom your favorite pet.</li>
    <li> I have three of these little drills and they all work perfect. I just love them.&lt;br /&gt;Order more than one at a time.</li>
    <li> A bit on the weak side.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of money. It does not file well at all and the file attachments is not properly secured or stable when filing. It is not electric it runs by batteries which does not offer enough power to get the job done</li>
    <li> Great service and product!</li>
    <li> A few of the heads came broken.  The motor is not strong enough to use on thick toenails.  You get what you pay for with this item.</li>
    <li> I got mine today. I&#x27;ve bought one of these from Wal-Mart before but for a little more money. But with not the same style and one different tip but was just a brush. Only thing I did not like about this was the actually device sticker was kinda wore which made me think that it was used. But the tips looked fine. I wiped it down with an alcohol pad. Tried it on my nails toes and hand and it did pretty good. For the price and quality it was a good buy. Shipping kind of took a bit but really not to long. I order on the 18th of april I believe  and got it today may 4th And I live in South Carolina US so really not that long.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work very well and it almost stopped working after the first time using it.</li>
    <li> Great little drill! Works great on the pre work when I wane remove gel polish! A lot of strength for such a small batterie powered and inexpensive thing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised at how well this works! The speed is pretty good too, not too fast and not too slow. I have a damaged toe nail which grows out thick. I was looking for something to file down my nail in the summer and this has worked pretty well. Just make sure you don&#x27;t file down to low because it will hurt. You definitely can&#x27;t beat the price! It did take a while to get in the mail but overall it was still worth the price. The quality itself isn&#x27;t the best but it&#x27;ll do the job. Overall I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The unit came quickly and the price is great but I guess thisis a case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely underpowered and not what we neede.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly,  Just as described.</li>
    <li> I should have believed the reviews.  It is okay for fingernails NOT NOT for toe nails that are in bad shape.  My bad.  Gave to my daughter.</li>
    <li> works awesome, cheap priced, and arrived early</li>
    <li> Very helpful when getting &amp;#34;mani&amp;#34;s &amp;#34; with my daughters</li>
    <li> Not bad at all for the low discounted price. My daughters are going to love it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work quite as good as I thought it would. Bits fly out of end of handle.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do and not at a bad price. :)</li>
    <li> Good everything works just wish it came with a nicer case for it</li>
    <li> This was a total waste of money. Tips won&#x27;t even stay in the device. Its totally true you get what you pay for so don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price.</li>
    <li> Received it before i expected and for the price you get a fair working nail file. Gets the basic job done!</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than I expected.  I already have one other set which I currently use.  I have not started to use this new one. It is working fine.</li>
    <li> Came fast but every time you put pressure on it ,it stops. So it takes a really long time to file a nail. @_@</li>
    <li> Not very high powered. But works well</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was cheap. I didn&#x27;t expect that much for how much I spent, but it does suck. The drills it comes with are cheaply made and hardly work. I have acrylic nails and it doesn&#x27;t work at all to file them, it barley makes a dent. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! It was sent sooner than expected and it came in a plain white Ziploc bag and a little purple bag to hold it. It was strange how nit was sent, but it explains why this product was so cheap. I would not recommend this product to anyone whether you have acrylic nails or use this for your natural nails. BY FAR THE WORST BUY EVER!!!!!</li>
    <li> cheaply made which broke easy but god product for only a couple dollars! :)</li>
    <li> This item was great it didn&#x27;t take long to ship it&#x27;s just that when u put the nail file in the hole at the top, the nail file tip also came out it would just slide out. Also the top would not stay connected to the bottom half. And occasionally it would stop working and general, so I had to take the batteries out and put them back in. (Double A Battiers). But it is good to use when you are first starting out and the tips worked great. But I do not recomend this for anyone who want to do professional nails.</li>
    <li> working great with duracell batteries,at the beginning i tried with a defferent one and there was not enough power&lt;br /&gt;doing really good job&lt;br /&gt;!!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when I received the manicure set because it was not electric but battery operated. Also the attachments do not stay in, and fall out during use.  No directions were included.</li>
    <li> Well worth 2.99 + free shipping. I have to get used to using it. More powerful than it looks. If you&#x27;re not careful you end up filing too much off &amp; gouging the nail. I think I&#x27;ll practice on my toes before I do my nails again. I love the felt, rounded snap on that shines the nail. I can use that now without messing up my nails.</li>
    <li> Works great with new batterys</li>
    <li> Works great! All the attachments are very nice quality. Although I will admit I can&#x27;t really tell which is for what. I&#x27;ve used this about 8-10 times now for home manicures, so far no complaints! Love the price, love doing my nails at home for cheap.</li>
    <li> As an old guy, my toenails are pretty tough (and ugly).  I used to have to file &amp; file just to keep them in pretty good shape; then my back was usually stiff from bending over so long.  This little item makes keeping toenails trim quck and easy.  The various tools do a good job and certainly can&#x27;t be beat for the price.  Delivery takes a while (maybe a month?)  but when it arrives, you will be glad you ordered it.  And the quality is surprisingly good.</li>
    <li> broke the second time i tried to use it.&lt;br /&gt;i put batteries in and next thing iknow is that it never started working</li>
    <li> Had initial problem but got it working and it&#x27;s been great</li>
    <li> Perfect.... arrived quickly.  Will use it on my next my pedicure.</li>
    <li> Do the bits come in a different package? I only received the filer and not the bits!!</li>
    <li> this product is not perfect but gets the job done. I had to buy different bits for acrylics. The ones it comes with are not abrasive enough. One more annoying thing is that the bits will slide out so you have to position it a certain way to avoid this</li>
    <li> Product did not work and even looks cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Very unbalanced and not even worth the little bit of money it costs. I don&#x27;t even try to use it any more.</li>
    <li> works perfect, and great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why others have given this little gizmo such a low rating because I think it&#x27;s pretty great.  Even though they said I wouldn&#x27;t get it until early to mid August, I got it within 2 weeks.  It comes in a nice little storage pouch and has all the bits you need to do your nails.  For a battery operated nail file it has quite a bit of power.  Really, at such a great price, what do you have to lose.</li>
    <li> Very good dremill for the price. Works well , did not bog down or get hot for me. My 13 year old daughter just loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Okay, this was $3.19, and it works!! I didn&#x27;t know you could make anything work for $3.19!!! It&#x27;s a great little thing! Come with lots of tools, fun and easy to use! Again, $3.19, I guess I&#x27;ll throw it out when it breaks!</li>
    <li> Watch out for this one.. I was using it with new batteries and it started slowing dowN and I noticed it melted! Not worth it!!</li>
    <li> nice little drill good for price u spent not so power full but what do u expect what u pay is what u get and it works good and gets the job done</li>
    <li> Very good for taking out corns out of feet and toes .</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work...waste of my time and money.</li>
    <li> I was replacing one of these under a different brand name (Trim) and it is exactly the same but does not perform nearly as well. Which is really curious because I have to think it is manufactured by the same company with just a different name painted on at the end. Anyway, much less torque, and no regular fitting with the emery board/sandpaper on it. ??? I&#x27;m keeping it but it won&#x27;t be nearly as useful as my old one, I doubt it will last as long either.</li>
    <li> This would be decent for the money if not for a major problem.  If you&#x27;re not putting pressure in the direction that the heads are inserted, they will slide out.  This makes the big pink one useless because it is designed to grind in the direction of the angle, which is away from the device.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, mine only came with 4 heads and no directions.</li>
    <li> Bought the original yrs ago and used it as a nail tool then a dremel for crafts&lt;br /&gt;replaced it for one for my nails works as good as it/they did 10 yrs ago</li>
    <li> SOO CHEAP. DONT BUY AT ALL.</li>
    <li> Works ok for now and then use but not for daily use.</li>
    <li> On time love everything was their and works wonderful</li>
    <li> Good little kit. Great for removing excess skin. Nice on feet also. The motor seems to pack a good little punch. The only downside is that even after 1 minute of use it kind of smells like its burning, mostly likely the motor being overpowered.</li>
    <li> slim and easy to handle. thank you.</li>
    <li> I could Not be happier with this purchase!! Paid $2.+ for this item, and works so good for filing down overgrown cuticles on my hands and feet... Just the right speed and coarseness for doing so safely at home!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> perfect for those little chips and breaks while away from home,a must for my purse!</li>
    <li> it was damaged when i received it</li>
    <li> I was able to review the niceEshop(TM) 5 Bits Electric Manicure Nail Drill File Grinder Grooming Kit for a fraction of the cost for my unbiased review. I am not one to go to salons or nail parlors, I prefer to do it myself and save the money I would have to spend on an overpriced service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! When I put batteries in this nail tool, it was ready to go, it filed my nails amazingly!! It&#x27;s s;eel design makes it easy to hold and to operate with one hand. It comes with 5 different bits, you can do anything a professional can! It&#x27;s made sturdy, to last use after use. I highly recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is written solely by me (Samantha Stevens), this is my own personal opinion/review.</li>
    <li> wow...for that price, it does the job!</li>
    <li> I intended to make this a gift but item arrived in a clear plastic baggie.  Not attractive in and of itself.  I waited so long for the item I didn&#x27;t think it was coming...and it literally was on the slow boat from China (via snail mail with a chinese return address)</li>
    <li> So this is a cheap add on item with Amazon.  What you get is a cheap add on item from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because technically it does do what it claims.  However, even with changing out the batteries with freshly charged AA&#x27;s you still have a low powered gadget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work ok for occasional finger nail work...but since I do not do anything to my finger nails beside clipping I am not qualified to render judgment.</li>
    <li> Terrible!  Bought to sculpt acrylic nails and it overheated within 4 minutes.  If you cannot afford a better/professional filer, I would wait until you can.  In the interim, I&#x27;ve taken to using my fathers rotary tool which works much better than this item until I can get a better filer.</li>
    <li> would not work even bought new batteries  still no workee</li>
    <li> It came in as expecting</li>
    <li> Would have been nice had it come with instructions.  Took a lot longer to arrive than I expected to.  But once I figured out how to get batteries in it, it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> Easy, inexpensive, handy</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because of the price compared to value. At this price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but it&#x27;s actually pretty good. The body is heavy-gauge plastic and the attachment bits work well. It&#x27;s not as powerful as a commercial grade device but is perfectly fine for home use.</li>
    <li> Works great. No complaints.</li>
    <li> In their own description, they say it only takes, what, 5-10 business days? It took almost the full time amazon said it would. My only other complaint is that the little instruction paper that came with it is just a small copied piece of paper and you can&#x27;t see what the images are that are being described for each individual piece. But, it works as intended, so I can&#x27;t complain too bad.</li>
    <li> the order arrived safely</li>
    <li> I actually bought it for my guinea pig&#x27;s nails and it seems to work good for them. It is not very strong but that is why I bought it. I did test it on my nail first and it was okay.</li>
    <li> For the price this little tool is powerful and works!</li>
    <li> Horrible shape and the head selection is limited. The speed leaves my nails feeling like I just put them over fire!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about how amazing this is for filing down toe nails. Wife tried using it on her toe nails and it&#x27;s not strong enough at all. Wife was hoping to use it on acrylic nails so she can fill them in. If this isn&#x27;t strong enough for toe nails, it won&#x27;t work on her acrylics. However, I should have known since it is just a small battery operated device. Wasn&#x27;t quite as good as what the reviews I read said it was.</li>
    <li> Great item for the price! Used it only for a bit but seems legit if def buy again</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do what you want. It actually doors nothing to the nail enhancements.</li>
    <li> Had a little problem with it. But all is well. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I received this. It works way better than a more expensive one that I have bought before. Only problem Is that the bit attachments wouldn&#x27;t stay in. I contacted the seller and they sent me another one immediately! I guess I just had a bad one before. Love this and the drill power that it has. I highly recommend this product and this seller!</li>
    <li> I got it a few days ago, and I love it! It&#x27;s perfect! It&#x27;s just like it says and it&#x27;s pretty powerful for being battery powered.</li>
    <li> Does not work that well on gel nails</li>
    <li> Love this keeps my nails filed down great</li>
    <li> Not bad at all took a omg time to get here but the price u can&#x27;t beat</li>
    <li> Mine arrived early, but it does not work... And I also didn&#x27;t get all 5 Bits that it shows...</li>
    <li> very awesome thing to have! this drill is so nice and powerful! it doesn&#x27;t hurt when it is resting on your hand, like other plastic drills, shipping is good and it was at  a very good price! it also came with a nice pouch to put it in!!!! great buy!</li>
    <li> Fantastic Amazon Trader / experience. Highly Reccomend.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have thick nails on a few of my toes, and use &#x27;one&#x27; tool to keep them thinner.(Don&#x27;t use that tool on other nails. You can transfer the fungi) I use some of the others to keep the dry flaky skin away. I will never have a pedi so this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I appreciate what a nice job it does on nails.  Low cost too.</li>
    <li> Item came quickly. Once I put the batteries in and turned it on I was very dissapointed, the &amp;#34;bit&amp;#34; spins very unevenly. There is no way that you can file anything with this.</li>
    <li> This product eliminates going to the salon to spend a bunch of money. I use this myself and helps me keep my nails looking flawless. It&#x27;s very easy to use so you won&#x27;t take several tries before you get it right! I love my little money saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review!</li>
    <li> You can tell this was made cheaply, but it seems as though it will get the job done. Going to get nails today, to try it out!</li>
    <li> Nice unit, as described. Wish there  were more attachments for it.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for leaving a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as described.  Once the batteries are installed, it doesn&#x27;t feel so flimsy.  It&#x27;s great for me since I have trouble reach my toenails and can&#x27;t bends my legs all the way due to knee injuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issues I saw with it was there were no directions nor arrows on how to install the batteries.  Normally you can tell by the interior layout, but in this item, both ends inside were the same.  So, I had to install them once and then try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the battery channel the spring is loose and can fall out.  Make sure you&#x27;re careful not to lose it or it won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments stay in place and spin at a good speed to make clean, smooth movements.  It works on nails very well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more than worth the price I paid!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Battery powered and seems to discharge rather fast but does a good job while powered up,,remember to turn off after use because it seems ti still use battery if left turned on. Great product for the equally great price</li>
    <li> If you need a cheap way to do your nails, you have came to the right place! This came ahead of time, requires only two AA batteries, which don&#x27;t come with it. Great for Calais, don&#x27;t press too hard or it will get hot on your nails or skin. Love the nail buffer, it makes my nails so smooth. Only downfall is the tips will fall out if not held right, it be better if they locked in. Overall I love this product and it&#x27;s affordable! Will be ordering from them in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome and great price.  Would highly recommend.  Has worked wonders on my husbands toes.</li>
    <li> got this kit for my wife mothers day gift...she loves it better then a box of chocolates thanks</li>
    <li> Not bad at all for the price... It&#x27;s not great like a professional one, but it gets the job done. Some of the parts didn&#x27;t fit as well as others, you had to work at it a little to get them in, but over all not bad for a home kit.</li>
    <li> Put fresh new batteries in. They died after 2 fingers.  Put more in and they died again.  Product is horrible. Would have never bought if known this was how it was. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Cheap but works fine for occasional home use.</li>
    <li> The inserts are a little hard to get in initially. You really have to work and &amp;#34;wiggle&amp;#34; to get them in. Not a fantastic product, but ok</li>
    <li> Works well with my nails both finger and toes. Easy to use and no cord to  plug in and get in the way. I can do my nails while watching TV. Would recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Overall the product was fine. There was only one problem, which is that some times the filers come out when in rotation. Now it did take a very long time to ship. I actually forgot I bought it by the time it came in.</li>
    <li> Weak product.  Does not hold up and seems to be for a child.</li>
    <li> Shipping is really slow!&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s worth the wait it does a good job (:</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool! At this price, you&#x27;d better grab one before they&#x27;re all gone, or you will regret it. I put mine to work as soon as it was delivered. It takes 2 AA batteries, which I always keep on hand, so getting started was a breeze. You attach whichever tool tip you want to use, then just press the button and hold it and the tool tip rotates. Let up on the button and it stops. Easy. It also will stop if you apply too much pressure, so there&#x27;s not much danger of doing any real damage accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this tool mainly for two things -- one for buffing the ridges out of my fingernails, and the other for grinding away and thinning a toenail that has plagued me with fungus for years now. I&#x27;ve tried everything on toenail fungus, even prescription drugs which are really hard on your body and take years to see any real results. So I wanted this tool to get rid of some of the unattractive thick toenail so I could apply tea tree oil to the infected nail and it would actually be able to soak in better and relieve my toenail fungus. So far so good. It&#x27;s still going to take quite a while for the tea tree oil to work its magic, but this little manicure/pedicure tool set has already done its job for me. I would gladly have paid double this price, it&#x27;s worth every penny. If you&#x27;re plagued with toenail fungus too, and need something to thin your unsightly toenail so your medication of choice can reach the infected area easier, you should definitely try this tool.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re paying for what you buy. cheap and crappy. the shipping took forever also. I think you should spend a little more money on something better.</li>
    <li> Great power with full batteries.</li>
    <li> Absolutely 100% what I expected ! Fits perfectly in hand, and lets you do so much detail with your nails. Most handheld tools such as this, run too fast and can mess up your nails in no time, but this manicure set runs just right for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Holy cow!  That thing is like a minature battery powered buzz saw.  VERY well satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this products especially considering how inexpensive it is. I am a serial nail biter -Have been for 23 years but this is definitely helping me to keep my hands and toes beautiful while I quit the habit- great buy!</li>
    <li> It does the job that I expected it to do and shipping was very fast, much different from the reviews that I read.</li>
    <li> this came nicely packaged...but...does not have any power....pretty much unable to use</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve ordered.  The first is still going strong, but I was so happy with it at the shockingly low price that I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to lay in a spare, in case they become unavailable.</li>
    <li> I brought this one to replace one I had for over 7yrs. It works good. I normally don&#x27;t do my own nails but when I do this comes in very handy.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Light and manageable. I&#x27;m amazed at how well my nails looked when I finish.</li>
    <li> Cheap do not but the bits fly off and hit you or someone in the face.</li>
    <li> its good for maybe teens to use , but not someone who is a nail freak like myself</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. No complaints. Would like to mention that these things make great gifts.</li>
    <li> Works great! Will buy one for all my girls for a stocking stuffer! Price is great. 2 week delivery</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be like the professionals use, but it does what I want it to do.  I can buff my nails finger and toes and it helps thin down a couple of townails.</li>
    <li> Poor product ... Barely works... Such bad product I lost it and didn&#x27;t care</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick big toe nails and this works like a mini dremel and helps me keep them under control.</li>
    <li> Does a good job for its size and price.</li>
    <li> This niceEshop 5 Bits Electric Manicure Nail Drill File Grinder Grooming Kit is a handy tool for nail care. It works similar to the craft rotary tools but at a fraction of the cost. This comes in a lavender satin storage pouch with a drawstring top closure. The tool is lightweight and runs on 2 AA batteries (not included) and comes with 5 different tips. I like this for filing my fingernails after trimming them and for smoothing the nicks on the nail tips. This works much faster and does a more even job than using an emery board, and is easier for me to maneuver with arthritis in my hands. There was no instruction sheet, but it was easy to figure out. I just guessed at what each of the tips would work best for which job. The AA batteries provide plenty of power to get the job done in a short time. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. It&#x27;s a good value for what you get.</li>
    <li> The human version of Pedi-Paws. I was looking for an instrument to grind down my sturdy nails. I found it in this Electric Manicure Nail Drill File Grinder Grooming Kit. Works for me!  ;-)</li>
    <li> I find the grinding stone too soft and iwears too quickly.</li>
    <li> This came in a plastic bag, with a TORN &amp;#34;satin&amp;#34; case.  The tips DON&#x27;T FIT in the end of the item.  The instructions were FADED - all of the pictures looked like silhouettes - in dark gray and black!  Put batteries in it and it WON&#x27;T TURN ON!  I wasn&#x27;t able to use it at all!  SO disappointed.  Not even worth sending back to China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
    <li> Great item and great price!</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE DOESN&#x27;T WORK GOOD AT ALL!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but to be honest it doesn&#x27;t look high quality, you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom. Came ahead of the estimate time of arrival which is a plus! Works very good and the customer service is very good also. The only suggest I like to make is the boxing for shipping, you might wanna put it on a small carton box or inside some more bubble bags cause this is an all plastic and kind of delicate item, just to prevent for not breaking it on the travel. Otherwise is very good for the price!!</li>
    <li> Product came on time, packaged well and is as described by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item was really easy to use, you just need two double A batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend it for anyone- it&#x27;s a nice product!</li>
    <li> great my wife uses this thing everyday but not on her nails but on her craft things she just loves it.and didn&#x27;t cost a lot and received it in a matter of days it seemed.thanks</li>
    <li> It came in exactly 10 days. I would definitely recommend this for beginners like myself. The only down side about it is that it&#x27;s pretty slow... but, it does the job. I just wish it came with instructions for the different heads &amp; what they each do.</li>
    <li> Only paid like 3 bucks for this, took 2 weeks to get here but it works good. I got it to file my nail down to apply anti fungal medicine and it does it&#x27;s job, pretty quick too.</li>
    <li> CAN NOT BELIEVE  THE QUALITY  WELL WORYH THE PRICE</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work  it&#x27;s junk sorry I wasted my  money and time it stops turning while trying  my nails files won&#x27;t stay in don&#x27;t recomen this product at all don&#x27;t wasteyour time and money</li>
    <li> Pos when you turn it on the tools vibrate out. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I received it with no attachments. Came only with the mange grinder piece and the satin bag. Well not repeat buy.</li>
    <li> 2 issues:&lt;br /&gt;The inner drum wasn&#x27;t centered, so the attachment stems rubbed on the opening. One file attachment&#x27;s stem was too thin and could not be seated firmly.</li>
    <li> Good item for the price... If you don&#x27;t want to spend lots of money this helps a lot</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS. IT HAS SO MANY USES. I USE IT FOR GROOMING MY BUNNIES AND MY OWN NAILS AND EVEN FOR FILING OTHER THINGS THAT NEED FILING!</li>
    <li> Works great and for the price, if it breaks in a month I won&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> I received the item WAY faster than what was expected. It was expected to be here between 2/25 - 3/13 and it arrived on 2/13. Works wonderful, perfect for nails or even small arts and crafts like sanding down small wood edges. Can&#x27;t wait to use this on my acrylic nails. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a awesome tool to have for ur nails! It requires two AA batteries, but hey it&#x27;s worth having.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice little tool. Comes with. Lots of attachments and a nice little carrying pouch.</li>
    <li> The item came as described and shipping was quicker than projected. The item does not arrive in box or with directions. It arrives in a satin pouch inside of a plastic zip lock bag. This did not affect the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Works great. Very slow shipping.</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot of power. It takes a long time to grind my nails. But it works, and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> no power, battery operated</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I tried every battery I have. I even recharged my batteries and it still did not work. Maybe it is the motor. I do not know. But it was cheap so I do not care that it does not work.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.</li>
    <li> piece of absolute s**t. Really, don&#x27;t waste the mailman&#x27;s time delivering it.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all for the price... It&#x27;s not great like a professional one, but it gets the job done. Some of the parts didn&#x27;t fit as well as others, you had to work at it a little to get them in, but over all not bad for a home kit. Only has one level to function on it but it works great</li>
    <li> Everything came within a day the reason i took away a star is because of the batteries. Also, it takes double A batteries for anyone who needs to know :)</li>
    <li> Delivery was very fast product works great</li>
    <li> I got the package with the attachments missing. I was offered a 40% discount in a product that worked 0% of the time. I am waiting for the replacement as of now, I hope its worth the wait.</li>
    <li> lasted about twenty minutes. you get what you pay for! :(</li>
    <li> Much better than nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Pretty useless with a very weak motor.</li>
    <li> this is surprisingly sturdy. it worked really well to file down old outgrown acrylics and get my nails ready for the next set.</li>
    <li> I struggled at first to put the two white pieces together. It looked cheap indeed, but it worked really good.&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated after reading some of the reviews, but I didn&#x27;t find it underpowered. The power was sufficient to do the job and it worked wonderfully on my nails and removed dead skin too. I just don&#x27;t know what to do with the pink piece as it is huge and rough on my nails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not quite powerful as I had hoped but serviceable and if it were more powerful I might burn myself. I certanly don&#x27;t have to be careful of that with this unite.&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it was going to be. A nail file sands my nails better than what this does. But I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> has absolutely no power.</li>
    <li> I am shocked at how much I like this set. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations because it was so inexpensive but honestly, this is a great little manicure set. I don&#x27;t like spending money on salon manicures and this set really is great for cleaning the cuticles and polishing nails quickly and with salon results. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This electric manicure tool is great for novice, at home use. It is cordless and comes with 5 attachments and a satin carrying case. It takes 2 AA batteries which are not included. The attachments are easily changeable and offer a variety of uses for shaping, filing, smoothing and buffing during at home manicures and pedicures. I would not compare this to a professional one, but it does the job for my simple needs. It’s speed is enough to get the job done and not fear filing too much nail off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked to receive some type of instructions or recommendations on what to use each tool for but there were no instructions included. If you are looking for a simple, easy to use tool for personal use at home, I would recommend this product. I was glad to be able to receive this product at a reduction in price for the purpose of testing, for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to my grooming supplies. I can easily file and shape my nails. Work on those hard to reach toenails that like to give me problems. It works easily and effectively to grind or file what needs to be. Its a good product at a good price. I would have bought it even without the discount i receved for sharing my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Its not too strong but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Took a few tries to get it to work. After that it worked fine. Wish it would&#x27;ve come with instructions. I&#x27;m a beginner and instructions would have been very helpful.</li>
    <li> LOVE It...it does take long. For my toe nail I figured out I&#x27;d only need the smaller of the two cylinder beads...the flat top and the edge... Works wonderfully on a toe nail fungus but I do clean my shower daily before use...and use this every other day and also use Lamisil for my skin and toes and Cyclops Nail Medication Polish to treat the fungus.  Nail conditions very but I think this is the accepted treatment for a fungus.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Powerful.  Takes other bits.  Maybe I&#x27;ll use it when I do my wood carving.</li>
    <li> Cheap little piece but very efficient,love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I had one for about 8 years before it stopped working and have wanted another one. It was a great price and works amazing.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a drill file before this is a good starting point. It&#x27;s cheaply made and cheaply priced so don&#x27;t expect miracles here but it does work and if all you want is something that makes it easier to get gel nail polish out this is good enough.</li>
    <li> Took a while to receive so I stopped checking the mail. I received the drill about two days ago and it was just as I expected! I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the drill pieces and found nothing wrong with the packaging. Overall I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works great but the bits are too big. Long battery life.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to put the attachments in the end of this...can someone tell me how?</li>
    <li> Awesome sauce! I love this set and my nails look great!</li>
    <li> It came on time, but it was a cruddy drill and would turn on but didn&#x27;t really DO anything when I used it 😠</li>
    <li> Surprisingly great! I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as it does. Of course it&#x27;s no dremel but it does the job, even on my thick nails.</li>
    <li> I hate this product! It stops and goes. And when you add pressure to it, it stops. I&#x27;m super disappointed in it!!! It doesn&#x27;t work! And I regret buying it. Waist of money!</li>
    <li> I received this quicker than expected from China.  Works well for the quality it is.  Of course, I wasn&#x27;t expecting something high powered because at this price point, why would you?  It&#x27;s powerful enough for most uses.  If you do press hard you will stop the attachment from turning since it is lower powered; other than that works good.</li>
    <li> Low power doesn&#x27;t file anything off</li>
    <li> I bought this because I do my acrylic nails at home which saves much more money, It works decently and gives great results!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! I got a bad pedicure and had a fungus growing as a result. With in minutes my nail was back to normal and was able to apply the anti-fungus treatment. Wonderful product for anti-fungus. Totally worth price. Picture is after use and is night and day comparison. Use the metal one first then the pink one.</li>
    <li> very cheap looking product, with no instructions</li>
    <li> After waiting 21 days for delivery the nail drill file fail to work, it has no power and stops when getting in contact with the nails also it overheat and the batteries need to be removed from the nail drill. Will not recommended to anybody.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, you need double A batteries it took a while, to come but it did.</li>
    <li> The picture looked better than the actual product.</li>
    <li> Great product !!! Works well and comes in a cute little bag to hold everything together !!!</li>
    <li> I was very suspicious getting this product bc of its low price compared to market price. I received it relatively fast and so far (been using it for one month already) it perfectly does the job! Would recommend</li>
    <li> really nice, don&#x27;t know how to use all of them but it seen good</li>
    <li> I already had a small manicure set to keep my nails in shape, but wanted another one that was a little stronger.  This unit is stronger, but the reason for only 3 stars is that you have to hold down the button to keep it running; which is very awkward when you&#x27;re holding it.  My other unit has a no/off switch.</li>
    <li> I liked it but the pink file was a little rough</li>
    <li> Did not work well at all on my gnarly toe nails. Ended up getting the much more powerful plug in drill that is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this might work for a women&#x27;s fingernails.</li>
    <li> This is a great drill. Even though it didn&#x27;t come with instructions it&#x27;s pretty self-explanatory. I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems that people were complaining about. My drill works perfectly fine and I only spent about $3 on it.</li>
    <li> Decent quality to price and published details</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Files broke first time</li>
    <li> Considering the price, I&#x27;m thrilled</li>
    <li> This set is fantastic. I have natural healthy nails that I manicure myself. This set makes it so easy.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Well worth the money</li>
    <li> works as expected. won&#x27;t last too long</li>
    <li> The product was quick to come so seller is awesome with that but you get what you pay for. The tips won&#x27;t stay in. Keeps falling out as I&#x27;m using it</li>
    <li> Works great! I usually don&#x27;t enjoy doing my manicure but with this thing it&#x27;s so much faster and more fun. I think I may buy few more of these for friends and family.</li>
    <li> this works perfect  for my nails. Great product</li>
    <li> Was not able to secure the barrel (battery compartment) from the gate due to defective twist lock.  I literally had to hold the two barrels together to turn it on.  The motor is obviously too weak to be effective on any nail.  As soon as ANY pressure is put on the tip, it bogs it down.  I was also unable to change the tips (it jammed after placing the first bit).  Sadly, only used once (for about 5 seconds).  TRASH!</li>
    <li> Terrible. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> This little thing has some power. perfect for the price</li>
    <li> The second I touch a nail with it at all, the file stops spinning. The motor keeps running, but nothing really grips the file to keep it spinning with ANY amount of resistance even really light. I wanted this to work so badly and reviews looked so good. I am disappointed. This is one product I wish I had paid more. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> really easy to use. love it</li>
    <li> Strength is too strong</li>
    <li> Works great.  Neat tool to ahve around the house.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> not what I was expecting it work weoo onfinger nail nore then toes wich is fine with me.</li>
    <li> Works great and perfect for shaping</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price.  Great for freshening the nails between nail appointments.</li>
    <li> I just got mine and I love it. It works great for what I payed. It&#x27;s not cheap. It does its job.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
    <li> This is very cheap. No power at all. You touch it to your nails and it stops. I just barley touch my nails to file them and it will stop.</li>
    <li> Works okay, but you need to hold the button down all the time. And depending on far down you hold it determines how fast the tip rotates. So unless you have a very steady hand, it rotates unevenly and can be very frustrating. Would have preferred one or two speeds and not having to hold the button down while in use.</li>
    <li> Not very sturdy, pretty flimsy equipment but gets the job done, in a very time consuming manner</li>
    <li> This works so great.....</li>
    <li> Awesome little device for next to nothing in terms of cost!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product. I bought it in hopes that I could remove my shellac nail polish with it. Not only is it unable to do that, the slightest pressure of any of the attachments against my nails would stop it from rotating. I was able to file my nails with it, but only if I was extremely careful to not push against my nails with any pressure at all. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Everything is fine except the power seems to be a little weak. If I had chance to buy again, I would look for one with stronger power.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even come with directions or anything just comes in a small bag</li>
    <li> Does nothing at all to buff your nails. I was hoping for a faster, easier buffing method than those 4 or 6 sided blocks you buy at the dollar tree, but I found this was just a waste of my money and time.</li>
    <li> I bought because of the great price and fast shipping but some of the add-ons kept stopping when I would apply them to my nails which was disappointing so I&#x27;m back to using a regular nail file. Maybe it was just my product that was doing this.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Used. Didnt even work. The parts didnt fit. They fall out so can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> This might sound a bit gay but I like grooming my own nails and I&#x27;m pretty meticulous when it comes to my nails .It took me about 2 days to figure out how this works but when I did, I instantly get hooked! It&#x27;s a nice product all in all.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. But dies and isn&#x27;t powerful not even enough to finish one hand.</li>
    <li> This product is preference for beginners. You do have to be careful that the bit doesn&#x27;t fall out while you are using it.</li>
    <li> This product is kind of cheaply made and not great just ok</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my daughter, She stated it was a very good buy and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It is very cute and works great! Thought it wouldn&#x27;t work but it does! And the price is great!</li>
    <li> works good wish it had a little more power. you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Very unhappy im not sure what happened but it came in smashed like someone ran it over and backed up and hit it again</li>
    <li> Worked we&#x27;ll the first time. Second time I used this drill, I put it away and an hour later it had melted where the battery opening is. It was extremely hot to touch so I took it apart so it wouldn&#x27;t further melt. It melted the opening so the batteries can&#x27;t even be taken out. You get what you pay for, but not even worth the $2 and change</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Loved that it came in it&#x27;s own storage bag and it was in my favorite color purple.</li>
    <li> it does the job okay. I have two complaint:&lt;br /&gt;1) when you stick the head in and start grinding - its not very centered, so the grinding isnt very smooth (rotation isnt centered).&lt;br /&gt;2) the tip sometimes calls off in the middle of grinding, which can be troublesome if you were doing it on top of your toilet :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, for the price, its okay, i dont regret buying it.</li>
    <li> When the product description on this said &amp;#34;Features a high speed rotation powerful enough to trim and shape tough acrylics&amp;#34; I guess I was just hoping for a little better quality and a little more power out of this 5 bit electric manicure set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works okay for using on your own natural nails, but it didn&#x27;t have much of an affect on acrylic nails whatsoever. I ended up going to the salon because this tool just wasn&#x27;t powerful enough. Also, it came with a purple bag to hold the tool and all the bits in &amp; when I went to cinch it shut, the drawstring come completely out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as the old saying goes, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, so I guess I just bought an overpriced nail file that&#x27;s just going to sit in a drawer.</li>
    <li> Did not come with instructions on what each end is for. Or how to use it.</li>
    <li> Got it for my gf she loved it you should send with batteries thats my only complaint</li>
    <li> I did like the it. It&#x27;s like a toy.</li>
    <li> I love it! It came a week early. I popped in a couple AA batteries, and it worked great! The bits are pretty nice, didn&#x27;t come with any paper or instructions, but I&#x27;m sure google will help.(: Overall really satisfied!</li>
    <li> Got it, kids love it for their hello kitty nails</li>
    <li> Does what is intended, 4 star rating as the construction is decently made.</li>
    <li> For the price I cant really complain. I think I did read that It didn&#x27;t come with instructions but it would be good either way if it did. Myself, I&#x27;m new to doing acrylic nails. I used to change nail polish pretty much everyday so I figured i&#x27;d leave my nails alone if I had acrylics (it worked for a little while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to really use it because sometimes I feel like it works and then it doesn&#x27;t? I was excited to get it so I would cut down the filing and buffing time but it didn&#x27;t. Most of the time the regular nail file worked better and faster than this. Sometimes the bits even fall out while your trying to use it even when its pushed in all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I absolutely hated was how it was packaged, I think sometimes I&#x27;m more excited about how something is packed than the actual product. This one was horrible but good thing is that it didn&#x27;t come damaged and it is extremely light weight.</li>
    <li> I bought it for the low price but it&#x27;s not powerful enough. Dr. Scholls toenail treatment comes with a set of files and seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I use the Grinder for anti-fungal treatments.  That is, I&#x27;m male.  So far I have only used the diamond-cut head (the thing that looks like a spear in the picture).  If you press this Grinder against a toe nail, you will get a lot of white dust.  The object is to make your nail both thin and absorbent.  Then apply anti-fungal medicine daily to the thin nail.  Keep the nail thin and abraded.  I am still on the original two batteries, so the batteries are NOT the cheapest possible.  I cannot recommend this Grinder for anyone who is trying to beautify their nails, as I have not tried all the heads, nor have I sought beautify toenails.  The metal spear does reduce the thickness of any nail (not so fast as to be dangerous, but fast enough to make white dust), making it essential for any anti-fungal treatment that is trying to penetrate a normal-density nail.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful nail device that more than meets my expectations.  Thanks to an efficient seller.</li>
    <li> delivered as promised</li>
    <li> Not enough power, you know what I mean? Cheap really</li>
    <li> SO far so good. I just got batteries for it and everything works (I haven&#x27;t actually tried it on my nail) unfortunately I got two small barrels instead of the metal callous tool I was expecting that is why I am not giving 5 stars. Also I did not get any instructions and had to refer to this webpage after I received the product to figure out what batteries to use other than that everything pretty self explanatory if you cant figure it out you probably don&#x27;t really need to be purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I bet it works fine.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product, but when I tried it on my nails it stopped rolling or functioning. So the filer or other parts would roll when I attached it however, it did nothing when it touched my nail. Really disappointed -_-</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s something that you need to try to see if you like it.  It works like it is suppose to, but it is a little dainty for the man of the house.  I believe the ladies would like it more than the men.</li>
