      <li>First, I get in my shower in enclosed bathroom to get the air good and steamy.</li>
      <li>So, in using the product it feels pretty good</li>
      <li>Now it rinses off pretty easily which is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>this product is very good, for me, and its the only shaving cream i used and its been over 10 years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still among the most comfortable shave</li>

      <li>The Maximum Comfort Shave Cream is a good follow-up; I usually leave it on for a while, finishing my showering regimen with a good head shampoo and conditioning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would not recommend this to anyone hoping for the original.</li>
      <li>Ruined this shaving cream by changing the formula kinda like coke 2 did by replacing the original are they nuts or what?</li>
      <li>Better price than buying from one of the large department stores.</li>
      <li>helps a lot, mildly numbs the skin so shaving is bearable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish the jar top flipped up, that would save a bit of visual mess, but otherwise, its perfect.</li>
      <li>Great product, have used it in the past &amp; really like the smooth comfortable painless shaves.</li>
      <li>You will have a great shave with just a little bit.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, especially for those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a goopy feeling later.</li>
      <li>been using this product for years, great for sensitive skin and dealing with my rough beard.</li>
      <li>I shave first with Gillette&#x27;s shave cream (in a can).</li>
      <li>OR YOUR BLADE WILL WEAR OUT FAST!</li>
      <li>He tried many different brands and Lab series is the winner(and</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t shave every day but this will last me more than 1 year.</li>
      <li>Had the original formula with benzocaine, after purchasing the new one it had no numbing effect which is the ONLY REASON why i purchased lab series, Save yourself the bucks and just buy gillete, an easy fix:</li>
      <li>The scent is clean and clear, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne or add a medicine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend,  worth every.cent.</li>
      <li>This cream is very gentle on my sensitive skin, and it provides just enough benzocaine to &amp;#34;numb&amp;#34; the top layer of skin so the shaving process is painless.</li>
      <li>So far I don&#x27;t find huge difference in the quality of the their new formula.</li>
      <li>The inner plastic liner was fine.</li>
      <li>Much easier to order here than going to Macys.</li>
      <li>I hasn&#x27;t changed much over the years.</li>
      <li>I used to really like this shave cream until they changed the formula.</li>
      <li>The cream feels much lighter than buyer.  </li>
      <li>Really miss</li>
      <li>I just decided it was too much to pay for shaving cream and stopped buying it.</li>
      <li>a little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s also a great value</li>
      <li>we normally panic when my husband realizes he is out of it...and race to Ulta!  </li>
      <li>Would switch back if they ever made the original formula again.</li>
      <li>Aramis changed the ingredients in this shave cream, but I still find it works better than any other shave cream out there.</li>
      <li>just ok, thats not good not bad</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>but, I think it is worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>This new formula doesn&#x27;t have the benzocaine, so the product isn&#x27;t the same.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A thick cream that spreads easily and provides consistently close shaves with perhaps one or two cuts a year.  </li>
      <li>tub lasts nearly a year!</li>
      <li>None-the-less, this is great, and after I learned that I only need enough to apply a thin coating, well now I see that it is very cost</li>
      <li>and wow they have a new and improved should have known</li>
      <li>It comes in a hard tube, but the seller said he will try to get a more flexible tube.</li>
      <li>My husband has sensitive skin and since using this shaving cream, he&#x27;s had no rashes or discomfort.  </li>
      <li>It is also inexpensive when you consider that you use the lightest film; only about a dime size dollop for your whole face.</li>
      <li>the only shave cream my husband will use!  Very soothing on the skin.</li>
      <li>I had used this shave cream for years and left it when there was a remake of the original product due to some issue with the formula.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes a shave very smooth!</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream for sensitive skin that money can but</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream ever.</li>
    <li> The original formula had benzocaine which helped make the shave more comfortable. This new formula doesn&#x27;t have the benzocaine, so the product isn&#x27;t the same.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this to anyone hoping for the original.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS SHAVE CREAM FOR OVER 20 YEARS! CONGRATULATIONS TO LAB SERIES ON A GREAT PRODUCT THAT WORKS. THIS SHAVE CREAM DOES NOT DRY UP, AND GET CLUMPY!</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream. I have used it for years and have never found anything close to as good.</li>
    <li> Lab series has changeed it formular for this shaving cream.  The cream feels much lighter than buyer.  So, in using the product it feels pretty good but I can tell the difference.  Preivously the cream use to stick to my shaving blades.  Now it rinses off pretty easily which is a good thing.  So far I don&#x27;t find huge difference in the quality of the their new formula.</li>
    <li> This shave cream is the best product on the market.  I havery used this product for.17 years.  Each tab lasts 4 to 5 month5. Nothing&lt;br /&gt;gives you a closest shave.. Highly recommend,  worth every.cent.</li>
    <li> Ruined this shaving cream by changing the formula kinda like coke 2 did by replacing the original are they nuts or what?</li>
    <li> Delivered timely, and product as expected.  No issues.</li>
    <li> My roommate loves Lab Series. Much easier to order here than going to Macys. A little bit goes a long way and he loves the smooth shave.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this Product. The cream has a numbing agent that facilitates shaving. It also moisturizes the skin and keeps it heathy looking.</li>
    <li> i have used this for years.  have not cut myself shaving since I began using it.  Very comfortable shave.  I like that it has no scent</li>
    <li> this product is very good, for me, and its the only shaving cream i used and its been over 10 years.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin and since using this shaving cream, he&#x27;s had no rashes or discomfort.  The down side is that it can be hard to find.  So glad we checked on Amazon, as now we won&#x27;t need to &#x27;shop&#x27; in stores for this staple of our home!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lab Series shave cream for over 20 years. It&#x27;s still among the most comfortable shave you&#x27;ll ever have. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shave cream.  It leaves me with a smooth shave and no razor burn.  I miss the days when they included benzocaine in the formula.</li>
    <li> Aramis changed the ingredients in this shave cream, but I still find it works better than any other shave cream out there. (Of course, I wish it were less expensive.)</li>
    <li> This product is condistantly good, and a great value in this large size container.  A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I used to buy this from Sephora. It&#x27;s a good product. I just decided it was too much to pay for shaving cream and stopped buying it. It was good while I used it though.</li>
    <li> Had the original formula with benzocaine, after purchasing the new one it had no numbing effect which is the ONLY REASON why i purchased lab series, Save yourself the bucks and just buy gillete, an easy fix: purchase a bottle of benzocaine for about 6 bucks and mix it in the shaving cream to restore its numbing properties.</li>
    <li> I used to really like this shave cream until they changed the formula. I have since changed  my shave cream.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for years.it gives him a great shave and his skin stays in good shape.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with this product.  I have read other reviews of the previous version that had a component to reduce skin discomfort.  It was a version I would have like to try.  None-the-less, this is great, and after I learned that I only need enough to apply a thin coating, well now I see that it is very cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one complaint with customer service.  My last shipment was damaged in shipping.  The outside casing was broken into pieces.  The inner plastic liner was fine. It just did not look good, and I would not want to give it as a gift.  My complaint is I notified the company, and made it clear that contact was only a courtesy notice of shipping damages.  I just wanted to let them know so they could make adjustments in the future to ensure the containers do not break in shipping.  After submitting my report, I did not expect anything but condolences, and a thank you for not demanding a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am disappointed to say, they did not respond at all.  It may be a problem for others to get a response too.</li>
    <li> Gives a smooth shave been using it for years</li>
    <li> Lab Series formula, unfortunately discontinued, this is crap. I compared it side by side with &amp;#34;Face skin care ultimate comfort shaving cream&amp;#34; and lab series looses big time. Can&#x27;t figure why they don&#x27;t bring the old formula back.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, painful when shaving -&lt;br /&gt;This helps a lot, mildly numbs the skin so shaving is bearable.&lt;br /&gt;** This is an update - the new product has been changed, the numbing agent benzocaine has been removed, the new product is worthless, Edge or Gilette is just as (good/bad).  The new jar lab series looks the same, but if you read the ingredients, the benzocaine has been deleted.  Now I use Face Skin Care, a good product that has Lidocaine, which will numb the skin, but is twice the price as the old lab series. It comes in a hard tube, but the seller said he will try to get a more flexible tube.</li>
    <li> Will never shave with any other cream.</li>
    <li> used this for years and its the best stuff out there for men.</li>
    <li> the only shave cream my husband will use!  Very soothing on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love that we just discovered that we can get this on Amazon...we normally panic when my husband realizes he is out of it...and race to Ulta!  Now...with Prime...it&#x27;s here in two days!  He cannot shave without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just keep on reordering it!</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD AS OLR ARIAMIS</li>
    <li> Only shave cream my husband will use...perfect for sensitive skin; 8 oz. tub lasts nearly a year! Better price than from the Aramis counter at the department store; Prime shipping is a great plus!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for those with sensitive skin. Better price than buying from one of the large department stores.</li>
    <li> Great product, have used it in the past &amp; really like the smooth comfortable painless shaves.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.</li>
    <li> I had used this shave cream for years and left it when there was a remake of the original product due to some issue with the formula.  Disappointed still, it does very little for a heavy stubble.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 jars for my husband. He tried many different brands and Lab series is the winner(and it has been for many years). He loves the numbing feeling, makes for an easier shave.</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for years and was thoroughly satisfied. For some reason Lab Series decided to change the formula and delete the topical anesthetic,and my product rating drops from 5 stars to 1 star.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 25 years. It is the only shaving cream I have ever found that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling scraped raw.&lt;br /&gt;In a pinch it will even work with cold water. I miss the Aramis scent it used to be made with but this neutral scent is more versatile. It requires no after shave or moisturizer. It is also inexpensive when you consider that you use the lightest film; only about a dime size dollop for your whole face. A jar lasts 6 months. A word of caution; be careful the first time you use it . If you attack your face with the same vigor you use with regular shave cream you may filet your cheek before you learn that it doesn&#x27;t take as much pressure to get the same results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaving cream for years. It seems to be the best for your skin and makes shaving the easiest.</li>
    <li> I have used the Aramis Lab Series Maximum Comfort Shave Cream for a long time. I have a system for using this product. First, I get in my shower in enclosed bathroom to get the air good and steamy. I shave first with Gillette&#x27;s shave cream (in a can). I used to use Aramis Lab Series Tri-Gel shave formula, but it&#x27;s got to where I can not find it. I use Gillette custom-plus (non-pivoting) razors for the first round. Then I follow up with glycerin soap (Neutragena); on this pass I can get very close because the glycerin in the soap makes the skin very slick while it is on. On the final round I apply this Maximum Comfort Shave Cream to do the last bit of shaving and to heal the skin and to nix any bleeding if I have nicked myself. I find using these three together works superbly! The Maximum Comfort Shave Cream is a good follow-up; I usually leave it on for a while, finishing my showering regimen with a good head shampoo and conditioning. Again, because the Maximum Comfort Shave Cream has benzocain in it, it heals my face and arrests any bleeding.</li>
    <li> Another great aid in shaving. If you hate to shave, this makes it a lot easier. It contains a numbing agent which I like and the razor glides along the surface. I have used it for years. It may be expensive compared to drug store brands but, I think it is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving cream for years. I usually purchase it at Macy&#x27;s, but decided to save myself a trip to the mall and purchase online via Amazon. This cream is very gentle on my sensitive skin, and it provides just enough benzocaine to &amp;#34;numb&amp;#34; the top layer of skin so the shaving process is painless. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and works just as well as the one I bought last year.  I will continue to use this product as I have done for 20 yrs.</li>
    <li> My husband get a great big rash shaving and in-grown hairs.  This stuff helps with the rash and to get a closer shave so nothing is left behind for an in-grown hair.  Never gets one when using this stuff.</li>
    <li> LAB Series Shave Cream is a very good product too, may be it&#x27;s one of the best!!</li>
    <li> The only shave cream I use even though it is getting a bit expensive...old habits are hard to change.  :)  Find it a bit less expensive on Amazon!</li>
    <li> One of the best shaving creams around!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how some people are giving this product 5 stars??this company changed the formula I&#x27;m sure to save money but in the process and again my opinion made it from the best on the PLANET to the WORSE...iI used the Aramis shave cream until Lab Series came along with no scent loved it I&#x27;m talking 25+ years and after all those years walk in to buy and wow they have a new and improved should have known lol...iit is now nice and runny and stings like crazy when shaving they completely changed formula BENZOCAIN REMOVED it was just a dash did not walk away with numb face it was just enough to not get razor drag...mmaybe some young guys that don&#x27;t have much facial hair might be ok??aat any rate sorry for the rant just so disappointed. ..</li>
    <li> perfect shaving cream</li>
    <li> Good deal, on time delivery</li>
    <li> The Best Shave Cream Ever!! Have used it for years...</li>
    <li> have used it for years</li>
    <li> As a man who has to shave every day to avoid stubble and the &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; this has been the only shaving cream that I have found which moisturizes enough and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Gladly recommend this to anyone who asks.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard and this last almost 9 months. Smooth clean shave and leaves no razor burn. YOU MUST RINSE YOUR RAZOR UNDER HARD PRESSURE OF HTE WATER OR YOUR BLADE WILL WEAR OUT FAST!</li>
    <li> been using this product for years, great for sensitive skin and dealing with my rough beard.</li>
    <li> This may seem expensive but there&#x27;s not a lot of waste with the jar style.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a goopy feeling later. The scent is clean and clear, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne or add a medicine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is if he accidentally gets some on his shirt, I can dab at it with cold water and the stain disappears...as opposed to those green drugstore gels that are impossible to get out unless you wash the whole shirt.  I wish the jar top flipped up, that would save a bit of visual mess, but otherwise, its perfect.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s also a great value</li>
    <li> Not the same product it used to be without the numbing agent.  Used to be the best shave cream on the market.  Now it is just overpriced Barbasol.</li>
    <li> Great product. You will have a great shave with just a little bit.</li>
    <li> Used to use this and was VERY happy with it until they changed the formula.  When they took the benzocaine out of it the result was just another cream, and a very expensive one.  Shifted to another cream that is less expensive but just as good.  Would switch back if they ever made the original formula again.</li>
    <li> A thick cream that spreads easily and provides consistently close shaves with perhaps one or two cuts a year.  Way down from the bloody old days.  Expensive, but well worth the cost for dense, tough beards with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  This is my 3rd order.  Works great for a close shave with no irritation and it lasts forever.  I don&#x27;t shave every day but this will last me more than 1 year.</li>
    <li> This is why reviews suck, This is a 3 star product, it has a three star price but 4+ star rating????&lt;br /&gt;Its just ok, thats not good not bad just ok.</li>
    <li> Really miss the Aramis A+ but this is a good alternative.</li>
    <li> Still shaving cream. I hasn&#x27;t changed much over the years.</li>
