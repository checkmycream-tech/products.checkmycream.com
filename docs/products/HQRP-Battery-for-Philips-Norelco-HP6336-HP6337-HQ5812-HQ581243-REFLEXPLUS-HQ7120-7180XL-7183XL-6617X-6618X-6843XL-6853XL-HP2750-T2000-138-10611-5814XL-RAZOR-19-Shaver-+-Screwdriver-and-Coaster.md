### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Now my Norelco is working as I don&#x27;t remember, the battery is working beautifully!</li>
      <li>included screw driver is excellent for those who need it (like me)&lt;br /&gt;-Battery fits my model</li>
      <li>Works perfect....  </li>
      <li>and it work great.</li>
      <li>Product is great, works wonderful , it is what they showed and said all good, Nice to deal with via e-mail,</li>
      <li>Good product for the money</li>
      <li>This battery replacement kit was received in good condition and in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with the battery.</li>
      <li>The factory original ran for about two weeks on a charge for almost 3 years, so if this one comes close to that I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
      <li>Of course it might also blow up :)</li>
      <li>seller gave me a refund, hence two stars not one, but the best thing to happen was reading the other reviews . . .</li>
      <li>Not for an easy change of battery</li>
      <li>Good battery and thoughtful to include the unusual tool to operate on the razor housing.</li>
      <li>The screwdriver worked well for dis-assembly.&lt;br /&gt;Battery was easily replaced</li>
      <li>Battery was fine.</li>
      <li>That said, since this is a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; replacement battery, I found the tabs needed to be trimmed for this to fit.</li>
      <li>After a full, overnight charge, I used my shaver daily until it wouldn&#x27;t go, and that took an amazing 4 weeks and 6 days.</li>
      <li>yeh, should have done that first! . . .</li>
      <li>Very thankful for the free tool.</li>
      <li>The additional screwdriver was also useful.</li>
      <li>The tool was worth the cost of the bat.</li>
      <li>Worth another star.</li>
      <li>After replacing the battery, my shaver sounded different and seemed to run more powerfully.</li>
      <li>The picture looked pretty close to my battery</li>
      <li>At the beginning I couldn’t find out the battery polarity (I knew it was important) as the (-) marking in the old battery, until I saw a notch in one of the ends of the battery.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I notice your typical and likely superior NiMH battery (Sanyo Enveloop being my favorite) seems to fit just as well, possibly even without soldering!</li>
      <li>A minor problem to be sure.</li>
      <li>The battery received a full 24-hour charge after installation, and has been powering my shaver every day for a week so far.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll update in the future, when I have more experience with this new one.&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
      <li>Very high quality.</li>
      <li>Not a negative thing at all, just be aware that this might happen.</li>
      <li>included screw driver may be redundant for those who already have the tool (or are purchasing this package more than once).</li>
      <li>Before the new battery, I was recharging every 7-days.</li>
      <li>There is quite a bit of soldering to remove and re-install the new.</li>
      <li>and I gave it a try buying a new one.</li>
      <li>I have no faith in this vendor and I&#x27;ll probably need a new shaver because of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I five weeks, the new battery has gone from requiring a charge after 10-days to requiring a charge after 6-days.</li>
      <li>Got it on time, replaced the old battery without problem, now my 3 year old razor runs like brand new!</li>
      <li>so I had to cut the width down with sissors to get it to fit on the board.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately not so, as the new battery just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and performed just like the old battery it was supposed to replace.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The instructions are clear on how to install this battery.</li>
      <li>So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
      <li>installation, I charged the Norleco 6618X razor overnite and have used it each day for six days so far without re-charging.</li>
      <li>As it states on the box, I&#x27;ve replaced batteries in various shavers over the years, and figured I&#x27;d have the same success with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Install was easy for me, as I have a lot of experience soldering on small electronics.</li>
      <li>, I have a new shaver with a battery that I know will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I relied on a thin ridge at the top to differentiate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The tabs are thin and easily cut with household scissors.</li>
      <li>I received a pair of batteries and was surprised to find that when I opened it, my Norelco shaver only required a single battery.</li>

    <li> The instructions are clear on how to install this battery. Applying the solder is all but impossible and better left to a professional. In the frustration, I ended up throwing everything including the Norelco razor away.</li>
    <li> There is quite a bit of soldering to remove and re-install the new. And WTH is up with the stupid coaster that came with it?</li>
    <li> This is for a through the pc board and soldered.  Not for an easy change of battery</li>
    <li> As it states on the box, I&#x27;ve replaced batteries in various shavers over the years, and figured I&#x27;d have the same success with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately not so, as the new battery just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and performed just like the old battery it was supposed to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller gave me a refund, hence two stars not one, but the best thing to happen was reading the other reviews . . . yeh, should have done that first! . . . i.e. someone suggested using a regular AA rechargeable, preferably Eneloop, and voila!, I have a new shaver with a battery that I know will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know how to use a soldering iron you can do this!</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my old HQ7120&#x27;s OEM NiMH battery (a Japanese Yuasa brand), which had become annoying by requiring increasingly frequent recharging -- recently just about every other day of very light use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The included screw driver is excellent for those who need it (like me)&lt;br /&gt;-Battery fits my model perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;-After initial charge it is outperforming the dying battery (no surprise here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The included screw driver may be redundant for those who already have the tool (or are purchasing this package more than once). It should be optional.&lt;br /&gt;-Battery&#x27;s polarity not labeled (I relied on a thin ridge at the top to differentiate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unknown at this time:&lt;br /&gt;-Longevity of the HQRP battery?? (It is made in China, which does not make me hopeful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional considerations:&lt;br /&gt;-I did not solder but simply bend in the long metal ends. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;-After opening up my unit I notice your typical and likely superior NiMH battery (Sanyo Enveloop being my favorite) seems to fit just as well, possibly even without soldering! Of course it might also blow up :)</li>
    <li> The very thin, flat leads were wider than slots in the circuit board so I had to cut the width down with sissors to get it to fit on the board.  Time will tell how well the battery holds up but seems to be working well after 1 month.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered.  Works perfect....  This saved me from having to purchase another razor which I had no intentions of doing. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the battery. It was difficult to instal but had nothing to do with the product. Very thankful for the free tool. The tool was worth the cost of the bat. Very high quality.</li>
    <li> Good battery and thoughtful to include the unusual tool to operate on the razor housing.</li>

    <li> Got it on time, replaced the old battery without problem, now my 3 year old razor runs like brand new!</li>
    <li> Battery was fine. The installation was difficult for my 7183XL. Probably not something everyone could do. It required difficult removal and soldering.</li>
    <li> This battery replacement kit was received in good condition and in a timely manner. The screwdriver worked well for dis-assembly.&lt;br /&gt;Battery was easily replaced however it required simple soldering to the printed circuit board.&lt;br /&gt;After installation, I charged the Norleco 6618X razor overnite and have used it each day for six days so far without re-charging.</li>
    <li> I ordered the advertised battery (screw driver and coaster included) for my Norelco 7180 XL based on Amazon&#x27;s reviews. I received a pair of batteries and was surprised to find that when I opened it, my Norelco shaver only required a single battery. I returned the package, explained the problem and monitored the ads for my shaver. Not long after, the ad for my shaver changed to a single battery (plus screw driver and coaster). The picture looked pretty close to my battery so I ordered the package. Mistake! After replacing the battery, my shaver sounded different and seemed to run more powerfully. Maybe good...maybe bad. Before the new battery, I was recharging every 7-days. I five weeks, the new battery has gone from requiring a charge after 10-days to requiring a charge after 6-days. At this rate, I&#x27;ll be charging every day in about 5-weeks. I have no faith in this vendor and I&#x27;ll probably need a new shaver because of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 22, 2013, now charging every 2-days.</li>
    <li> My Norelco was not keeping charge and I was planning to buy a new one (ouch it was expensive!). I thought that maybe the problem was the battery and I gave it a try buying a new one. At the beginning I couldn’t find out the battery polarity (I knew it was important) as the (-) marking in the old battery, until I saw a notch in one of the ends of the battery. I assumed it was the polarity and it work great. Now my Norelco is working as I don&#x27;t remember, the battery is working beautifully! As this battery is being sold to the public, my only recommendation for the produced is to mark polarity to help those with no much knowledge.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have any trouble installing it on my razor.  Charged it with no problems at all.  The additional screwdriver was also useful.</li>
    <li> It seems such a simple matter to designate the positive end and the negative end of the battery. A minor problem to be sure.</li>
    <li> [See update below]&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to give 5 stars, but as this is a rechargeable battery, I don&#x27;t yet know how long it will last. Install was easy for me, as I have a lot of experience soldering on small electronics. You need a decent small soldering iron and some flux core solder. That said, since this is a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; replacement battery, I found the tabs needed to be trimmed for this to fit. Not a negative thing at all, just be aware that this might happen. The tabs are thin and easily cut with household scissors. The battery received a full 24-hour charge after installation, and has been powering my shaver every day for a week so far. The factory original ran for about two weeks on a charge for almost 3 years, so if this one comes close to that I&#x27;ll be happy. Maybe I&#x27;ll update in the future, when I have more experience with this new one.&lt;br /&gt;Update: This battery, as well as the original, did not have capacity (commonly stated as mAH) markings, but newer batteries usually have improved values. After a full, overnight charge, I used my shaver daily until it wouldn&#x27;t go, and that took an amazing 4 weeks and 6 days. Worth another star.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money</li>
    <li> havent had time to solder it in place yet but in time i will. i did like the fact that it came with a driver for the screws that hold the razor together</li>
