      <li>This is the best brush I have found so far for use in the shower.</li>
      <li>I honest wouldn&#x27;t have minded if it was firmer and sharper, but I&#x27;m a masochist :)</li>
      <li>Any good super glue would hold it together again if it did separate.  </li>
      <li>Worked okay while it stayed in one piece, but breaking after one month?</li>
      <li>and I love it for that</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find one like that in years.</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>dimpled handle would provide better grip than smooth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>

      <li>Thought it would be made a bit better for the price</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the brush</li>
      <li>Love the look of it as well.</li>
      <li>I wanted a bit more stiffness in the bristles, but this one is much much better than any I had tried before.</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>This was just the ticket for better reach in the interest of getting those hard-to-reach regions when showering.  </li>
      <li>Just ordered two more for company.</li>
      <li>Love the handle since it won&#x27;d</li>
      <li>good brush , the bristle content is a good blend of natural and synthetic bristle making for a much more comfortable scrub brush .</li>
      <li>While I think it is probably a great brush for 90% of people, it was too soft for my preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is an attractive brush with the natural looking bristles and tortoise shell handle.</li>
      <li>It breaks too easily.</li>
      <li>love this, great for my back in shower</li>
      <li>So you have to take it easy</li>
      <li>A piece of cord is provided that helps if used for a lanyard but is easy to forget to use.</li>
      <li>The brush head comes off easily, I cut my shoulder when it snapped off and the plastic scratched me.</li>
      <li>Strong and works for what its needed for.</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because it is a fine brush</li>
      <li>Brush works fine</li>
      <li>but otherwise works fine.</li>
      <li>The brush fibers are fine.  </li>
      <li>The design of the brush is fine, and it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>It is a nice design with a nice brush head; but, it is apparently made out of cheap, brittle plastic to meet the price point.  </li>
      <li>I dropped it in the shower as the handle is perfectly smooth and, imagine this, once you have soap on your hands there is virtually no grip.</li>
      <li>Plastic held together by cheap glue.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use it under water as the head filled with water and came off when I did.</li>
      <li>Bristles and handle are of cheap materials with no brand name on it.</li>
      <li>Extremely cheap quality.</li>
      <li>Made of cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>the bristles and curve of the handle on this brush are fabulous.</li>
      <li>Great product, nice and firm.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Needs a better grip but other than that I like it.</li>
    <li> Lame!! it lasted a good 3 week. I was cleaning my restroom dropped it from about 8 inches high and the brush came off -_-</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Great for getting to all those hard to reach parts of the body when showering.</li>
    <li> Excellent bath brush!  Hard plastic handle will never get moldy like all the wooden handled ones I&#x27;ve had in the past. The handle can be a bit slippery when wet, but it&#x27;s still easy to grip. Bristles feel superb. Hangs to dry in the shower.  The brush and handle are two separate pieces that have been fused or glued together and seem very sturdy, but will have to see if they separate over time.  Any good super glue would hold it together again if it did separate.  Used it every day for about 2 seeks now and I&#x27;m extremely happy with this so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/24/15:  I initially loved this brush for just over 2 weeks, then soon after I wrote the review above, the handle snapped apart at the point where it just meets the brush head, and couldn&#x27;t be fixed.  It barely fell 2 feet in the shower tub, and I&#x27;ve got a fiberglass tub, not tile.  I&#x27;m returning it.  Very impressed with Amazon&#x27;s return policy.</li>
    <li> Handle is a bit slippery but otherwise works fine. Just one caution - don&#x27;t use it under water as the head filled with water and came off when I did. I glued it back and it seems to be okay now. Actually I think it would work better if the head was detachable, just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Handle broke first week under normal use.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I use bar soap to lather it and it holds soap very well. Not too hard not too soft, feels great.  Other brushes actually scratched my back and left me looking like I&#x27;d been in a cat fight. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a good back brush. Just ordered two more for company.</li>
    <li> Great brush.  I&#x27;ve had a bout with bursitis and was losing range of motion in that arm as a result.  This was just the ticket for better reach in the interest of getting those hard-to-reach regions when showering.  Very pleased with this brush.</li>
    <li> The head broke off after about a month of use. Worked okay while it stayed in one piece, but breaking after one month? Unacceptable. Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> The brush separated from the backing with 7 days. Pure junk</li>
    <li> Brush head broke after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> Nice shower brush. This is a better deal than buying local. Brush has medium strength bristles.</li>
    <li> Bristles and handle are of cheap materials with no brand name on it. Made in China.</li>
    <li> broke from a low impact drop</li>
    <li> I bought this brush in October of this year and have used it twice a week at the YMCA.  Unfortunately, I dropped it one time in the shower (approx. 3 ft.) and the handle snapped off of the head.  It is a nice design with a nice brush head; but, it is apparently made out of cheap, brittle plastic to meet the price point.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> brush head fell off of handle just like a few others. what a waste i only used it 3 times!!!!</li>
    <li> brush came off the handle at first use with gentle back scrubbing by an individual who weighs right under 100lbs.</li>
    <li> On the scale from 1 to 10, I would give this a 5.5  After 4 months this brush broke and I emailed the company regarding this issue.  Received a prompt reply but no conclusion.  The presentation stated one piece but looking at it would appear it to be two.  I have read that others have experience the same problem.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my honey!  He uses it daily and yes it lived up to its expectations and then some.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Nice and sturdy, great bristles for scrubbing, and the tortoise shell finish looks great.</li>
    <li> Nice bath brush, not too soft and not too scratchy.  The tortoise handle looks nice.  Good size too.  I like the squarish brush head, is bigger than the oval ones.</li>
    <li> Love it - not too soft, not too hard; just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  So, I bought one, for my son, who loves it; then I bought one for me, love it; then I bought one for a friend, and the handle snapped, not loving it; then I bought one for another friend (didn&#x27;t know the handle snapped on the one I gave another friend) and the handle snapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the handle doesn&#x27;t break, it is a great brush - however, two out of four brushes purchased, two have broken.  A 50% success rate, does not bode well.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> disappointing..on SO many levels! :( The handle is flat so it&#x27;s not comfortable to hold; It&#x27;s slippery in the shower so count on dropping it! the first time it fell, the brush section came apart from the handle...simple enough fix, I just super glued it together. The bristles don&#x27;t hold the body wash very well and the bristles aren&#x27;t stiff enough to do much good. Kinda like scratching your back with a feather. LOL! And then, the last time I dropped it, it broke from the handle so into the trash it went! I think I&#x27;m going to have to design my own to get what I want!</li>
    <li> Works fine but the only complaint i have is that the handle gets slippery when wet with soap - LOL, may sound very obvious, but a little bit of rubberized or textured grip would be helpful. Otherwise, functionally, it&#x27;s a very good quality brush.</li>
    <li> The first day I used this brush the handle came off the head.  After reattaching the head by sliding it back into the groove then the brush part popped out of the plastic frame holding it in.  I find this cheaply assembled at best.</li>
    <li> Some quality qualms. I originally set out to buy the round one, a very old example of which I have used happily for many years. At the last minute, I decided to get the square one because the handle angle looked potentially advantageous. I was wrong about that; the square brush&#x27;s handle is not better than the round one (in fact it&#x27;s the other way around; the round brush&#x27;s handle is slightly better). The bigger issue is that the square brush does not have the sturdy 1-piece construction of the round brush. Instead, the square brush head is (minimally) glued to the handle. The other day in the shower, the two pieces parted company and the sharp edges on the handle put a real nice scratch on the side of my neck. I glued it back together, but I should&#x27;ve gotten the round one. Get the round one. Seriously, get the round one.</li>
    <li> poor quality brush broke third time i used.</li>
    <li> the bristles and curve of the handle on this brush are fabulous. However the handle itself is VERY slippery and hard to hold while in the shower. I had seen someone complain about that in the reviews before I purchased it but honestly did not think it would be THAT big of an issue. I was wrong. It&#x27;s not so great to scrub with if you can&#x27;t even hold on to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent - I like that the bristles are firm and really scrub your back.</li>
    <li> Chic design, nice bristles, long arm reaches all the nooks &amp; crannies!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY !!!! I had this Bath brush for a short amount of time and the handle broke in two. I bought this to replace my Bass Boar Bristle brush,should have bought quality.</li>
    <li> Nicely made. Looks like it should last a while if used properly.</li>
    <li> Very firm bristles and excellent scrubber. The only problem is the plastic handle slides in your soapy hand when scrubbing.  But the firm bristles make me feel very manly like a bear getting scrubbed clean.</li>
    <li> Nice big brush head and moderately stiff bristles.  I wanted a bit more stiffness in the bristles, but this one is much much better than any I had tried before.</li>
    <li> BEWARE! This broke with normal usage after one month!</li>
    <li> The bristles are way too soft for me.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a moldy worn out wooden one. Since its smooth plastic, it won&#x27;t grow mold like the wooden ones. At least I don&#x27;t think it will. I have had mine for a year and its still great.  The only down side is that since it is smooth, you have to use a moderate to heavy grip to prevent it from slipping when using it.</li>
    <li> The bristles broke off the stick 3 days after I received it.</li>
    <li> The handle was too short, and since it has no grip support at the end of the handle, it slips out of your hand.</li>
    <li> Holds up well in the shower.</li>
    <li> So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing with these is that you will need to soak them in water for a few minutes prior to using them.  Otherwise the brush is harsh and will make your back completely red and scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that the contoured handle assists in applying extra pressure when washing your back, ensuring that dirt and grime doesn&#x27;t get a minor once over and then hangs around to become an irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this should be a mandatory purchase for any shower/bath setup.</li>
    <li> Too soft and handle falls off. Also, tough to grip with wet hands.</li>
    <li> Not stiff enough for me and the angled handle is just for looks...same effect as a straight handle.</li>
    <li> Use in shower every day. Helps with old joints that don&#x27;t want to bend like they did years ago.</li>
    <li> I bought this bush to wash my back with and it works well and is nicely constructed. It also looks good hanging in my shower. The only problem I have with it is it&#x27;s a lot more coarse then I expected it would be. So you have to take it easy or you&#x27;ll scrub yourself raw. But it serves it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
    <li> Head broke off the handle. This was after a handful of uses. What a shame. Brush was great otherwise.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a back brush. It works. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Would be four stars if it had not fallen apart after a few weeks of use</li>
    <li> The brush head comes off easily, I cut my shoulder when it snapped off and the plastic scratched me. Bad bad bad!</li>
    <li> Much better than the last brush I bought.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the handle broke off the first time I used this and I wasn&#x27;t even exerting pressure on it.  The brush is basically laying on the handle with a very small ribbon of glue.  This might have been a one-off problem with this unit but I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This brush is made of cheap plastic, very slippery to grasp on the shower.  It fell on the shower floor yesterday and broke.  Spend the extra few bucks on the wood brush with a better grip and more durablility.</li>
    <li> Wife was using it in shower, head fell off handle, and the head split apart. Other than that, it is fine ;-). I glued it back together, as it is not worth returning.</li>
    <li> Great product, nice and firm. I honest wouldn&#x27;t have minded if it was firmer and sharper, but I&#x27;m a masochist :)</li>
    <li> Brush head broke off after 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> good brush , the bristle content is a good blend of natural and synthetic bristle making for a much more comfortable scrub brush . Can be used as a dry brush or a soapy brush . Some times I use as a back scratchier , Good reach , The negatives , handle slippery in a soap environment ( I wrapped rubber band around handle to create a grip ) . If you drop it the brush may pop off , but it was easily put back on . Nice looking faux tortoiseshell look .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty big guy and this handle is long enough to reach everywhere I need it too. The bristles are spread enough to make decent lather, but I was hoping for super soft bristles for my psoriasis.....but that isn&#x27;t the brush&#x27; fault. Over-all, very good quality!</li>
    <li> This brush is very good quality. In addition the angle of the handle makes cleaning my back much easier. I look forward to future sales.</li>
    <li> First-the bristles become too soft once wet. Second- the brush top section fell off it&#x27;s bottom base...super glued it back on. Third, the entire brush (base and the piece that the bristles are infused into) came off of the handle...which upon further inspection it appeared it was meant to do --as in having the option of holding only the brush part in your hand, the only problem was it would not stay on the handle when pushed back into its &amp;#34;slot&amp;#34;....thus I super glued it permanently  to the handle. I have only owned this for 6 months. Not a great product...would not buy again. One star b/c it is an attractive brush with the natural looking bristles and tortoise shell handle.</li>
    <li> It fell about a foot, and the brush separated from the head. I had it for less than two weeks.</li>
    <li> This brush is great. I don&#x27;t understand the complaints that I&#x27;ve read about it here. It is one piece plastic, and very solid. I do not find the handle overly slippery, even with soap on it, but you are in the shower, after all, so you can just rinse it off. The first couple of times I used it the bristles were a little stiff, but they softened up after that. You can run it under the warm water to soften them further before you use it. All in all, it&#x27;s a good brush for a good price.</li>
    <li> broke within 2 weeks at the base of the brush</li>
    <li> This feels SO good to use in the shower.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple different kinds of brushes for washing my back and this by far exfoliates my skin the best.</li>
    <li> Handle is very slippery can&#x27;t hold on to it. Could be a little longer and have some kind of grip on it!</li>
    <li> Use it twice and the head broke off. $10 in the garbage.</li>
    <li> It has two of the three features I most want in a back brush, it&#x27;s contoured and it&#x27;s almost long enough. (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;6&amp;#34; so finding one that really works is an impossibility.) Here&#x27;s the thing it needs; Where you grip it, there&#x27;s nothing to give you purchase and the slick plastic allows it to slip through your hands, particularly if your hands are wet with water and slippery soap. In all other ways I got what I thought I was getting. Some have wanted a rougher bristle but the abundance of the ones on the scrubbing surface makes up for some of that. Also, I&#x27;ve seen back brushes whose bristles were just one millimeter short of flexible steel and that was far too much.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, can&#x27;t say it adds or detracts to the d&amp;eacute;cor of my shower but...that wasn&#x27;t the purpose.</li>
    <li> love this, great for my back in shower</li>
    <li> Nice Brush, only problem is the handle is on the slippery side when soapy.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and says the bristles are perfect. Love the look of it as well.</li>
    <li> The brush broke right off the handle!  The bristles were good, and it was a good brush until it broke off.  I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I ordered the well reviewed handsome square brush in the photos because I liked the design and thought it was an excellent value. What I received is a different brush of another design and inferior quality. When I click &amp;#34;return item&amp;#34; on my Amazon account page I am told it is &amp;#34;non-returnable&amp;#34; and no explanation is given.  I&#x27;ve never encountered this before on Amazon.  If you like the well reviewed  brush as it is pictured and described, be aware that you may receive something quite different.</li>
    <li> The brush worked exactly like I wanted it to, until the brush part broke off the handle two weeks after I bought it.</li>
    <li> Brush works fine but mine broke after one month.</li>
    <li> Brush does good job for what it costs, bristles not too harsh and holding their shape.&lt;br /&gt;Handle is obviously plastic colored like tortoise, not actual tortoise shell. Mine arrived&lt;br /&gt;Cracked at eyelet so not a good way to start. Smooth plastic is very slippery with soapy&lt;br /&gt;hand but IF hand rinsed before grasping handle to begin scrubbing (wet) grip is okay.&lt;br /&gt;Have considered baseball bat friction tape for handle but haven&#x27;t tried it yet. A grooved&lt;br /&gt;or dimpled handle would provide better grip than smooth.&lt;br /&gt;09/24/15 Update: Brush head kept falling off until I glued it to handle several months ago.&lt;br /&gt;This week I dropped the brush and when it hit bottom of tub handle broke off at the head&lt;br /&gt;leaving the glued in portion still attached to head. Jagged break so I consider this brush as&lt;br /&gt;more of a safety hazard than as a good brush.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality-bought 1, it broke after a month, bought a second one, it broke too after a month. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Nice looking brush and the bristles aren&#x27;t to hard ...perfect...</li>
    <li> I dropped it in the shower as the handle is perfectly smooth and, imagine this, once you have soap on your hands there is virtually no grip. the brush head immediately popped off of it&#x27;s base. Evidently it was glued in ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush also leaves me with a bad itch after bathing anywhere the brush was used on my body. .. . .sucks.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to wash my back.  The bristles were to stiff to use, but thinking maybe they would soften up or my back toughen up I keep using.  Now today the brush head fell off the handle, enough said.</li>
    <li> Plastic held together by cheap glue. It fell in the bath and shattered in pieces. 1 star.</li>
    <li> Broke the third time I dropped it. Works fine, it gets very slippery in your hands, so just don&#x27;t drop it. Yeah, I&#x27;m not buying this one again. (Wife says it is rough on her skin and will not use it.)</li>
    <li> I specifically bought this brush because some of the reviews said it was too rough, and I was looking for a stiff bristled brush.  While I think it is probably a great brush for 90% of people, it was too soft for my preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the &amp;#34;ergonomic handle,&amp;#34; think of it more as a straight handle with a lump in the middle.  Where you hold it is parallel to the angle of the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the brush to anyone who wants a simple, middle of the road brush.  I gave it 4 stars because it is a fine brush, it just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping it would be for my personal preferences.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product... Only, the handle needs some work in my opinion.  Hard to keep a solid grip with soapy palms.</li>
    <li> Desperately needs a grip! There are better options out there for the same price.</li>
    <li> It breaks too easily. Go with the Beechwood Long Bath Brush.</li>
    <li> Great bath brush - works just as I wanted. Not too harsh, not too soft - and I find it&#x27;s long enough for my needs. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Strong and works for what its needed for.</li>
    <li> The brush seems well made but the bristles are super stiff; way too stiff for me.  Since softer bristles are more of a personal preference, I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have found so far for use in the shower. I&#x27;m able to reach all areas on my back with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are stiff which is good if you want a good scrubbing. If you want a softer touch, soak the bristles fully first and then gently scrub your back.</li>
    <li> Excellent product except that handle is slippery. Wrap with non-slip tape and better than wooden handle and head.</li>
    <li> Mr Wonderful wanted a bath brush.  Researched various offerings on Amazon...this one got good reviews.  Had it a few months and it is holding up well.  Like the natural bristles and the tortoise (acrylic) shell look base/handle is very nice.  The curve on the handle is a good design feature</li>
    <li> This is an attractive bath brush (yes, I know, but, fundamental might as well look good!). Handle is good looking and, bristles&#x27; color co-ordinates nicely. Brush seems sturdy; I like the fact that it comes with a nylon loop tied to it for easier-adapted hanging. I would prefer this brush&#x27; bristles be, say, @ 25% stiffer than they are. However, perhaps if this was used for dry-brushing skin, I&#x27;d think it perfect. As a shower brush, the reach is good and, the curve and angle I find easy. In my opinion, if it was stiffer it would earn 5 stars -- or, if you like a gentler brush for bathing, it might just be THE 5 star brush for your needs!</li>
    <li> Maybe it should have been obvious, but I have tried several similar brushes made from wood.  I like wood, in general, but in a shower?  Hot water, steam, humidity - can you spell &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34;?  After a while all the wooden models developed mold or mildew, or fell apart before that could occur.  And, some of the brushes had bristles which were so stiff they actually left scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush seem to be holding up quite well, no mold or midew, and the bristles are just firm enough to scrub with without being too aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If and when I ever do wear it out, I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the brush</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for. The bristles are sturdy, but not too hard. They scrub well and soap lathers well on the brush. The hanger is made of synthetic rope and dries out between showers. I do not have any issues with the handle being too slippery to hold onto during a shower. Seems very well made. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Would have been 4 or 5 stars but the very slick handle makes this brush difficult to use in the shower.  Once the handle is wet, it almost is impossible to hold anywhere but right next to bristles.  I like that the bristles are not super soft but have some body.</li>
    <li> Before I could use this brush the first time, the plastic &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; holding the bristles simply fell off the handle. This plastic head is simply a press fit into a shallow &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; molded in one piece with the handle. I considered trying to glue the head into the &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; but decided instead to return a brush that needed immediate repairs. Otherwise, looked like a nice brush!</li>
    <li> Excellent reach and just the right amount of bristle firmness.</li>
    <li> The brush is little hard and broke when I dropped down on the floor.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and contoured hsndle really helps.  You won&#x27;t be dissapointed</li>
    <li> This is a heavy plastic scrub brush. Built like a tank. Drop it on your foot and you will be sorry.  Unfortunately the design is flawed. The handle is thin with no hand grip and slips out when wet so you probably will drop it on your foot.  The brush is very stiff and the bristles feel like needles. This may be what some want for exfoliating but for everyday showering it&#x27;s not a good lathering brush.&lt;br /&gt;I found a lightweight wood handle CVS loofa on a stick called  &amp;#34;essence of beauty&amp;#34; for five bucks. It does a better job for half the money. It Lathers well and cleans back- legs -tops of feet with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Better choice for me.</li>
    <li> Fell apart.  Head came of handle.  Didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Product fell apart as I was taking it out of the packaging. The head just fell off the handle.</li>
    <li> Like every other shower brush I have bought, the brush part fell off of the handle. It took about 3 weeks. I&#x27;m sure I could glue it back on, but being in water and steam would just make it happen again.</li>
    <li> Be aware! Round brush MAY have different bristles than the square! -- I purchased this brush in Aug &#x27;12, and came back today to repurchase because the handle broke (a little too vigorous in the shower), and now I see that the product description for the square brush has changed to include boar hair with the plastic bristles. MY ORIGINAL BRUSH DOES NOT HAVE BOAR HAIR. When you click on the &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; option above, there is no mention of a mixture of different bristles. The one I have is strictly plastic, and the bristles have definitely stood the test of time, still hold soap and, while my brush is now half it&#x27;s length, is still my best bath brush. (I just have to use a separate brush for my back for now.) Regretfully, I can find no recent mention of this possible discrepancy in Q&amp;A, or other reviews. Maybe I missed it. Even worse, the Amazon headers for the reviews don&#x27;t state whether the reviewer purchased the round or the square. &amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I purchased this in &#x27;12, it was $15.85! That the price today is nearly half what I paid may be for a reason, though I hope not.</li>
    <li> The brush looks very nice, but:  (a) the bristles have an unfortunate chemical odor; (b) the plastic handle is very slippery if used in the shower; and (c) it promptly broke when my girlfriend dropped it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve since moved onto a brush with a wooden handle that doesn&#x27;t smell, grips much better, and is much more durable.</li>
    <li> love the angled handle!</li>
    <li> Very, very good body brush. Firm bristles but not the type that hurt. Love the handle since it won&#x27;d mold - a problem with wood handled brushes. The square design seems to cover more area thoroughly than the similar but oval shaped brush.</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple of months. It feels very nice (non-exfoliating). However, the handle can be slippery when wet and about the 4th time I dropped it on our tile shower floor, it broke.</li>
    <li> The design of the brush is fine, and it does what it is supposed to do. The only complaint I have is holding a smooth brush handle when it is wet and soapy, nearly impossible. As a former tennis player, I wrapped the grip of my tennis racket with products made to keep my tennis racket from slipping when my hands would sweat. Great for that, so I thought it might work with the grip of my brush. It works great and the handle does not slip when wet and soapy. Maybe Swissco should include this in their product!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome. Although the thing came apart the first day, it was pretty much my fault. The brush is plastic and molded together at the end where the bristles are... don&#x27;t be a tough guy and try to shake the soap and water out of it at the end of your shower. I put some gorilla glue on it and I could probably knock out Obama with it now. As far as it being slippery, in these other reviews... I don&#x27;t get it... seems fine.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a mans brush, tough enough for my back, yet gentle enough for my sack.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I&#x27;ll probably buy another so I have a back up.</li>
    <li> Broke shortly after receiving.  Made of cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are perfect, not too rough but not too soft either and they don&#x27;t appear to be shedding just yet.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the handle seems to be pretty cheap, it is very slippery and I have a feeling that if I apply too much force over time the head will just break right off from the handle. Hopefully it will last a while though.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be made a bit better for the price</li>
    <li> Ooo...very nice and sleek, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
    <li> This brush is horrible! Very poorly made. The bristles shed badly. I would NEVER purchase this again. I would have done my review sooner but couldn&#x27;t remember where I had purchased it. Waste of money. I ended up going to Target.</li>
    <li> Well, it is really gentle and I love it for that BUT the handle doesn&#x27;t have a grip for the hand (fingers) so once you start taking a shower, the thingy becomes really slipper and it is hard to keep it in your hand and brush your body.</li>
    <li> Item came apart after three uses. It will have to be glued back together.</li>
    <li> Extremely cheap quality. This is something you pick up at the dollar store. I used it once and the whole thing snapped. What a rip off. DO NOT BUY!!!!!! There are definitely better quality ones on here for similar price.</li>
    <li> Great brush for getting squeaky clean in the shower.  The handle gets a little slippery when wet, but nothing to really complain about.  The bristles are nice and stiff and clean very well.  I would buy this brush again.</li>
    <li> This is two pieces. Be sure you understand.</li>
    <li> Looks good.  A bit short for me, but not enough for a down grade.  The brush fibers are fine.  However, the plastic usedin maufacture is a poor choice for a handle.  It is too slick, making drops of about 3 ft onto a hard surface likely when used in a shower.  A piece of cord is provided that helps if used for a lanyard but is easy to forget to use. The components do nor survive drops. In eight showers, with about 6 drops from moderate hights the brushhead broke off.</li>
    <li> brush fell off the handle during second bath ?</li>
    <li> Broke during 2nd use, looked like it was pulled out of a trash can.</li>
    <li> Brush itself is great. Unfortunately, it fell off the handle promptly upon removal of the packaging.</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews for this brush, I ended up more confused than enlightened.  Some said it was the greatest thing ever, others that it was a piece of junk. I decided to try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first brush I received was in two pieces in the package. The front part of the brush head, with the bristles, separated from the back of the head. I discovered this when I took the tape off the head and the two pieces fell apart. I don&#x27;t know if this was a manufacturing or a shipping problem, but, in either case, Amazon quickly sent me a new one, which was together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That tape was a bit of an issue.  The adhesive residue did not want to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some commenters mentioned that the curve in the handle prevented them from having the brush head fully against their back. Personally, I do not understand this comment. Without the curve, I could not keep the brush against my curved back. Perhaps the people making this comment have backs that are straighter or longer than mine. Others commented that the handle was slippery. I have had no problem holding onto the handle. At least one comment said that the hanging cord was too heavy and did not dry out, being a breeding ground for bacteria. The cord on mine dries fine, in about the same amount of time as my towel. I do have an open shower, so the brush does not remain in a closed, high-humidity, environment. If the cord on yours doesn&#x27;t dry, it would be easy to remove it and either replace it with something lighter or, if you don&#x27;t hang the brush, leave it with nothing. In replacing the cord, all you need to do is tie something else on - no sewing skills are necessary. Other comments said either that the brush was too stiff or too soft. This is completely a matter of personal preference. I like a good stiff back brush. I haven&#x27;t been able to find one like that in years. This brush is stiffer than a lot I&#x27;ve found, but still a bit soft in my opinion. It is, however, a decent, medium stiffness, brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a decent back brush, and much better than others I have tried in the last 10-15 years.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a decent back brush, and much better than others I have tried in the last 10-15 years.</li>
    <li> Owned 2 Swissco round brushes - both lasted for years. This head came off with 6 uses. No abuse. No dropping. This brush is Not worth 10 cents. Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update just ordered the round head instead of the square head. The round head is a sturdy Swissco brush I have used for year do not antipathetic any problems. This brush should be rated 5 stars but the square head is not usable as stated above. Thus I split the difference. Big difference between the two brushes.</li>
