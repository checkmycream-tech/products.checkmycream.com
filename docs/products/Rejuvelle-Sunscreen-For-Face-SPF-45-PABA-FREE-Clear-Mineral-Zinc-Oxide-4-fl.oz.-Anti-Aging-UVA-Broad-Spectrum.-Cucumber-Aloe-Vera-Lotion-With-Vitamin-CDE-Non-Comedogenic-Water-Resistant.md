      <li>br /&gt;light, non-oily and effectively protects my face throughout a 10-hour long&lt;br /&gt;exposure day with one or two re-applications.</li>
      <li>This review is my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>so I like the fact that this goes into the skin nicely and does not make my skin feel greasy.</li>
      <li>Reapplying it many times could be good but my skin  does not tolerate that many layers.</li>
      <li>It is every bit as light and pleasant to wear as she described… and not one bit of burned skin.</li>
      <li>My skin breaks out very easily and is oily</li>
      <li>This is the best natural sunscreen ever.  </li>
      <li>This makes it perfect for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very light and not greasy..</li>
      <li>The odor is very light so once you apply it, the odor does fade.  </li>
      <li>It smells a bit strong but it goes away, and it is a nice smell.</li>
      <li>The cream is light and it does protect !</li>
      <li>Very night and not noticeable (we were sniffing lol).</li>
      <li>It is sort of magical.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You will also love this because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I think you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Every time I used it, I feel refreshing.</li>
      <li>I have searched the web over for a facial sunscreen without chemicals or synthetic preservatives that irritate my skin, and this product is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>because my husband doesn&#x27;t tan, he burns and he needs it more than me.</li>
      <li>I officially love this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Also, I love how moisturizing it is, without breaking me out.</li>
      <li>Excellent sunscreen and terrific moisturizer!  </li>
      <li>I love it and would recommend  to any one</li>
      <li>would recommend this to everyone.  :)</li>
      <li>The BEST facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>I am not too sure  if it is as efficient for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and easy consistency of the sunscreen lotion.</li>
      <li>Mild, nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a good moisturizing sunscreen that you can use daily this is a good choice.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen wears excellently and is very gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>just use this directly over the Vit C serum &amp; it feels great.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen rubs in easily and does not leave a residue.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen goes on smooth, has a nice fresh smell, and absorbs easily into my skin.</li>
      <li>I with held the fifth star because of the strong fragrance of one ingredient, which I cannot place.  </li>
      <li>Really like this sunscreen, it is not greasy, and it has this refreshing cucumber kind of scent.</li>
      <li>Additionally it would be nice if they specified the exact forms of vitamin C, E, and D contained in the product (i. e. ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate etc) instead of just listing it as &amp;</li>
      <li>/&gt;Application is smooth and easy.  </li>
      <li>(This has been a huge issue with my daughter).</li>
      <li>for what I don&#x27;t like:  It seems the label does not list all the ingredients accurately.</li>
      <li>Light on the skin.  </li>
      <li>received one free bottle for review purposes.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and not greasy,</li>
      <li>Finally, a sunscreen he&#x27;s happy with</li>
      <li>And I would really want to reapply it every 2 hours as one should with any sunscreen because it makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
      <li>Has a very calm cucumber/melon smell, no added perfume scent, goes on clean, not greasy.</li>
      <li>Additionally, this is a wonderful facial moisturizer &amp; my mineral makeup flows softly across my face when applying.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes, absorbed well, no white residue, great under makeup.</li>
      <li>My pic is from day 10 and my skin was not dry, all good.</li>
      <li>The bottom line is that I still believe that micronized or not, minerals are better than chemicals and that is based purely on experience and the fact that chemical sunscreens react when exposed to sunlight.</li>
      <li>Hard to believe this great product is both!</li>
      <li>But, the last thing I want to say is that this sunscreen feels emollient and I do think that it is good for your skin.  </li>
      <li>Prefect and full of moisture.... will continue buying.</li>
      <li>I started using the product to combat mild melasma.</li>
      <li>This exceptional facial sunscreen literally soothes my skin when I apply it-</li>
      <li>It is my new favorite for my annual Mexico trip.  </li>
      <li>It goes on so light weight but feels very nourishing on the skin.  </li>
      <li>If this sunscreen had added scent of any kind it would have been sent back.</li>

    <li> This sunscreen lotion is great, it absorbs and lasts.  It is my new favorite for my annual Mexico trip.  Two weeks in the intense sun and this year I brought this product and wore it every day.  It smells better than every sunscreen I&#x27;ve had and best of all, it did not stain any of my bathing suits or clothes....this is a must for me.  La Roch Posay and Sheshido are great, but they stain everything. Next year I am bringing 3 bottles, okay, maybe 4, because my husband doesn&#x27;t tan, he burns and he needs it more than me. But, the last thing I want to say is that this sunscreen feels emollient and I do think that it is good for your skin.  My pic is from day 10 and my skin was not dry, all good.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t opened my bottle yet, but I&#x27;ve used it before; my mom has it and I really liked it; so I ordered it too!!</li>
    <li> I shave my face and head almost everyday. I wear sunscreen almost everyday. I wanted a stronger SPF than 15 which for some reason is the most common SPF in sunscreens designed for the face. Well Rejuvelle is it. SPF 45. Has a very calm cucumber/melon smell, no added perfume scent, goes on clean, not greasy. So far the SPF 45 is doing its job well. If this sunscreen had added scent of any kind it would have been sent back. Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> This sunscreen rubs in easily and does not leave a residue. It has not caused any breakouts, which can be an issue for me. This product has a faint, pleasant cucumber-ish scent. My 80 year-old lifelong Californian grandmother tried the sunscreen recently and she was impressed. I started using the product to combat mild melasma.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:49367fb841cd53eec00b2f0c5c496874]] This sunscreen is moisturizing and smells so good ( No one can tell its&#x27;s sunscreen)  AND it&#x27;s made in the USA! I can wear it to work or I can wear it to the pool, it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t streak. I&#x27;m so spoiled by this sunscreen, drug store just won&#x27;t do it for me anymore :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works awesome on my acne prone skin (back and chest ) I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using it. This is a quality product , I&#x27;m in loooove !</li>
    <li> This is the first time we have purchased this sunscreen. We like it, and we will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  I have combination skin (oily t zone) and was looking for something that was oil free and had a high spf rating. It smells like honeydew melons! The odor is very light so once you apply it, the odor does fade.  I was also looking for something natural without all of the nasty ingredients in normal sunscreen. It has a light feeling to it, and a little goes a long way!!! Would defenetly buy again!!!</li>
    <li> The cream is light and it does protect ! It&#x27;s a moisturizer and suncream which I did not realize at the time I ordered. However, I still use a moisturizer over it because I feel that is not enough. It does not leave white residue maybe because it has a low content of zinc oxide. I like it because it does not clog my pores since I have an acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks. I love it so far. It smell great! Every time I used it, I feel refreshing.</li>
    <li> My husband is a golfer and was looking for a good sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on his face and neck.  Finally, a sunscreen he&#x27;s happy with and he doesn&#x27;t mind wearing!</li>
    <li> I have been using it daily (six days per week) during an eastern Oregon&lt;br /&gt;heat spell with temperatures in the 95 to 105 degree F range and clear&lt;br /&gt;skies. I wear reflective safety glasses, therefore my face and nose are&lt;br /&gt;difficult to protect from exposure. Other products I have tried are either&lt;br /&gt;to oily and sweat off and/or they just don&#x27;t work effectively and I end up&lt;br /&gt;with a &amp;#34;raccoon face&amp;#34;. The Rejuvelle Antioxidant Moisturizing Sunscreen is&lt;br /&gt;light, non-oily and effectively protects my face throughout a 10-hour long&lt;br /&gt;exposure day with one or two re-applications. I also feel good about using&lt;br /&gt;a natural-based product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen wears excellently and is very gentle on my sensitive skin.  As I apply sunscreen every morning, I also am very satisfied with how this sunscreen does not gunk up my pores.  I with held the fifth star because of the strong fragrance of one ingredient, which I cannot place.  The first three days my eyes actually watered and nose ran a little and I recognized it was because of this one ingredient&#x27;s fragrance. (I cannot place it, but juniper comes to mind.)  After a couple of weeks this strong reaction dissipated and only a little eye watering remains.  I am so satisfied with all other aspects of Rejuvelle Suncreen I will buy again.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good moisturizing sunscreen that you can use daily this is a good choice. After applying is absorbs quickly so you can apply a regular moisturizer over it if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this sunscreen when I&#x27;m going to be outside for an hour in the yard. My skin doesn&#x27;t burn and actually looks ten years younger once I come back inside and look in the mirror. I love that this has natural ingredients like aloe which really plumps the skin. This makes it perfect for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zinc in this product is also totally clear so it is invisible on your skin. If you&#x27;ve used other products with zinc in them you&#x27;ll notice a big difference. It is sort of magical. Here are the ingredients as listed on the box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Micronized zinc, Octyl Methoxycinnamate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Certified Organic Aloe Vera, 9% Micronized Zinc, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamins C, E &amp; D, Grape Seed Extract, Evening Primrose, Sunflower Seed, Safflower Seed, Slippery Elm, Borage Oil, Alpha Bisabolol (Chamomile), Plantains, Allantoin, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Squalene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see it has a lot of skin calming ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will also love this because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is absolutely no white residue when applied&lt;br /&gt;You can use this as your daily moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;You can use this while playing sports or swimming - sweat and waterproof&lt;br /&gt;No mineral oil&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance Free&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight moisture&lt;br /&gt;Can be used over the whole body&lt;br /&gt;Protects against UVA, UVB and UVC rays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is made in sunny Margate Florida. I think you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free bottle for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and I still have a lot left in the bottle.  I&#x27;m estimating that this will last about 3 months.  My skin breaks out very easily and is oily so I like the fact that this goes into the skin nicely and does not make my skin feel greasy. I also have not had any breakouts or irritation since using this. This product wears very well under my mineral make-up and it does not leave a white film on the skin as I have found with some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Really like this sunscreen, it is not greasy, and it has this refreshing cucumber kind of scent.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of sensitivities and over time have found I cannot wear standard sunscreens on my face -- it burns and is pretty intolerable -- especially around my eyes.  I also have a lot of autoimmune problems and need to reduce my exposure to chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is excellent -- did not cause breakouts -- provided good protection on the water (just returned from week of boating on the ocean).  Never bothered my skin or eyes in any way.  Grateful for this product, thank you.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The BEST facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used! I have extremely sensitive facial skin as well as rosacea. I&#x27;ve tried a myriad of facial sunscreens over many years. All have caused a burning sensation &amp; have flared my rosacea. This exceptional facial sunscreen literally soothes my skin when I apply it- it feels like a cool soft cucumber has been applied all over my face. Since using the Rejuvelle Facial Sunscreen, my rosacea redness, small &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; &amp; skin flakiness has improved dramatically. Additionally, this is a wonderful facial moisturizer &amp; my mineral makeup flows softly across my face when applying. My skin is so soft now- even the little wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable. I highly recommend Rejuvelle Facial Sunscreen &amp; encourage anyone who&#x27;s looking for a superior facial sunscreen/moisturizer to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrea Paul, RN, CCM&lt;br /&gt;Scottsdale, AZ</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen and terrific moisturizer!  Hard to believe this great product is both!</li>
    <li> Smells like bananas! Doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout - always a positive for someone&#x27;s who face always breaks out from products that claim&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;non-comedogenic. Seems to work great!</li>
    <li> This is the best natural sunscreen ever.  No white residue, no dangerous ingredients or harsh chemicals, no greasy feel.  This matt finish is perfect for faces and under makeup.  A real find.  Most natural sunscreens leave you looking and feeling white and pasty.  Not the case with this one.  I have searched far and wide to find an SPF of 45 in a natural sunscreen that would not feel heavy or greasy.  This one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and easy consistency of the sunscreen lotion. It is not greasy and leaves no residue like other sunscreens and it has the added zinc oxide for blocking the sun. I use it daily before makeup and it has the 45 block that I am looking for.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product . All in one . I use in the am before applying my foundation . My skin feels great all day. I recommend you try there Vitiam C serum .</li>
    <li> Best sun SPF for face!  Smell great! Moisturizes, absorbed well, no white residue, great under makeup.</li>
    <li> This is the best face sunscreen I have ever used. It blends in so well and feels great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the $.</li>
    <li> Works well for my wife.  She is already planning to reorder as soon as her current supply gets low.</li>
    <li> I used the product this morning for&lt;br /&gt;the first time and I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Application is smooth and easy.  I&lt;br /&gt;Went out for a run for 1.5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Even while sweating heavily it stayed on.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen! This is the only thing I have found that is natural and safe, but doesn&#x27;t make you look like a ghost. Will buy again definitely! I plan on buying this sunscreen for as long as it is still on the market. Also, I love how moisturizing it is, without breaking me out. It smells a bit strong but it goes away, and it is a nice smell. A bit like cucumbers. Also, Rejuvelle always sends follow up emails that are personalized to what you did and your name. You can tell that this company reads every email that you send.</li>
    <li> So far I have liked it but on very hot days and too much sun where I live I am not too sure  if it is as efficient for my skin.  Reapplying it many times could be good but my skin  does not tolerate that many layers.</li>
    <li> The description of the ingredient list on Amazon is misleading. I thought I was purchasing something that had only zinc oxide as the active ingredient. It also has octyl methoxycinnamate. The tube itself does not have a list of the inactive ingredients.</li>
    <li> Because of allergies it is difficult for me to find sunscreen that I can use. This works without an adverse reaction and it&#x27;s clear as advertised. Love it!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week and love it! Goes in smoothly and does not make my face white.</li>
    <li> I loved the Rejuvelle Vitamin C so much I decided to try the sunscreen.  It goes on so light weight but feels very nourishing on the skin.  It&#x27;s made with more of those great anti oxidants, which is a plus.  I love the fact that is has a high SPF but does not look white &amp; pasty under my makeup.  I don&#x27;t even feel like a need a moisturizer --I just use this directly over the Vit C serum &amp; it feels great.  These products have replaced my much more expensive brand &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them!  I&#x27;ve got my husband using them too!  Great ingredients--great price!!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and not greasy,</li>
    <li> Not white like other zinc SB, not greasy or oily.  I love it and would recommend  to any one</li>
    <li> Was About to use this product they put( OCM) octyl-methoxycinnamate.  Would you put this on your children.  Would return but missed the deadline.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and the scent is calming. No greasy feel to it. No skin reaction. But honestly way too expensive</li>
    <li> I have purchased several tubes of this. It&#x27;s wonderful. It is light and moisturizing, smells great and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I have to use mineral sunscreens because I get bad melasma and my skin feels like it is burning with chemical sunscreens. I have read mixed opinions on micronized vs non micronized vs nano zinc and while I would love to stick with non micronized the reality is that you can&#x27;t avoid the ghostly white cast they leave. I have tried so many brands and spent so much money. The bottom line is that I still believe that micronized or not, minerals are better than chemicals and that is based purely on experience and the fact that chemical sunscreens react when exposed to sunlight.</li>
    <li> no messy white stuff and my daughter loves the smell! does not make my skin break out.</li>
    <li> Great suntan lotion!  It worked really and does not cause break outs.  It also does not make you look like a ghost!!</li>
    <li> 9/17/2017 UPDATE: Now that they updated the product to 12% zinc and removed the octyl methoxycninimate, I can say I absolutely love this sunscreen and feel 100% great about using it!  Best sunscreen on the market now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now. So far, I really enjoy it. I had searched so long for a mostly zinc based sunscreen that I could wear daily without looking like Casper the Ghost. I like that the ingredients are mostly natural and that the product is cruelty free as well.  This sunscreen goes on smooth, has a nice fresh smell, and absorbs easily into my skin. It is wears well under my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for what I don&#x27;t like:  It seems the label does not list all the ingredients accurately. The product has a very obvious fragrance (smells like cucumbers) and yet there is no fragrance listed in the ingredient list, neither do I see cucumber extract listed. I can&#x27;t pinpoint which listed ingredient the smell is supposedly coming from.  Maybe the company can reply to this review and help answer this. Also, the label says 9% zinc, but does not list the percent of Octyl Methoxycinnamate. I&#x27;ve read that the company claims they use the smallest amount of chemical required by the FDA, but I would like to know what percent that is?  Additionally it would be nice if they specified the exact forms of vitamin C, E, and D contained in the product (i. e. ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate etc) instead of just listing it as &amp;#34;Vitamins C, E, D&amp;#34;.  The vagueness makes it seem like they are trying to hide something, since other natural products have much more detailed labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/2016:  I&#x27;m still buying this and have changed my 4 star to 5 star rating. It seems they&#x27;ve reformulated the sunscreen a bit and improved it. It smells less strong and even better now. They&#x27;ve also corrected the label.  I officially love this sunscreen.  My only suggestion at this point would be that they get rid of the less than 1% Octyl Methoxycinnamate. If it&#x27;s such a small amount, why have it in there at all?  9% zinc should be sufficient.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful!  Very light and not greasy.. Has a very slight fresh almost cucumber scent.. Very night and not noticeable (we were sniffing lol). I am white skinned and dry and my daughter is bi-racial with medium toned dry skin. This disappears right into both our skins leaving NO chalky grey residue.  (This has been a huge issue with my daughter). I used it yesterday while sitting in the yard with our dogs and I am not pink at all.  I was out there for about 4 hrs in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone.  :)</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be better than expected.  If I had one suggestion it would be to ask for a small &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; - if not already offered.</li>
    <li> I use this primarily on my face and it is excellent.  I have searched the web over for a facial sunscreen without chemicals or synthetic preservatives that irritate my skin, and this product is wonderful.  No irritation, and it feels good on the skin alone or under makeup.  It has a fresh cucumber scent that dissipates quickly and it keeps my face soft, smooth, and hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all.  Light on the skin.  Mild, nice fragrance.  Works well as a sunscreen.  I will definitely order this product again!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.  I use in the morning as a moisturizer under make up.  It is non greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell to it.  My son also loves using it.  Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I put a bean size amount on my face and feel the moisture immediate penetrating my skin. I have been using estee lauder&#x27;s sunscreen for a while and very often it greases up my skin. This would be a change for good i believe. And I would really want to reapply it every 2 hours as one should with any sunscreen because it makes my skin feel amazing. I dont know about its potency as a sunscreen yet but I&#x27;ll keep you updated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: get it.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  It has a very pleasant smell almost like cucumbers, and it glides on my face like silk.  I use it on my whole body.</li>
    <li> We rec’d the sunscreen today – as always, perfectly packaged and arriving as expected.&lt;br /&gt;My family (and now coworkers, also!) absolutely loves your product: After removing a nasty basal cell carcinoma from my forehead, I had no desire to press my luck in the sun and so, when my daughter told me about your product prior to a vacation in the sun, I jumped on it! It is every bit as light and pleasant to wear as she described… and not one bit of burned skin.</li>
    <li> Prefect and full of moisture.... will continue buying.</li>
