<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my room is too bright from the outdoor lights, so this blocks the light and I can sleep much better. it also has an adjustable strap in the back so its not too tight.</li>
    <li> Anyone who likes to keep the light out and keep their eyes cool this is a perfect purchase! Very cool!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for our purpose. Handed them out to students at a sleep awareness event.</li>
    <li> cannot sleep without them!</li>
    <li> Soft comfy cute and blocks out sunlight. Did I mention its comfortable and leopard? Whats not to love? SO cheap too. Great deal</li>
    <li> I have always wanted one of these and this one didn&#x27;t fail to satisfy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: It&#x27;s durable, lightly padded and blocks the light out! Not surprisingly though, if you open your eyes while wearing the mask you will see a tiny bit of light through the space between your nose and the mask but that&#x27;s understandable and not much of a defect of the product. I got the Leopard print and it&#x27;s exactly as pictured. The strap is made of elastic with a buckle that allows you to adjust the mask to ensure a proper fit. I lent the mask to my dad to sleep with the week after he had cataract surgery to keep the light out of his eyes and it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cons: The mask tends to slip off my head during the night as a toss and turn but maybe that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t pull the strap tightly enough; I don&#x27;t really want anything snug on my head while I sleep though.</li>
    <li> Cheap, itchy, and a much darker color yellow/orange than I expected. I was pretty disappointed when I got this. The elastic band in the back is thin and cheap feeling. It is adjustable so that&#x27;s good but I wouldn&#x27;t push it&#x27;s boundaries because it looks as if it will snap. First time I laid down to use it it was pretty rough and itchy on my face, but it seems like that&#x27;s faded, maybe due to the oils on my skin, and the fabric needed to be worn down some. I&#x27;ll use it occasionally until I can find another one like I&#x27;ve had in the past, with much softer plush satin. This just isn&#x27;t a material you&#x27;d be comfortable with over your eyes while you sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of sleep masks through the years and this one is great. I&#x27;m purchasing a replacement since the elastic on my current one is starting to stretch too much. However, it&#x27;s lasted me about 2 years without any other defect, and I sleep with it virtually every night! I&#x27;ve gotten more expensive ones and they&#x27;re just not as comfortable. You can&#x27;t beat the price on this one. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask had a wonderful leopard design and was a sturdy fabric.  May work better in a quiet dark room/</li>
    <li> I received this sleep mask as a gift and I find the style and material to be very comfortable and effective. However, within days of my starting to use it the band began to come apart. The elastic ripped out of the outer material and now I am left with a loose band that continues to unravel every day. It is still usable, but soon I will no longer be able to adjust it and it will be too loose to use. I am very disappointed, as I was otherwise quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> I used to never wear sleep masks at night because I had a bad experience with one.  It didn&#x27;t fit my face right so it was uncomfortable to wear in my sleep.  I thought all sleep masks would bother me like that, so I didn&#x27;t bother trying other ones.  I bought this as part of a \\&quot;costume\\&quot; for a pajama party and I tried sleeping in it one night just for the hell of it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  You can customize the fit because the strap is adjustable.  The satin is very smooth and comfortable and its fits my face just right so that it blocks all of the light but I can still comfortable open my eyes underneath it.  Now, I sleep with it every night.  I&#x27;ve only had it for about two weeks so I don&#x27;t know if it will be sturdy given the price, but I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Too tight and I have a very small head.</li>
    <li> Very silky smooth.  I love it !</li>
    <li> I have a set of wireless headphones and a TV in the bedroom. I often like to watch Netflix late at night. My wife had solved the noise problem by purchasing the headphones but she found the light from the TV was bothering her. So one day I bought her these and she hasn&#x27;t complained about the TV since. She seems to really like these and finds them comfortable. She also uses them on the weekend, every once in a while, if she wants to take a nap during the day.</li>
    <li> its cute but it moves away from my face as  I sleep, i wake up with it completely off</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t as trick as i thought it would be</li>
    <li> This is a soft satiny sleep mask with the only adjustable strap Ive ever seen that actually worked well and didnt have a plastic hook adjuster I could feel when I laid down. I&#x27;m very happy with it and am now so spoiled I cant sleep without it!</li>
    <li> It had a strange (plastic?) odor to it....I&#x27;m sensitive to scents, so I couldn&#x27;t wear it. Otherwise, it would&#x27;ve been a perfect sleeping mask.</li>
    <li> I use mine all of the time. Comfy and cute :) Doesn&#x27;t block out all light, but it works and is a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well doesn&#x27;t form to the face so there&#x27;s lots of light  getting in</li>
    <li> I needed this for light issues and I&#x27;ve used it 3 nights and the strap is almost broke. The strap is so skinny and cheap. The rest is okay but it&#x27;s overall very stiff and not comfy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye masks and this one is just perfect.  It covers the eyes completely and comfortably.  It has an adjustable strap.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Adjustable straps, nice lined mask! Not too thin not too think... just right!  I threw all my others out and use this! I own 2! I hope they keep them in stock! I&#x27;ll keep buying them!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my daughter.  Her fiancé laughed when she opened it for Christmas, but now I hear he has taken it over and wears it every night.  Guess I will have to buy her another one!</li>
    <li> I love this mask, it&#x27;s soft on my face and it keeps all light out. So when my husband has on the room light on or TV put the mask on and go to sleep. Love love!</li>
    <li> Great gift for those who love Leopard&#x27;s or Leopard print.  Purchased as gifts and the recipients were excited.  Nice and soft product.  No regrets.</li>
    <li> I recommend that everyone have a sleeping mask. I sleep so much better at night thanks to this mask. I feel sort of cut off from the world, and everything is pitch black. I love it. The cheetah print is very pretty! I ordered one for my mother as well.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is super cheap and blocks out light perfectly for me in my home! It is just what I needed at an awesome price to sleep. I hate sleeping when I can see light through cracks in the window!!</li>
    <li> This smells funny and it smells toxic. It is not for me, and I could not sleep with this smell. I do not recommend, would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone</li>
    <li> Great Deal!!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Just as I hoped it would be. Comfortable, cute, and stays in place overnight. Would recommend and plan on buying another if I somehow lose this one.</li>
    <li> I love this mask.  I feel like the strap is a little flimsy and that it won&#x27;t hold up forever, but I like them thin like this.  I would buy another if needed.</li>
    <li> works great - soft on the face - my 9 yr old daughter loves it too.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is wonderful. It has the normal issues that any sleep mask will have, ie- light comes in under the nose, it can make your face warmer than normal. However, it still makes the room darker. I used to have trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep and this helps with both. I&#x27;ve gotten so spoiled that I can&#x27;t sleep without it. Its very soft against your face and eyes, and the adjustable headband makes it fit perfectly. I may get the second in zebra just to have a back up. Its a $5 miracle purchase for better sleep.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing I like to use it when I go to sleep and the sun just started to rise and it help me to go to sleep right away plus it&#x27;s a leopard and I am addicted to leopard.</li>
    <li> This product is super soft and the strap is in the perfect location! I bought the black one from the same company and there are TWO straps on that one and one of them rubs right across the ear and is too tight around the head so it is useless. This one however is just right and around the nose has a nice little flip down that helps keep out the light. It is not light proof around the nose but it is better with the flipper than the ones without. I put it on and forget I have it on and it doesn&#x27;t come off. I am one of those extremely sensitive people that wake up to every little sound, light, movement and has to have the temperature just right etc., which can be irritating. I do LOVE this product, so that is saying a lot. I used to have an expensive one with memory foam and it was too bulky laying my side, I pushed into the side of my face and would move the whole thing. Also it had Velcro in the back which dug into the back of my head. Some of those expensive eye masks are just not worth it if you can&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item back in dec but 3 months later of using it every night, the elastic band a completely stretched and no longer fitting my head :/</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for a Halloween prop!  I have no idea how it works as an actual  sleep mask though.</li>
    <li> I did a little research for a sleep mask and found many mixed reviews.  I purchased 2 of these masks and we love them.  I love that the headband strap is adjustable.  If you tighten it just enough, it will stay on all night.  It fit myself and my 12 yr old daughter perfectly.  The masks are soft and silky.  They block the light just fine.  We both love the fun prints.  They also come in a case that is great for travelling, you will want to save that.  Look no more - these are great!</li>
    <li> I cannot sleep without a sleep mask. I have been through so many different ones from walmart before this. all low quality and It didnt last long. this one I figured would be that same. ordered online for convenience. this mask is amazing not only does it seem good quality it is adjustable!!! I repeat adjustable, that&#x27;s what I love the most, also that its thick where no light leaks through which was a problem with the ones I bought at walmart. when mine wears out Ill be rebuying this. maybe in the zebra print next time. I also love animal prints.</li>
    <li> Good but too small for my wife but my daughter ended up using it. Just make sure you buy for right size person</li>
    <li> It seems to me like the sun rises directly in my room because it&#x27;s SO bright in the morning.  I&#x27;m not a morning person at all.  I bought this on a whim as an add on, figuring if it was cheap and didn&#x27;t last at least I&#x27;d give it a try.  It&#x27;s pretty well made, though.  This mask is SO comfortable and completely blocks out the sun.  It&#x27;s almost magical - as soon as I put it on I&#x27;m out like a light.  Does its job perfectly.  I think I&#x27;ll get a few more so I am never without it again in my life.  It&#x27;s satin and the strap is adjustable.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Broke I only got to wear it once or twice</li>
    <li> I love these eye masks! They are so comfortable! They cover your eyes completely.  Love, love these eye masks! I bought two.</li>
    <li> Great! Thick fabric and comfortable to sleep in.</li>
    <li> I love this sleep mask, in all honesty. However, it was poorly made. Cheap product. I had to sew it back together several times.</li>
    <li> This was for my cousin who is a nighttime shift nurse, she couldn&#x27;t sleep during the day so this was something she really needed and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use when I am at a hotel for work and trying to sleep during the day.  My job often requires that I am up for many hours and when I have the opportunity to sleep it is important to take advantage of it.  I found that not all hotels have the darkened curtains.  I purchased this to use in those cases.  I have not had a problem with the band that goes around the head stretching out, however I do not use it all of the time.  It does the job for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but it doesn&#x27;t create full darkness. It also starts to get fuzzies that tickle the nose during sleep and it wakes me up. I have yet to find the right sleep mask.</li>
    <li> Keeps light away, no complaints. Adjustable band which is nice.</li>
    <li> Maybe I sleep too rough.  It didn&#x27;t always stay in place when I slept.  Some light still came in from the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;It was adequate to eliminate the most distracting lights however.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 5yr old who claims to have needed it to block out the sun while she&#x27;s sleeping and she absolutely loves it. She uses almost every nite and she looks like a little lady...</li>
    <li> Just as I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Keeps out the light and comfy! Decided to purchase the zebra one too! :)</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a spa theme sleep over for my teenage daughter. They were super cute &amp; a hit @ the party.</li>
    <li> For the price...it&#x27;s OK.  It&#x27;s a bit smelly out of the bag, like plastics....and it&#x27;s super thin.  Attached strap is really cheap, so I don&#x27;t see it lasting very long.  I think I paid $5 for it, so you get what you pay for in this instance.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, and I think it looks really cute. However like most of these kinds of masks, it lets the sunlight in a little bit at the bridge of the nose, so each morning I have to tug it down a little bit which gets annoying. It doesn&#x27;t block out all the sun because of that. I like how it lets you adjust the tightness on the back with the straps. Satisfied!</li>
    <li> I liked this sleep mask for awhile. Then the band became stretched out not long after buying it then one night it just broke. I hate light in my face while sleeping :(</li>
    <li> This satin sleep mask is good.  There is nothing i can say bad about this mask.  I is as described in the listing</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of sleep, and use this mask nightly.  It&#x27;s smooth and silky, and pleasantly thick.  The elastic is not too tight- on the other hand, it does stretch out quickly. Washes and dries beautifully in the machine.  Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> These are flimsy and not that thick or heavy. I used them once and then stuck them in my nightstand, never to be used again. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> This thing is literally the only reason I get a good sleep at night, it blocks the light out so well and it&#x27;s comfortable on my face. By far best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> They are soft and cancel out the light. This sleep mask was affordable and comfortable. It fits perfectly in the sleeve that it was shipped in and matches the sheets I bought at the store. (This was my sole purpose for buying them)</li>
    <li> this item was purchased as a gift, but from the looks of it the transaction was good i am happy</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is comfortable and blocks about 90 percent of sunlight. It stays put too. Except for one time it fell completely off my face. I&#x27;ve had this mask for 3 weeks now and am very happy with it. It was mailed quickly as well.</li>
    <li> I love it. Perfect fit, and no velcro strap that hurts my head. Throw it in the washer first. I had a mild reaction to whatever was on it when it first arrived.</li>
    <li> Feels nice against my eyelids. Adjustable elastic.</li>
    <li> These are OK. Pretty pattern, but they don&#x27;t fully block the light...but they are sufficient. It is handy the elastic head band part can be adjusted.</li>
    <li> This is my second Swissco Sleep Mask.  I use it every night, it stays in place and is lite enough to be quite comfortable.  It&#x27;s very easy to adjust and keeps light out quite well...price is right also.</li>
    <li> It tends to slip off my head while sleeping.. but maybe my head is a weird shape.....or its just not tight enough...about to adjust...</li>
    <li> Nice, light weight. Blocks light well! Unfortunately the band stretched out very quickly.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask works about as well as I thought it would--it doesn&#x27;t fit really tight, so light comes in around the edges, but I adjust it down to rest on my cheeks a little.  My biggest complaint is with the adjustable elastic band in the back.  The hard plastic piece is right at the back of my head, so I can feel it when I sleep on it.  I usually use the mask just for naps, so depending on what side I want to sleep on, I can flip the mask inside-out if needed.  It would be annoying to use it for a longer time.  Still, for the price, I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this while living in hotels traveling for work. The great thing about it is that it is very comfortable to wear. It&#x27;s not hot and is adjustable so that the proper tightness around your head can be achieved. My only problem is that unless positioned absolutely perfect, light can seep in. A wee bit of light doesn&#x27;t usually bother me too much at night, but if trying to nap during the day the light seepage becomes more prevalent. For the price (and cute design) this is sufficient for me.</li>
    <li> Glad I made the decision to buy this. It&#x27;s perfect, keeps the light out, makes me sleep a lot better! Now my fiance knows not to bother me when I have it on lol. Very happy with my purchase (:</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this mask. It is very comfortable and blocks out light, which is exactly what you want in a sleep mask. My boyfriend was reading in bed with the overhead light on, but with the mask on I couldn&#x27;t even tell. The band is adjustable and does not pull my hair.</li>
    <li> I was needing a new one as I had a cloth one and it started itching at night.  I bought this satin one and it is sooooo comfortable!  Can sleep very peacefully with it on and actually be able to sleep in with it as well.</li>
    <li> cute product and it came on time. the bad part is that it broke like 2 days after i got it while i was putting it on at night. i guess my head is too big :-(</li>
    <li> It gets only two stars because the leopard print is in black and white when I thought it should have been in color. The image is false!  Don&#x27;t trust them if you want the sleep mask in the picture!</li>
    <li> uuh - kinda tight kinda flimsy but does the job,</li>
    <li> The coverage, quality, and wearability are perfect. The material is satin so it will make you hot if given half a chance.</li>
    <li> I am on the fourth one of these sleep masks.  I LOVE them!  They are lightweight, washable, great for airline travel and....even if you look bad in the am, you will be stylin&#x27; with your mask.</li>
    <li> Years ago I discovered that a sleep mask helped me get a better night&#x27;s sleep when traveling. Hotel drapes never seem to close all the way, and a mask worked to block out ambient lights. Now I use a sleep mask every night, and it helps me to reach a deeper sleep faster. This brand is very comfortable and very affordable. Best product for the price that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I purchased these.  They seem a little thick for this time of the year.</li>
    <li> It broke as soon as I got it.</li>
    <li> I filters out most light but some still gets in from the bottom and it slips off a lot but it&#x27;s still pretty comfy.</li>
    <li> I love it, I only wish I had bought it before now. I have been awakened by the sun for so many years, now I can sleep soundly with out any light bothering me.</li>
    <li> Extremely comfortable and fits nicely with an adjustable strap. The design doesn&#x27;t look cheap and makes sleeping pretty. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Pros: very soft, stays on my head, adjustable, looks sleek&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Lets some light in through the bottom but not a ton.</li>
    <li> sooo comfy. it works!&lt;br /&gt; wish the elastic strap was a little wider though..</li>
    <li> I sleep with this mask every night. it is wonderful. It really is nice and soft so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it blocks out the sunlight.</li>
    <li> i like it and it does the job of helping me fall asleep in the dakr. i do not like that it slips off during the night</li>
    <li> These were very reasonably priced and they block the light and they are stylish. Most of the time somthing like this cost a pretty penny, but this didn&#x27;t. Great for gifts and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Blocks out any light, very comfortable!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  Good quality.  The strap isn&#x27;t very thick (more string-style) but it stays on well</li>
    <li> bought these to go with my leopard travel pillow.  Will be traveling in style!!</li>
    <li> It came within a week of my purchase. The material is nice and silky. At first I didnt like how it was so tight, but when I took a closer look at it I realized that it has an adjustable strap. It does it&#x27;s job and I would definitely repurchase if my dog ever ate mine.</li>
    <li> Blocks out any light. Very comfy on my lids but it is not what it looks like in the picture. Anyways it&#x27;s still leopard print and it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I was using a sleep mask that I got for free on a flight to England for about a year and decided to upgrade to something that didnt have a Virgin Atlantic logo on it (no offense to that airline).&lt;br /&gt;I love leopard print so I figured that for the price it would be a worthwhile investment.&lt;br /&gt;While its not too shabby looking it definitely is what you paid for.</li>
    <li> I have gotten to where I can&#x27;t really sleep without a mask on, and I was happy to receive this cute leopard print mask. It is a nice, silky quality and a good value for the price. I plan to order the Zebra print as well.</li>
    <li> It works and is as comfy as advertised, my wife uses it and does not complain so it must do the job.</li>
    <li> Looks nice, but doesn&#x27;t stay on very well. I often find it slipping or sliding off my eyes. Think it would work well with smaller body (head) size.</li>
    <li> Works good, blocks out the light.</li>
    <li> It does let some light in around the nose but is pretty comfortable and works well enough at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask does exactly what I need it to do. The leopard print is adorable, and it is very functional. It is a little thin and not necessarily the most luxurious sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever had, but for the price, it&#x27;s definitely a winner.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t sleep if it isn&#x27;t really dark and this sleep mask works great for that aspect. It has an adjustable strap that makes sure it is a good size for your head and a silky feel to it that doesn&#x27;t itch the face or area around the eyes. My only issue with it is the adjustable strap. The strap is really thin and can sometimes cut into my skin right above my ears if it slips down at all or my hair isn&#x27;t positioned right. I think a thicker strap might have been a better way to go.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute, comfortable and works well for the price.</li>
    <li> After a short while, the elastic gets very loose and you must continually tighten the strap. Also, when it&#x27;s extremely bright, there is some light bleed-through. But it&#x27;s soft, lightweight, and cheap, so no complaints.</li>
    <li> This product really does do its job... I love it.. I put it on just before bed and it helps me go to sleep and stay asleep. I doesnt let any light in and its great. Its really worth the couple of dollars.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask does block out the light, but only 80 percent of it. Light comes in around the nose area; Obviously this isn&#x27;t an one size fits all mask, but it is comfy to sleep in. On the plus side, it&#x27;s animal print. Who doesn&#x27;t love having a little leopard print in there lives?</li>
    <li> ordered for my neice, who is now into leopard, trying to add to her leopard collection. this look good to me</li>
    <li> I have a ton of sleeping masks, but I was looking for a replacement for a several year old airplane sleeping mask I adore (but is falling apart).  I wanted this one to work so bad, but the material is too stiff to fit comfortably over my face.  I tried washing using fabric softener, but no use.  Guess it can join the rest of the pile that didn&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as comfortable as some other masks I&#x27;ve used. Also the light gets in through the nose area. Sometimes the dye comes off on my pillowcase. It&#x27;s fine, but not great.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask was an answer to my dreams. My boyfriend likes to have the tv on at night to fall asleep, but I can&#x27;t deal with the light. This mask really keeps out the light, nothing sneaks in. It also stays on my head very well while I sleep, whether my hair is up or down. And the cute design makes them even better! The adjustable headband also makes for a nice way to switch things up. These show no lights, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Soft. Comfortable. And it helps me sleep good at  night.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughters for Christmas and they both love them!</li>
    <li> This is a great little mask. I&#x27;ve bought three of them but still using the original one. I have given the other two away when someone complains about the sun waking them. Doesn&#x27;t happen with this mask.</li>
    <li> I wear an eyemask every night to sleep - even if it is &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; in the room, my eyes are still bothered by lights from an alarm clock, street light outside...you get the idea. I found that eyemasks help me sleep at night, and my old trusty brand suddenly became impossible to find. I like the thin foam-like lining in this one, that helps it hold a shape and feel soft/smushy when you may lay on your side or stomach. It keeps out moderate amounts of light well - as with any mask, though, light will get in where it bends around your nose. I like this mask and have already purchased a 2nd one as backup.</li>
    <li> This product fits okay and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s comfortable enough and doesn&#x27;t take up much space. (minimum word requirement)</li>
    <li> If only I&#x27;d known such a simple product could improve my sleep this much, I&#x27;d have ordered this 10 years ago.  For numerous reasons, health, situations, etc., I have great difficulty sleeping.  I have tried multiple different approaches to this problem, with minimal to slight improvement in each area.  Combined, they give me acceptable rest from time to time.  When I ordered this mask, it was a shot in the dark.  Little did I know the great relief I&#x27;d have the first night and without medications, pharmaceutical or homeopathic.  The elastic in this one is perfect, adjustable and with enough give at the ends.  The coverage is complete, no light leaks, and it naturally forms around my nose without being uncomfortable or too hot, always a problem here in AZ.  A big thank-you to the manufacturer for restoring my sleep!</li>
    <li> very comfortable, moves with me, doesnt snag or drag,or shift out of place, stays body temp. , others i have tried get too warm.</li>
    <li> I like how the strap is adjustable and it gets the job done for the most part. Only bad thing is it still lets light in around the nose. I&#x27;ve yet to find a sleep mask that doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and comfortable. Little flaw: it still shows under your eyes so it doesn&#x27;t cover 100%, but it&#x27;s alright for me :3</li>
    <li> BEST EYE MASK EVER. Not too tight on my head/face, it&#x27;s not hard to remove, and super soft.</li>
    <li> good product, adjustable and is comfortable</li>
    <li> Got to have something cover the old ladies eyes.  Watching tv in bed never been better, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about hear getting after me. just put her to bed in style with these haha.</li>
    <li> Breaks after a few months</li>
</ol>
