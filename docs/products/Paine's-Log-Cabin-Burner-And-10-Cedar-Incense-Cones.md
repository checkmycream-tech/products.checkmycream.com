      <li>this is so cute when burning incense cones</li>
      <li>I love  when  smoke comes out the chimney,</li>
      <li>and we love watching the smoke come out the chimney.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite lovely and homey</li>
      <li>this is the same awesome log cabin.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>All together, not terrible for the money.</li>
      <li>..was so pleased as it brought back wonderful memories!</li>
      <li>If only I could find the perfect smelling logs, I&#x27;d be all set.</li>
      <li>I love the design and the smell of the burning cedar.</li>
      <li>I love this little wood cabin and then when it smokes with the wonderful wood incenses, it&#x27;s simply divine - thank you, we love it!!!</li>
      <li>Very cool how the smoke comes out of the chimney.</li>
      <li>I can easily leave a dent in it with my fingernail.</li>
      <li>They crumble all over and once lit burn out very quickly.</li>
      <li>I broke off another and managed to light it before it broke too</li>
      <li>Brought back great memories.</li>
      <li>I simply enjoy the smoke rising from the chimney.</li>
      <li>so the bottom doesn&#x27;t burn and for easy clean up.</li>
      <li>I tried sanding the cones so they would fit, but they just crumbled.</li>
      <li>The look: If you enjoy or want to enjoy the sweet aroma of burning incense but are not into the wizards, dragons, and new-agey look, this is your product.</li>
      <li>They really are surprisingly charming little things and the incense, as I recall, had a very nice, earthy, true cedar aroma.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S FUN TO WATCH.</li>
      <li>The first cabin I bought came with balsam fir short, fatter sticks and we loved them so much we bought a box of 72 balsam fir sticks.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit into the hole in the cabin, so I placed it on top of the metal ring and watched it carefully.</li>
      <li>Exactly like I remembered for years ago.</li>
      <li>It seems to be only slightly more dense than the balsa wood that is used for kids crafts and model building.</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like I remember it</li>
      <li>Lightning fast shipping!</li>
      <li>She appreciated it a lot!</li>
      <li>and I still love it and use it often, especially in the autumn/winter.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>I love it so much this is the second one I have bought</li>
      <li>I bought one of these at a souvenir shop in woodsy Northern Michigan many years ago, but I&#x27;ve long since lost it.</li>
      <li>Also - and more importantly - the hole for the incense is too small and does not hold the cones.  </li>
      <li>Such a great little gift.</li>
      <li>It would also be adorable blending in with your holiday decorations, with little puffs of smoke curling up out of the chimney.</li>
      <li>It burned VERY quickly and my family was not impressed by the scent (very light) like they were by the balsam fir.</li>
      <li>she had one many years ago, it was misplaced in one of our moves.</li>
      <li>They are too skinny and won&#x27;t stand up in the hole in the cabin, although they are lovely for burning in a different holder and are exactly the same as the short, fatter balsam fir sticks, but for their dimensions.</li>
      <li>Had these years ago when I was young and have been looking for a replacement.  </li>
      <li>I managed to break the first one off whole, but, even though I was handling it VERY carefully, the cone crumbled in half.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, the incense are too large to fit.  </li>
      <li>Great looking and functional, but it pulled off some of the lacquer on the wood when pulling the tape off. :(</li>
      <li>It is very light in construction and a small piece of the wood on the chimney I realized over a week later was missing.</li>
      <li>Also, mine had pretty obvious messy gluing on the side of the roof and chimney.</li>
      <li>The housing itself is made from a light wood, yet carefully hand-crafted to be sturdy enough for at least one or two drops.</li>

    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at a souvenir shop in woodsy Northern Michigan many years ago, but I&#x27;ve long since lost it. They really are surprisingly charming little things and the incense, as I recall, had a very nice, earthy, true cedar aroma. The cones actually burned well for cone incense. After I ran out I was never able to find it&#x27;s aromatic equal. It&#x27;s a pleasant surprise to find they are still available after all these years. I highly recommend them as a gift for any earthy hippie-dippie you know, or anybody with a rustic (and usually musty) vacation cottage. It would also be adorable blending in with your holiday decorations, with little puffs of smoke curling up out of the chimney.</li>
    <li> Item arrived with chunk of wood missing from frame of house so roof does not fit snuggly.  Also - and more importantly - the hole for the incense is too small and does not hold the cones.  Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it reminds me of a similar product I had growing up - but I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is really cute! Keep in mind it is small, I got this for my dad to keep on his nightstand and it looks so cute! Gives the effect that the chimney works lol.</li>
    <li> this is so cute when burning incense cones</li>
    <li> outdoors in your home. I got it for the wife. she had one many years ago, it was misplaced in one of our moves. she loves it.</li>
    <li> Had these years ago when I was young and have been looking for a replacement.  Could not find one in any of the local shops, so ordered it through Amazon.  It smells exactly like I remember it..was so pleased as it brought back wonderful memories!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the one I had so ordered this and guess what found mine, so someone got a cabin gift</li>
    <li> I love the design and the smell of the burning cedar. Unfortunately the wood used is so lightweight thay I can easily leave a dent in it with my fingernail. It seems to be only slightly more dense than the balsa wood that is used for kids crafts and model building. Also, mine had pretty obvious messy gluing on the side of the roof and chimney. I don&#x27;t like how the inside only has a metal ring to set the cone on/in. I lined the bottom of the cabin with a small square of foil so the bottom doesn&#x27;t burn and for easy clean up. All together, not terrible for the money.</li>
    <li> We all know when the season starts in our house because of the burning of incense in our log cabin. Just a nice thing to have around and this product is timeless.</li>
    <li> I love this little wood cabin and then when it smokes with the wonderful wood incenses, it&#x27;s simply divine - thank you, we love it!!!</li>
    <li> The cabin itself is great. But it did not come in any sort of box or packaging, and had no instructions which made giving it as a gift not as nice as it should have been.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my sisters birthday. We had one like it at home when we were kids. She appreciated it a lot!</li>
    <li> Great looking and functional, but it pulled off some of the lacquer on the wood when pulling the tape off. :(</li>
    <li> Everything was just as I expected.  Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. it came fast (with prime) and works great. i read somewhere that you shouldn&#x27;t burn incense in a wooden burner, but i have been using for about a month and have had no problems. it works great and makes my house smell like wood burning stove. Love it.</li>
    <li> This little log cabin burns and smokes just like my old fireplace.  I simply enjoy the smoke rising from the chimney.</li>
    <li> The cabin is really nicely made.  Unfortunately, the incense are too large to fit.  I tried sanding the cones so they would fit, but they just crumbled.</li>
    <li> My son loves how the incese burn through the chimney.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful - just like I remember them from when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased - they are very old fashioned - work perfectly (smoke comes out the chimney and the room smells wintry and woodsy</li>
    <li> The look: If you enjoy or want to enjoy the sweet aroma of burning incense but are not into the wizards, dragons, and new-agey look, this is your product. This is winter-y enough to be a holiday item that you take out with the tree, yet simple enough in design to be on display year-round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The function: The housing itself is made from a light wood, yet carefully hand-crafted to be sturdy enough for at least one or two drops. The incense included is not very high quality, but does help offset the over $10 price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all: This thing is awesome! Maybe not worth the full $13 I paid through Prime, but not worth knocking down a star. Definitely a solid buy!</li>
    <li> I bought a few of these for little Xmas gifts. The log cabins are designed and made well, but I can&#x27;t seem to find logs that smell &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;. I received one of these as a gift about 20 years ago and I still love it and use it often, especially in the autumn/winter. If only I could find the perfect smelling logs, I&#x27;d be all set.</li>
    <li> I had one in my house growing up in Minnesota,  this is the same awesome log cabin. I love  when  smoke comes out the chimney,</li>
    <li> The log cabin was great.. It was the cones that came with it that smelled like something was burnning</li>
    <li> Brought back great memories. Good product.</li>
    <li> This cabin looks, as it should, just like those from 20 years ago.  The quality is superb, and the scent of the cones is a perfect pine.</li>
    <li> Great product. We use this with Cedar incense cones and it reminds me of elk camp. Very cool how the smoke comes out of the chimney. Great ideas for men&#x27;s birthdays/xmas. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great item! Lightning fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Exactly like I remembered for years ago.</li>
    <li> This little cabin reminds me of my childhood.  I didn&#x27;t think I could find it anymore.  Its great and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Such a great little gift. Love it! The smoke doesn&#x27;t billow out the chimney like I thought, but the included incense cones smell delicious.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S SO CUTE AND SMELLS JUST LIKE THE MOUNTAINS. IF YOU MISS BEING IN YOUR CABIN, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE THIS. SMOKE COMES OUT THE CHIMNEY IT&#x27;S FUN TO WATCH. HAD THEM WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND I HOPE YOU KEEP MAKING THEM FOREVER! ONE CAME TO ME THAT WAS NOT GLUED CORRECTLY BUT THE OTHERS ARE PERFECT.</li>
    <li> I wanted to order this because when I was little my grandparents has one of these. It is very light in construction and a small piece of the wood on the chimney I realized over a week later was missing. I looked in the wrapping it came in and there was the shard that was missing. Very hard to get the cones that came with apart. They crumble all over and once lit burn out very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this log cabin insence burner! I love it so much this is the second one I have bought so I could have one in another area of my home. It&#x27;s quite lovely and homey and we love watching the smoke come out the chimney. The only issue I have is with the cedar insence cones. The first cabin I bought came with balsam fir short, fatter sticks and we loved them so much we bought a box of 72 balsam fir sticks. They smell wonderful and burn very nicely. I can&#x27;t say the same for the cedar insence cones. I don&#x27;t recommend them at all! They come attached to  each other and you must carefully break one off, which is difficult as they crumble and break VERY easily. I managed to break the first one off whole, but, even though I was handling it VERY carefully, the cone crumbled in half. I broke off another and managed to light it before it broke too (it still crumbled some in my hand). It doesn&#x27;t fit into the hole in the cabin, so I placed it on top of the metal ring and watched it carefully. It burned VERY quickly and my family was not impressed by the scent (very light) like they were by the balsam fir. The good news is the short balsam fir sticks fit in this cabin perfectly and we already have a box of 72! (Just a warning-Don&#x27;t buy the 2&amp;#34; balsam fir sticks for the cabin! They are too skinny and won&#x27;t stand up in the hole in the cabin, although they are lovely for burning in a different holder and are exactly the same as the short, fatter balsam fir sticks, but for their dimensions. I would give the cabin  5 stars, but I would give the cedar insence cones 1 star.</li>
