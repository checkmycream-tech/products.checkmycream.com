    <li> I have thick hair and wanted to control frizz rather than pump up the volume which this product does accomplish, however, the result is flat and hair that looks greasy in a day. Other than that the product DOES NOT have any peppermint in it. If all you want is a decent conditioner its not the worst i&#x27;ve ever used but you can do better for the price.</li>
    <li> As long as this item is brought from a trusted source (I always buy directly from Amazon) then there is no need to doubt the authenticity it. Being a user of TIGI Bed Head Men Separation Wax, it was a no-brainer to order this conditioner to complement my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed was the smell -- it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have a pure peppermint smell but more of a strange, yet pleasant sweet peppermint smell. After applying this to my hair, I was rather disappointed by the lack of a cooling sensation but I did feel very clean despite that. However that dearth soon became a nonfactor, as (surprisingly) after only one wash my hair felt softer than it has felt before. A few washes later and I can still say the same -- this is definitely the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Leaves a discernible tingle on your scalp. The first time I used it I thought something had gone horribly wrong. Now I like it. Will buy another one just to make sure my hair stays manageable and my brain stays on red alert.</li>
    <li> conditioner works very fast!! smells really good, the tingling feeling is great in the shower and repairs hair fast. paired up with the shampoo and leave in condition, my hair damaged was reversed in about 2 months when the cosmetologist told me 6 months. even she was impressed. brings back shine, strength and moisture. now its my regular product! Recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> How can anyone not enjoy the peppermint tingle on their scalp?!</li>
    <li> I love the way this conditioner makes my hair feel, but it doesn&#x27;t have much of a peppermint smell and you only get the &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; sensation if you leave it in for 5 minutes or more.</li>
    <li> TIGI is always a brand I trust and Amazon always has it in stock. The tingly feeling of the peppermint feels great on the scalp. The seller prepared the product well for shipment. It was also offered at a fair price.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;peppermint\\&quot; in this conditioner is more of a windex smell than candy cane, but after a week it seems to be working well. It makes my hair soft without making it look like baby duck down (having asian-esque hair this is a problem I frequently face with most conditioners). It leaves my hair with a good weight and not greasy. If they tweaked the smell I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product as it cleans better than any generic shampoo brands. I strongly recommend this product to anyone seeking better quality care. Go for it!!</li>
    <li> its a great product loved it great smell works great the mint is refreshing. Down side is the botle is so mouch smaller than the shampoo bottle need a bigger size</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Smells great!  Have been using it for more than 6 yrs. now.  Also,  I use the shampoo which coordinates with it.  Great products.</li>
    <li> Unforgettable peppermint smell and feel. After using tons of different conditioners Bed Head Men Clean Up is head and shoulders above the rest. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, he uses it for his beard. It smells amazing and does a really great job keeping his beard frizz free and tame. Good value as well since you only use a very small amount.</li>
    <li> Felt good but made my hair feel greasy by the afternoon. Has potential.  Evolved product is needed. Does anybody else agree?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is really a Bed Head product . I&#x27;s been buying this product&lt;br /&gt;at my upscale barber and it&#x27;s expensive. When I saw it on Amazon I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;hesitate to buy it at such a low price. Well I got what I paid for. It doesn&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;the smell or quality of what I&#x27;ve been buying at my barber AND I MEAN THERE&lt;br /&gt;IS A MAJOR DIFFERENCE.!</li>
    <li> Has a  good smell.  Does not make you hair too greasy.  Gives you good control, and a nice look.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Thats about it, nothing to fancy - smells good, decent product for the price. It&#x27;s shampoo ? not sure what else.</li>
    <li> Great smell and nice tingly feel, but it makes my hair feel really weak and lacking of moisture.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner for men seriously and helps clean as well as refresh hair. My husband loves it and was so sad when it was discontinued by bedhead&#x27;s line. But he loves it and was so happy to find it here!</li>
