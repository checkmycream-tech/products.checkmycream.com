      <li>A lovely true classic!</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t really tell you if it smells good or not, but i purchased this for my mom&#x27;s xmas present this year</li>
      <li>It smells similar to the genuine Je Reviens which has been my perfume for about 55 years, so I know the genuine article.</li>

      <li>made for a really great present, especially since i guess this perfume is kind of hard to find.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and lovely, not too spicy or complex.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is real &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Great stuff not like the bootleg  </li>
      <li>It is very distinctive.</li>
      <li>, this is a complete scam, it does not smell anything like Worth of 20 years ago, very dissapointed, specially, since I can&#x60;t return it and get my money back, DO NOT BUY IT</li>
      <li>It really is an under appreciated classic.</li>
      <li>not what I expect it at all, I use to wear this perfume a long time ago, it was my absolute favorite, this thing has a complete different fragrance, it smells like air refreshener ,</li>
      <li>I have loved this perfume for years, but for a long time it was not available in the US.  </li>
      <li>, I guess, they&#x27;re pretty different.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s was old is new again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only 30ml but is very concentrated and you only need a drop to have the esence all day with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and she thought i spent $100&#x27;s since the bottle was so large.  </li>
      <li>Very green and fresh and just brightens my mood.</li>

<li> Not cool!</li>

<li> I am very, very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Purchased as a gift for my mother, and she loved it.  What more do I need to say?</li>
    <li> My girl loves this one too!</li>
    <li> This perfume is my favorite.  I have used it for over 30 years.  The fragrance is timeless and not too heavy.  Light and clean smelling.</li>
    <li> This should be in a spray bottle, not a screw cap.</li>
    <li> Mistakenly bought parfum instead of eau de parfum, that was the problem, I guess, they&#x27;re pretty different. No issues otherwise.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, lovely perfume.  It&#x27;s floral - jasmine with orange blossom notes.  It&#x27;s light and lovely, not too spicy or complex.  Just think of a happy and fresh spring day when love was new and the world was good.</li>
    <li> not what I expect it at all, I use to wear this perfume a long time ago, it was my absolute favorite, this thing has a complete different fragrance, it smells like air refreshener , thanks God that once you put it on, the smell goes away after a few minutes, this is a complete scam, it does not smell anything like Worth of 20 years ago, very dissapointed, specially, since I can&#x60;t return it and get my money back, DO NOT BUY IT</li>
    <li> My mom use used this fragance many years ago and you can&#x27;t find it in my country. It&#x27;s only 30ml but is very concentrated and you only need a drop to have the esence all day with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy because my mom is happy with her gift.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after remembering encountering this in my mom&#x27;s collection in the 70s. She had the perfume in the small round blue bottle tucked into one of her \\&quot;kelly\\&quot; bags and the fragrance was enchanting. After ordering this one from Amazon, the memories came back. The elegant round bottle is so unique. As for the scent, I think it is still a great fragrance for today. It is very distinctive. A delightful floral that is elegant and unlike anything else out there today.  Very green and fresh and just brightens my mood. If you don&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else, try je reviens. It really is an under appreciated classic.</li>
    <li> A lovely true classic!</li>
    <li> Great stuff not like the bootleg  very real great smell she loves it ,wears it all the time great perfume :)</li>
    <li> This looks like the authentic package.  However, the product inside is not authentic.  It is not made in France, but in England.  It doesn&#x27;t last.  It smells similar to the genuine Je Reviens which has been my perfume for about 55 years, so I know the genuine article. This appears to be a watered-down version.  I don&#x27;t think it is real &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; although that&#x27;s what appears on the package.  Maybe it&#x27;s cologne or some version of Je Reviens.  I am very, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my mom on her 70th birthday... it was her favorite perfume as I was growing up. I give it two stars because Amazon packaging was perfect! Product packaging was less than to be desired as the perfume was not properly sealed and the entire bottle spilled all over her when she opened it. Not cool! Just FYI. I will be returning it and wish me luck on the replacement :-)</li>
    <li> This is one of the scents I use to love in my younger years.. but I&#x27;ve rediscovered it through Amazon.. What&#x27;s was old is new again. You will love this perfume; an elegant feminine scent.. try it, I think you will love it as well.</li>
    <li> i guess this perfume was popular in the 70&#x27;s.  it&#x27;s my mom&#x27;s favorite.  can&#x27;t really tell you if it smells good or not, but i purchased this for my mom&#x27;s xmas present this year and she thought i spent $100&#x27;s since the bottle was so large.  made for a really great present, especially since i guess this perfume is kind of hard to find.</li>
    <li> The newest incarnation of JeReviens.  I have gotten more complements on this perfume than you would imagine.  It is my go to for every occasion.</li>
    <li> This is getting harder to find. It is a lovely summer scent and have been out for a couple of years. My husband first got it for me over 40 years ago and I fell in love with it. I am now enjoying it again.</li>
    <li> I have loved this perfume for years, but for a long time it was not available in the US.  Thanks for bringing back my favorite, and thanks for the GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> The product arrived empty. When i opened the box, the perfume had been watered on the box. So i paid for nothing.</li>
