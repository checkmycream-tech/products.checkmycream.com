      <li>I&#x27;m completely happy with it</li>
      <li>The quality on this mirrors great.</li>
      <li>but I guess that is what these mirrors are made for, lol.</li>
      <li>The unit looks and works great.</li>
      <li>The light is very bright (sometimes seems too bright).</li>
      <li>Very elegant.</li>
      <li>This mirror is very stylish and has a nice bright light with just the right amount of magnification.</li>
      <li>:) Otherwise this is about as luxurious as it gets.</li>
      <li>I love this mirror.</li>
      <li>Amazon replaced it very quickly without any problems.</li>
      <li>it was easy since I had a nearby outlet.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice mirror, looks very modern, matches chrome decor.</li>
      <li>The mirror has a beautiful modern look and the light around the rim is a bright, cool white LED powered light.  </li>
      <li>It extends more than enough to see probably more than you want to see and the led lighting is quite nice.</li>
      <li>It is worth $5.00</li>
      <li>But the light is better, and I have it mounted on a back wall from which it&#x27;s not seen from the side...</li>
      <li>In fact, the mounting bracket is pretty nice if you need a lot of different attachment options.</li>
      <li>It was my first electrical project but after plenty of research online</li>
      <li>Fast shipping definitely worth the price</li>
      <li>A more open bracket would not allow those options.</li>
      <li>I had bought another makeup mirror first</li>
      <li>/&gt;It would be much better if the hole in the bracket was large enough to allow the wires/nuts to pass through.  </li>
      <li>that was not bright enough, but this one is perfect.</li>
      <li>The only difference is the light on this mirror is SO much brighter.  </li>
      <li>The lighting that comes with the mirror is very helpful.</li>
      <li>The swinging arm works really well and is very durable.</li>
      <li>a good item but the bracket is poorly designed.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to adjust the mirror up or down for viewing.</li>
      <li>Valid enough, but not a huge issue if you are handy.</li>
      <li>To mount the item, you have to thread the wires through the bracket, twist and nut them, then screw down the bracket and attach the light to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wired and installed it myself with an old work electrical box.</li>

    <li> Mirror was in great shape when it arrived.  I wired and installed it myself with an old work electrical box. It feels as sturdy as anything a pro might do.  It was my first electrical project but after plenty of research online it was easy since I had a nearby outlet.  My only issue is the wires are made up of tiny flimsy strands which makes stripping and capping them difficult. The mirror has a beautiful modern look and the light around the rim is a bright, cool white LED powered light.  There&#x27;s no bright spots behind the rim like you might expect with LED based lights, it is consistent.  Very elegant.</li>
    <li> a good item but the bracket is poorly designed.  To mount the item, you have to thread the wires through the bracket, twist and nut them, then screw down the bracket and attach the light to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be much better if the hole in the bracket was large enough to allow the wires/nuts to pass through.  hard to explain but it&#x27;s cumbersome to mount.  The unit looks and works great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful mirror. Fast shipping definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> I received the box from Amazon and immediately opened it to inspect. The mirror was not fastened correctly and as I looked under it I could see it was fastened with two pieces of double stick tape.  DO NOT BUY THIS MIRROR.  It is worth $5.00</li>
    <li> works well. excellent appearance.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have paid attention to the measurements.  Smaller than I expected .</li>
    <li> This mirror is very stylish and has a nice bright light with just the right amount of magnification. I had bought another makeup mirror first that was not bright enough, but this one is perfect. It is easy to adjust the mirror up or down for viewing. If I had to give any suggestions, I wish the mirror was a little larger and the adjustment arm is a little stiff. But over all this is a great purchase!!</li>
    <li> I would give it 0 stars if I could.  Bought this in January for my home that we were in the middle of remodeling.  Took it out of the box yesterday to install and the mirror is attached to the frame by sticky tape, and of course it was not attached.  And, since the return time period has passed, I am now stuck with a very expensive defective mirror.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a difficult mirror to install--and complaints about its difficulty in mounting are both merited and not. To start with, you are going to need a behind the wall electric feed--some source of electricity that you can use to power the unit. Someone complained that the connection wires have to be fed through a small hole on the mounting bracket. Valid enough, but not a huge issue if you are handy. In fact, the mounting bracket is pretty nice if you need a lot of different attachment options. A more open bracket would not allow those options. I mounted mine in the middle of two mirrors on a back wall above a vanity. It extends more than enough to see probably more than you want to see and the led lighting is quite nice. Bottom line: if you are not handy, hire an electrician. If you are terribly vain, find a mirror that will not show you every pore on your nose. :) Otherwise this is about as luxurious as it gets.</li>
    <li> We recently had a honeymoon in Aruba at the Marriott Renaissance hotel and they have a mirror that is similar to this mirror in the bathroom suites.  The only difference is the light on this mirror is SO much brighter.  I love this mirror. I can see fine details, even the scary stuff that you probably don&#x27;t want to see in the mornings but I guess that is what these mirrors are made for, lol.</li>
    <li> arrived broken, and inspection confirmed that it was poorly constructed..  Returned</li>
    <li> I just wish it was a little bigger and also could be rotated horizontally.</li>
    <li> The quality on this mirrors great. The lighting that comes with the mirror is very helpful. The swinging arm works really well and is very durable.</li>
    <li> A little thicker than what I imagined.  But the light is better, and I have it mounted on a back wall from which it&#x27;s not seen from the side... And I leave it pulled out from the wall about halfway of its limit anyway.  Cost less than the others I was considering, and (without comparing side-by-side) I&#x27;m completely happy with it</li>
    <li> Very fragile. The mirror arrived broken twice! 2 issues: insufficient packaging and bad design</li>
    <li> Initially the mirror came defective - the extending arm was crooked and mirror looked crooked because of that too. Amazon replaced it very quickly without any problems. It is a nice mirror, looks very modern, matches chrome decor. It was a little tricky to install. Wish it was less expensive. The light is very bright (sometimes seems too bright).</li>
