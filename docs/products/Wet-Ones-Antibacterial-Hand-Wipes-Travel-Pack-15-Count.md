<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A must have in your purse, or to send in backpacks to school with the kids. love the travel size!</li>
    <li> Love these! Perfect compact size to stick in the diaper bag. I wipe down the changing table and tables we sit at. Perfect size!</li>
    <li> I live in a location that has sub standard cleanliness and just a culture of ignorance to hygiene so if you don&#x27;t want to get sick and you also can&#x27;t get to a place to wash your hands frequently Wet Ones are a must.</li>
    <li> I travel at least once a week, so these come in really handy with all of the airplane armrests, rental steering wheels, hotel phones &amp; TV controllers, etc. But they&#x27;re also really handy in places where there are a lot of kids, crowds, etc. Keep one in every vehicle and backpack/travel bag, it can save you or someone you care about from more cold/flu exposure than we experience already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a little tip- if you ever have a pack that has become dry inside, just add alcohol gel (i.e. Purell) to them to get them back to normal.</li>
    <li> Both of my sons are thumbsuckers.  These are a must after the playground, playdates, and nursery school pick up. I keep a pack in every bag and the car.</li>
    <li> Keep these in the car for easy access when out at stores, etc and want to keep hands clean.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, keep one in every car and all my purses</li>
    <li> Bought this just before my first flight with baby and sanitized the airplane seat (touchscreen, tray, seat pocket, arm rests) to ensure that baby was free to touch things without picking up germs. Very easy to pack. Very easy to use. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> definitely a well priced item. these hand sanitizer  are very convenient. for 11$ its definitely a good deal compared to the individual pricing i find at the local drug store.</li>
    <li> I buy these hand wipes all the time and carry them in my purse. I prefer these over the hand sanitizer since I can also use them to wipe off other things, in a pinch.  Ordered them as a set since it was cheaper in bulk.</li>
    <li> I love having wipes handy in my purse for cleaning my hands if I can&#x27;t wash them in a restroom, or for cleaning them if they get messy while we&#x27;re out. I especially keep a pack handy if we&#x27;re on vacation, at a concert, or at some kind of festival/fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Convenient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Package sometimes comes open--not the best to keep in your purse&lt;br /&gt;This scent is strong</li>
    <li> I like having these on hand because if the water&#x27;s off, I can use one and then rinse my hands with water from a bottle. Much better than trying to use soap and not get the bottle messy. Also, we have a couple of tortoises (a Russian and a Leopard), and these are great to use after tending to them.</li>
    <li> I love wet ones. This is a great deal</li>
    <li> Good price and the thickness of each sheet is ideal. Not thin like a wet nap, but rather thick so you can actually wipe something off your hands. I keep a pack by the door in case I need to quickly wipe down. I also use them on my dogs legs and paws after a walk. It didn&#x27;t get 5 stars because the scent is not that good. It&#x27;s mild but not really a good smell. Just sort of like a whatever smell. For the price, I wish the packs came with 20+</li>
    <li> 2 cars, and people always visiting, I go through these things sadly, way toooo quickly.  Local stores sell them individually for more, so the holidays come along with sales and WHEN POSSIBLE BUY IN BULK (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stock up for the holidays and wipe everything down since everyone of my co-workers seem to be coughing )-:</li>
    <li> These packs are so convenient and I am never without them. I signed up for subscribe and save so I have a continuous supply. They are great to throw in the diaper bag for those messy little hands!</li>
    <li> Received this item on time. Wipes or just like the individual ones you buy at the store. Bought these for my messy toddler and they work great. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with him being irritated by the wipes. Will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> I take these on every flight.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awkward to have to get to a bathroom to wash your hands when you&#x27;re out, so it&#x27;s great to be able to reach into your purse and sanitize your hands on the go (plus you can use them to wipe down your phone occasionally, never a bad idea!). These give a MUCH cleaner feeling than regular hand sanitizer lotions or gels, no stickiness. These also contain ingredients to kill stomach flu/norovirus, something most hand sanitizers do not contain (especially not the alcohol based ones). I usually got around 3 colds per year, after using these this year I got one and it was very mild.</li>
    <li> These were great to have along on a two week bus travel tour overseas. Not too small, not too big, can be carried in purse and always clean and handy. I bought some more for my next trip and for a friend who will soon be traveling.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I paid for. If you actually close and open them properly, they stay moist.</li>
    <li> cant&#x27; live without these things, staple in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I bring these to the gym to wipe down the equipment before and after I use it.  I use 2 together since they are small.  They fit my purpose nicely.</li>
    <li> I love these travel packs.  I keep them in my purse and in my diaper bag.  Use them to wipe my child&#x27;s fingers and face, my hands, tables of restaurants, grocery carts, everything.  I love that they are food safe, unlike Clorox wipes and they don&#x27;t stink like the other wipes.</li>
    <li> I am a health nut/germ-a-phobe.  I have a 1 yr old daughter and 2 older boys.  I always keep a package of these wipes in my purse.  Before my daughter sits in a high chair or shopping cart, I wipe it down with 1 of these wipes.  And before we eat dinner out, I have my older kids clean their hands with one of these wipes.  The wipes are large enough and wet enough that they can share one between both of them.  With the subscribe &amp; save discount + amazon mom (which is free if you have prime), you receive 20% off on your purchase bringing the total down to $0.82/pack.  That makes these wipes cheaper than I&#x27;ve found them for in the store.  Most stores carry them for at least $1 for each pack.</li>
    <li> Does the job at a good price point.  If you are concerned about organic or non-alcohol containing products, this is not for you.  If you just want to get your kids&#x27; hands sanitized after the playground, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Love these, we keep these in the diaper bag for when we are on the go!</li>
    <li> Whether or not these work, my wife loves to use them.  When she found a 15-count on amazon I thought her head would explode!  She is very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Very useful for travel.  This item was a very good value, much less expensive than purchasing individually, if you are a regular user of this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really lovely to have these around. I just throw them in all my bags. They do leave a slightly sticky residue after use, but this does subside after some time. The fragrance could also be improved.</li>
    <li> Keep a pack of these Wet Ones in my truck, in the kitchen and in the bathroom.  Very nice to have handy.  Never know when or where I might need one.  Also, have noted no skin irritation and I have even used to wipe my face occasionally.</li>
    <li> Essential for travel and trying to keep well while coming in touch with new germs and bacteria. I keep a package in my backpack as well as one in my purse. I prefer them to the bottle of Purell because they&#x27;re easier to find &amp; use. I use the bottle of Purell on my toothbrush each evening.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in the tiny community I live in, but like having them in my car, so I stocked up.  Odor a tad intense, but they do the job.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re primitive camping, oh hell yes!</li>
    <li> As a new Mom with a baby that was born during flu season, these little packs were in my purse at all times. He his 9 months old now and I still use them like crazy! I use them on my hands, on tables when we eat out and on the baby toys. If I use them on his toys, I rinse with water after. I don&#x27;t know that the solution on the wipes is safe for the baby. I like these wipes much better than hand sanitizer and they do not dry your hands out like sanitizer. A must have!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have two little once and I take Wet Ones with me everywhere.  I love the packing of this one, its much lighter and easier to carry,  The price is very good if you order from Amazon Mom.  I think every parent should have this in their cars, bags, and homes.  Love It!!!</li>
    <li> Love these. I have two small kids so I pack them everywhere. Diaper bags, glove compartment, strollers, my purse, etc.</li>
    <li> I have a pack of these everywhere - car, work, and in my purse. I use it to clean up emergency spills in my car, wipe my hands clean, AND .... take stains out of my clothes when i spill on myself! Seriously, these wipes are awesome. Try it next time when you get a coffee stain on your leg.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these anti-bacterial Wet Ones in my local stores for some time and could find only the sensitive-skin type. I was about to give up when I remembered to look on Amazon. Of course, I found them. Since I \\&quot;can&#x27;t live without\\&quot; these, I am grateful once more to Amazon for having them.</li>
    <li> comes with it&#x27;s own shelf box. Great for our pantry or car when you need a quick wipe. Now I always have some packs on hand.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes. Not only do they clean but they disinfect. I love bringing them out with the kids and feel confident that their little hands are ready for an outdoor snack or a quick cleaning before eating out. The packs only have 15 wipes so we go through them quickly but they are so convenient I don&#x27;t mind changing out the packs to keep my bag less bulky.</li>
    <li> These packs of Wet Ones are great for campng.</li>
    <li> Love that it is small enough to fit in any sized purse.</li>
    <li> When traveling you fun into every known and unknown form of bacteria. It is indeed, a good thing to have in your stead a supply of anti- bacterial wet wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I turn on a faucet or flush a toilet in an airport I break one of these out. I keep a supply in my bag. The wipes in the ladies room are dry and many people may have put their hands on it. I also swipe the Cash machine before I use the touchpad. Just a few things to keep my health the best it can be. While going up or down a stairway, I have one if these in my hand to use on the stairway bar. You never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good buy, and you will be very glad every time you pull one out. I keep a supply in my bag at all times. If you need one, ask me for one if we pass by in an airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 08-06-14</li>
    <li> Handy to have in my purse.</li>
    <li> These are phenomenal to have in the diaper bag and have come in handy!!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t run out for awhile</li>
    <li> These are good for ANYTHING...they can clean yr hands, body, and get this, they are the best  for removing  stains from clothing and upholstery, wiping a surface, and they are safe. The red packs are the best. Prefer the flat travel on over the tub so they are thicker. These have a unique  smell, but it is not bad, and it won&#x27;t make you smell like a baby .As my husband says, they are MacGuyver of wipes.</li>
    <li> cheap, bulk, and shipped to me in 2 days.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a store of these wipes. They are perfect for Moms on the run. My 3-yr-old sucks her fingers so I am OCD about keeping her little hands clean. These are perfect when we&#x27;re away from home. I find myself using them all the time. Seller was great. Amaazon Prime made it a no-brainer!</li>
    <li> I use for Blepharitis worked like magic for 8 days and then back to what I had before, IMPORTANT I am not a doctor so check with a Health Professional before using on eyes. Great priver.</li>
    <li> a must have for the kids lunch bag.</li>
    <li> A very useful and handy size. Good price value.</li>
    <li> Perfect for baseball!</li>
    <li> I really like the travel pack. They are so handy. In my line of work, I&#x27;m in constant contact with the public; sick and well people. So having the wipes instead of the hand sanitizer liquid cleaner makes me feel that I&#x27;m able to clean and scrub (if necessary) my hands well. The small size fits well in my purse, glove compartment and lunch bag.</li>
    <li> Product is terrific. When we travel these wipes are great. For twins they are a must. I would definitely recommend these for a handy travel companion.</li>
    <li> We go through these a lot--ordering them through subscribe and save means we don&#x27;t run out, and that is absolutely so convenient!!</li>
    <li> Convenient. Does job. Very moist. Does dry a little tacky or sticky though, but not annoying enough to make me stop using them. Will reorder more once these are gone. These are very convenient to strap to my poop bad dispenser for walking my dogs and for slipping into the side pockets in my car. Convenience while performing the job is the name of the game, and this succeeds at it.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They are a bit pricier and bigger pack than the individual packs of a different brand I used to use.  However, they also are more reliably long lasting.  The packet reseals, stays moist, and after multiple orders I have never had a problem.  I was always careful with germs, especially around the kids, but after going through chemo and really needing to be careful, I got used to using these.  I try not to rely on them more than necessary, since hand washing is best, but life doesn&#x27;t always allow for that so this is much better than waiting too long.  The pack is small, hits easily in most purses or backpack pockets, stays moist, smells fresh but not overpowering, and overall I have been very happy with each purchase.  The cost is affordable too.</li>
    <li> Great way to help stay healthy with today&#x27;s busy schedules. Helps stay fresh while on the go.  Nice flat packaging for less b mulko</li>
    <li> love having wipes more than antivbacterial lotiion.. i like the store-brand wipes i get from wegmans grocery store better..cheaper price and thicker and stronger and have a better smell. also i use them before i eat lunch between classes and these wet wipes leave more of a residue than wegmans kind so prob wont bother with wet ones brand again</li>
    <li> These wipes are really nice quality. They don&#x27;t rip apart and the packaging is such that they stay moist until the package is empty. The smell of the wipes is nice and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This product was not for me. It is highly scented so anyone with sensitivity to scents or allergies like asthma should steer clear of this product. I wish I would have known this before I purchased it because it cost me to return it.</li>
    <li> We took a bunch of these packs on a recent cruise. They fit nicely in day packs, purses, etc. We were able to clean our hands wherever we went on the ship and on shore.</li>
    <li> Do you have a kid?  Then you need these because it turns out they are messy as hell.  Seriously, put that dirt down!  Even though I&#x27;m sure this just makes the bacteria that survive stronger, I feel a little better at the time.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. You can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price either. I low that I can buy these in bulk...put one in my purse, one in the car, one at work, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch actually SEALS (unlike cheapy type &amp;#34;resealers&amp;#34; that peel up), and product stays fresh. Just avoid keeping it in a hot car for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love these, great for all kinds of things, keep in office, cars, desk.  Life is messy and the little packs are super convenient.</li>
    <li> A little hard to pull out just one from a full pack.</li>
    <li> I throw a pack in my &amp;#34;kill bag&amp;#34; when hunting. It can be messy to skin, gut and bone out an elk and these are a little luxury when doing that kind of task.</li>
    <li> These packs are awesome, especially if you are a little bit OCD like me when it comes to washing your hands. I keep a pack in my car, a few packs around the house, one at my office, etc. The packaging keeps the towelettes fresh for quite some time, and obviously it is super portable. I much prefer these to using hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> These are terrific! The Seller&#x27;s price point was without equal!&lt;br /&gt;Wet Ones are great and better than that liquid hand sanitizer that &#x27;hospitals&#x27; use because they actually remove a good amount of dirt and bacteria from your hands or any hard surface. Unlike liquid hand sanitizers (that leave your hands sticky and filthy at the end of the day once you ACTUALLY wash your hands), Wet Ones are cloth-like so they can better clean. The fact that they are packaged in small resealable packs is but another great feature about Wet Ones because you can carry them in your purse, knapsack, pocket or leave in your desk. Wet Ones are also great for cleaning telephones and keyboards at work or at home, as well as door knobs. They are great for your diaper bag as well for when toys, pacifiers, etc. need to be cleaned. They are great for your children to take with them to school to clean their desks, seats, lockers, etc. The use of Wet Ones can teach and promote better hygiene for youngsters in this day of contact ringworm and flu, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Wet Ones are a great product with a myriad of uses. I would definitely recommend Wet Ones for everyday use while you are traveling through your world of different adventures.&lt;br /&gt;Wet Ones have a million and one uses; far superiour to liquid sanitizers</li>
    <li> I have these everywhere, in each car, every handbag and give them to others.  I like them better than the liquid type hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> So easy to carry around! I have them in every GO bag and in the trunk of each of my vehicle.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use these wipes for years before we had our baby. We use this for travel on airplanes especially. We wipe down the seat rest and the tray tables and I can&#x27;t tell you how gross they are when we do! I feel so much cleaner when I&#x27;m done after changing my daughter when we are not at home and I feel like she&#x27;s cleaner as well. A total MUST for your diaper bag!</li>
    <li> Love being able to carry a pack of these in my purse as a mom. Stayed moist for a long time! Durable, thick wipe.</li>
    <li> These are great for the car and come in handy on road trips.  We have even stashed a few in the kiddos backpacks for school.</li>
    <li> This is not the single use packs.  First time buying such things for kids school lunch clean up.  I returned it without problems.  Looks ok for outings, but still a waste if not used quickly.  Probably will dry out if kept in the car over time.</li>
    <li> Convenient &amp; easy to use.</li>
    <li> As a mother of 3 children, these are a must in my purse and vehicles. I like the small packages that can go with me.</li>
    <li> These fit perfect in your purse.  I always have a packet with me.  Perfect for cleaning kids but also great for cleaning my own hands.</li>
    <li> I am a germ a phobic and always travel with wet ones. Their easy and convenient to use in this travel pack and I thought the price was right! And they really last long even after opening the pack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought various types of travel hand wipes from the independent packaged ones to larger packs and these appear to have the most liquid in the packaging. This is to my preference because it allows me to truly feel as if the bacteria on my hands, steering wheel, door handles, etc…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about the repercussions from consistently using antibacterial products on the hands; however, since using these I&#x27;ve minimized my households illnesses drastically.</li>
    <li> These are an absolute must when traveling.  Used these all the time during our flight and cruise to Europe back in May 2015.  Wiped down our seats, trays and touchscreen tv&#x27;s.  When we got to our room on the cruise ship, I wiped down everything; remotes, bathroom, closet, nightstand, balcony etc.  They are not strong smelling and then are super easy to use, as expected.  Thankful that I remembered to purchase these!</li>
    <li> Loaden with chemicals. Read the ingredients. Strong smell and leaves residue. May be killing bacteria but these certainly will no longer harm my child.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0045XDGZ4 Wet Ones Antibacterial Hand  Wipes Travel Pack, 15-Count (Pack of 12)(colors may vary)]]  Super good product--cloths are large enough to clean the hands completely.  They stay wet long enough to get rid of germs.  We use them for travel as well as shopping trips and dining out.  Great product, great brand.</li>
    <li> these small packe are sooooo easy to keep anywhere--purse, glove compartment,  travel bag or anywhere.  they smell great--not mediciny--and dry fairly fast. i ordered them to be shipped every 6 mos and this way is a great value and super easy to always have a good supply on hand.</li>
    <li> After my local discount store stopped carrying these at 97 cents a pack (a steal) and started selling the individually wrapped ones - a pain - the cheapest I could find were 1.69 each. Amazon&#x27;s price is great when you consider the free shipping and convenience of buying in bulk because I have run out out and I use these all the time. Best things since chocolate milk!</li>
    <li> We use tons of these wipes. They are extremely convenient. We keep some in the car, use them camping, around the house.</li>
    <li> Good product, just what I was looking foe.</li>
    <li> I have been carrying Wet Ones Hand Wipes in my purse for years.  My decision of purchase from Amazon is based on value.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo182C2UUXJLYKJ]]The best wipes for my big family. As long as I remember myself - I remember the Wet Ones. They help us stay clean, non-sticky (DURING OUR LONG WALKS AND TRAVELLING) and HEALTHY.</li>
    <li> We use these all of the time, and they really do help to get some of the ick off when you can&#x27;t get to a sink.</li>
    <li> I have these in my purse and diaper bag to use them with my toddler, and due to size they fit everywhere. The wipes are good and really gives you a clean, refreshing feeling. Better than just using a liquid sanitizer. Highly recommended on the go, and the canister version for the same product is excellent to keep in the car, or in the stroller.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! AFTER THE PACKAGE IS OPENED, THE PACKAGE DOESN&#x27;T RESEAL. IT LEAKED ALL INSIDE MY FAVORITE LEATHER BAG. I WISH I COULD RETURN THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> perfect size pack. Not too many, not too few. perfect for backpack, purse</li>
    <li> These are great to use when in the office where our supply person won&#x27;t buy any sanitizer. Keeps my hands nice and clean and true to the name ARE actually WET.&lt;br /&gt;Very cool and I keep a pack with me in the truck and in my work bag.</li>
    <li> I use these in the car all the time. They are perfect for cleaning grandsons hands and mine when riding in the car.</li>
    <li> When I go on long, all-day hikes for cycling adventures, I always carry this in a handy place--usually in a close backpack pocket, or in the top pouch of my cycling bag. I&#x27;ve literally used them dozens of times. The &amp;#34;single&amp;#34; kind works best, since it&#x27;s always sealed. I need to know that it will be ready to go when I need it. Today for instance, I had some minor foot cuts due to a bunch of &amp;#34;foxtails&amp;#34; embedded in my shoes. Out come the &amp;#34;Wet Ones.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ Good product, recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris Lawson</li>
    <li> I keep a package of these in my purse at all times. They are great for any messy cleanup, for cleaning hands, etc.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a parent. these are a life saver to have with you.  The small packages makes them so much more portable than big wipe packs.</li>
    <li> These are very handy and are packaged conveniently so you get a full sized wipe out of a small container. The color variety is a fun bonus.</li>
    <li> Very convenient to keep in the stroller or a purse, or anywhere for that matter.  package is thin enough to fit into a back pocket.  We use it to clean hands when soap and water are not available.</li>
    <li> Great product very efficiently delivered !  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel, vehicle or other mobile lifestyle applications.</li>
    <li> Extremely handy, pun intended. Reseals like a champ. I live in Arizona and have not run into a pack that went dry yet, so that says a lot. Recommended.</li>
    <li> rec&#x27;d as promised and as advertised</li>
    <li> not the flushable kind, but smells very fresh.</li>
    <li> A perfect travel companion</li>
    <li> We bought this packet of Wet Ones before taking an airplane/road trip.  Each of us used a travel packet of wipes that we kept in purses and backpacks.  While soap and water is always the best approach to handwashing, when we were far from soap and water (Yosemite&#x27;s vault toilets had no soap, for example...) we could use these wipes to clean up with.  The packets are self-sealing and managed to keep the remaining wipes moist until the packet was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be using these again next time we travel.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful after my messy, creative son is at the park and there is not an option to wash his hands, so we can eat snacks.</li>
