    <li> I figured this would be like the other waist trimmers I have used and bought cheaply from local stores. I recently had our third baby and have successfully lost my pre-pregnancy weight however am struggling with toning up my stretched out midsection. I put this on after it was delivered just to see how it fit being its a &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;. I got caught up between cooking, taking care of 3 kids, putting away laundry and forgot I had it on. By time I took it off, my midsection was already sweaty and I hadn&#x27;t even done my workout. Just a few chores around the house. I&#x27;ve never gotten half the results with other belts as I have this one. I can&#x27;t wait until the Spring comes and I can get back to my daily runs with this on! So glad I bought this product, thanks to it I am looking forward to my beach body this summer after three kids!</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t do what I needed to do for my man.</li>
    <li> i rated 4 stars cos I did&#x27;t like it very very much may be they should fabricate it a little more havier</li>
    <li> been wearing this for 2 days and i already lost 20 lbs. J/k it does what it is supposed to do. also works well as a back support also if doing heavy deadlift.</li>
    <li> I use it 2 to 3 times a week, its been more than 3 month and it still like new. I recomend this brand, it is really good and does what it is supposed to...</li>
    <li> I love this waist trimmer. Probably one of the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. After I took the band off post-workout, sweat came pouring off of me! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever sweat that much in my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It works , I gave it 5 stars kuz it helps with your back also , would definetly suggest it to anyone</li>
    <li> I expected the band to be much wider.  The width of the waist band is the same size of all other bands.  Also, the band velco strap is too small in comparison of the width of the band and it does not keep the top or bottom pulled tightly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this trimmer.  I wear it to work, sleep in it...you name it.  I see a considerable difference in my waist.  It has gone down considerably!!!!!!!!!I bought two of these to change in, and will probably buy another one.  Inexpensive and very helpful.</li>
    <li> Great waist trimmer belt for the money. Sturdy and gets the job done.  For men or wanna be men only.</li>
    <li> Good quality stretch material it does not move when I run and it helps provide good thermal temperatures to help me burn that body fat. Most of the time I even forgot I had it on by far the best product that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> use it every day on my three mile walk in the morning.  very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Love it and it doesn&#x27;t fold or roll up it stays in place the entire workout!!</li>
    <li> Much better than my old one.  More plyable and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I fully understand that when using trimming belts most of the weight that I see being loss is from water weight.  I have however noticed over the past several weeks a solid weight loss, fat loss.  The belt also helps retain warmth in the muscle on long runs or intense workouts where my back would normally fatigue.</li>
    <li> Nice Fit..East to Clean.</li>
    <li> Works great! Feels great!</li>
    <li> What I Did Was Rate, The Mc David Waist Trimmer, Five Stars. This Product Helps Me Lose Over Weight. What I Do Is Strap It Around My Waist, And Work It Out, At My Job.</li>
    <li> It worked well at first few weeks then it got worn out and I stopped seeing process.</li>
    <li> one of the best waist trimmer i have ever use :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can kill the extra shape with this relaiable trimmer</li>
    <li> My back feels great during running. It makes my midsection sweat in the area I need it. The Velcro keeps it tight.</li>
