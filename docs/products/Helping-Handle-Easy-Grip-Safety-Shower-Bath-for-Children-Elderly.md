      <li>Does not provide very good suction.</li>
      <li>These work great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is great for the on the tub itself.  </li>
      <li>Great product when it stayed put.</li>
      <li>These would be great on a shower/tub that has one of those bathfitter things but with tiles it can get tricky.</li>
      <li>It does however work great for glass surfaces.  </li>
      <li>Good Idea</li>
      <li>IT WILL LET GO OF THE SURFACE ON ITS OWN, IS NOT SAFE!WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT MANUFACTURER</li>
      <li>Works OK in my shower stall which is molded plastic.  </li>
      <li>I know that has more to do with the size of the tiles in my shower/tub</li>
      <li>In addition, I love the fact that it is moveable.</li>
      <li>It does state on the box to make sure each suction cup is fully on a tile, not on a grout line.</li>
      <li>Make sure that it will continue to hold her weight while she is showering.</li>
      <li>i thought I was going to love this item.</li>
      <li>Glad I gave it a test run before letting my elderly father use it.</li>
      <li>I found the back or front wall to be the best spots.</li>
      <li>B004HIGWLW Helping Handle Easy Grip Safety Bar for Shower /Bathtub, for Children, Adults &amp; Elderly]]</li>
      <li>Lifts glass table tops securely and easily for cleaning underneath.</li>
      <li>To my surprise it is working just fine.</li>
      <li>Starts fine</li>
      <li>so weight was not the issues - just cheap workmanship.  </li>
      <li>Initial holding power is great</li>
      <li>The price does indeed reflect the quality of this product, CHEAP.</li>
      <li>At first she wasnt so sure about the bar, as it fell off the shower wall.</li>
      <li>suspicion is that the product needs a non porous and super clean surface in order for the cups to hold.</li>
      <li>Another positive is that they can be removed easily or even taken on trips to use else where.</li>
      <li>You absolutely must have a smooth surface to mount to.  </li>
      <li>I will make it my business to super clean and polish any part of my tub enclosure before relocating a future handle that I will need as more years go by.</li>
      <li>Others are right about their staying power.  </li>
      <li>I have a one piece fiberglass tub and unless you find the exact spot to snap the grip on to - it falls off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first couple of times I used it, it pulled off the shower wall.  </li>
      <li>first day I used it.</li>
      <li>But once we had it back up again, she is able to grip it pretty well and feel secure enough that she will not fall.</li>
      <li>but they didn&#x27;t stay put very well with her.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m assuming it might stick to tile, but it absolutely doesnt work on our one piece tub/surround.</li>
      <li>It could really harm an elderly person pulling on it.  </li>
      <li>Very upset with this item.</li>
      <li>The issue is the suction cups are bigger than most standard bathroom tiles.</li>
      <li>Bought it for my ours senior parents to add a little more support in the shower.  </li>
      <li>so it was completely unusable.</li>
      <li>but lacks the suction holding power on natural stone tile.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind, my kids are both under 5 so, not super big or strong.</li>
      <li>As I first placed the cups on the middle partition, within a few hours it would fall off.</li>
      <li>My far back wall stays completely dry at all times and has no soap or water deposit buildup.</li>

<li> It was a waste of my money.</li>
<li> The tile in my tub is very slightly textured--</li>

<li> By the time it broke, it was too late to return.</li>
<li> it will slowly lose suction.  </li>
<li> I cant imagine an elderly person trying to pull their body out of a tub or something, and then having the suction break, and then the person falling and seriously injuring themselves.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the worst product I have ever purchased. Item fell off from wall first day I used it. Just received it and  already broke. The suction plastic thing broke off. Dangerous!! I am on crutches, had surgery due to broken bone in foot and had purchased item to help me with balance in shower. Very upset with this item. I could&#x27;ve slipped and broken my other foot or something else.</li>
    <li> I have medical issues involving my bones. I cannot afford to suffer a fall getting into the tub. I also cannot afford to install permanent handles. These work great. Another positive is that they can be removed easily or even taken on trips to use else where.</li>
    <li> I have a one piece fiberglass tub and unless you find the exact spot to snap the grip on to - it falls off.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for the on the tub itself.  I found the back or front wall to be the best spots.</li>
    <li> Do not buy----will not stick---useless!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick as well as I need</li>
    <li> Please do not depend on this product to stay attached. I do not use it to lift myself out of the tub, just as backup to recline in the tub.  It does not keep itself attached.  Must be reattached on a regular schedule.  Even then, I would not depend on it to support any weight.</li>
    <li> The suction cups were not the correct distance apart to miss the cracks between the tiles.  Therefore the handle would not suction to them properly.  The item could not be adjusted for different tile sizes to miss the cracks so it was completely unusable.</li>
    <li> They fell off the walls, I tried inside the shower and outside too, I could not get them to work, so returned.</li>
    <li> Great product when it stayed put. It had a habit of coming off the wall. I know that has more to do with the size of the tiles in my shower/tub but that should be taken into account when producing this product. It does state on the box to make sure each suction cup is fully on a tile, not on a grout line. The issue is the suction cups are bigger than most standard bathroom tiles. These would be great on a shower/tub that has one of those bathfitter things but with tiles it can get tricky. It states that it can support a person up to 300lbs and my mother in law is all of 100lbs soaking wet but they didn&#x27;t stay put very well with her.</li>
    <li> Surfaces must be absolutely flat for the device to work at all. Even when device is used on a perfectly flat surface (glass, plastic) it will slowly lose suction.  Initial holding power is great but I would not trust it after 30 seconds or so......</li>
    <li> Good Idea but lacks the suction holding power on natural stone tile.  Bought it for my ours senior parents to add a little more support in the shower.  Starts fine but within a short time falls off.  It does however work great for glass surfaces.  Lifts glass table tops securely and easily for cleaning underneath.</li>
    <li> This is just a comment on why some reviewers found that the handle does not stay attached to the tile:&lt;br /&gt;please remember to follow these instructions:&lt;br /&gt;1- Flip UP the tabs.&lt;br /&gt;2. Position on surface, avoiding joints.&lt;br /&gt;3- Flip DOWN the tabs.&lt;br /&gt;No discovery here, its all in the package instructions.</li>
    <li> Initially I was very disappointed with the product. We have acrylic (cultured marble) tub liner in three sections of the tub. As I first placed the cups on the middle partition, within a few hours it would fall off. Frustrated, I then tried to place the product on the  back wall. To my surprise it is working just fine. I only need it for balance in and out of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suspicion is that the product needs a non porous and super clean surface in order for the cups to hold. My far back wall stays completely dry at all times and has no soap or water deposit buildup. I cannot say the same for the other parts of the tub that do have water and soap buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will make it my business to super clean and polish any part of my tub enclosure before relocating a future handle that I will need as more years go by. Hope this info helps others that were as frustrated as I was.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother.  The grip has worked so well for her.  She has the extra grip for getting in and out of the shower.  A terrific product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you have any type of shower surround. I&#x27;m assuming it might stick to tile, but it absolutely doesnt work on our one piece tub/surround. Glad I gave it a test run before letting my elderly father use it. About five pounds of pressure pulled it off the wall.  Unfortunately, my husband pitched the box, otherwise this would be going back.</li>
    <li> Others are right about their staying power.  However, after the 3rd time, it has stayed for a week.  God my fingers crossed.  You absolutely must have a smooth surface to mount to.  The tile in my tub is very slightly textured--no go.  Works OK in my shower stall which is molded plastic.  Only time will tell with this.</li>
    <li> This piece works well.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t stick and then broke entirely on about the fifth try. A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my mom. At first she wasnt so sure about the bar, as it fell off the shower wall. But once we had it back up again, she is able to grip it pretty well and feel secure enough that she will not fall. I think she may have been a little concerned since the handle fell, but now I think she likes the product.  I just want to give a little while longer.  Make sure that it will continue to hold her weight while she is showering. In addition, I love the fact that it is moveable. It does not install in the shower especialy since she lives in an apartment.</li>
    <li> i thought I was going to love this item. But,nowhere on the package did it relate that they could not be moved once they were placed on shower walls. So, therefore, I am unable to use them as they are unable to be placed once they have been stuck the first time.I guess you must decide where to put them and leave them. I cannot use them as I moved them and the second time they would not stick. It was a waste of my money. I was disappointed.  Thank You for inquiring. Donna J. Johnston</li>
    <li> This is garbage. I ordered 2 of them. The first one out of the package was broken. The plastic used to make this item is sub par. You would have to be insane to trust the well being of yourself or others to this product. The price does indeed reflect the quality of this product, CHEAP.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered.  Moral of the story - you get what you pay for.  I ordered this prior to ankle surgery.  The first couple of times I used it, it pulled off the shower wall.  The last time, it pulled off the wall and fell apart.  I weight 115 lbs so weight was not the issues - just cheap workmanship.  Unfortunately, I ordered it a few weeks prior to surgery - just trying to be prepared.  By the time it broke, it was too late to return.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS HANDLE FOR DIABLED PERSON!  IT WILL LET GO OF THE SURFACE ON ITS OWN, IS NOT SAFE!WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT MANUFACTURER AND LET THEM KNOW THEIR PRODUCT IS UNSAFE!</li>
    <li> Does not provide very good suction. Was not impressed,  thought about returning it.</li>
    <li> Broke within a week, sad cause I really need this handle.</li>
    <li> This Easy Grip is the worst thing I have ever purchased.  It stays on the shower wall about two minutes before it drops into the floor.  Should be against the wall to sell it.  It could really harm an elderly person pulling on it.  Well maybe not, I don&#x27;t think it would stay on the wall long enough for an elderly person to try to grab it.[[ASIN:B004HIGWLW Helping Handle Easy Grip Safety Bar for Shower /Bathtub, for Children, Adults &amp; Elderly]]</li>
    <li> This doesnt work and is a piece of junk. I&#x27;ve had it now for only a month &amp; a half &amp; it is falling apart. The suction cups on the ends have popped off, and I&#x27;ve never gotten it to stay on for very long. I used it on my sliding door so my kids could open it on their own, and half the time the suction would fail while they were attempting to open it. Keep in mind, my kids are both under 5 so, not super big or strong. I cant imagine an elderly person trying to pull their body out of a tub or something, and then having the suction break, and then the person falling and seriously injuring themselves. Its a waste of money.</li>
