      <li>Gives you great color after just one session and smells awesome which is a must.</li>
      <li>Great lotion</li>
      <li>Cost effective with great results.</li>
      <li>and i rubbed it in good.</li>
      <li>Still good tho</li>
      <li>but once in a while you switch around bc you dont feel the tingle as good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting a good tan</li>
      <li>or if it&#x27;s just good bulbs.</li>
      <li>The tingle isn&#x27;t too hot if you&#x27;re really experienced with tingles!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
      <li>love the scent and the way it makes me feel.</li>
      <li>9 more minutes.</li>
      <li>This is okay</li>
      <li>I love the snooker tanning lotions, but this is not one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Love the color I get from this lotion.</li>
      <li>But it did do its job on tanning pretty good.</li>
      <li>This would be a good tingles for a first time user of tinglers.</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t streak, tingles a little more than I would prefer but still awesome tanning lotion!</li>
      <li>Its a decent product, worth the money, just not as great of a result as i was expecting.</li>
      <li>This is fine.</li>
      <li>Def for experienced tanners only.</li>
      <li>I realized it did have a light tingle to it</li>
      <li>, I like that if I&#x27;m wearing light clothing, it doesn&#x27;t stain or have that after tan scent.</li>
      <li>after putting on skin it dilutes and smells much more calm.</li>
      <li>I got a nice tan after the third time in the bed, and the tingle is pretty nice also.</li>
      <li>the pink snook ie bottle of tingle which work great with tingle and bronzer that do rub off on clothing,  but that&#x27;s what they do</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only good thing was the return label was quick &amp; the refund was even faster.</li>
      <li>This lotion gave me an amazing color boost instantly!</li>
      <li>whew,but i saw results right away</li>
      <li>Hot, Sizzling means it feels like a blow torch on your skin!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>But back to the this lotion, I thought ok it says HOT TINGLE</li>
      <li>it was so hot n</li>
      <li>and ive used snooki hot in the pink bottle and liked it</li>
      <li>I got this because i wanted a really hot tingle</li>
      <li>Love this lotion, definitely a tingler so don&#x27;t get if you have super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I found it similar to her original hot bronzer to give you a comparison.</li>
      <li>it felt like it was shaking the whole bed.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The real one is tented.</li>
      <li>Smells very SPICY.</li>
      <li>The smell of this lotion is also not very nice compared to most.</li>
      <li>and I was kind of skeptical at first when I opened it.</li>
      <li>, this lotion is great smelling for those days you just don&#x27;t want to smell or get your clothing dirty.</li>
      <li>my legs that didn&#x27;t seem nearly as bothered by it- began burning like the rest of me.</li>
      <li>my heart starting beating so fast</li>
      <li>After about 3days I did look darker and myskin wasnt dry (very moisturized).</li>
      <li>This literally burned my skin, this is definitely not for anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is not good at all, and they tingle is not as strong as I think it should be.</li>
      <li>But other than that it works really well.</li>
      <li>They opened the bottle they sell and put some in a clear cup and then the amazon product Ina clear cup and placed them next to each other-</li>

    <li> Smells very SPICY. after putting on skin it dilutes and smells much more calm.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! My bottle is almost empty! And i will definitely be reordering</li>
    <li> I got this because i wanted a really hot tingle and ive used snooki hot in the pink bottle and liked it but once in a while you switch around bc you dont feel the tingle as good. Well i bought Ed Hardy Body Shots. Great Tingle but awful lotion. After using it for a bit my tan looked i had used a sunless tanner and missed places and i rubbed it in good. But back to the this lotion, I thought ok it says HOT TINGLE so i bought it. I couldnt feel a thing or tell i could used it. WONT BE BUYING AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> I love the snooker tanning lotions, but this is not one of my favorites. The smell is not good at all, and they tingle is not as strong as I think it should be. This would be a good tingles for a first time user of tinglers. It&#x27;s also very thick. But it did do its job on tanning pretty good.</li>
    <li> This lotion gave me an amazing color boost instantly! The tingle isn&#x27;t too hot if you&#x27;re really experienced with tingles! I found it similar to her original hot bronzer to give you a comparison.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t do nothing for me at te tanning. It didn&#x27;t give me a tingle like I wanted not a good product.</li>
    <li> Left me a little spotty. But other than that it works really well. I got a nice tan after the third time in the bed, and the tingle is pretty nice also.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Hot Skinny Sizzling&amp;#34; felt like someone put a flame on my skin! I had to jump into the shower and my skin had red hives and little blisters! This literally burned my skin, this is definitely not for anyone who has sensitive skin. Hot, Sizzling means it feels like a blow torch on your skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing was the return label was quick &amp; the refund was even faster.</li>
    <li> Omgoodness.......If u like tingle,this is for u......i dont like tingle on my face but thought i would try it anyway........it was so hot n tingly...whew,but i saw results right away and it gave me the lift i needed past my base tan.......would use everywhere but my face...great product.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, definitely a tingler so don&#x27;t get if you have super sensitive skin. Gives you great color after just one session and smells awesome which is a must.</li>
    <li> I paid for this month&#x27;s ago. I was looking forward to using it to get a tan for the summer but it never came in the mail. Now I&#x27;m pale and out of the money I paid.</li>
    <li> I read an article about this product on my tanning salons website. They opened the bottle they sell and put some in a clear cup and then the amazon product Ina clear cup and placed them next to each other- the one from amazon is white. The real one is tented. And I don&#x27;t feel a tingle at all. Total waste of money on this.</li>
    <li> So after debating on whether or not to try this I decided to give it a go recently at my local tanning salon. The girl said it would tingle and make my skin a little red afterwords but that it was normal. So being my naive self I lathered up and not feeling anything yet got into the bed. What I felt when those bulbs lit up can only be compared to being doused in capsaicin cream and getting strapped to the surface of the sun. My body felt like fire ants has covered me from neck to toe..my stomach started cramping uncontrollably to the point I looked desperately around the small room for anything to puke into...my heart starting beating so fast it felt like it was shaking the whole bed. Every painful thing I had ever felt started flashing though my mind like a movie and all I could think was how I&#x27;d take any of those pains a thousand times over this. The emotional pain of my fathers abandonment was nothing NOTHING compared to the physical pain of this lotion. I questioned why snooks, why would you want to hurt my like this. But I am no quitter and so I laid there regretting not keeping that life insurance policy I once had. After about 6 min into it I began to calm down slowly getting used to the feeling of being on fire. This is okay I thought. This is fine. That was when my previous saving grace- my legs that didn&#x27;t seem nearly as bothered by it- began burning like the rest of me. 9 more minutes. At 8 I Lost the ability to blink and waited for the angel of death to take me, fading in and out of conscience. When the timer went off I grabbed the bottle and searched the ingredients. I don&#x27;t know what they put in there but it felt like the tears out of hell had been bottled and sold to me. that&#x27;s what it felt like. Hell. Only after I told the girl my misfortune that had just occurred one door away and her seeing my skin beat red did she tell me that now that she thought about it there was another lady who used it and came out of the room naked and asked them to call 911...only use this product if you need some serious life perspective.</li>
    <li> Love the color I get from this lotion.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of complaints that is fake, it is in fact the real thing. I bought this at the salon and Luke that is white and does tingle, I like that if I&#x27;m wearing light clothing, it doesn&#x27;t stain or have that after tan scent. Great lotion if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for,  I&#x27;ve used lots of tingle lyrics and this one does just that,  I often use ruby, and the pink snook ie bottle of tingle which work great with tingle and bronzer that do rub off on clothing,  but that&#x27;s what they do, this lotion is great smelling for those days you just don&#x27;t want to smell or get your clothing dirty.</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning lotion! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! Cost effective with great results. Def for experienced tanners only.</li>
    <li> love the scent and the way it makes me feel. tingle i believe holds my tan longer and faster results. best for the price too!</li>
    <li> It does not a hot tingle to it like it&#x27;s suppose to. So that&#x27;s disappointing. I&#x27;m getting a good tan but I&#x27;m not sure of it&#x27;s because of the lotion or if it&#x27;s just good bulbs.</li>
    <li> Its a decent product, worth the money, just not as great of a result as i was expecting. Still good tho</li>
    <li> awesome lotion, didn&#x27;t take but 3 days to arrive! won&#x27;t streak, tingles a little more than I would prefer but still awesome tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> I just received my order last week and I noticed the o the tanning lotion is WHITE!! IM ALREADY REALLY DARK. and all bronzers Ive seen are brown color and I was kind of skeptical at first when I opened it. But when I went to the salon to tan I realized it did have a light tingle to it but not what I was expecting. After about 3days I did look darker and myskin wasnt dry (very moisturized). But im just wondering is the lotion supposed to be white ??</li>
    <li> The hot tingling made my skin red, and is pretty uncomfortable for about ten minutes. But it made me rally tan.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product at all. Not a very strong tingle, also leaves you with a blotchy tan. The smell of this lotion is also not very nice compared to most. Save your money and do not buy this.</li>
