<li> it&#x27;s smaller than average size, it allows you to do precision work on the brows and lashes otherwise impossible.</li>

    <li> I love this set!  In particular, the eyeshadow blending brush is BOMB.  Does exactly what I need it to do.  Also, the smallest brush in the set is great for doing your eyebrows with a pomade.  Would definitely recommend and was cheaper than at Ulta!</li>
    <li> perfect price, delivery, quality! thanks</li>
    <li> Great quality, super soft and lux brushes. Only wished there was a larger powder brush included. The powder brush in this set seems small to me, but I guess it&#x27;s based on what I&#x27;m used to. Still, I&#x27;m happy with the quality,  look &amp; feel of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Great. I love this product line wanted brushes and got them at a good price. I recommend this highly. Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> just wish it didnt come with a foundation brush. but great quality</li>
    <li> Luv these brushes !!&#x27; They are so soft and  puts on your make beautifully . My friend also bought a set and she is so happy she purchase them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. I have nothing to say but good things. My only wish is I would have gotten them sooner.</li>
    <li> Lovely and incredibly soft brushes. The handles are nicely weighted due to the fact they are made of metal, plus they have a fantastic rhinestone jewel on the ends of each brush as a really cute embellishment. You get the same IT cosmetic quality brush you would expect...SUPER soft, beyond belief! Performance and durability are stellar as always and you get a great carry case that doubles as a stand if you flip it over. This set is supposed to be a travel set, but these brushes are really full sized, not the stumpy little things you normally receive in travel kits. The powder brush is not the crazy humongous powder/buffing brush IT is famous for, but it works beautifully for blush/bronzer and powder, so it is a nice addition to any collection. You will also receive a standard foundation brush, it is not the big IT buffing brush you see on youtube all the time, but it is the most luxurious flat foundation paddle brush Ive ever seen!

    <li> I Love these It cosmetic brushes i got for Christmas! They are soft,durable with no shedding and really provide great application of eyeshadows,concealer and foundation. I have been using Mac brushes forever and last year got Lancome brushes for Christmas and i use Jane Iredale.  Now these. I have no complaints. They work better than MAC. Mac brushes shed and bristles end up all over my face.</li>
