<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loved it. I wasn&#x27;t really sure on buying it because of the reviews, but I got tired of looking so I took the risk and I&#x27;m glad I did. They are great! Truly recommend. It does smell like paint a first but after a few days it goes away or when you wash them.</li>
    <li> I have plenty of brushes but wanted to actually have a kit. The quality is great, soft and applies makeup evenly. :( my eyebrow brush popped off after a month but all the other brushes are in great shape still look brand new. (I dont wear make up everyday, clean them monthly. so I dont know how it will last for the everyday user)</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes and they came quickly</li>
    <li> The brushes came and I have to say I was impressed by the fan brush. It was very dense and nice. However the other few face brushes were not very usable. Thankfully I was getting it mostly for the collection of eye brushes. Although it did smell heavily of paint after washing the brushes it went away. The eye brushes are in all kinds of shapes and sizes; they also may not be the most soft brushes but for the price you can&#x27;t really beat it.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes for how cheap they were! They did kinda smell at first but once they were out for a day or two that smell went away! Love them</li>
    <li> Worst brushes i have ever purchased. They smelled bad the bristels fell off and very low quality. I wish i would have invested on something better now i have this.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about these brushes, I suggest to invest in good brushes, the tops keep coming off because it&#x27;s made with a separate top piece which loosens after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Smelled funny but after washing them once it was gone ( note: please wash toxic chemicals aren&#x27;t good for your skin ... Duh) wonderful brushes just wish they were more flexible and not so stiff. Came in 2 days very fast. Would buy again for gifts.</li>
    <li> These brushes came super fast I&#x27;ve used them already and I love them</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes they work so good for contouring and everything!!</li>
    <li> Was really disappointed. Right after I received these the hair started falling out immediately right after use.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I was looking for a professional complete set for cheap. Discovered the brush hairs are a little rough, and fall out once I attempted to properly clean them. Clean my brushes with a proper cleanser and then swirled in and rinsed. Brush hair would fill the cup. Would have spent more had I known the quality.</li>
    <li> the brushes became very stiff and it hurts in my skin. I had to throw away a third of the brushes. I dnt recommend this product.</li>
    <li> so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good set of makeup brushes that are at a good price range especially because I am new at this and didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive set I would mess up or something so I came across this and I love it the brushes are soft and are in good condition I recived the brushes in a matter of 3 days I expected much longer but well worth my money definitely will recommend these to everyone!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any issue with shedding, and these brushes are all good quality. However, some sections of the bristles of the larger brushes are bent from the packaging and a couple of the smaller brushes have several dents along the handle. The bag also smells very strongly and unpleasant. Overall, though, the quality for the price was great.</li>
    <li> It is not good. I tried applying liquid foundation, oh boy. Don&#x27;t even attempt. Literally it was like &amp;#34;HELLO!, Welcome to ShedCity!!!&amp;#34;. Some of the eye brushes actually came off of the stick, the fuzzy brush part is now separate off of the handle. Cool? They work I guess for the meantime while I get my new brush collection. Some HIGHER end stuff, would be much more worth the cost.</li>
    <li> These brushes are not that great,, the hairs are very stiff on all of them, and the blush brushes the hairs fall out onto your face while applying your plush.. I bought the onest from coastal i think it was and they are superior compared to these!</li>
    <li> I wanted natural hair brushes and 95% of the total are synthetic shadow brushes are all flat, not round or stuffed contains. Product description had no clearly information...</li>
    <li> Amazing makeup brushes for a low price! If you are a beginner and looking for good quality cheap brushes, these are it.</li>
    <li> Love how organized the brushes are! However the smell of paint is soooooooo strong it made my head hurt. They pick up makeup okay but they shed a lot.!!!!!!!!!!! They are okay but if I had a choice I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Received them in two days thanks to Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great! Wonderful quality- they are super soft and well held together. Also, there is a perfect variation of brush shapes and sizes, i&#x27;m set with all these brushes. My favorite is the fallout brush which is sturdy enough to sweep fall out but gentle enough not to smear my makeup. The case is very convenient and is of a great quality too. Good deal for the price!</li>
    <li> Bought as a present was well liked</li>
    <li> Great brushes . The bag stinks really bad. I washed it but it still had toxic fumes being released. So I threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes don&#x27;t leave hairs and overall a good product. ...except I had ordered the &amp;#34;rod brushes &amp;#34;which showed thicker round handles,  However I received these thin ones. And the picture was changed. Alwells .</li>
    <li> Love! Use mine every day!</li>
    <li> This brushes seem great at first but started breaking one bye one... Go by the Elf brushes!</li>
    <li> Less than half are soft, the rest are st if and can&#x27;t put makeup on without feeling like it&#x27;s a straw broom on your face, and the ones that are soft shed like crazy, horrible not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! The only thing wrong with them, are the hair falls out of the brushes like crazy. Just the bigger ones. But other then they are great for the price.</li>
    <li> Great buy!! SOO many brushes!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it describes. The brushes smell new and they are all there. Glad I ordered this order.</li>
    <li> the eye shadow brushes are great but the blush brushes were really cheap and shed a lot. but you cant ask expect much for the price</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give 1 star. These brushes are terrible they are so rough on my face and the brushes shed terribly!! A waste of money :(</li>
    <li> This performs exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> PAY FOR THIS 15 SO IT WAS A NICE LITTE THING FOR MY DRAG QUEEN SHOWS&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT THE BIGGEST ONE ITS VERY HELPFUL GIRLS WINK WINK</li>
    <li> Love! Love! Love! I got exactly what I ordered and paid for! Thanks much!</li>
    <li> I give these brushes 4 stars only because there is a lot of shedding from the brushes, other than that the brushes are good if you want to expand your brush collection. The shipping was fast. The brushes were nicely packaged in the pouch. However they did have a new paint scent to them so i washed each one  in hand soap and disinfected them with some alcohol and the smell went away.</li>
    <li> Good for someone who is a beginner or doesn&#x27;t put on makeup a lot.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter had me order it for her to give as a gift, so I really don&#x27;t know anything about it.</li>
    <li> Brushes are not the highest quality but the amount of brushes and all the different styles of brushes makes up for it by far . I was pleasantly suprised. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. I Would order from this seller again. I was a little upset that their was duplicate brushes, but I suppose you can never have too many. Which is why I only gave it four.  You got plenty of brushes for the price. Over all I was very happy with this order</li>
    <li> I love it, even though it sheds a little when I first use but love it, use it everyday..thank you</li>
    <li> Came in 2 days after ordering.  Looks great!</li>
    <li> I put on makeup everyday so I&#x27;ve already worn out my previous brushes and I bought this set as replacement and I&#x27;m satisfied with it. It came out just as I expected and the tips are fine and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very soft, the brushes pick up color like crazy!  I&#x27;ve washed all of mine with Dr. Bronners soap when i first got them.  The case isn&#x27;t great, and I&#x27;m an amateur and have no idea how to use some of the brushes, but I like having the different sizes to play with.</li>
    <li> As a professional these make-up brushes are very affordable and a great deal! Easy to clean and do not break. Soft and would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Not good at all it hair in the brushes are to rough and hard witch it&#x27;s not good for the face. Do not recommend unless good want rough brushes</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Low price. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> very good for the price it does have a smell but let it air out over night and your fine! and they feel really nice :D</li>
    <li> These brushes seem about as high quality as another set I bought for a similar price... not like I was expecting terribly high quality for the low price...! BUT the case smells so bad of chemicals (like nail polish remover or paint) that I was afraid to keep this indoors with my parrots (birds are extra sensitive to chemical odors). I&#x27;m sure it will air out in my dusty workshop, and I don&#x27;t intend on using the case anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you intend on storing these in the case they come in, and are bothered by strong smells, don&#x27;t buy this set.</li>
    <li> I saw this brush set and saw some really mixed reviews. Most of the comments were about the quality of the brushes. I&#x27;m not terribly concerned with the quality of the brushes. The case did have a really strong smell when it first arrived. It gave me a really bad headache to be honest but the smell did go away once it sat out for about an hour. As for the quality, there is a little bit of shedding on one of the blush brushes but not on all of them. The handles are long and great for application and the case is really convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to what I didn&#x27;t like. I&#x27;m really surprised that so many people said this was a great set for starting out. What&#x27;s even more shocking is that many makeup artists said the same. Two of my best friends are both Pro MAC makeup artists and believe when I say, this set will never past their test for any level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set has ZERO eyeshadow brushes (sponge applicator does not count). This is really just for the face. The brushes are great for highlighter and concealer. There isn&#x27;t even a good contour brush in there so you can&#x27;t really call if a face set. The fiber on the blush brushes are ok. They are really soft mut much to large for that type of fiber because the there is no structure making brush application a challenge. You&#x27;ll end up with blush all over your face. I really only use two brush out of the whole case and that is to concealer my eyebrows. Most of the brushes are literally repeats of themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, don&#x27;t waste the little $16 it costs or find another set to supplement whats missing in here. I was looking to save some money but this was definitely a waste. I will continue to buy Mac and Sephora brushes.</li>
    <li> Work well, never have a problem with loose bristles or caking. I plan on ordering more for my sister soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with these!&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple things I didn&#x27;t like such as the paint smell everyone talks about and the smaller brushes are kind of hard and don&#x27;t put shadow on very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But every brush came individually wrapped, and I haven&#x27;t experienced much fall out when it comes to bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, these are absolutely amazing and I would recommend them to any person just getting interested in makeup. :)</li>
    <li> Awesome pushliners and concealer brushes, but there weren&#x27;t really any blenders at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great Christmas present for the girl who loves makeup</li>
    <li> Alot if duplicate brushes</li>
    <li> The brushes are great except for the eyeliner and angle brush it should have more support and hair (thickness). Overall great buy.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my purchase .I received them the next day which was awesome</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great beginners set</li>
    <li> Lots of shedding . And one of the brushes were broken.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay for beginners</li>
    <li> Great variety of brushes, can&#x27;t beat it for the price. Some of the brushes aren&#x27;t as soft as the others and those same brushes do have bristles that fall out often, but you get what you pay for. Overall a good purchase. Make sure you buy brush sleeves/ guards/ sheaths and a brush cleaner/ shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love it true to picture , brushes are clean and they don&#x27;t shed</li>
    <li> Decent brushes. Not overly impressed, but not upset with purchase.</li>
    <li> Everything I need and more all in one very organized case &#x3D;) I don&#x27;t think I need all the brushes but it&#x27;s best to have extras, the price was reasonable, quality of product is reasonable. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes because I wanted to make my collection bigger.So i got most of my brushes from here and i thought i would check it again. well i came on here and saw how cheap they were and i decided to go ahead and try it. so I ordered them and now im glad i did:) i love them so much:))))))))))))))) the only thing i dont like about them is that they kinda smell when they get out of the package but the odor is gone in like 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> had to glue some on the brushes back on to the handle part but over all i love them</li>
    <li> This set has everything you&#x27;ll ever need if you&#x27;re a non-pro like me. I&#x27;m not sure how many hundreds of different brushes a professional makeup artist uses. Anyways, as for the brushes themselves, they are all well made (the wands) and the bristles are very soft and doesn&#x27;t fall off. It doesn&#x27;t smell of paint as opposed to some reviews, and the leather roll-up bag is really nice, not cheap. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Loveeeeee and worth it smell didnt kill or break me out and i use them daily and no shed yet. Recieved them before Christmas</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a fan of these brushes. They smelled a bit funny and were harder than I hoped.  They also shed more than I&#x27;m used to.  I found an alternative on Amazon that worked better for me.</li>
    <li> 3 of the pieces are eye sponge brushes...you know the ones you get with your dollar store eyeshadow. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. Also, several of the brushes are very similar in the eye brush department. They are soft though so I&#x27;ll give them that. They have the quality of elf brushes at half the price. Carry case was kind of cheap looking. I was expecting leather but in retrospect, I was comparing to Morphe brushes so that&#x27;s not fair..But I look back on my purchase, I&#x27;m like..&amp;#34;Do I REALLY need 32 brushes?&amp;#34; No I don&#x27;t and neither do you... at least not these...I&#x27;d go look at those real technique brushes or the other brushes that popped up when you searched for brushes on amazon.</li>
    <li> Definitely not the greatest quality, but for the price this is a great starter kit from someone just getting into makeup!</li>
    <li> Some of the bristles fell out.</li>
    <li> the brushes look and feel cheap. I have bought better at this price point. i regret my purchase</li>
    <li> Great gifts for my makeup artist sisters. They love them, and I didn&#x27;t have to break the bank.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it. I bought it as an &amp;#34;I love you gift&amp;#34;. I was nervous about buying it as she is a make up guru. She said it&#x27;s super good quality.</li>
    <li> I figured this would be expensive, but not at all! The brushes look nice, and are great quality. Not to mention you have every kind of brush you need, in a nice case! The only thing is yes, to me it smells very strongly of paint. When i said strongly, i mean strongly. Other then that, i love them</li>
    <li> Not the best quality, but there are a lot of brushes in the package.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes, and honestly you can&#x27;t beat the price. They are nice quality, all I do is wash with a little baby soap and water. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them falling apart. I&#x27;ve been using them for nearly a year now.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this item!!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth paying for, the amount of pieces is perfect for a makeup kit!</li>
    <li> The shipping was great it came very fast. The product is definitely not professional grade though. The case is a great pleather case with slots for each brush and rolls up nicely. My first issue is the cheap synthetic hair they use on the brushes. The bigger brushes have hairs going in all directions and are not grouped together well at all. The smaller brushes are very stiff and brittle. Now my second issue is how they attached the fibers to the handles, it was done very poorly. Just touching the brush you will have at least 5 strands fall out. Using the brush on your face you end up with hairs all over you like you used a shedding cat as a makeup brush. The setup is good it goes smallest to biggest. Honestly most of the brushes are not needed at all. They are not numbered or labeled in any way so you don&#x27;t know which is which if your not a expert. It&#x27;s definitely a disappointment and not really worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> For the price it was great.</li>
    <li> Not very good quality.  Ended up using most of them as art paint brushes. Some of the eye shadow brushes are better. But they are rough and scratchy. Only gets worse after washing.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great. However there is no labels to tell you what each brushes are for. The hairs on the foundation brush shed a little. But overall great produc.</li>
    <li> it was a present for my bestfriend for christmas and she loves it. i did have to air it out for a couple of days when i first got it because it did smell like paint. would buy again.</li>
    <li> After one use the bristles started to fall out of some of the brushes making them unusable.</li>
    <li> my female family loved them to no end</li>
    <li> Gave my daughter a set and I got one for myself. For the price its a steal. I have more brushes than I know what to do with.</li>
    <li> Would be five stars if brushes were labeled</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect and I love how it comes with a bag of its own.It does have a smell in the beginning but I think it comes from the container. I love how this feels very smooth on my face.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really nice, like them very much</li>
    <li> Compared to other brands selling brushes at a way higher cost for less product, this was a great deal.  Not only a great deal, but I use these every day.  This was my first time buying a brush set... Didn&#x27;t expect them to be of such high quality.  32 pieces for the same price you could buy just 1 or 2 at? Come on, that&#x27;s an easy decision.</li>
    <li> Very impressed. You couldn&#x27;t buy these individually for ANYTHING less than $3 a piece, making it a $90 kit. It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> absolutely great product I love it 100% very soft and extremely  fast service. best price ever !!</li>
    <li> This brushes are great, good quality and the price was great , shipping was fast, and was highly impressed bought 3 more sets</li>
    <li> Nice. Brushes of great quality disregarding of the low price.</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> some brushes are amazing some, nlt zo much</li>
    <li> Came in good condition . Love how they feel . And they really work . 👌 I&#x27;m obsessed with my new brushes 😍</li>
    <li> Poor Quality, waste of money</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe anyone that speaks bad about these brushes. They are absolutely awesome. Of course i&#x27;m sure there are those instances where things go wrong. But i am here to tell you it is one of those long shot instances.</li>
    <li> The brushes arent what I expected. Even though they were for a low price i did not expect to have so much brush hair fall out. Some of the brushes are good while the others are useless due to the way it applies makeup .</li>
    <li> Brushes are really stiff</li>
    <li> All the brushes are really nice and soft. Everyone was complaining of the smell, they don&#x27;t smell bad you just have to wash them before you use them. And yes the bigger brushes shed but that&#x27;s why you wash them and they don&#x27;t shed after. For the price is actually really good :)</li>
    <li> I love that there&#x27;s so many different brushes and if you are serious about make up you will use them all! I wish the larger brushes were not so sparce with the bristles but they get the job done...........I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I love the variety of brushes provided with this set, however if you are not a makeup artist, there will be brushes in here you have never seen! Also, unlike a lot of kits the brush does not have the type of brush stamped on it. Be prepared to do some research to figure out how to use these things!</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes and I absolutely love them! They work great and it comes with more bushes than I thought it would. Very easy to clean also. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> totally awesome. This set has everything you need. great price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!! These brushes are very very nice and high quality</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes and the case it comes in so it&#x27;s easy to keep them sorted and organized. But because I&#x27;m new to makeup I have no clue which brush goes with what kind of makeup and they aren&#x27;t labeled. I&#x27;ve been putting off googling all the info and I basically just guess as to what to use for what. The brushes don&#x27;t fall apart, like I&#x27;ve had happen before. They seem sturdy and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest brushes in the world. Some of the brushes are very hard while others were soft. But it does it&#x27;s job for the price. I love the holding case its great.</li>
    <li> It is ok , expect for the smell , it is so bad.&lt;br /&gt;One more comment on the brushes hair, it could fall easily</li>
    <li> the cheapest bushes ever ! they poke your skin not soft at all and they broke so easily because the brushes were just glued on to the stick! and they are not the same color as in the picture i do not recommend this item to anyone</li>
    <li> Very happy with product and all the brushes are awesome!</li>
    <li> Some brushes are good others well... But all in all, happy about the purchase. Wished they were named the brushes so I can kinda use it properly or knew what&#x27;s used for what.</li>
    <li> Enough brushes to get me thru at least 2 years! I bought another one for Christmas as a gift for my sister.</li>
    <li> Some of the hairs fall out while using... Pretty frustrating. Overall it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; set.</li>
    <li> Arrives so fast, I love all the brushes, for that price its a steal, instead of spending a lot of money on expensive ones this is worth it.</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes pretty much makes them worthless...</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a nice brush set to have and when I received the brush set it was a Mac knock off and the brushes fell apart with in the second day do not waste ur money !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Average cheap brushes</li>
    <li> I had decided to get a nice set of brushes because my face was breaking out horribly from using my fingers to apply my makeup and thought I would have to spend a fortune.... these brushes are a bank saver! They are super soft and work great. The only reason they did not get 5 stars from me is because the brushes are not labeled and I am a beginner with brushes.... but over all awesome brushes!</li>
    <li> good for how cheap they are, but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them if I&#x27;d gotten to try them first.</li>
    <li> Each brush is very good. Everything it say is true. The brushes are good on the face and it is soft and good to use. It&#x27;s a brush for everything you need to apply your makeup. So I would say, is order them because the price is good and the use is great.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for a beautician class, very good purchase, I intend to purchase another couple of these for friends for gifts</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using these brushes, and was bummed to see them fall apart when doing so.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! They are smooth and so many choices!!!! I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better set at this great price :) even my mother in law ordered a set!</li>
    <li> They have work good, not professional but works fine. I am happy to have them. They help me a lot when I want to make something new to my make up</li>
    <li> I liked some of the brushes. But the face brushes are not soft enough to use on the face. I had to buy some other brushes to replace them.</li>
    <li> great for the price! onley deducting one star because had one of the brushes tip brake off when I received it. not going to use that brush anyway so no worries.</li>
    <li> Great buy. All the brushes were in great condition, except one which the little things would fall out of it. The rest of the brushes are great! Would definitely recommend to buy.</li>
    <li> Would say I&#x27;ve enjoyed the product however by my daughter&#x27;s continuous usage, I say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes. Not bad for the price. Smelled awful but once you wash them they are great. Nice storage bag too</li>
    <li> I hesitated getting a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; makeup brush set like this because of all the people who claim these type of sets reek of an unbearable chemical smell and of terrible brush hair fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say these brushes don&#x27;t smell at all ... The vinyl case smells like new vinyl but it isn&#x27;t overbearing - and I have an extraordinarily sensitive nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the hairs on the brushes I&#x27;ve used, so far, haven&#x27;t shed at all. If you like e.l.f. brushes, then you will love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush set expecting regular- no brand brushes. most were bad quality and some were ok, some were even bent up. they also came in and had a mac sign on the package and a mac logo on all the brushes. they were fake mac. do not buy. I made a very bad decision.</li>
    <li> Honestly this was a steal&lt;br /&gt;1.large brushes are very soft&lt;br /&gt;2.application is good&lt;br /&gt;3.there is a smell but if you let it lay open for like 10 min it will go away completely&lt;br /&gt;4.they are good quality especially for this price very good&lt;br /&gt;5.shipped and arrived before the given date which is so awesome I was ecstatic when I received them early</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think they would be this good, but i do love them :)</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. Loving them!!!!!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a cheaply made set, but the brushes are OUTSTANDING! Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had, beats the name brands.</li>
    <li> the eye shadow brushes are not at all soft they feel more like paint brushed then makeup brushes but the big fan brush works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Has an assortment of many brushes that come in a very stylish case!  The case is a black leather type that is very soft.  Able to tie shut which is a nice feature.  Great product!</li>
    <li> They are falling apart</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them !!!&lt;br /&gt;They were individually packed I used them last night to do a couple of my friends makeup and it worked smoothly and there soft to the skin :)</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. After reading others reviews of this product I had decided to purchase it and it was everything I thought it would be. The brushes vary from size and texture. The best part is the case that comes with it, very convienient. So happy I made the decision to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> The product I ordered arrived to my hose 2 days after purchased. The brushes were soft clean and undamaged. I am very happy with this product and I would recommend to anyone who does makeup, beginner or professional.</li>
    <li> love the brushes good quality</li>
    <li> does exactly what I needed it to do. wish I would have went with the 60 pc though.</li>
    <li> I had bought this brush set because I was getting back into makeup but didn&#x27;t have any brushes. I used these one time and the foundation brush started shedding. I had hairs stuck on my face in my makeup for the brushes. They weren&#x27;t expensive so I really didn&#x27;t lose out on alot of money but the quality was poor and I expected to use more than one time.</li>
    <li> You pay for what you get. But it definitely gets the job done!</li>
    <li> It is what I expected and now I can play</li>
    <li> Nice quality and clean very easily. Came quickly! good value!</li>
    <li> my daughters love it.</li>
    <li> I love this set so much! I was nervous when I ordered it, thinking that the brushes might be low quality since this set is so affordable. But the brushes are great quality!!! I love them so much andd there really is a brush for all your needs in this set!</li>
    <li> They work, My make-up looks great...I was surprised of how many brushes theres is to use, but each and everyone is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get these but they are not the best and there is a lot of multiples.</li>
    <li> Fabulous set of cosmetic brushes at a great value. There are more than enough brushes for every aspect of makeup application!</li>
    <li> As far as quality goes, all but the large, red brushes are nice. For the red ones, the bristles were falling out as soon as I opened them. I used the smaller, brown brushes for the first time today and though they didn&#x27;t pick as much pigment as I&#x27;d like, they were nice.</li>
    <li> I will end up throwing most of these away or using them for some nail art or something. You get what you pay for. These shed like crazy.</li>
    <li> When these arrived, most of the tips were unglued, which thankfully was easily fixed with a little patience and super glue. They also had a very strong &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;spray paint&amp;#34; smell.  I washed them all, including the case in warm soapy water to attempt to remove the smell.  However, I ended up having to throw the roll up case away and keeping the brushes out, open to air, in order to remove the smell.  I was very disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> I so love my brushes and it is worth to buy, everything you need for in a make up brush is there.  Although this is not a branded brushes, but hey it is still a make up brush.</li>
    <li> Love them, Great for the Price</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Great deal and brushes are awesome.</li>
    <li> Great all the sizes and more</li>
    <li> Yo hard on face and the little hairs start to break all over face.. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes! Did NOT experience the bristle fall out that everyone else seems to have gone through but I will say the smell of the plastic bag is pretty stout. But I didn&#x27;t buy the product to smell its bag so that can be forgiven! Would give five stars but I noticed that the brushes are not as soft as one would expect for the face but maybe that will better with time.</li>
    <li> Good..but still working with this brush to know about each one what for?!</li>
    <li> i wanted some makeup brushes without spending a load of cash. they shed a tonne. wouldn&#x27;t repurchase. id rather invest the extra dollars into something more substantial. the bristles are also very hard/tough which makes them very difficult to use around the eye areas. Right now, i only use the spooly brush as well as a few of the tiny softer flat brushes.. as soon as i am able to afford a quality set, i will be discarding most of these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are OK some are very good and other seem thin and shed. There are a lot of doubles of the a few brushes. I don&#x27;t mind having doubles. I think this set is good as a gift, for a beginner or younger girl.</li>
    <li> For the price they are decent at best. They seem to be made fairly on the cheap and alot of Bristles were lost after only one application</li>
    <li> Nice. Put together cheaply  the handles just come apart. But for the price I can&#x27;t  complain.</li>
    <li> I was expecting medium to low quality because of the price but literally they are awful and unusable and stiff, I wish I never spent the money!!! DONT BUY THIS!!! any good reviews are probably fake ones by the company</li>
    <li> Top quality make up brushes!&lt;br /&gt;Love them!</li>
    <li> Look better thank they work.</li>
    <li> Brushes keeps falling off</li>
    <li> Wife seems happy, so I&#x27;m happy. Pretty inexpensive too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with makeup and makeup products, so when I saw this brush set for this price, I had to try them out and I love them!</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. Nice dense bristles on the brushes. They also wash well, didn&#x27;t lose too many bristles.</li>
    <li> Brush came in good condition. No fault found. No bad smell was noticed. Everything is great! It&#x27;s surely a great buy!</li>
    <li> Alot of brushes! WOW.  Don&#x27;t need all these brushes.  But an excellent price.  The bristles seem to be fine.  I would recommend and the price was great.  But no one needs this many brushes.  I don&#x27;t think makeup artists needs this many either.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> The sheer number of brushes is impressive. They are all soft and of varying appropriate stiffness. The handles are sturdy and smooth. The brushes themselves also feel quite lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off because the case is made of a pretty sad (or funny) faux leather. However, it is sewn well and is thick enough to be useful.</li>
    <li> as described good product</li>
    <li> So many different brushes to use, decent quality for the price. Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I purchased the black color of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product somewhat reluctantly because of the reviews, but I am glad I purchased them. The first image is of the product after opening. The brushes came well-packaged and all brushes were in their respective spots and not strewn around. The product does have a slight smell (lowering the rating to 4.5 stars). The bag smells so terribly that I may throw it away if putting it outside for a few days doesn&#x27;t get rid of it. I wasn&#x27;t planning on using the bag anyway though. The brushes also have a smell, but after a good wash in Dawn dish soap, the smell has been reduced. They do still have a scent, but it&#x27;s not enough to prevent me from using it. The smell will likely fade with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have a problem with synthetic hairs falling out of the brush like other reviewers. While washing them, either no hairs came out at all or just a few, which is to be expected. The one thing that did happen was one of the brushes had what seemed like a small piece of glue stuck in the hairs (lowering the rating to 4 stars). I worked it a bit, and it eventually came out and the brush returned to its shape after washing. There is an image of this specific brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some brushes are very dense, making applying eyeshadow an easy task. The eye blending brushes are soft and fluffy and do a great job. The face brushes are also nice and plump. The handle seems to be a synthetic wood and feels nice. The handles are long enough to make them comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these brushes are a pretty decent set for the price. (I paid $12) You could easily spend much more for animal hair makeup brushes with a brand name, but these brushes are synthetic, making them economical, while also keeping quality in mind. I have already recommended to a friend.</li>
    <li> amazing love them all</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality set, definitely put together by someone who didn&#x27;t care what they were giving people. The case doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to me like other people were reporting. Make sure to &amp;#34;de shed&amp;#34; your bigger face brushes before using them because the first couple uses will shed if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face brushes aren&#x27;t any harsher than an elf face brush. The medium/large  concealer  brushes are soft and nicely useable. The smaller, what I&#x27;m guessing are supposed to be eyeshadow brushes, are like mini-concealer brushes. They&#x27;re stiff, very small, and flat. You do not get any sort of eyeshadow blending brush with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angle and flat edge brushes are nice for eyebrows and eyelining. The spoolie is an average spoolie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: I really like the different sizes, the carrying case, concealer brushes, and face brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: Wish there were more useable eyeshadow brushes, I wish the fibres were a little higher quality.</li>
    <li> This is worth the price, and gives you so many brushes!</li>
    <li> Literally when I got the brushes, they had a really bad chemical smell. They were also shedding like crazy. The barrel of the brush completely popped off from the handle and the brissels were super rough and it was a little painful to use on my skin.</li>
    <li> 32 brushes for less than $20 seemed to good to be true.the brushes are horrible and product application is a nightmare. Would not recommend. Invest in good brushes, try the Sigma brushes. I just bought the F80 foundation brush and the F60 foundation brush. They are more money but, the better the brushes the better the makeup looks.</li>
    <li> Received the package and it went to the garbage, the quality was bad</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they are great. I did notice the weird smell others mentioned, but it didn&#x27;t really bother me and it was worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Worth it. They are so so nice of brushes. They feel so great :) I love them!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! When I first got them I cleaned every brush and air dried them and it never lost it form. And with each wash the brushes feel good as new.</li>
    <li> Hair comes out on face not good quality</li>
    <li> Bought this for use on a halloween FX makeup I was doing for my sister, was expecting something I could use once and toss, the price was ok for a one time use deal. What I got was completely NOT what I expected! These brushes are awesome quality and they&#x27;ve been through a beating these past few months. They wash out easily, are super soft, and I haven&#x27;t even had an issue with shedding! the case has a harsh chemical smell, was the only downside, because it permeated the brushes. But otherwise, this was an amazing buy. I would DEFINITELY but this again.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear makeup but I was definitely excited to purchase this brush kit because I&#x27;m starting to get into it. This kit is amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to get the rest of my makeup so I can start doing my own makeup all the time.</li>
    <li> Looses more hair than all my 3 German shepherds !!</li>
    <li> Been looking for a make up brush kit. This is light and stores easily</li>
    <li> i use maybe 4 brushes out of the 32.... its kinda cheaply made</li>
    <li> Bigger brushes just fall apart.</li>
    <li> I was looking for brushes to try new techniques with before i started buying expensive individual styles. This set has a great selection to work with and i have been able to figure out which brush style i like and works for me.  They dont shed, they provide great application, the length of the brushes are great for home but not for travel or purses.</li>
    <li> A perfect gift for a teenage girl who is experimenting with make up.  It was a great price and they are good quality brushes.  My teenager said it was one of her most favorite gifts from Christmas.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for in this case, the hairs falls of the big brushes, some of the little ones are OK.</li>
    <li> Loveee them... my new babies</li>
    <li> does not say what each brush is for</li>
    <li> The brushed are solid and great, but on the larger brushes the hair falls out easily and isn&#x27;t stiff.but all together super</li>
    <li> Pretty impressed with these brushes. The hair does not easily pull out and I love the long handle on the brushes. All in all a well worth product</li>
    <li> The brushes were not as smooth as I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> I was so exited to get these. But the brushed are a little stiff for eye shadow which makes blending very hard.</li>
    <li> Quality not to standard</li>
    <li> I like all the brushes besides the face brushes....they ARE NOT soft! They are prickly but they will do if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money....they DO SHED! Especially the first few uses! Maybe here and there throughout....also a few of mine have broken....meaning the head detached from the rest of the stem...the brushes are definitely cheap of course...I am on the search for a new brush set with better quality...</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes…very very soft!</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 5 out of 5 stars because it really is worth the rating!! I ordered it on a Sunday night and received it Tuesday night, even though the information said it would actually come Wednesday night! I opened it and was so excited, the bag smells like acrylic paint but for me it&#x27;s not a problem at all since I&#x27;m a painter so I&#x27;m surrounded by paint smells all the time, and if you don&#x27;t like the smell just get rid of the bag and put your brushes in a brush holder! All the brushes came in a plastic covering, and the bigger brushes like your foundation/bronzer and fan brush came in a brush protector which I thought was very convenient since I usually buy brush protectors for $10 a pack! They have a very wide selection of eyeshadow brushes and small brushes, although I wish they had a flat top brush for powder application I still wouldn&#x27;t consider it a burden! The price for such a great set of brushes still makes me believe that it&#x27;s too good to be true. The bristles are VERY soft, as soft as a $15 brush you&#x27;d find at Target. I am VERY pleased with the product and look forward to using this set!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 3 months later update.&lt;br /&gt;After having these brushes for 3-4 months I would just throw away the bigger brushes like the foundation/powder application brushes away, they shed excessively and will become rougher with time and use. As for the smaller brushes, I still use them and they still work amazing! The only problem are the bigger brushes which, disappointingly, suck. I bought much better brushes for foundation/powder and the softness of them cannot compare to these low-quality ones. Just go to the drug store and buy some ecotools!</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectations. All the hair on the brushes were coming off when applied makeup or eye shadows on my face.</li>
    <li> These brushes are good but most are fairly similar with slight variation of angles, for instance the fluffy eyeshadow brushes &amp; fluffy eyeshadow blending brushes. Hairs come out of the bigger brushes upon first couple of uses, hoping it&#x27;ll stop one I continue using them. They aren&#x27;t that soft, but they get the job done! I would recommend for a person starting to craft their everyday makeup routine, not if your a makeup artist or guru!</li>
    <li> Not the best brushes i have ever purchased! some of them were soft and others were really rough and harsh on skin. They shed a lot! but they are cheep!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! My best friend had ordered from this vendor &amp; recommend it &amp; I see why! The only CON is that the pouch the brushes came in has a very strong factory smell to it so I suggest you co-wash them &amp; the pouch before using them but other than the smell the brushes are amazing!</li>
    <li> My wife just received it this week. The bristles started coming apart while she tried to apply eye shadow. We threw away two brushes so far. I&#x27;d not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good for the price and great for anyone who wants to practice new makeup applications. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Uhm, I think people over exaggerate about these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) they do shed hair, but after you clean them they hardly shed.&lt;br /&gt;2) when you do open the package for the first time, the makeup brush holder does have a strong smell and it&#x27;s not crazy od like these other people make it out to be. If you leave it out for an hour or so the smell goes away.&lt;br /&gt;3) I mean the variety of eye brushes you get is amazing for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean I bought it mostly for the eye brushes because I wanted to build my brush collection. I suggest invest in good face brushes but keep all of the eye brushes from this kit cause they work amazing and pack on color beautifully. I deff would purchase this again and also buy it for a friend.</li>
    <li> I love my brush set! My makeup looks nice and my brushes are the attraction of my makeup corner :)</li>
    <li> Very nice, very complete set.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush set. I have read some of the reviews before buying this. Most people complained about there being a smell to it when you open it. Yes that is true, but just leave it open to air out and wash the brushes before use. The other complaint was how some of the hairs falling out. Every brush set I had ever gotten wether expensive or cheep has done it. My suggestion is to brush them against your skin of you  are not going to wash them first. Not many of the hairs fell out for me.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I had was that I was short 1 brush. Really not a huge deal to me so I let it go. With the variety of these brushes I&#x27;m sure this would of not hampered my morning makeup routine with 1 brush missing.</li>
    <li> i was let down when i received this product, the brushes are not of the best quality and the brushes shed like no tomorrow. The eye brushes are the best thing about the set and even then they are not good for blending.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant because many posted about the smell but honestly i love them so much, they have so many great uses, and I wanted them to start my makeup collection. People complained about hair falling out, I washed them with mild shampoo and let them air dry and they were fine.</li>
    <li> Received these brushes today!! Very pleased with the quality of this product, can&#x27;t never go wrong with this great collection of brushes. Surprised on how it arrived days earlier, than it was meant to arrive. Now I can definitely show my work, as a makeup artist :]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about a year since I purchased these brushes. At first I was very pleased with them;my only complaint was the gasoline smell the brushes had,which some reviewers warned about. As time went on I noticed that 5 of the brushes fell apart, and this was before I used them. My next issue was that when I would use the fluffy brushes the hairs would fall out everywhere! In the midst of using them to apply makeup I would end up with the black hairs on my face! I wish that I known how problematic these brushes were before I purchased them.</li>
    <li> those are so cheap looking and really does not do a good job...</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this set out, until I received it today. Horrible quality (the red &#x27;face&#x27;  brushes are worse then the cheaper Elf line of face brushes), had numerous duplicates, no spoolie.  Case was OK, shipping timely, but strong plastic smell, brushes shedding and dusty. Will be returning if possible. Only purchase I have not been satisfied with in all the years I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect brushes don&#x27;t even shed extremely happy with the overall product and price</li>
    <li> smelled like synthetic leather</li>
    <li> Absolutely L O V E 💕 these makeup Brushes !&lt;br /&gt;Although they have a Very rare Scent at 1st, But the scent goes away as your using them from time to time. They have a very Nice texture to the Brush 👌✨</li>
    <li> It is awful. the bristles fall out each use and some of the brushes are the same.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I have had them for over six months now and they are holding up perfectly. None of the brushes have started to fall apart like other brushes I have bought in the past. I enjoy using these every day to put my face on. The only thing that I was sad about with this was the lack of a stippling brush I ended up buying one but if this kit included that it would be absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> I received this product really quickly and it looks exactly as it does in the picture. I cannot wait to use the brushes.</li>
    <li> These suck! There is not a lot of veriety since the same brush is repeated several times. Also these brushes aren&#x27;t soft at all and shed like crazy! Ive already gotten rid of most of the big face brushes because those were the worst. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes and for the price. I did get a couple of duplicate brushes and I have had a few fall apart, but like I said there were plenty of them and duplicates.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my brushes, they&#x27;re perfect to use, easy to clean, &amp; as a professional make up artist I&#x27;m really pleased to see they actually do a nice job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to make up so I didn&#x27;t really know a lot about different brushes. My only &#x27;thing&#x27; about these is the brushes weren&#x27;t labeled but a quick YouTube search will help you out. Other than that these brushes are the best very durable and soft.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product a while ago and im in love with this product!  at first yes, it smell a little funky but it goes away. This was the first product i bought online and i was nervous but it works amazing!</li>
    <li> OMG I love this SO MANY brushed that I dont even know what to do with some of them. This is just perfect for any lady who wears make up especially for the price!!</li>
    <li> these are absolutely amazing. They work so well and are very nice. They came quite a while ago-they were EXTREMELY early. Very nice...I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are all the brushes I need for my arsenal of makeup application, easy to clean easy to work with and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the quality for such a good price :)</li>
    <li> For the most part some of the brushes work good. But the face brushes shed like crazy.  They don&#x27;t hold product well</li>
    <li> These brushes are cheap and weak. I am very disappointed. The bristles are steadily coming off. It would have cost me more to ship them back, so I just threw them away. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Brushes suck, don&#x27;t buy them!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice but would be better if I had received all 32 .. I only received 18? Where do we contact the company?</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the quality of these brushes. I have paid more than this just for one high quality brush. Yay!</li>
    <li> Very good for the price! They did have some shedding but id advise washing them before use. I originally bought this for the case and variety of brushes that came along with this.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Brushes were all nice quality (although for untidy me easy to loose ha ha) but this is a GREAT deal. I love these and use them every day. you can tie them around your waist for easy use, they&#x27;re really quite lovely. There&#x27;s a brush for every situation and I love it, love it, love it. Everyone needs one.</li>
    <li> This set was very disappointing. I had read the reviews and assumed that it would be a wise purchase but once I received the brushes I realized that only the blush, powder, and large fan brush were actually natural hair. The rest of the brushes are acrylic. You ever tried applying eyeshadow with an acrylic brush? It cakes and it&#x27;s terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So A+ for the powder and blush brushes but the rest can only be used for liner, lipstick, and gloss. Not much of a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them to oil paint with, not a total loss.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all items are very cheaply made and they do not work at all ! This is a waste of money</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so much, just the bag has a weird smell, but its going away. THEY ARRIVED 2 WEEKS EARLIER then when it said they would and I was delighted. I used them a few times now and I love them they wash easily and apply makeup easily. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> After only a short while using the bristles started falling off the stem. Only able to use less than half of the 32 pieces recieved</li>
    <li> there are posts about how the brush hair sheds everywhere all the time, all I can say it that is not true. I properly care for my brushes and wash them properly and there has not been any shedding, and I washed them before I even used them!  the only problem I had was the brushes arrived,  the smudge &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; was pushed in, and I will be contacting the company about this because I use that particular &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; a lot. there seem to be complaints about the smell. its just the fabric and that goes away after a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;there are more brushes in here than I know what to do with some days!! there are not any numbers or brush names on the brush handles  so that is a downside if you do tutorials</li>
    <li> yeah, its a bunch of stuff, but quality is better than quantity. They shed and are extremely rough to me.</li>
    <li> Thought brushes were going to be much softer mine were really stiff and not soft at all very disapointed went back to my old brushes</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this brush set because I needed these for professional use and  thought that the amount of different brushes would be helpful. There are a lot of brushes but the quality is poor. The base of the brushes are not attached well and the hairs fall out constantly. I will not be using these on clients.</li>
    <li> all brushes work perfect I loved them and for the price I got them for was perfect I plan on buying more from them really soon.Thank you</li>
    <li> Very good for the price. If you expect a more professional product... you have to pay for it. I really like the brushes and the carring bag... the purchase is what I expecting for.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the them but I still gave it 4 stars bc I got it a lot quicker than I expected. And it&#x27;s a good price for that many brushes. Can&#x27;t wait to use them. The set may need better foundation brushes &amp; a kabuki brush bc it does shed.</li>
    <li> great collection, not very good quality , but you get what you paid for , i didn&#x27;t use half of them yet, but its good to have</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a really good set of brushes. So many of them! None of the fibers have fallen out and none have been broken. Been using a few months.</li>
    <li> Brushes are good. My only complaint is that the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; in the bigger brushes are always coming out. But the aray of sizes are great and I&#x27;m getting a lot of use out of them</li>
    <li> It a great deal. So many brushes and the price is so low.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the smell is not pleasant. I have only started using them, so I&#x27;m waiting for the smell to go away as other reviewers wrote on that matter.&lt;br /&gt;Second, one fluffy big brush looses its hairs but the others are fine.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you won&#x27;t be happy with all the 32 brushes, you will get slightly less, but the overall value is great.</li>
    <li> I am no MUA, but i love makeup, yet I was not willing to spend the big bucks until i got a hang of the general concept, these brushes are great to learn and play with, I also take these to travel since i do a lot of flying, i rather take these than my mac brushes.. and used them for halloween, since i didn&#x27;t care if they got ruined so much, as far as the fibers, for the bigger brushes the fibers fell out a lot, but the smaller brushes are actually quite decent quality,</li>
    <li> They are terrible and brushes are so fake nor do they even work well, i do not recommend at all youll regret waisting you money on this.  DO NOT BUY THEM</li>
    <li> Eyeshadow brushes are ok at best. The facial brushes suck. They tangle and are rough on the face. Very displeased. Case looks nice though.</li>
    <li> The brushes I got are not the ones in the picture. The ones I got are not ever good.</li>
    <li> The hair on these brushes keep falling out. The brushes are very coarse. It hurts when i apply makeup on because the quality on these brushes is like a paint brush. Its horrible and i would never recommend these brushes to anyone. NEVER.</li>
    <li> You know I ordered these over a year ago, and most of them are just like new. With a once a week cleaning, theyre just like new. One of the best 15$ I ever spent.</li>
    <li> Compré este producto porque necesitaba más de una brocha para maquillarme, y yo no quería gastar mucho dinero; pero grande fue mi sorpresa cuando llegaron, todo tipo y tamaños de pinceles y muy linda presentación, yo estoy feliz.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I needed more of a brush for makeup, and I did not want to spend much money, but great was my surprise when I arrived, all types and sizes of brushes and very nice presentation, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> The bristles are itchy and cheap. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The price is ridiculous for the quality and amount of product. I have two daughters, We all use them constantly</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOVE LOVE LOVE THE BRUSHES. The only bad thing is that the hairs fall out while youre doing your makeup, id recommend you clean the brushes before your first use. Also, the leather case that they come in smells like toxic paint but it goes away after you use the brushes!</li>
    <li> First of all I paid almost ten dollars for this product to come from En&#x27;da on the 18th, they didn&#x27;t arrive until a day later.  Ok, not a huge deal but if I paid for a specific date, I expect it to be delivered by then.  I got the brushes, the smell wasn&#x27;t that bad, but the issue is with the brushes.  They looked nothing like the picture and a lot of the brushes were missing instead they were duplicates and in some cases three of the same brush.  The quality is another issue, they don&#x27;t have the consistency and fiber necessary to pick up eye shadow and to blend it well.  I used to be a makeup artist for major beauty brands.  I have also done weddings and photo shoots and I would never use these brushes.  I contacted Amazon and I am returning them for a full refund.  Do yourself a favor and do not get these.  The reviews from the people that love them, must have received a totally different product than what I got. THE END</li>
    <li> I love the many choices. You do have to clean them up when they arrive since some of the strands will come off. But other than that, they are great!</li>
    <li> My Brushes only took a week and a half to come in, and once on opened them I was so amazed. They are a Mac nock off but still look real! I would deff recommend a friend to buy this kit because it comes in handy and so much brushes are offered for different uses. BY THE WAY, the people who say that the bristles fall off Is because you have to wash them with soap and water and conditioner before you first use them, same goes with any other brand of brushes.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this in the mail, only to find out that ALL the brushes were so hard (like lipstick brushes).. You can&#x27;t blend with these brushes and you certainly can&#x27;t rub it against your eyes! Blush brush is good, though.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I bought these. The reviews weren&#x27;t bad, but the thing about the bristles falling out kinda had me weary. But I washed them the way a couple of the reviews suggested and I haven&#x27;t had any problem. I also took a fine-tooth comb to the larger brushes and combed them to pull out anything that was loose. The case is REALLY soft and flexible. There are so many brushes that I haven&#x27;t had to worry about getting color mixed by using the same brush. All in all, I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with these. They&#x27;re wonderful!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely pleased with this item. I have been looking for a good makeup brush kit and this one is it! Grey price for a 32 peace set!</li>
    <li> You got what you paid for.  Cheap product. the hair part come off right away.  it does not pick up the powder.  it made with plastic material so it is hard. i dont like it at all.</li>
    <li> Good presentation, very useful product, they were in time! The hair of the brushes are fine not excellent but very useful</li>
    <li> Okay I ordered the brushes just to expand my collection and well some of the brushes suck like the big fan brush powder brush and the other big brushes kind of suck they do shed not that bad but there not soft enough for me so I won&#x27;t use them ill probably just get a high end replacement of those brushes. Now the other brushes are perfect and for a few dollars and some change it was worth it I do wish they labeled the brushes but I&#x27;m not going to use them exactly where the are intended only for the exact look I need to achieve. It does have a terrible smell though but nothing a little washing won&#x27;t take care of. So out of the whole pack there may be 4 brushes I don&#x27;t like but the rest are cool. Love my new brushes</li>
    <li> My brushes are amazing. They are super soft and are easy to clean. The pouch is also great for traveling. Great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> No 🌟 ...brushes came with a weird smell ...they came broken apart...they shed all the time...not worth a dime .....</li>
    <li> So many brushes you won&#x27;t know what to do with yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I bought this! I got it because a lot of the reviews said it was good for beginners. If you&#x27;re just starting to experiment with makeup I definitely recommend this. The brushes are very soft and leave my eyeshadows very pigmented. I mainly just use the blending brushes and the eyebrow brush. I have experienced any shedding and I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now. The carry case is very sturdy; I don&#x27;t see how a $60 set could be much better! The only critique I would make is that they should include a chart or something that tells you what each brush is for. Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> Brussels coming out before I even had a change to use the brushes.....bummer!</li>
    <li> love these brushes. I have  had  no shedding on any of the brushes. the blush brushes are a little coarser than I expected, but still use them. they have great ones for applying eyeshadows on wet. all of them have really improved my ability to contour my shadows.there are way more brushes than I need, so I have kept the ones I haven&#x27;t used yet in the sleeves to protect them longer. I would definitely recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This set is great quality all the brushes are really soft and the case Is great as well. Also they are all individually wrapped to ensure the brushes don&#x27;t fray. Great value for the price. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> smh don&#x27;t waste your money these brushes suck</li>
    <li> These are made of very cheap material. The bristles constantly fall out and get stuck to my face after putting on concealer. They don&#x27;t look the same as the picture either. Only a few of the brushes from this set can even be used.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes for a great price but some of the brisles or whatever it&#x27;s called comes out I&#x27;m not sure if its because they&#x27;re new or what. But other than that they&#x27;re great</li>
    <li> Nice set. Smells pretty strong like permanent marker. I washed the brushes and the smells gone but the case still smells.</li>
    <li> i love these ... for the price they are amazing! MUA approved! great for MUA newbes wannabes and vets! love!</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes for about six months. I love that there are so many of them. They came packaged very nice and not all wonky and misshaped. Best of all they never leave stray hairs behind. I would buy again. Great price too.</li>
    <li> The eye brushes are a lot better than the face brushes. There are a lot  of the same brushes just in different sizes which was a downer /: and there was no blending brush which, in my opinion, is essential in a brush set. I tried the blush brush and it really irritated my cheek but whatever I just won&#x27;t use those (: I saw in other reviews that the case had a bad odor but it wasn&#x27;t bad. I liked how each brush came in a little cover, however, the fan brush&#x27;s bristles did get a little bent because of those. There is quite a bit of shedding, mainly on the face brushes. Overall, I think I got enough for what I paid for, hope this was helpful to someone (:</li>
    <li> I love this so much like so many brushes the only thing I hate is that I wish they were labeled, I had to label them myself and it took forever</li>
    <li> I LOVE this set!!! Its affordable and very durable. I am an MUA and Highly Recommend this product!</li>
    <li> They are brushes.  It hey work great the case they come in is very nice.</li>
    <li> These brushes weren&#x27;t too great. Very rough brushes and always fall out and the material falls out of the brushes. I&#x27;ll be purchasing the MAC set soon and getting rid of these one.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with all of the brushes and the leather case that it arrived in.  I now have to learn how to use all of the brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush were great at first but after a couple of uses the hair of the brush would fall out! It left a bunch of bristle all over my face and clothes..</li>
    <li> Its a great set and for a reasonable price! I love it! it has all the essentials I need as a fellow make up artist!</li>
    <li> A good friend of mine recommended this product to me. At first I was a little deterred by some of the negative reviews, but I decided to place an order anyway - and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived in staggeringly good time. I placed my order on Saturday and it arrived early Tuesday morning in flawless condition. The brushes themselves seem to be durable. At first when I removed their plastic packaging a few small bristles did come out of the fluffier brushes, but they seem to be holding up very well after several uses.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the actual case itself has an odd plastic smell to it that I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of. It&#x27;s not really that major of an issue, and therefore I stand by my rating of 5 stars. Once again very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a great deal on an unbeatable set of cosmetic brushes!</li>
    <li> I brought this product and the brushes are horrible. They shed really bad. I would not recommend this product to anyone,.</li>
    <li> I love how it comes with all the brushes  but I don&#x27;t know what most of them are for I would like it better if it had its name on the side of it and it takes for ever to get here! But I like it</li>
    <li> I love these. there are some many that I can use them for so many different looks. It is really long when it is fully opened so hopefully you have the counter space.</li>
    <li> this will be my second set that i buy first one was a gift for my sister that she loves to use&lt;br /&gt;after seeing the product and how soft the brushes are i had to get my own set&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied. and the way they were shipped was very satisfying.</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t labeled</li>
    <li> Everything about this brush set is great except for the shedding on the larger brushes and the fact that one of my brushes came with adhesive in the bristles.</li>
    <li> The eye brushes were great but the face brushes were not at all what i expected they were not soft in fact very scratchy and they shed and awful lot so they were just OK.</li>
    <li> I love the eye brushes, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But they gave me doubles of like 3 brushes. The face brushes suck, I meant he shedding is horrible. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> The smell is not bad. Just wash out with water. The bigger brushes shed like 1st time use and after that is ok. The smaller brushes don&#x27;t shed. If you are not a big makeup fan having all these brushes don&#x27;t make sense. The brittle&#x27;s are soft but a bit stiff when apply makeup- (brushes does not move smoothly along eyes you have to pat makeup on, rather that wipe). But I am happy with purchase. I purchased with Prime and received item on time. Great delivery.</li>
    <li> i ordered the make up set and it only can with 31 i am missing the fan brush(the big one)</li>
    <li> I still don&#x27;t believe I got this as cheaply as I did.  Good quality too!  The strap the wraps the bundle up came un-attached a few weeks in, but can be used un-attached.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and came just in time for prom :) I love that I have doh Lea of brushes so I don&#x27;t have to mix make up types.</li>
    <li> great brushes! and there are so many so that when you wash them you still have brushes left to use while the others are drying ! great set ! love it !</li>
    <li> these are a great value and are very soft. I love how these brushes feel! my daughter had to explain what each brush is for. keep in mind, some are duplicate so you can use with different colors,obviously. i really love these!</li>
    <li> I think this set of brushes look like they are good quality, but I am weary of the very cheap price they are being sold for...</li>
    <li> I am BEYOND upset and disappointed! I&#x27;m missing 3 brushes and the brushes that did come are flat rough thin and look nothing like the pictures ! I thought I was getting a great deal for these brushes but I did not! SO SAD :(</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent for the price. Sans the larger brushes, they shed very little hair and work great for applying eye makeup. I didnt care for the larger brushes for powdering my face because they always seemed to leave behind multiple hairs. The smaller ones were perfect though. Overall they were definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great item despite what others said. Slight smell but it&#x27;s what you get from a vinyl bag. thank you for the brushes</li>
    <li> I bought these as a birthday present for myself and I&#x27;m so glad I did! They came in about 3 days after I ordered them and I was actually impressed with the quality considering the price. The black bag does smell pretty strong like others have said but I didnt buy them for the bag and If its not being held up to youre face then it shouldnt bother you, Its also doesnt effect the brushes or make my purse smell. The brushes are really soft, I love how they feel on my face and I only had the bristles come out of one brush (the littlest black fluffy one) but there so many others that I just dont use that one. I am very happy with my purchase! Once my 4 year old gets ahold of them and ruins them I will absolutely be getting another set. Exceeds the expectations I had:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m learning how to do makeup the brushes are great love the long handles I experiment with the makeup. got a lot of learning but the product is awesome</li>
    <li> Some makeup brushes shed. I&#x27;ve noticed the larger synthetic ones mainly did. The smaller brushes are soft. A lot of the same like brushes, but I did like the set.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, excellent package, the presentation is great, and feet perfectly for a gift!&lt;br /&gt;I recomend this!&lt;br /&gt;And everything on time</li>
    <li> dont buy waste of money bad quality. they feel ruff and the hair falls out from the brushes.  trust me</li>
    <li> This brushes are just amazing. Affordable and nice. When I first got them (shipping was awesome too) I felt like a real MUA lol. I mostly use like 4 brushes and still have the others intact. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more, they are just beautiful.</li>
    <li> All the little brushes are great and I love them, but I mainly bought this for the large powder brushes because those are what I really needed. The brushes shed very bad, but I began using them anyway, hoping they would stop. After cleaning my brushes for the first time, the powder brushes began giving off a putrid smell and I can&#x27;t use them at all anymore, and they still continue to shed. I&#x27;m going to keep the set for the small brushes and buy a set of powder brushes, but ladies be warned.</li>
    <li> Professional quality make up brushes. I liked this set. Easy to use this every day. Wide variety of options for every need.</li>
    <li> This product far exceeds what one expects.  The brushes are soft and in every shape imaginable.  All in all, a tremendous buy.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Greatelious thankz god. Order this it cheap and wonder in different sizes😇def it be good for people who travel wit makeup kits</li>
    <li> For the price they are ok. The item was shipped sooner then it said it was so that was good. In the set they give you some of the same brushes, there are 2 sponge aplicator brushes which i feel are sooooooo un needed because they are useless. What the !st thing you do when you get eye shadow kits? throw the applicator brush away! so I didnt like that those where in there. Last I dont like the fact that theres no names on them. Im new to makeup so I kinda need to know what brush im using. Overall I like about 5 brushes out the kit</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! They came really fast I ordered them on Monday night and they came today (Thursday) of the same week! The face brushes are not as soft as the eye and concealer ones but still okay. Some of the light haired brushes came off of the handle but that&#x27;s fine since I can hot glue gun them back on. The case was black with white stitching, it looks like leather but it&#x27;s plastic and give off a strong paint/permanent marker scent. I will post pictures soon</li>
    <li> I think that it is a good price for the brushes at that price point.  They are much stiffer than other brushes and the larger ones do shed a lot.</li>
    <li> They are cheaply made and most of the brushes were useless</li>
    <li> some brushes broke the next day</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush set!!!  The brushes are soft and work perfectly to apply my makeup.  Even the foundation brush is great - it doesn&#x27;t make streaks.  My makeup application is so much nicer.  Incredible brushes for this price!!!</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes are ok to apply creams such as concealers, however, the brushes are much too hard &amp; abrasive to the face, which caused slight irritation as I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. Good for beginners, and is very cost  but not something I will buy again nor use on my clients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m inlove with this set I barely use it because Im scared I might ruin it .</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this in the mail and use them as part of my makeup kit.&lt;br /&gt;The tops of the brushes fell off and the hair fell out of a lot of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles were too stiff and don&#x27;t hold powders and shadows.&lt;br /&gt;really not a quality product.</li>
    <li> The hairs fall out like crazy, other than that theyre okay for people who just need brushes for practice. If youre looking for nice and dependable brushes that will last you for a long time, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews thought it would be a good buy. I was wrong the brushes suck. All the reviews were FAKE. The hairs on the brushes are rough. Their synthetic hair.</li>
    <li> Great value for money, nice assortment of brushes in a useful bag. However, there is a distinct strong odor from the bag. My suggestion is to open it up, remove brushes and their protective plastic, and lay everything out for 24-48 hours to air out completely. The smell has not returned. Repeat purchase of this product for a gift. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It was just as described. I love the brushes and the varieties. Would definitely recommend this product. The case makes it convenient to carry it anywhere</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them.  She has become quite the makeup artist.  This brush set is great and easy to wash.</li>
    <li> Bristles are falling out when wife uses the brushes.</li>
    <li> Very soft &amp; never disappointed me</li>
    <li> I only gave this one star because I wasn&#x27;t allowed to give zero stars.  These brushes are AWFUL. They shed so bad and are rough on the skin. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> A MUST PURCHASE! I love these brushes! They work great and are easy to clean! Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> Oh my god, is just amazing, I dont regret buy it!!</li>
    <li> Before I make any online purchases, I usually check for reviews on Youtube. I heard a few people saying that this kit comes out smelling very strongly like paint and that the hair falls out of the brush as soon as you get it. I wouldnt say that this is entirely true. The vinyl bag does have a distinct smell, but it isn&#x27;t something that will affect you unless you hold the bag near your face at all times. The brushes do need a little bit of grooming before you use them to clear up some fly aways, but other than that it is great for the price. For any one wondering, this is not the kit with the fake \\&quot;MAC\\&quot; logo on the brushes. I definitely recommend this set if you are looking for something affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 5/13/2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a year and still use them regularly. After adding a flat foundation brush and possibly a kabuki/ blending brush, you pretty much have everything you \\&quot;need\\&quot; with this kit.</li>
    <li> For the price the quality is amazing. They shex a bit at first but work wonderful and are soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is just from wharehouse packaging but it goes away. 32 brushes for this price is unheard of. Take advantage.</li>
    <li> i didnt like it is very low quality product and the price is not good for such product like that .</li>
    <li> This brush set has a lot of duplication but since these were quite inexpensive I don&#x27;t feel bad about the purchase.  You definitely have a lot to choose from. I have another five brush set from Sonia Kashuk that I got from Target that I find myself reaching for most often. This is certainly a better deal than spending a lot of money on the very expensive brushes from Ulta.</li>
    <li> Yuk these brushes leave hair everywhere they get into your eyes and are terribly difficult to get off of your face I would not recommend these brushes at all cheap price for cheap product</li>
    <li> This is a great bargain.  I was looking for cosmetic brushes as mine had worn out and needed replacement.  These brushes are nicely presented in the case and each one is wrapped.  I paid less for 32 brushes than I would have paid for one brush at a cosmetic store.</li>
    <li> Love the way they take in pigments, very soft and good for traveling. It does smell a little but after airing it out for a while the smell goes away. The big brushes do tend to shed a little bit but that also goes away and the brushes remain nice and thick. :D</li>
    <li> It may be the biggest bang for you buck with the amount of brushes you get, but the quality sucks. I only use a couple brushes like the flat angled brush and blending brush but everything else just doesn&#x27;t apply makeup well enough. I did read other reviews that said it sheds a little the first few times, but it still sheds on me and I have had this for awhile now. It doesn&#x27;t pick up makeup like I want it to and the brushes aren&#x27;t even soft at all on your face. Like the old saying goes, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. Invest in something better. Real techniques has awesome brushes for a decent price.</li>
    <li> The first day I got this item the brushes started to lose the bristles. My granddaughter was very disappointed with the item. I will not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> great set for a great deal.I would recommend to anyone.Wonderful case as well.I hope you enjoy this as much as i have.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes but as soon as I took the package out they have a horrible chemical odor. Hopefully it goes away.</li>
    <li> shed easily, material is falling apart. Strong odor.. please save your money, skip this product .</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this brush set.  I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different looks and some of the brushes are doubles which make it much easier to add several colors to your eyes or use a bronzer and a bit of blush.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is the eyeshadow applicator fell off on the first use and I had to super glue it back on. I hardly use an eyeshadow applicator though, but I thought it was worth mentioning.  I love the carrying case as it keeps it organized and is very easy to roll up and go when you travel.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the variety of bushes shown, there were multiple sets of 5 of the same brush. they also dont pick up pigment well but for the price I&#x27;m ok with that. I used them for a wedding so I had a lot of brushes on hand that were clean and ready to use. I would probably recommend better brushes if you would like a set to use more often.</li>
    <li> The quality isn&#x27;t great, but that is to be expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I like it mainly for the case and all the smaller brushes it comes with for eyeshadows and lips, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The face brushes are not soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge makeup fanatic but I could tell the quality wasn&#x27;t great.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping though and as not bad considering the price!</li>
    <li> These brushes are decent and excellent for the price.. Yes the packaging smell is a bit strong but that doesn&#x27;t take away from the value if the brushes. 32 pieces for this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.. Even if you decide to only use half of the brushes it&#x27;s still an amazing value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, although a must have crease brush is missing from this set. But the kit has many other needed and useful brushes and the quality is very good for the price. I&#x27;m actually very impressed and I recommend for beginners or the casual users looking for a budget brush set that will last them a little while, but definitely not a lifetime product. Overall, very good for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these brushes and the quality of them.  They don&#x27;t shed like a lot of other brushes she has tried</li>
    <li> I should have listened to all the lower starred reviews.  These bristles are harder than what I was currently using at the time.  I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble or returning it since it was only about $15.  The whole point of getting brushes is having them have soft bristles and they ARE NOT all that soft on your face.  The smell really didn&#x27;t get to me much as it faded away fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, DON&#x27;T GET THIS.  IT&#x27;S NOT WORTH IT...EVEN AT $15. My roommate bought a smaller set but for the same price and its MUCH softer than this one.</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of complaints regarding how the case smelled before I purchased it but when I received my the case smelled like plastic since that is what is it.  However, I sprayed with the frebreze it is fine.  The brushes are great some where duplicates but that was fine because I have found use for the them.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the feel of the fan brush. It feels to coarse.  Other than that I would recommend the purchase of this set if you are trying to expand your use and knowledge of makeup techniques.</li>
    <li> This Product is amazing&lt;br /&gt;and what I love the most about it is that it was cheaper than any other place&lt;br /&gt;it also arrived to my house (address) on time&lt;br /&gt;everyone should take the time out to buy this</li>
    <li> 4 star. This set contains 32 brushes for only 15 dollars! For the price the quality is good. The eye brushes are really whats worth getting this set. The face brushes are not quality at all. They shed really bad, are really scratchy, and they were spray painted with a purple paint that smells awful. It did come missing 2 face brushes but I don&#x27;t know if they would have been any better than the ones I got. There are duplicates but I kind of like that instead of washing my brushes every time I can use another one. Also if it breaks I have plenty of replacements.  The eye brushes are synthetic and are not spray painted with the weird paint. The case does smell like its covered in chemicals, which is why you should wash these brushes thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is amazing for the eye brushes, but if you&#x27;re looking for face brushes this kit is not for you. Sigma and Real Techniques have way better quality face brushes. These brushes are also really great for beginners. Having a lot of eye brushes to experiment with can help you in the future know which brushes are your favorites and which are really necessary. Excluding the 7 face brushes that are useless, the 2 that were missing, and 2 sponge brushes that are also useless, I got a total of 21 usable &amp; quality eye brushes for 15 dollars. Still a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 4/2/2014 2 star&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have more experience with makeup, I wish I would have saved my money and bought a higher quality set of brushes. BH cosmetics has a better quality makeup set and for a little bit more, Sigma&#x27;s Premium Kit has all the brushes you would ever need.</li>
    <li> A lot of the brushes are really stiff, not shedding so far but a few bristles are out of place but for the most part pretty good quality and maybe after you wash the brushes they won&#x27;t be as stiff.</li>
    <li> This was a great steal, it was really cheap and they feel pretty gd (surprising). So I am pretty happy with this purchase. Wash first cuz the brushes shed.</li>
    <li> Great, even though I&#x27;ll never use them all, but some brush hairs like to fall out. Otherwise a good deal</li>
    <li> Horrible...  don&#x27;t like them at all.. i expect.better things this.wasnt a goog experience i expect.to buy some good stuff bye</li>
    <li> Just a couple of months ago I began getting into makeup. I wanted to buy a cheap brush set that would get me by. I honestly regret purchasing. I did encounter that bad smell.... left it open over night and the smell disappeared. There were a lot of pointless or repeating brushes within set. I think out of the entire set of brushes I only use 2 on a daily basis. I used the foundation brush (actually different from the rest of brushes) and the spooly (to comb through brows). They delivery time is also ridiculous. I think I had to wait an entire 2 months. Just go to sephora and buy a $70 set of essential brushes..</li>
    <li> it is a very nice set of brush, but the smell was soooo bad when you just opened it. I just leaved it alone for couple days before using it.</li>
    <li> Heres the thing, these brushes are not the worst I have ever gotten, they aren&#x27;t the best but I am basing that off of feel alone.  I don&#x27;t think they are as soft as I expected them to be, they are bit rough, but not anything that will irritate your skin at all, I was coming from super soft brushes though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^ that is why their are 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said based off of the other reviews, I didn&#x27;t have any smell from the bag or brushes when I received them, there is some shedding, I have yet to see if after multiple uses that shedding stops or not.  in saying all of this though you DO get A LOT for your money, I mean that many different brushes your not going to find for this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d say its a great deal, not the best feeling brushes but definitely an affordable deal if you are looking to amp up the amount of brushes you have.</li>
    <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE AMAZING. I LOVE EVERTHING ABOUT THEM! THEY ARE SUPER SOFT HAVE EVERY EYE SHADOW AMD BLENDING BRUSH YOU CAN THINK OF. THE PACKAGING DOES HAVE A PLASTIC SMELL BUT ONCE OPENED IT DISAPPEARED. THEY ARE SUPER LONG FOR EASY USAGE! I WOULD DEFINITLY RECOMMEND THESE BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> like it but it smells</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes for personal use even after I read some of the terrible reviews. Glad I did, the brushes aren&#x27;t top of the line but you pay 15 dollars for them the bigger brushes shed a little and they do have a chemical smell but who doesn&#x27;t wash their brushes. I was hoping I would get a few nice brushes out of this large set. And I did the smaller brushes are great they&#x27;re firm don&#x27;t shed and wash with ease. Any one who complains about brushes they spent 15 dollars for I suggest buying this set for small brushes and spend money good money of foundation brushes like sigma is a good brand.</li>
    <li> To me theses 32 Pcs Black Rod Makeup Brush Cosmetic Set Kit with Case seem to be a little harder than I like.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes primarily because I needed a few more eyeshadow brushes and powder/bronzer brushes. They were incredibly affordable. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with them. Bristles don&#x27;t fall out. However, they aren&#x27;t soft. And the kit comes with far more tiny brushes -- like for creases and eyeliners -- than I&#x27;ll probably ever use. Shadow brushes are probably bigger than I ideally like and blusher brushes could be thicker. But all in all, they&#x27;re not bad and I&#x27;m certainly adding several of them to my regular makeup kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend. She Love theme, I had purchase this Iteam for me a couple of Months ago After she seen my Brush set she decided that she wonted 3 sets.</li>
    <li> I got my brushes within two days of ordering them and they smell like plastic and so much fall out from the brushes. There are many dupes of the same brush. The face brushes are not soft and rough. I do not recommend this product. If you want good brushes, I suggest elf. Very unhappy with them.</li>
    <li> So I Ordered my brushes on Tuesday and they came Thrusday afternoon. i love them they do have a really harsh smell to them at first but they are good. One thing i would say is that it doesnt include a blending eyeshadow brush i was very dissapointed. But overall its a nice deAL.</li>
    <li> These Brushes are okay if you are just starting out. Not high Quality!</li>
    <li> I love the many brushes it has.. even though I have no idea what to do with them..lol&lt;br /&gt;The only con, would be they brushes do shead. I can say that. But I guess ill be fine.Lol</li>
    <li> Large assortment of different sized brushes.  Makes it easy to put on makeup.  Good value for the money.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s of brushes to work with only thing that bummed me out just a little was there was no &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; brush for blending in eye shadow into your crease but other than that really like these brushes!</li>
    <li> not awful but not the best, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, they do not hold the make-up well, and the brush falls off</li>
    <li> These brushes are fine.  They&#x27;re not great.  I find the eye brushes don&#x27;t hold on to as much powder as I&#x27;d like.  Some of them are pointless if you don&#x27;t know much about applying makeup.  It says 32 pieces, but you should know that about 5 of the brushes are duplicates.  They&#x27;d probably make a good gift to the guy or girl in your life who loves to beat their face everyday and doesn&#x27;t have a decent start-up brush kit, but they&#x27;re nothing to write home about and they are NOT for a professional.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any smell with these, like other reviewers reported. The brushes are great quality, no shedding, not too hard, not too soft; and there are more than anyone other than a professional makeup artist would need. The bag isn&#x27;t anything to write home about, but it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> They work great. It would probably be better if I knew what they were all for. It&#x27;s a learning experience.</li>
    <li> They seem really soft when you get them and then they get rough after you wash them and the glue makes them fall apart after only a few washes.</li>
    <li> For the price you can not go wrong. The case is awesome, and the brushes are fantastic. Seriously such a good deal!</li>
    <li> I have yet to use my new brushes but all seems great. The shipping was super fast! I only gave a four star because like others have stated the case does have a strong odor, luckily the brushes have no smell. The bristle do fall out a bit at first, but as I like to pre-wash all my brushes before use anyways, I am not concerned. I am pretty satisfied with the price and quality.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Still have them years later and still use them. Only one of them broke.</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you need! I am starting to build my make up artist kit and this is close to perfect. The bigger brushes could be a little better but at this price I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> What a great kit to have! So many different brushes! It&#x27;s great if you want to share with friends or family, too.</li>
    <li> Great quality brush, the handles are cheap but are semi-durable. Decent for the price. Nicely organized makeup brush case, good quality.</li>
    <li> It has many brushes . But not in good material . U can feel the cheap quality.i can&#x27;t use the big one bcz it is hard and hurt my skin . Only the small brushes r ok to use</li>
    <li> Came on time, and it&#x27;s up to the standards I had hoped! 😊</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay, they need to be groomed before use and that&#x27;s about their only flaw.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with these make up brushes, these brushes hold up and you get a lot for a cheap price</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush collection!!!  I can&#x27;t believe how many it came with -despite its description I don&#x27;t think i really believed it would come with that many!  The case is a really cool roll-up case that, when unrolled, displays all brushes in their handy little slots.  This will probably last me for YEARS!  There are many brushes that I will be using for eyebrows, lips, eyeliner, and blush, with MANY to spare.  Great set!!</li>
    <li> The brushes were falling apart when, I applied my makeup.. this product is no good. I should not have to remove the product of my face,after applying my makeup. I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> when i first got this i was realyy excited because i was hoping this would help me complete  my brush collection!  this was a waste of money.  They are almost exactly the same as the elf essential brushes and they shed and fall apart just like the elf ones.  If you are looking for cheap brushes i would recommend the elf (eyes lips face) studio line. They may be a little bit more expensive but theu dont breal and are very soft!</li>
    <li> awesome! i love these brushes :) they&#x27;re cheap and work very well! I just wish there was a instruction manual. i don&#x27;t know how to use all the brushes...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not bad, but if they had been any higher in price I&#x27;d be annoyed. After the first few uses the hairs stop shedding and they&#x27;ve lasted me 6 months (and still going). But these aren&#x27;t long term brushes. I imagine I&#x27;ll have to through them out in six-nine months.</li>
    <li> I have so many brushes, I don&#x27;t even know how to use them all lol</li>
    <li> These keep shedding. The smell faded after a while but the crappy quality did not. Most of these brushes are useless too.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item as gift for my mom. They were packaged well; each brush had a cover over them and was also wrapped in plastic. The hairs on the brushes were soft and the case was organized. She loves them!</li>
    <li> I definitely suggest washing them before you use them to remove the shedding of the brushes. However they are good brushes and are different sizes so you&#x27;ll have just about whatever size you need.</li>
    <li> I bought a set for my girlfriend and one for myself, we love them.  They are soft easy to clean and do not split.  Keep them in their case and keep them clean these will be with you for a long time.  When I replace mine i will be buying the same exact set.</li>
    <li> Received the brushes and while they say MAC on them, I&#x27;m pretty sure these aren&#x27;t...I&#x27;ve had bristles fall out on me every time I&#x27;ve used it and I don&#x27;t think a true MAC product would do that. For the money, just an ok set for a beginner.</li>
    <li> I am not a big make up person, but like to have enough items around because things always get lost.  The brushes were soft and plentiful.  The hair bristles don&#x27;t easily come off and stay on my face.  I&#x27;ve used the brushes from Mac and Bare Escentuals and those bristles fall off and make my skin itch.  So far this have worked better.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> The hair of the brushes fall out all the time .</li>
    <li> Great brushes, I do mostly FX type makeup and these work well with traditional cosmetics and water based makeup as well. So far they&#x27;ve done exactly what I&#x27;ve needed them for.</li>
    <li> GOD I LOVE THESE you don&#x27;t have to buy expensive brushes to get quality stuff! Ive had no problems with them at all they&#x27;ve been wonderful!</li>
    <li> all good, nice quality for the price...</li>
    <li> The brushes are a good quality their is no shedding at all I gave them 4 stars because they give you a few brushes that are almost identical which is unnecessary ..but overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and they arrived in 2 days :)</li>
    <li> I am fairly satisfied with my purchase. I threw about half the brushes away because they were so crappy, but the other half of them are pretty good. It is completely what I expected for $13 and it worked out well because I just used the extra space in the carrying case for brushes I already had. I love the large case they came in. It looks professional. I purchased the brushes for a wedding make up I was doing for 6 bridesmaids. They served their purpose.</li>
    <li> First of all, I was so excited to get these! The vinyl smell of the brush holder was strong but not something that really bothered me. I work at retail and we sell a lot of bags from vinyl, faux leather, and real leather so it&#x27;s normal. I opened it up removed all brushes to air out and noticed that some of the pockets for the brushes weren&#x27;t sown well. So those brushes no longer can be held in it&#x27;s pocket. The bristles on the larger brushes were very course and there was a lot of fall out. The rest of them were synthetic and they reminded me of my bh cosmetic brushes. I thought that they just needed a deep cleansing. After cleaning and drying, the large brushes got super tangled at the bristles and still way too much fall out. Then I started to notice that the paint on the rods were flaking off. It looked like it was literally spray painted on with out it being primered before painted or set after painted. They looked so good just solid matte black, not anymore. So out goes the large brushes... And I feel like I can save the rest of the smaller brushes because they&#x27;re sinthetic but is it worth trying to sand down the original paint, and repainting it? I&#x27;m holding on to it just in case. I&#x27;d rather by a set from walmart when it comes out during the holidays. I&#x27;m sure those would last throughout a wash. Sad that I didn&#x27;t even get to use them.</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes! wonderful quality! Soft and a brush for every application possible. I will buy more of these dand send them as birthday presents</li>
    <li> Brushes very soft, though it did smell like a very strong paint like smell when I first opened it, some of the top of the brushes became detached from the handle, and the bag after awhile to strings to tie it up together started tearing apart. It still closes, I had to put super glue to keep the tops of the brushes from falling off, and I had to air it out for a bit just so it wouldn&#x27;t smell too much like paint</li>
    <li> im so happy with the result I get when applying makeup with these brushes. It just kind of sucks that instead of 32 different brushes, many of them were duplicates. Luckily im a makeup artist, and I can find a use for anything. Multiple eye brushes is actually a good thing in my line of work. Just wish they didn&#x27;t lose so much hair when I use them.</li>
    <li> Overall good product. Love the variety of brushes, and love the packaging and the brushes are really soft to the skin</li>
    <li> I Love Them😍😍😍 They Are Perfect</li>
    <li> For the larger brushes the hairs just fall out.  I like the quantity for the price but the quality isn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
    <li> excellent for fast delivery , I would totally recommend</li>
    <li> Love it thank u. My friends love it they&lt;br /&gt;also want a set. I will recommend it to everyone. Thanks</li>
    <li> I read a lot of other reviews before I ordered and thought I&#x27;d give it a try ... I&#x27;m glad I did! This is a great brush set ... I can def see the awful shedding in the larger head brushes, but the smaller ones (which I use most) have not shed at all ... This was for sure great for the price ... and yes there was a smell of some sort when I first received it but it&#x27;s not as bad as other reviewers have stated. I didn&#x27;t even notice the smell the next day after receiving them...  OVER ALL -&amp;#62; GO FOR IT!  :)</li>
    <li> They were delivered on time. Theirs only one problem the bigger brushes are not great they shed a lot but the smaller ones are amazing they work super great</li>
    <li> Gotten so much fall out from there brushes not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The brushes are not good! The bristles fall out and they are too rough on the face. I returned mine.</li>
    <li> Awesome , soft brushes!</li>
    <li> OMFG SHEDS LIKE S***! but,when it stops its okay.ish</li>
    <li> Their good brushes and good quality as well. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about them was that it didn&#x27;t have anything to know what each brushes are for.</li>
    <li> Great for the price brushes do Shedd a little.</li>
    <li> when I bought these brushes I know that it wont be a good quality according to the price , but I didn&#x27;t expect it will be this bad , the hair is falling whenever you touch the brushes . now I am really try to sell them to anyone so I can get red of them</li>
    <li> I highly doubt this product has bad reviews, literally best amount of brushes and great quality for the price! Better than e.l.f. brushes from target, not as good as mac. I love make up, and this kit fills every requirement of brushes! EXCEPT the contouring brush. I use the one from mac.! I love this package! its my favorite that&#x27;s why I gave them 5/5. you pay less and get so much more.&lt;br /&gt;trustttttt meeeeeee!</li>
    <li> The case is already shredded</li>
    <li> Too many brushes for my taste. I dont know what to do with most of them. But great for aspiring make up artist</li>
    <li> Bought the brush set for my daughter and she loves it!  She&#x27;s a beautician and make up artist and the brushes are awesome!  The variety and different sizes are awesome and come in a really cool case.</li>
    <li> Smelled horrible. Fell apart, and hard to clean! Spend the few extra dollars for better quality.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered these, considering their price. I was VERY surprised at the quality! I love these and would compare them to some of the higher end makeup brushes. These are a must have</li>
    <li> People-- stop overreacting. For $15 these brushes are amazing. Nice quality, soft, no fallout. Of course they&#x27;re not a high-end brand but you get what you pay for. These are very good quality with a nice case. The smell goes away after a few hours, as with any fabric.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. The interesting part is that the set contains right material brush for the right purpose. The brushes are made of sable and goat hair makes it easy to clean and you get a good finish. She has just used it once - So, I can&#x27;t say much about the life of these brushes but they are worth for the money.</li>
    <li> they are as described, they are as others have said.. but for the price they are OK ... once you get all the loose hairs off</li>
    <li> Larger brushes shed like crazy..smaller brushes aren&#x27;t to bad if using them for concealer, cleaning up your brows or something.  All of them are so similar in size and the smell is horrible on the brushes and the case. You definitely get what you pay for I would not recommend!</li>
    <li> I really love my new brushes! I use them everyday and I will recommend them to my friends! Love, love, love</li>
    <li> I like all the variety of brushes but it would be nice if the blush/powder brushes didn&#x27;t fall apart when apply...the little \\&quot;hairs\\&quot; stay on your face. Annoying.</li>
    <li> good of your a beginner but the quality is poor dont expect these brushes to be grade A</li>
    <li> I received them very quickly. . Excited to try them out...</li>
    <li> so surprised about how good it was! lovin it! im good for a while now. recommend it if you want alot toys ;)</li>
    <li> Kinda cheap material but they are very nice</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. It&#x27;s true what they say you get what you paid for. Bristles keeps falling off. My powder brush came in like some dog chewed it up.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery!!! The product will shed a little at first, but it will stop.  I love them. I recommend to buy them if you know how to use all these brushes.  This set is awesome and you will find a few doubles (not many) which is good to have when using many shades.  If you get them, have fun and don&#x27;t get scared if they shed because it will stop.  For the price, I was so surprised to have received such quality product.</li>
    <li> The larger face brushes shed quite a bit, but they still work for applying powders/bronzers. The eye shadow brushes are perfect. For the cost of the product, I would definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> They are great , its just entirely too much shedding. If the shedding was fixed then they would be excellent brushes.</li>
    <li> These were the worst makeup brushes I have ever purchased. They are not soft and do not work for makeup at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product for a great price. Not as soft as I wanted but still lovely! Thank you for a speedy shipment.</li>
    <li> Said something a little too soon. The biggest brush started falling apart right away. Actually all the red hair brushes start to fall apart. The rest are great!</li>
    <li> good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I read that these brushes were really bad an smelled and people were missing brushes. I don&#x27;t think they lied , maybe the ones they received did have those negative features. Mine are all here, the face brushes are soft not at all rough, and they don&#x27;t smell. I guess I got lucky,but I love these brushes! I&#x27;m glad I ordered them anyway!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a couple months now &amp; All of the larger brushes shed bristles.  And not like 4 or 5, but like 20 fall out.  I always have bristles all over my face when I use one of these brushes.  The smaller ones are pretty good though and their bristles have not fallen out.  But I mostly use the larger brushes and they suck. Now I have to get new ones.</li>
    <li> Since receiving my brushes, I have not had any shedding of the bristles. I am not a make-up artist, so really did not need as many brushes, but still fun to try them out.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They really blend and apply my makeup well. There is a brush for everything you need to do with your makeup.</li>
    <li> This brush set is perfect for beginners to begin experimenting with foundation, blush, concealer, powder brushes.  Am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my daughter and she loved it so much I ordered one for myself</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, I was a little scared of ordering this brushes because of some of the raiting, the brushes do smell a little but it&#x27;s because of the plastic case. Hope everyone knows how to wash/clean brushes other than that they are awesome I love them and the price makes them even better!!!!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The bristles are so rough they actually hurt your skin when applying make up. Of course the hair is already falling off. If you were going for a cheaper option, you are better off buying eco brushes from cvs.</li>
    <li> I have only used a few of these brushes since I received them, but I love them already! They are good (not great) quality and don&#x27;t look cheap to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stiffer brushed are holding their shape and the softwer, larger brushes feel GREAT on the skin. They do not remove too much product while you are working with them and bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for beginning professionals or home use. I am a home user.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for me. Really nice brushes, really light. The case can go in a purse because it&#x27;s not that big. I only thougt the bruses would be natural hair, but as looking at those, I really think it&#x27;s sintetical. I&#x27;d just appreciate with the logo of the brand came in the case or in the brush as a pattern. It&#x27;s sad that I can&#x27;t say to my clients where they&#x27;re from.</li>
    <li> I was a little sceptical at first but I must say these brushes turned out quite fine. I would recommend these brushes any day.</li>
    <li> GOOD: Lots of brushes and stuff only the ladies know what it&#x27;s for. My GF is happy she loves them, she was always complaining about her brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD: Does smell a little bit (the case) like permanent marker but goes away after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the bristles  was kinda loose and not as firm as the ones I bought years before. but I would not return them .</li>
    <li> All the large brushes are very rough and did not feel good on my face. I finally stop using them. all the small ones are great. They do smell odd when you open them and it takes a good while for the smell to go away. but over all they are ok and priced good</li>
    <li> Bought it for my little sister who turned 17. She&#x27;s a makeup fanatic and wanted mac brushes but I decided to buy her something less expensive since she&#x27;s still experimenting. She ended up loving them! Sure they&#x27;re not the best quality but they are great for a beginner set. Her friends are constantly asking her how much I paid for the set and it&#x27;s hilarious watching their reaction when she says $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love them, I might buy myself a set as well.</li>
    <li> some of the brushes shed. its ok for the price....still use my brand brushes... these are backups for &#x27;in case&#x27; stuff</li>
    <li> i bought these brushes per recommendation from a friend who bought the same pack. the brushes i received were 100% different than the ones she got. my brush heads were all made out of some sort of plasticly feeling bristles and they only give you around 6 different brushes, but they give you like 4 of each type. When you go to put these in your products, because of the roughness of the bristles it actually breaks your shadows and then when you go to apply it you get so much fall out. would not recommend these to anyone. i ended up throwing the majority of them away. The 3 I kept, I use to do my nails with.</li>
    <li> I just really started getting into make up. These brush are  perfect for practicing skills and learning the different types of brushes. After you was the brushes the hairs fall in place and there is no shedding. The angle brushes ARE THE PERFECT.</li>
    <li> Comes with every brush you could think of needing! Awesome case to transport and keep brushes clean and debris free while not in us. Very happy!!</li>
    <li> The bag has a weird smell but the makeup brush set is perfect.  Just wash the bag with a bit of soap and water and the smell goes away.</li>
    <li> These brushes are VERY rough on the skin and shed quite a bit. I would recommend just getting a couple good ones at Sephora, because these are not worth it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, you get what you pay for.  Some of the brushes do shed, but that&#x27;s what happens when you don&#x27;t spend a lot of money.  I am happy with them though so they&#x27;re okay with me.</li>
    <li> This brush set isn&#x27;t getting five stars because of the brush case. I read it was leather with black stitching. The stitching is white and looks super cheap! This was a gift to my daughter so I&#x27;m disappointed in the brush case. I tried to contact the retailer to replace the case, but didn&#x27;t happen. The brushes are soft and those that are a bit brisk need to be. I would buy the brushes again, but the case should be replaced with that as stated.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely HORRIBLE! I bought them because I saw some good reviews on here, but I have absolutely nothing good to say about these. First off, the little brush hairs fall out ALL the time. Plus, they had a strong paint like smell when I first got them, and I just assumed it was maybe the bag. No, it was the freaking brushes. After using them straight out of the pouch for 2 days, my face was absolutely ruined. I have never been so broken out in my life and ended up having to spend the money I could have spent on quality makeup brushes on a Clarisonic and facial treatments. I washed the remainder of the brushes that I had never used and BLACK PAINT CAME OUT OF THE FREAKING BRUSHES! SOOO NASTY! I still have redness and scarring 2 months later and I&#x27;m scared my face will never be back to normal. My advice is don&#x27;t waste your money on these brushes, and just save up for some quality ones because you will only lose more time and money in the long run with these.</li>
    <li> Great product, for being synthetic, It&#x27;s not Eco Tools or anything but its nice. I only got this set for one brush, the eyeliner brush, and I&#x27;m now using a to more of the brushes and my makeup looks pretty awesome if you ask me :)</li>
    <li> Before I bought them, I read all the bad reviews. I agree with some of the comments, the vinyl carrier smells like nail enamel thinner, but the smell has subsided a bit after airing out. As a painter I always pull the hair in the brushes prior to use to get all the loose hairs before dipping them in paint, so, I did the same to these makeup brushes. I noticed that the only ones that shed were the real hair ones, (the half fan, 2 fat/blush and 1 angle/fat/blush. The rest did not budge at all. As far as the shedding goes,  they did not shed lots of hair, the brush integrity (shape-thickness) did not change.  32 brushes for the price I paid for 1 Revlon, I say it&#x27;s a pretty good bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy a set to do my actual painting-painting (&amp;iquest;have you any idea how much a single paint brush goes at an arts store? $$$)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 2 daughters and they really like it..alot of brushes, quick shipping and looks just as picture shown.</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooo ridiculous!! I paid $15 for 32 brushes and i could not believe the quality i got for my money! They do not shed at all witch is great! And the handles do not get lose and fall off witch i was surprised how well these brushes work for the price! I cant say that enough. I have no idea what brand they are cause there is no name but they are great!! It looks like there is a few that may be the same but i dont care because i can use the same brush for another eye shadow color without having to clean it right away. The caring case is nice. I keep them in 2 small glasses, one for the face brushes &amp; one for the eye brushes. But if i travel i just throw them in the bag &amp; go. I even love these more than some of my Sigma brushes. These dont shed like those ones, witch is a big deal for me. I hate picking hairs off my face &amp; rubbing my eye makeup off in the process.</li>
    <li> Nice, but obviously on the cheap side.... they are soft, and will probably stand toe to toe with almost any product out there...at least for a short time.  Not sure about the longevity of them, although I don&#x27;t know much about this sort of thing.  My daughter asked for them and I will see how long before she asks for more, and will update the post them.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my Mac brushes but good for price a lot of brushes not really a leather case but holds all the brushes</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Multiple ones to choose from&lt;br /&gt;Soft brush tips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Shedding&lt;br /&gt;Easy to break tip of brushes from the stick</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be good. All of the hairs fall out and they are not soft. don&#x27;t buy this</li>
    <li> They would always flake &amp; some of my brush handles actually broke</li>
    <li> I love the bag and the amount you get for the price but it essentially the same 3 or 4 brushes just varying sizes. It lacks a true brush for the crease. This seems more for a make up artist than a set for someone doing their own make up at home</li>
    <li> Do not buy. The smaller ones work great, but the larger ones fall apart upon brushing over your makeup powders and your face. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have never used professional brushes and still really do not since I do not know how to use these. They seem cheaply made but they were cheap so oh well</li>
    <li> This product was very nice! Very well proced and got the job done right! Forget those expencive Mac brushes. These are just as soft and workable.</li>
    <li> One of the first items I purchase based on the average reviews and it is horrible! The brushes are so hard that they hurt you!</li>
    <li> I like these brushes, the range they come in and that they come with a case. But, on some of the fluffier or bigger brushes hairs come out all the time and get stuck in my makeup. Also, the case doesn&#x27;t fully enclose the brushes so the ones on the end fall out. Over all they&#x27;re not bad but I don&#x27;t use all of them because of the shedding of the brush.</li>
    <li> Brush were not what I expected.  Brush are made with low grade material.</li>
    <li> Brushes are okay. Bought for my daughter. Contain a weird smell to them. Overall they&#x27;re fine, but the smell is really bad. Pretty good for price.</li>
    <li> A lot of brushes but the main brushes I needed were not in this kit. They should add a countour brush</li>
    <li> The brushes are good for the price, the only bad thing I can say is that they sent me repeated brushes. Other than that their good the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out and didn&#x27;t pay to much out of pocket.</li>
    <li> This only gets an okay rating because I only received 31 out of the 32 brushes, otherwise this brush set would have been an amazing buy if it came complete.</li>
    <li> Wow tons of brushes that fit every need.  Natural hair ... I didn&#x27;t believe the claim would be true, not at the great price, but it was!  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  I bought two sets, but the brushes were not the same in each set, which I found weird.  In one set I had more brushes with sponge tips and in the other I had more angled eyeshadow  brushes of varying sizes.  I&#x27;m not too bothered by that because there are so many brushes that, even with the difference in types of brushes in each kit, there are more than enough brushes to fit any need.  While this kit is a great value and the brushes are pretty good, do not think that you are getting professional-grade brushes.  This would not be something a pro makeup artist would use.  But for me, a regular off-the-street makeup user they are awesome.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase these if I was you!! JUNK!.  Case is plastic and it came to me torn, now how can I give that to someone as a gift??  I CAN&#x27;T!</li>
    <li> the hair of the brushes were falling out right when i opened them. the hair was not soft sadly and all around bad qualities</li>
    <li> Eye shadow brushes are okay, just not the fluffy ones. Face brushes are horrible. Overall not worth the price. There&#x27;s better affordable brushes to invest your money in.</li>
    <li> CAME EARLY IN &amp; THESE BRUSHES ARE SWEET IDC ABOUT THE OTHER REVIEWS THEYRE SOFT &amp; PACK COLOR REALLY WELL, APPLYS SOFT &amp; EASILY! WELL WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> As soon as they arrived I noticed the brushes had been heavily shedding the whole trip. I have cleaned them and they&#x27;re still shedding. Very poorly made. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Hi Guys,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my bf&#x27;s account to order these brushes and they&#x27;re pretty good.  I ordered them mainly for the eye brushes and I have not experienced any shedding with them and I&#x27;ve used and washed them multiple times.  The larger brushes however do shed but nothing major. I was skeptical about buying these when I saw the awful reviews but they&#x27;re good brushes. I didn&#x27;t expect MAC-quality but for the price they&#x27;re good. Oh yes, and alot of persons have been raving about the awful smell, please, the brushes don&#x27;t smell, its the case and it just smells like if you bought something new and kept it in plastic for a while.</li>
    <li> Quality on these brushes were terrible. Hairs fall off while using them. I can tell why the price was so cheap.</li>
    <li> So before I usually buy anything, i usually read at least half of the reviews by others to get a feel for the product. So I hope this review helps anyone whose not really sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well when I first received the brushes, they were packaged very nicely. There was a smell but it wasn&#x27;t strong and sure enough it was gone after a few days. These brushes are amazing for their price. If you were to go and buy real haired brushes of course they are going to work much better, but for the price of $13, you can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommended these brushes to professionals because I personally feel as though my makeup doesnt stick to the brushes as well as other brushes i&#x27;ve tried. I usually buy my makeup from Kiko, MAC, and a bunch of Sephora Brands - esp Urban Decay. The makeup doesnt stick as well while applying and I do feel that I have to use more product in order to for it to even look like there is makeup on my eyelids. I would recommend these brushes to beginners or to people who do their makeup every one in a while. There also are many varieties of brushes for different things you&#x27;d like to try. The brushes are pretty soft for not being actual human hair, so no complaints there. In the end, I would buy these brushes again for starting, but now that i&#x27;ve passed my beginners stage in makeup, i will definitely invest in something much more expensive and worth its while.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> this is a great deal, highly recommend it, excellent product for such price! I would for sure but another set as a gift for a friend</li>
    <li> Great gift for the wife. She had plenty of make up stuff but this one is one of the best sets that she has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Would seem too good to be true! BUT! It is a great buy, the hairs do not fall out as much as other reviews have said, it does however give off a paint order when opened, this is due to the pouch it comes in. Just let it air out and you&#x27;re all set! Awesome Steal!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear make-up often so I don&#x27;t have to worry about these too often - I was just looking for a more complete set than I would find at a convenience store.  The brushes are INCREDIBLY rough - they certainly grab a LOT of powder with little more than touching them to the make up which means a lot off waste as I have to blow it off so I don&#x27;t end up with a blush colored streak across my face :)  Since others have said these brushes are really soft, I can only imagine they sit in a warehouse somewhere with piles of random brushes and just grab n stuff em into cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the case - it has fake MAC symbol on it, which I thought was INCREDIBLY TACKY.  They were cheap, so quality could not be expected, but really guys??? MAC???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend, she loves them</li>
    <li> These are so wonderful!  They work great, clean up we and are durable.  The case is so easy to use and saves so much time and clutter!</li>
    <li> It makes my face itch. Very hard brizzles. Not highly commendable</li>
    <li> Love my brush set great brushes great quality just hate that they&#x27;re not labeled &amp;&amp; the smell of the packaging -_- other than that great product</li>
    <li> Good product but some brushes are not sturdy!!</li>
    <li> brushes a little to stiff but overall lovely!</li>
    <li> The brushes are good quality. The only complaint I have is that the case smells really bad and is not of the highest quality. Other than that I would recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. There isn&#x27;t a variation in brushes most them come in multiples of four and one of them even broke already! Most of the brushes are ruff and shed like crazy ! I</li>
    <li> The big brushes shed like crazy. The smaller ones are a little bit better, but they are still pretty bad quality. I guess that&#x27;s expected since the kit is pretty cheap...</li>
    <li> Great quality! Super fast shipping and product is very nice! In stores you would pay Atleast $80 for these.. I love them, they have every brush you need from eyelash brush to a fan brush!</li>
    <li> My daughter was blown away with this makeup brush set!  I loved this gift because its something different.  I started using &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; brushes to put on eye shadow and blush some years ago and it really does make a huge difference in the way your makeup looks.  (Those little foam things that come with makeup are crap!!).  This was a really nice gift and she loves it and uses it every day!</li>
    <li> This is acheap set of brushes. The bristles are not very soft and they shed like crazy</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the quality of the brushes, I have soft sensitive skin so it didn&#x27;t work out for me</li>
    <li> I just received my brush set! Came way earlier than expected. Brushes were all in perfect condition and the bristles are all super soft. I&#x27;m not a professional or anything but I do love to play around with makeup and this is the perfect kit to have in your collection of you don&#x27;t wanna spend big bucks. The only bad thing is the plastic smell that you get when you first open the package. It goes away pretty quick however. I would definitely buy again or as a gift. Awesome starter set. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good set other than the fact that the seven brushes made of natural hair fall out like crazy. I washed it before I used it trying to take out all the fallout but no matter what it kept coming out and I&#x27;ll end up of strands on my face. The fan brush had a ridiculous chunk come out of it. It&#x27;s kind of harsh on the face as well. I use the other brushes a lot without a problem. Most of them are duplicates but that&#x27;s fine with me. There are some brushes I still don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s for. It did come with a strong odor but it went away after a while. Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good set for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Im from south america, I ordered theses brushes and it came on time. The packaging was good and everything they said would be in it was. However, when it came to the actual use of the product thats where the problem began. I always wash my brushes before I use them. While washing the big brushes I noticed the bristles were in the water. Alot of bristles came out and its useless at this point. While applying powder and blush the bristles wud be all over your face, falling out everywhere.  The small brushes are intact and works great. I would recommend give bh cometics brushes a try. You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time!! All brushes are so soft and no stray/ broken hairs on the brushes! All come individually wrapped. Its a steal for the price! Awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product. It was definitely a good buy for what i paid. The only thing is that there wasn&#x27;t a softer/ plush eye shadow brush. Other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this set to someone that doesn&#x27;t wear make up everyday and has been applying makeup for a while.  Not a bad set, it gets the job done but I have much better brushes. Would I order these again - probably so. The case is nothing special either but I could care less about the case I took them out and put them with all the rest of my brushes.</li>
    <li> Bought this set as gift for my daughter who has her Utube channel on beauty. She loves the brushes. Very eager to start new videos, I read reviews and was keen to buy Coastal Scents, but they were on back order, so got these.</li>
    <li> Besides the really strange smelling case, these brushes are great!! I&#x27;ve used many different brushes, but none this inexpensive and this quality! Great!</li>
    <li> Good usable product...  My girlfriend love it....  And the price is excellent against quality.. You will enjoy to purchase it.</li>
    <li> the brushes are pretty cheap so they fall apart pretty easy and the hairs come out of them even easier.</li>
    <li> I gave it as a Christmas present. It was a great price and my daughter said the variety of brushes was perfect for applying her make-up.</li>
    <li> amazing price for this product. love it!!! I didnt give this a 5 star since the hair on these brushes doesnt pick up the color very well and it is stiff so a bit harse on the skin so use gentle strokes when applying</li>
    <li> I received this item way before expected. There is a strong smell I smelled it even before I opened up the package. The brushes are all wrapped in plastic. When I used one of the brushes to blend in my cover one of the hair pieces did come off that is my only con. The smell is not as strong when I first received it. Def get this if you use a lot of brushes and need extras I am so glad I bought this! Do not hesitate. The company answered my emails and helped me with whatever questions I had. I highly recommend this company and will def buy from them again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING !! I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have used many different types of brushes. These brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed &amp; are beautiful !! You get more than you pay for !! Worth every penny. I love Shany cosmetics !!</li>
    <li> You get Moneys worth for the price. The brushes are soft, firm and works well. Love it! Def recommend it, no regrets.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sister. A make-up addict and I must say these are great. She uses these everyday and says they work for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with price and quantity of my purchase, I wish the brush hairs didn&#x27;t fall out so easily but over all I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> Very good selection of brushes and as a beginner, I am very happy for what I paid! Besides that, the bag does smell!!!! :(</li>
    <li> They are really soft and they are really cute. One thing I would change about them though is how flat the all come. That can be a adjusted by just spinning the bristles in your hand to make them more rounded out. Other than that, they are perfect. Remember to always wash your brushes before you use them! They last waaaay longer and the soap gets out all the icky stuff.</li>
    <li> I previously only owned about 6 make-up brushes and my mom asked me if she could have my brushes so she could use them &#x27;cause she didn&#x27;t have any, I obviously declined. That is, until I found these and ordered them for myself, I love them! There are so many different style brushes and they are all in great condition, especially for the price. I washed my old brushes and let my mom have them, I kept these all to myself!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had good reviews, but again it&#x27;s all personal preference. I used them for the first time and all of the powder brushes were shedding the second I took the plastic off of them, and they kind of like on the skin, I like the eyeshadow brushes mostly. Overall, they&#x27;re okay. But if you want them to be amazing, definitely need higher end brands.</li>
    <li> amazing&lt;br /&gt;soft&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;good variety&lt;br /&gt;long lasting&lt;br /&gt;dont smell bad&lt;br /&gt;overall i recommend getting these if you are on a money crunch</li>
    <li> I dont like it..! The quality its bad i dont recommended at all.. I don&#x27;t even used it bad bad</li>
    <li> Wish they were softer but it&#x27;s incredible set. Especially for starter sets.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had any issues and they arrived faster than expected.</li>
    <li> the shipping was great and easy and brushes was good for the price you pay. What really disappointed me was that I didn&#x27;t really get the brushes I was expecting. you&#x27;d that isa 32 piecebrushset</li>
    <li> I read the reviewsbefore i purchased this set, what made me want to buy was a review where someone claimed they are a MUA and loved the set, there was also another comment describing the brushed aw soft. What made me think twice was the comments where they described the smell of the brushes as horrid. Although the brushes did not have a ununderstandable bad smell. The brushes are not soft and aren&#x27;t a choice for MUA. I do like the eye brushes that are decent and will work. The face brushes came with the hairs bent in diffrent directions and are not soft at all... if your looking for just a set of brushes and it doesnt matter the texture of the brushes this will do as it does come with 32 brushes.</li>
    <li> Smell goes away within a day of using. They shed the first time then stop shedding. They work great. No compaints, really. They are Bobbi Brown or Mac or Chanel, so don&#x27;t expect that. They are absolutely do-able!</li>
    <li> These brushes are unnamed and there are like a lot of the same brushes. I do like that the hairs are soft. I use elf brushes and they are rough. But these brushes feel great on my skin</li>
    <li> First time purchasing a makeup brush set with case. Was a strong paint smell but disappeared within 5minutes of opening.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I looked at this kit. The bristle quality feels the same as on any paint brush. If someone is looking for reasonable brushes, they should go for e.l.f. They are far more better quality and more or less same price.</li>
    <li> Looks great can&#x27;t wait to give it to my mom as a present! It&#x27;s way better than I expected</li>
    <li> The smaller brushes are very good quality but the larger brushes were horrible and did not hold any product. I ended up throwing out the larger ones and keeping the smaller ones.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the head of the brushes wasn&#x27;t glued on, and keep falling off.  The quality of the brushes are actually very good, but I will have to glue all the brushes on to the handles.  The variety of brush types is very nice, and there is no shedding at all.  For the price, the value is pretty good.  You just may have to glue the brushes on.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and could not find  Thank you  I will enjoy using these each day</li>
    <li> This brushes are bad quality. Don&#x27;t like them because the hair is kind of stiff and don&#x27;t like the way they work.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing only thing is no names. But here are the names/purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for almost 2 years &amp; im sad to say my brushes are falling apart better yet they&#x27;re coming unglued. But for how cheap they were the case is nice &amp; they lasted longer than expected! Nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! While a few hairs are out of place, none have fallen out. The case does have a strong smell but after letting it air out, the smell is gone. I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Almost too many brushes for me but they are a great quality.  The case, as a whole, is quite large and wouldn&#x27;t be travel friendly, but, it is nice for storing.</li>
    <li> love these brushes! Many ppl said how bad the case smelled when they first got it, there was a smell to it but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable, and it went away pretty quickly. The brushes are very soft and with the number of brushes you get, it&#x27;s totally worth the price! Will deff buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read previous reviews regarding the smell of the case and quality of the brushes. Yes, does have a chemical smell but I don&#x27;t use the case anyway. I cleaned the brushes before use and I would recommend cleaning them prior to using. As for the brushes, some are better quality than others. There&#x27;s a few that lose the bristles. Overall, you get what you pay for and it&#x27;s certainly worth the cost. If you have higher expectations for a cheap price, you might be disappointed and you&#x27;d be better off spending the extra on a name brand. I&#x27;ve used them for a cpl months and have discovered my favorite brushes. Some are perfect for contouring! I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my little sister for her birthday, and I was seriously impressed with what I got for the price! The case is nice and looks professional. The brushes are of good quality. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Recieved all brushes. The only issue is the big brushes sheds alot.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of affordable brushes. They are soft and easy to use. This is a great set for those who are starting to do makeup.</li>
    <li> Great love it. I even gotten 4 of them, 1 for myself and the rest as gift</li>
    <li> Love these brushes &amp; the case</li>
    <li> Alot of these brushes are the same ones and they Frey alot when ever I use them the bristles are left behind on my face I would suggest going with elf much better for a good price too. But with these I got what I played for and some of them are fabulous about 4-5 of the eyeshadow brushes I am in love with so it was worth it to me but the blush, foundation,  and powder  brushes are usless.</li>
    <li> I loved the makeup brushes. Big variety! Also they are soft ,unlike some brushes that are rough make my face breakout.</li>
    <li> Perfect for first time makeup brushes:) I did have to wash them to stop the fall out hairs but other than that I use these every day!!</li>
    <li> I love the set wish it came in a wooded pattern but this is still fine</li>
    <li> Face brushes suck a lot of shedding and brushes aren&#x27;t even soft</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my mother, though she had wished for a different color, she liked the brushes in the end. The large ones for the face (Blush brush,fan brush etc) are a little bristly feeling, and shed. I combed them out and trimmed them up and they because much smoother and nicer looking. Recommend for anyone on a budget, and wanting makeup brushes where you have a lot of variety. May buy another for myself next time.</li>
    <li> Brushes shed very bad and break. They are good for learning (sorta) but buyer beware. I am going to try sigma.</li>
    <li> On all of the brushes that contain animal hair, when you use them they have major fall out I would definitely not recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need for a god makeup brush set and after looking around I liked the reviews on this one. What none of the reviews mentioned was how quickly it takes to arrive. I ordered it and the tracing information told me it would take a few days to arrive, so imagine my surprise when it arrived the next day! Very happy with the set, despite the slight chemical smell, I&#x27;ve found if you just lay it open to air out, it goes away after about ten-fifteen minutes. Very happy with it, and would totally recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> These are good quality brushes at amazing price.I bought to for my girls for Christmas and they loved it. Must have for all women that wear makeup.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone though. The hairs on the brush shed like crazy. The pieces on the eyelash brush bent and broke off as I was trying to pull the plastic wrapper off of it. These brushes suck.</li>
    <li> It  came  pretty  fast  considering  that I  ordered  during  Xmas  season.  I&#x27;m  pleased  with  them. I  tried  to  clean  one  of  them  it  started  to  shed.  other than  that I  love  and recommend  them.</li>
    <li> Love the way they the brushes are all sorted out</li>
    <li> I ordered these based somewhat off of the reviews and the price point. They arrived promptly and did not have the smell as stated in previous reviews. I washed them before us , and there was very little shredding . The one thing I do not like is after cleaning they tend to lose their shape. Otherwise not a bad purchase for the money .</li>
    <li> great brushes and soft</li>
    <li> I knew not to get my hopes up entirely but I could&#x27;ve got better makeup brushes at walmart with their little makeup gift sets for like $5. Although the only brushes I love, the flat foundation, eyebrow groomer, eyelash, and miscellaneous brushes that will Not shed. The majority of the brushes I have received shed like CRAZY!!! I did not care for these \\&quot;MAC\\&quot; brushes at all. Yes I received the fake MAC brush set, judging from all the other reviews, guess it depends on if you&#x27;re luck of the draw to not receive crap. But like I said, LOVE the foundation brush!</li>
    <li> I love this set. The price is great for these brushes. Comes off a little paint order but the overall look of the brushes are great! I received the pkage fast and quick and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy brushes!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great variety of brushes for the price. The only downside is that you will have fall out on some of the brushes that will leave you with strands left on face.</li>
    <li> great value and they were very good quality. very surprised at the quantity also for the cost. I love them</li>
    <li> The bristles are constants falling put. &amp; the when I washed one of the face brushes, the red colored dye started to wash out.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was doing my makeup, my mother&#x27;s makeup, and my friend&#x27;s makeup for my wedding. I hated these brushes because the bristles are so rough. I did not feel like the applied the makeup nicely, and most of the brushes were unnecessary as they were very nearly the same shape/size. Also, the case is very flimsy vinyl. I highly doubt it would last very long if you traveled with your brushes regularly. I ended up giving these to my preteen neighbor to play around with because it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle to return them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these. Use the money to go to a beauty store where you can feel the fibers and only buy the brushes you want and would use.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these brushes yet, but they are so soft. The large fan brush is actually bigger than what I expected. All the brushes are really soft and dense. The leather case they come in looks so professional, but it does smell like paint. All the brushes came individually wrapped in the carrying case. I love them and can&#x27;t wait to use them!      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;QLa-k_rgaA4</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impress with this set.the brush fibers are not soft at all which makes it difficult when applying eye shadows Or Trying To Blend colors. I love the case and how professional the set look but I do believe that I got for what I paid. I&#x27;d hope that it would have been gentle on the skin..I&#x27;m not thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very stiff.  the cheek brushes are flat so they do not get as great of coverage as some of the round brushes I have had in the past. I will be replacing them as soon as I can.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re fine. The bigger brushes are sort of useless and they don&#x27;t do much, but all the small ones work great considering the price.</li>
    <li> I was drawn to this 32 piece set because of it&#x27;s low price, and I saw some good reviews so I decided to give it a try. It is true, the package had a very strong leather smell. It went away after a few days, but it would probably be very bothersome to someone with a sensitive nose. I have only found uses for about 4 of the brushes. Most of the brushes appear to be the same exact thing as the one next to them. They worked adequately until after about a week they started shedding all over my face during usage, and I got hairs in my eye that were difficult to get out. Also, when I washed them, they got hair everywhere, and continue to shed. This product is not worth it.</li>
    <li> This brush set, for the price, is good for someone who is looking for a set to use at home (not professionally). Yes, on some of the brushes the hairs tend to fall out which is disappointing. Though I found washing the brush with soap and warm water helps a bit. The product had a weird smell at first, but when I laid it out opened for 10 minutes the smell went away. All in all it is a good product for a first-time variety brush set. Make sure to wash your brushes before use and periodically during use!</li>
    <li> These brushes are #Everything ; )</li>
    <li> I have no complaints really. It&#x27;s probably more than I need so it&#x27;s difficult to handle all of them. But I like them. The smell goes away</li>
    <li> Yes, there is a slight smell. But it is not that bad! Came in great condition, packaged very well :) no hairs falling out of the brushes yet</li>
    <li> The bristles come off these brushes and end up on my face or on the floor. Wasted my money on these. Just goes to show you that you do get what you pay for. If it seems too good to be true it&#x27;s because it is.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that based off the reviews I would be one of the lucky ones who would give a five star. Unfortunately, I am not. These brushes are a huge waste of money. Please, do not buy them. I was putting on my makeup and ended up with hair EVERYWHERE. Stuck on my face and my clothes. It was horrible. These brushes are the worst. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I just received them today and they smell like paint and the hair falls off of the big fluffy brush and some aren&#x27;t that stuff but for the price there over all good</li>
    <li> I was so excited when this brush set came in. Then every brush I used or tried would lose a ton of bristles. My face would end up covered in hair. I tried clamping where the bristles meet the handle and glue. And nothing I tried worked. It was a waste of my time and money.</li>
    <li> All of the face brushes a useless. The hair sheds at the slightest touch! The eye and brow brushes are awesome! It&#x27;s worth the money IF you are not too interested in the face brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these brushs my makeup looks so much better now and everyone has noticed.... I highly recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> Absolutely AMAZING for the price!!</li>
    <li> I like these brushes. When you first get them they do have a strong odor. But once you wash them the smell goes away. For what they cost they are good brushes. Nice matte color to them as well</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product, but was incredibly disappointed when I finally got it in the mail. Although they advertise that the brushes are made of real goat hair the majority of the brushes have stiff synthetic bristles that are almost impossible to use. Also, I had to throw two brushes away as soon as it arrived because when I took the wrapping off the brush all of the bristles fell right out. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this brush set. The bristles continuously fall out and they are very stiff. The old saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; is definitely true with this item. Another thing is that there are several of the same brushes. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist so I&#x27;m always looking to try new products and I can never have enough brushes...these brushes are okay you really get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> Really nice collection. I&#x27;m not a make-up artist but I do use makeup daily. The odor is from the faux leather.. like any new item it has a distinct odor. The large brushes shed, not a big deal for the price. Nice soft and well built for the price. Good for experimental work so many brushes and sizes.</li>
    <li> I got them for my Granddaughter for Christmas. She loves them.  It was a great buy!  If you are looking for brush set, these are nice. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these makeup brushes for about a month now. Super sleek and the variety is amazing, however there is a lot of brush shedding which is extremely annoying.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my own use. I already had one pretty good brush set to compare it to. I was a little disappointed however, when I was looking at the pictures online the brushes looks softer. The brushes were rougher than i thought and the eyeshadow brushes weren&#x27;t super soft either which i think is necessary for eye use. Over all the brushes are all usable and i think for such a cheap price they were worth the money.</li>
    <li> this is completely HUGE i didnt expect it to be so big but its very nice tho, cant wait to use them, the thing is u need to have it like separately from your make up box unless u have a very big box or ur a make up artist... quality looks good but lets see how that works when i start using it</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before ordering these brushes, and saw that they had mainly good reviews, so I thought I would go ahead and give them a try. I really didn&#x27;t expect professional brushes for $15.99, but I didnt expect for them to be the worst brushes I have ever used. The face brushes are very rough and they shed like crazy,  and I dont mean just a few hairs,  I literally could pull out clumps from the brushes. The eye shadow brushes do not pick up color and are very very stiff. I thought washing them would help, and it did not, it just made them worse. I would not recommend these brushes to anyone.  Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Love it. they are great.only thing i would say is that they kinda do shed.and if you cleaning the brush with a little too much strength the will pull apart.</li>
    <li> I really like my brushes, even though the brushes has their flaws. I don&#x27;t expect much for brushes that are worth less than $12.</li>
    <li> honestly I like it def would recommend it ,the only thing is that the brush isn&#x27;t hard, like the hair is very soft so in order to get my make up to stick I have to wet the brush a little bit.</li>
    <li> my brushes came in on time and they are brand new the only reason why I gave them a 4 star i wish the brushes was marked with the numbers on them.  other than that I would buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I though it would be good for the price but when I use the bigger brushes they shed really bad and I have little hairs all over me.  I washed them, pulled on them, buy its only when I use them.</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty nice, there are a lot of them and they are nice and stiff like a new brush.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I have ever made! All of the brushes have individual places in the kit and are easily stored in the leather, pouch-like case. I 100% recommend this product to anyone looking for makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes ! The only thing is they smelled funny... but I just washed them with brush cleaner (:</li>
    <li> This kit appears smaller in the picture and I was extremely happy when I opened up the box and unwound the case. The brushes are very soft and gentle on your face. Some of the hairs in the brushes come out but not much. These are my go to brushes and they are amazing!</li>
    <li> Everything was so awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Totally love this. Its awesome. Alot of brushes for the eyes not alot for foundations or blushes. Could use more of them. Overall awesome! Brushes are not all different you get couple of the same brushes.</li>
    <li> For the price payed this iteam works really well! I got the thirty-two piece set and love it! Also it shipped exactly as expected!</li>
    <li> It has a weird smell when you first open it! but then is ok :D Also one of the brushes loose too many hair! it is a little bit upsetting. But for the rest it is ok for the price!</li>
    <li> the brushes shed alot, but overall bargain for the price</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter and wife.&lt;br /&gt;They love it</li>
    <li> I love this makeup set so much delivery was really fast the brushes do have a smell but will go away once you use them and will shed skittle but the shedding stoped</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this set of brushes!!! Soft on the face! Easy to clean and no shedding</li>
    <li> This set is so nice! The brushes are soft and good for my clients and I love the case that it comes with. The only thing that bothered me with this product and most on this site is that it didn&#x27;t come with a stippling brush! I love stippling brushes because of the detail they provide. But I have loved my brushes and have taken good care of them since purchasing them.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set I don&#x27;t regret this purchase</li>
    <li> My order came in before expected which was great but the brushes aren&#x27;t going to work. I&#x27;m either going to have to send them back or buy more of the powder brushes. The bigger brushes don&#x27;t have a lot of bristles and are falling out. Smaller ones are fine so far but the bigger ones aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
    <li> Great buget. A lot useless brushes.the hair bristles fall out a lot when applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Brushes too hard cause to have bumps appear when try to put on makeup through them aways</li>
    <li> Love that it has all the different brushes you&#x27;ll need to do your makeup. But I don&#x27;t like how some of the brush piece fall out.</li>
    <li> I thought it was the same set I had purchased off here before. It wasn&#x27;t. I wasn&#x27;t as thrilled with the set/ There wasn&#x27;t any stiff brushes. They were all soft, and didn&#x27;t work with my eye shadows well. I like all the brushes but the eye shadow brushes. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but sometimes the brush makes my face feel irritated. Also in a few brushes the hair is loose and ends up on my face. I wish they sent me one of the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; kits others mentioned. I guess I got a bad one.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes about a month and a half ago now. I only have a few brushes out of this set that I use regularly and they have been wonderful. The price is great for all that you get. There IS a fairly strong smell when you first open it, but if you just leave it open and air out for a little while, it goes away. These brushes are really sturdy, I haven&#x27;t had any problem with the hair falling out. They get the job done very well and, for the price, it&#x27;s a definite steal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very makeup experienced so take this with a grain of salt... but I really love these brushes. Initially they shed a lot so make sure all that is gone before you use them. But after that it&#x27;s a great way to experiment and figure out what shapes and sizes are going to work for you.</li>
    <li> The shipping was incredible! I received these brushes in 2 days!! There is a bit of a smell, but after they have been washed they are fine! They are amazing brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes where good there was so much I split the brushes with my mom the reason why I gave it four stars is because the big brushes the hairs where falling off like crazy ended up throwing away but the eyes brushes worked great there were some brushes that looked the same but hey in case of anything I could just have an extra one.</li>
    <li> I loved the brushes! sooo many and so soft! Easy to clean and easy to use! Totally recommend this</li>
    <li> I was really excited about receiving this but the brushes leaves behind bristles all over your face. The smell is really not that great either</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty good, they get the job done, the only downfall is the first few weeks hairs fall out and cling to your face. Other than that they are good.</li>
    <li> I love this product, the brushes are very soft, applies my makeup nicely, without leaving residues on my skin as other brushes I used in the past. Its a should have plus the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> After reviewing previous reviews, I was hesitant to order these brushes. I, however just received them in the mail. They do have a spray paint smell to them, but it&#x27;s nothing crazy and I personally think it&#x27;s only on the bag the brushes come in. I cleaned the brushes with E.L.F. brush cleaner and the smell wasn&#x27;t on the brushes anymore. I also read that they fall apart easily. Like any other brush, you&#x27;ll have to trim them up with the lose hairs. I only had to do this with the big brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I love these brushes. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. It has all you need for your facial makeup. I would highly recommend this to other people!</li>
    <li> These are a great deal! They&#x27;re very good quality and there&#x27;s soo many brushes! I definitely recommend these brushes to anyone!</li>
    <li> If you are begining in makeup and don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on brushes, these are perfect. Aside from having to trim to the blush brushes I have had no problems with them. I still use most of the eyeshadow brushes eventhough I have purchased different brushes. Definitely a recommendation.</li>
    <li> Very nice I orderd twice, one  for my sister also..worth it</li>
    <li> There were 32 brushes with a case included but the brushes are not good quality. They are falling apart. The handle has come of of 4 brushes so far. I used 2 before I realized the defects of the others or I would have sent them back.</li>
    <li> These brushes are good. but only the smaller brushes as I may add.. The bigger brushes shed.... ALOT. Shed all over my face, all mixed inside of my MAC foundation, all over my clothes... its just a huge mess. But overall, 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I was a little scared from the other reviews, but when they came in the mail i was impressed. They have a good quality the hair doesnt fall off like some others say, the plastic bag smells like plastic if you hold it to your face, but it does&#x27;nt stink. I am gooing to be using them a lot and all my frinds that have seen them so far want one as well. The price is so good.</li>
    <li> IVE HAD THESE FOR LIKE A YEAR AND THEY STILL IN GOOD CONDITION, BUT WHEN YOUR IN THE MILITARY YOU DONT WHERE ALOT OF MAKE UP ON A DAILY, BUT I LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this set, the eye make up brushes are fantastic and are holding up quite well to my everyday use. The face brushes are mediocre, but I just don&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> Face brushes are awful. They shed way to much and do not pick up enough color. Applying bush to my cheeks this morning was a utter fail. I&#x27;m glad these are just my back up set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadows brushes get the job done, but aren&#x27;t that soft. If you want a good quality brush set try Coastal Scents.</li>
    <li> I left a review on here when I first got them stating how great they were. The face brushes are not as good as the ones for the eyes, those are really good. But th facial ones are not. They shed when you wash them or get tangled.. they work really good the first time you use them but as you all SHOULD know already, you HAVE to clean your make up brushes. And these shed A LOT. I was so upset that my angle bronzer brush was going to come apart because it would not stop shedding!! Do NOT comb these. They will shed even more. But the brushes for the eyes are amazing, work really good. There&#x27;s maybe one or two that are a little hard to work with but I was able to replace those so that&#x27;s fine with me. It&#x27;s a good buy if your just starting with make up, if your a MUA, DO NOT. or if your into using more expensive products on your face like MAC, Estee Lauder, YSL, (Sephora expensive stuff) don&#x27;t bother. You will just get frustrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my brushes , great quality and amazing price ! I ordered a couple of more or gifts ! Very worth it !</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this set, it finally came in the mail &amp; all the hair on all the brushes except about five were everywhere. I don&#x27;t even know how to explain it. I am very disappointed in this set. &amp; would not purchase it if I were you, it was a waist of $16!</li>
    <li> Good concealer brushes. Not good for an only make up kit. I would suggest going to target and buying a few decent eye shadow brushes. Really was a vet average purchase to me. I am currently using one brush from the set, witch I do use for eyeliner. It&#x27;s a flat brush, nice and small, works good with black track from mac :)&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars bc they were not bad quality and I do like the case. I use it to pack brushes I really like when I go on jobs !</li>
    <li> When I received this order I was SOOOOO happy, it&#x27;s just like (look) it&#x27;s post had described. BUT this makeup brush is the abustle worst makeup brush I have ever laid my hands on....while pretty to look at once used your actually pulling of the fibers of the brush off your face, eeeewwwww. It felt like I rolled around in a shedding dogs bed....this is such a nasty feeling..............thumbs down as well as my big two toes..&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware just because it looks like a deal, and a great item means nothing when it&#x27;s being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eeeeewwww!</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft, easy to clean, and the bristles are not bent. I received it with everything in tact and with plastic around each brush. I love them! 100% WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
    <li> Some brushes are great, but many lose bristles during use. I really only use the eye brushes.</li>
    <li> 32 BRUSHES?? IN JUST 14.50 DOLLARS? they look very good! I had read the reviews about smell and all of the pouch the brushes are kept! well that smell is of leather, pure leather!!! so thats good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked all the brushes! Nicely kept , good condition! I think I dont even know their use, but m glad I will google it and use them for sure:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are good!</li>
    <li> These are ok. The eyeshadow brushes are alright I use them the most. The face brushes are bad, they&#x27;re not soft at all and hurt when using them they&#x27;re very course.</li>
    <li> Brushes came nicely packaged and everything was in the kit brushes do shed but they are soft and lovely to work with</li>
    <li> It arrived in the time frame it was suppose too and works perfectly. I love it</li>
    <li> MUY BUENA PARA MAQUILLARSE, TODO ES MUY UTIL.</li>
    <li> i really like these.  get a lot and not to pricey, multiple of some brushes which i like so i can use with more then one color a brush</li>
    <li> Thought it was a good deal, but wasn&#x27;t quite what I had anticipated. Some of the brushes don&#x27;t have a good grip on picking up my eyeshadow and I have good quality shadow. A lot of the brushes looked the same, didn&#x27;t seem like a different variety. I did notice the smell that a lot of people had mentioned, it wasn&#x27;t that bad after I had washed them. Maybe it&#x27;s just me being over dramatic, but hopefully I get used to them and not regret purchasing them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are OK.  The picture is inaccurate.  These brushes are comprised of smooth, synthetic bristles.  Those are ok for some application, but none of these brushes will work for any powder application (bronzer, blush, powder, eyeshadow).  They work well for cream applications, but even then there are better options.  Still - if you&#x27;re cost conscious, this isn&#x27;t a bad set.  There are plenty of detail brushes in this set that will help with specific applications.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a brush kit and finally i had gotten it. This brush kit had made my friends jealous everyone wanted it. they had wanted it because of how the brushes felt and how great they where.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t expect too much after paying $13 for this many brushes. when i received my order, the big fan brush had hair already falling off. i really wish they gave you a blending brush rather than the little sponge applicators you&#x27;d get in an eyeshadow pallet. the case, including the brushes have a weird scent to them but nothing unbearable...other than that they&#x27;re ok&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2jjnzIWlifU- my channel review</li>
    <li> These are the worst brushes I have ever seen and bought oh my goodness, the brushes shed as you are applying your makeup it looks like cat hair all over the place I was very upset over this smh I figured maybe it was just that one bad brush so I tested them all and they did the exact same thing. They are definitely not worth purchasing, worst make up brushes ever!!!</li>
    <li> I recently received this brush set and I am the happiest girl on earth. I was looking for brushes and went to Sephora and noticed they were each $30 and up, so I figured i&#x27;d try one from amazon, chose this one randomly, and am SO beyond glad I did. Especially for the price, it&#x27;s absolutely phenomenal. So many fun brushes and their great, honestly.</li>
    <li> I wish the brushes would have been a little softer, but this is a great starter kit and for the price I am defiantly happy.</li>
    <li> No complaints absolutely what i paid for</li>
    <li> these brushes were ok. A lot of teenie tiny lip brushes, and eye brushes. unfortunately there are zero blending or crease brushes, which are the ones i&#x27;m really needing! But overall great for the price. I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5 because the large &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; brush already fell off the tang and needs to be glued back on. Simple enough to fix...but annoying.</li>
    <li> I just got the brush set in today and the eye makeup brushes are perfect! The powder brushes do shed but I have yet to find a good powder brush that doesn&#x27;t.  Otherwise it is a pretty good brush set and even if the powder brushes are a little funky, they are inexpensive and the rest of the set was completely worth the money. It has a sort of plastic smell to the case but that may also be from the packaging and the fact that it is fairly new and hasn&#x27;t been used yet. It is an overall great buy!</li>
    <li> I like the set, i would give a 5 but one of the brushes came off, and the brushes are not labled</li>
    <li> I love these the are great brushes</li>
    <li> Great set and value for the price.</li>
    <li> Great products!  Fast Delivery!</li>
    <li> They work great and there are multiples of the same brush. They do smell though. I would air them out before use.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awful. do not buy. The  rustled are hard and they she&#x27;d like crazy.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! So many to chose from.</li>
    <li> GOOD BUY AND NICE BRUSH SET</li>
    <li> I am not a makeup artist...and I don&#x27;t play one on YouTube..but I have started to get more into make up lately! I purchased on cyber Monday for around $12...really happy with them!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love these makeup brushes !! They work way better than my mac ones I had . I like how you get a huge selection for a low price . It is definitely worth the price just because you see the price is low does not mean they are cheaply made they are very good quality makeup brushes and I highly recommend them .</li>
    <li> I am super happy i bought these brushes, they definitely needed a good cleaning the first time ( not because of filth, they had a few lose hairs that i didn&#x27;t want in my makeup or on/in my face)  They also came in a nice leatherish case and all wrapped in plastic! They work amazingly, and are so freaking soft i am in love! good buy, and it shipped and was her the next day! super awesome!</li>
    <li> Great quality, very soft. I got it in about a day, when i ordered standard shipping, which is a bonus, The only complaint I have is the bag thing kinda smells weird, but nothing too bad.</li>
    <li> Cheap/ Hairs fall out but they are very cheap.</li>
    <li> Great brushes very high quality.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really soft and the case is very nice and not to mention a very good price, I mean, definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this set for my 17 year old daughter and she loved them! They are of great quality and a very extensive set.  Not just all the same brushes.  It is a full set for use for your entire face.  I may have to order one for myself as well!</li>
    <li> Great brushes with an unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> Verry nice brushes, just didnt like that i ordered two and on one of the set of brushes That i got a brush, was messed up. It was on of the big ones too.other than that very nice</li>
    <li> Some of you girls are whiners! If you wanted professional well crafted brushes you should have bought the over 100$ Sephora or MAC brush sets. You obviously came to buy cheap brushes for a reason, honey. For only 14$ you should be able to put up with a smell that will probably go away and a few duplicates.take care of them and they will be worth the price.</li>
    <li> Half of the brushes fell apart after the first use. Even after washing, the brush hairs fall out in mass.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes came damaged, and some of them had bristles falling out right away</li>
    <li> Brush shed very bad go to Walmart</li>
    <li> my first brush set! i didnt want to spend too much when i was soo new makeup. does have a vynl scent but who cares! lol great selection on brushes</li>
    <li> Fabulous set of brushes. Excellent for the price. Works great!!! Brushes available for almost any application techniques! I do recommend. Great deal!</li>
    <li> These brushes seemed great, until I received them in the mail. All of the bristles are falling out on every single brush. And the bigger brushes are so rough and loose which makes it impossible to apply. I will not buy these again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my brushes and when I used them, they hurt my face from the stiff bristles and the hairs fell out.  It was a waste of money, but I should not have expected anything better for 15 dollars.</li>
    <li> The materials the brushes are made out of aren&#x27;t the best. Also, they kind of have a distinct smell but this isn&#x27;t an expensive set so you get what you pay for. I would recommend this to people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money or are just getting into doing their make up.</li>
    <li> It sucks, the brushes shed a lot of the hair and it&#x27;s just terrible.</li>
    <li> Very good product couldn&#x27;t ask for a better quality</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me that people are whining with such a great price?&lt;br /&gt;I believe it&#x27;s a GREAT product and it does not have a strong smell. It does smell a bit because the little bag is made with vynil, hell haven&#x27;t you entered forever21 and never complained? I really loved it, the hairs are soft and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;once more, can&#x27;t ask for more with this price</li>
    <li> These brushes are just okay, they defiantly aren&#x27;t as amazing as some have said. The bigger brushes hurt when you out them on your face, they are very rough and one of my brushes have already fallen off its body. I don&#x27;t at all use the blush brushes not only because they hurt but because they shed like crazyyyy!!!! I was putting powder on my face and the bristles fell on my face. The smaller brushes though are good. I love the eye brow brushes when I shade my eyebrows it went on smooth and had a great finish... All in all buy them for the amount they come with but don&#x27;t expect really amazing top grade quality... :)</li>
    <li> I was needing some new brushes and wanted something a little professional. The kit brings a good variety of brushes but no explanation of what each one is for. I will definitely use the eye shadow brushes but the powder/blush brushes are harsh against my face. Its the the only down side to the whole kit.</li>
    <li> We got a lot of brushes at a great price I love the quality of the brushes, what a perfect Xmas gift to my daughter</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how many brushes came with this but I will have brushes for a long time, there were so many. Awesomeness and they work great. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had great hopes as I received the package. Quite disappointing as I used it the very first time. I tried all of em and they all shed badly. Def not a good buy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Wonderful!!!! I was soooooo excited fir them and they&#x27;re just wonderful. I like it, I like it. Very helpful.</li>
    <li> Good quality but brushes are really loose.love the variety</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter wants me to rave about this product. When she first got it she was very upset because the bristles were all over in the package and she thought she&#x27;d been conned - that she was &#x27;getting what she paid for&#x27; since the set was beyond reasonable - it was downright cheap. However, she looked up makeup brushes online and quickly found that losing bristles initially is common for ALL brushes. What she had initially found was very normal. All she had to do was clean them and then they stopped losing bristles. It worked and now they are the find of the century and &#x27;cheap&#x27; became &#x27;an incredible deal/steal&#x27;  She explains there&#x27;s a brush for everything and they all work beautifully. She is very into makeup and knows her stuff so now she&#x27;s very pleased with her &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
    <li> The face brushes weren&#x27;t as soft as I would have liked, &amp; the fluffy powder brush has some fallout when you run your hand over them roughly. Not a huge deal, just one or two hairs stick up. Maybe with liquid foundation, they would get softer with use, but not with powder foundation. But so far, there&#x27;s no fallout when you&#x27;re applying on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller brushes are great quality. Only thing is there&#x27;s not TONS of variety. There&#x27;s about 2 or 3 of each style of brush. This is great if you use lots of bright colors on your makeup, or if you want to store some &amp; just use one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was &amp; am very happy with these brushes. They get the job done &amp; cost WAY LESS than ONE high-end makeup brush. Hope you enjoy your purchase if you decide to!</li>
    <li> So far good enough. Works as needed.  One issue is no labeling, contour brush, highlight, etc. that world be useful.  Not high quality but gets the job done. More than enough brushes to cover everything</li>
    <li> alot of them are very repetitve, and the huge ones suck as a whole, infact the bristles come off, i bought them because i figures there would be eyeshadow brushes but its mostly for creams, like concealers and such</li>
    <li> It is too bad I don&#x27;t recomend any body to use it</li>
    <li> I give it a five star, has all the brushes one needs for all makeup and I eyeshadows, thinking of ordering one for my daughter</li>
    <li> This make up set its super cheap they are soft they are awesome</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work very well. The brushes are not great,</li>
    <li> I like these. I&#x27;ve had them for a while now. The only problem is how much they shed.</li>
    <li> amazing brushes, im very impressed and very durable!&lt;br /&gt;i recomend this. i am a performer and needed all my makeup brushes in one place, i also use lots of oil based makeup and they were really easy to wash!!!!&lt;br /&gt;great product!</li>
    <li> Very strong smell when the package was first opened but I left the bag open overnight and that solved that problem. Brushes work well.</li>
    <li> It suck&#x27;s that the pencils are not marked. It makes it hard for me to know what each is used for.</li>
    <li> The flat shader brushes work very well, but the powder brushes are very rough.</li>
    <li> THE BRUSH HEAD CAME FROM THE BOTTOM N IT&#x27;S NOT STRONG.JUST DON&#x27;T GET THIS HOME AT ALL IT&#x27;S NOT WORTHY</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. I don&#x27;t use some of them but like the product. I reccomended them to a friend and she ordered them as well</li>
    <li> I loved all the eye brushed and foundation brushes very soft and didnt shed. However the blush/face brushes were not as soft as the rest and they do shed. However for the price you get a lot of great brushes its just 4 or 5 I was not fond of. I would still recommend buying this set.</li>
    <li> They are amazing love them. You have an enormous range of. Rushes to use. They are brilliantly made and I would highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> these are cheap and the brushes are not even the ones on the picture!!!&lt;br /&gt;save your money, you get what you pay for!!!</li>
    <li> amazing brushes for the cheap price they are actually really good quality and a huge variety of bushes to chose from</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing high-quality very durable and easy to use I was really surprised at how many there were gr8 price as well...</li>
    <li> My daughter ended up handwriting labels and taping them to each brush.  On the plus side there is a brush for everything you need makeup wise.</li>
    <li> I bought her this set as a stocking stuff.  Good price and a variety of brushes.  She&#x27;ll have fun playing with them, but probably only settle on a few.  Worth the money though for sure.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about buying this because of the revuews but I found that the quality of the brushes was good for a starter set. The case does smell and I just let it air out for a bit. The natural hair brushes are good, but they do shed so I recommend washing them, but the synthetic brushes are good as well. Some of the brushes seem to be the same with some variation in size but it does come in handy depending on the makeup design you&#x27;re trying to do. I recommend this for a beginner.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased these and compared to some more expensive ones she has, she says they work just as good.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. Liked most of them they are very poorly made but worked for what i needed with cosplay.</li>
    <li> When I purchased these brushes I was expecting them to be decent. But they smelled awful  and they are all pretty much the exact same brush and they shed really bad!! I would NEVER recommend them to ANYONE!</li>
    <li> Love it! Only problem was that it shed. A lot!</li>
    <li> This set of brushes are wonderful. They are high quality and were even shipped to my home ahead of schedule. I am a very satisfied customer because i am so picky about my make up brushes!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush set</li>
    <li> there are a few types of brushes i hoped would come with this that did not. but overall its a good buy for a low price. i&#x27;m sure anyone would find the large amount of brushes adequate and more than a normal person could use in a long time.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are nice and soft and it blends the color really well.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick i got them in two days. brushes work great and  i  love the case they came in makes it so easy to keep everything neat and tidy.</li>
    <li> I decided to write this review since I remember when I was looking that I couldn&#x27;t find the exact description that I desired. These brushes are what you would expect for the price. They aren&#x27;t BAD but, they aren&#x27;t professional quality. The bigger and fluffier brushes are made with very brittle and not soft hair. It tickles/pricks my face when I use them so I doubt I will use them much at all, maybe just as a backup if my main brushes are dirty. I bought these just to expand my brush collection and there are some good brushes in the back. There are a few good eye brushes that would be good to pat the eyeshadow on but are not fluffy. There are a few good looking blending brushes but I haven&#x27;t used them quite yet. There is one amazing crease brush that I have never seen before! It&#x27;s perfect for getting a cut crease and applying the crease color. Its thick but cut straight across and almost has a flat top to it. Great for expanding your brush collection but nothing special.</li>
    <li> The only thing that was good about this brush set was the smaller brushes. The bigger ones were horrible the hair on them fell off immediately! Not a good buy, might as well spend money on something that will actually work.</li>
    <li> This set has a brush for every need and then some. A few of them were loose but nothing major. The bag has a slot for a few extra if you already have some to add with this variety set. The bristles were soft as well.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice for the price. Quite decent for synthetic value brand brushes. The plastic roll case smells like cheap plastic, so I will look for or sew a replacement in a better fabric that can be laundered and not transfer a smell to the brushes. I would recommend washing these and all new brushes before use, but they don&#x27;t appear dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set has enough quantity and variety to do anything that I might need for make up on my own face or someone else. I do have a flat head foundation brush from another maker that I prefer for applying my foundation, but I could recommend this set as a gift for a younger person just starting to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; and learn their intermediate make up or for anyone who wants more tools beyond the free brushes or a haphazard collection from the discount store. If someone only wants &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; things, then this is not for them. However, for those who need more options in tools on a budget, this kit can get you started nicely.</li>
    <li> These brushes work like one would expect, BUT they do shed quite a bit the first few times you use them. Before using a new brush, I swish it around on a dry towel for a bit to get the loose hairs out. Also, I would suggest finding a way to secure the powder brush on the far right side. The protective flap doesn&#x27;t cover that area, and it has dropped out of the case a few times now. Aside from that, all is well! They arrived in great condition and on-time.</li>
    <li> yes! I&#x27;m so excited my brush set finally came in I&#x27;m inlove only thing some of the brushes shedded but for the price I can&#x27;t really complain 32 brushes for 11.95 can&#x27;t beat that</li>
    <li> I just had to say how pleasantly surprised I was when I received my order.  I bought the 32 piece black brush set and was very surprised to see how big the brushes actually are.  They are pretty nice especially when you consider the price being as cheap as it is.  I gave it 4 stars and not 5 simply because I&#x27;m new to using brushes and not sure exactly which one does what and it&#x27;s not written on the brushes and they do have a strong smell when you open the carrying case.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell...  but it&#x27;s definitely strong.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and I just resieved my package of makeup brushes, And I&#x27;m loving theses so far. They have a very slick sexy look to them and they work great for my every makeup need. Great product for the price I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> the brissles are rough, and the bag smells really bad, like burnt plastic.... probably send it back.... real soon, but thanks</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes!!! Great quality and for the price you pay it&#x27;s amazing how many and the quality you get</li>
    <li> brushes are ok.  It would have been nice to have some kind of description as to what brushes is for what-for new users like myself.</li>
    <li> At 12 years old, going on 18, she loved this makeup kit.  It was exactly what she wanted and was not disappointed.  Plenty of brushes and easily kept in the roll up pouch.  She&#x27;s happy, we&#x27;re happy.</li>
    <li> This is definitely something worth purchasing for the sheer number of brushes/ tools that you receive, and they honestly work fine. I was just expecting softer (maybe rounder?) brushes. These brush heads are kind of flat and not too flexible, but good enough for the purpose if you&#x27;re just experimenting with using different makeup brushes &amp; stuff like that. Not bad at all, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sisters wedding (Nov 9 2013) and it arrived 3 days early. All of the brushes are brad new and individually packaged in clear as well as the leather bag for carrying. Although the brushes are not numbered or named, they work perfectly. (for beginners) Be prepared to loose little hairs on your face every once in awhile because they are brad new. I would definitely recommend these to everyone!</li>
    <li> They were ok for the price but I don&#x27;t use them much. When I use them to put anything on my face whether it be foundation, concealer or powder I always end up with hairs in my face. The small brushes for the eyes and lips were good though they didn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
    <li> I do makeup for a salon so if I have a bridal party that has to be ready at a certain time I need clean brushes. I have two sets of good brushes for clients and I have this set for when I dont have time to disinfect an angle brush or a conceler brush for example. As for everyday brushes I wouldnt really recommend.</li>
    <li> When I first received my brushes I had to first let them air out for a couple days because the smell from the pleather case was really strong. After about 3 days the smell was completely gone. I ALWAYS wash my new brushes before I use them on me or anyone else. As I was doing my normal procedure for washing brushes, I noticed that the face brushes (powder, blush, contour, fan brush etc) was shedding like crazy. It was shedding as if the hairs was never attached. At that point I just gave up and left those brushes alone. Other then that, all the other brushes are okay and are working well. But they could be a little more softer.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like they are rough on face. they shed a lot. no good results they are very poky on the face and eyes</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes haven&#x27;t quite figured what ill use each one for yet but so far the eye brushes are awesome</li>
    <li> My brushes are great!! I got them with a speedy delivery. The only thing I didnt like was the smell when delivered but once I washed them, the smell went away.</li>
    <li> Great at first, brushes aren&#x27;t a very good quality, it&#x27;s itchy and the hairs come out while applying on applications and the most when I clean them.</li>
    <li> More brushes than you ever need, but the best part, they give you a photo list of the brushes and what to use them for. I copied this list and gave it out to other stylist, make up artist, and clients. The brushes are soft and clean wonderfuly. For home or professional use. The case is soft but durable, and cleans easy for when you get it home.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes for everything, especially the powder brushes! The foldable case it comes with is very convenient, especially for travel. The bristles aren&#x27;t super super soft, but they still get the job done without irritating your skin. The only downside is that the bristles tend to shed/fall out. These brushes would be great for begginers as well!</li>
    <li> These are the worst brushes ever, they shed and are very coarse. I was sold on the positive reviews but truth is they&#x27;re misleading. The brushes are horrible but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Awesome set! Didn&#x27;t realize until I opened them that they were all from Mac. Has everything I need in there and a great case as well.</li>
    <li> I guess they&#x27;re good for the price but I find these brushes to be a little rough of my skin compared to my other brushes</li>
    <li> What awesome brushes! Yes, the bag does smell very strongly, but that&#x27;s only if you hold it up and sniff it! Otherwise, you can not tell, and it does not affect the brushes what so ever. The brushes are so well made, and are all very soft and work great! Fantastic quality for for the price, and shipping is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my granddaughter, she loved it. And yes I would recommend it to friend and others. Its good for the price.</li>
    <li> I wish the brushes were numbered, but other wise they are a great product and at a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I recommend this brush set to anyone who is just starting out with makeup.these brushes are MAC brushes.I did receive my brushes a week before the expected date which I was so happy about.the brushes do smell like paint and also some brushes shead like crazy but still good brushes.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not MAC. But for 15 dollars, they don&#x27;t have to be. It&#x27;s a great deal considering the price, especially if you&#x27;re not doing heavy, professional makeup everyday and are just looking for some brushes to use once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> These brushes are poorly made.  They are extremely stiff and shed. On the positive side the angle and push liner brushes are okay.  These brushes are TOO HARD and I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> This brush is not worth your money. The bristles are terrible and thin. You can&#x27;t do s*** with it. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Good for someone young figuring brushes out, but I would never use these on clients, these brushes dont pick up anything, they arent soft at all, and they shed. These do come with a nice spooly, lip brush and gel eyeliner brush. Those are nice. But the powder brushes are horrible.</li>
    <li> Personally I think that this product deserves a lot more credit. Yes, the bag does have a distinctive smell to it, but it&#x27;s nothing that isn&#x27;t bearable. Plus, the smell will fade in time. With this product quantity is definitely not in question. 32 makeup brushes!! Whoot!! However, if you&#x27;re wondering if the quality of these brushes holds up.... It does. None of the brushes I got are shedding as I unwrap them. Each brush is individually wrapped. None of them are broke or chipped. The brushes are full and soft. I&#x27;m excited to use these brushes and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the eyeshadow brushes,  the other thicker ones has hair falling out.  Very good customer service, they just need to fix the hair problem m</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes for Christmas and I have to say I&#x27;m in love! I agree that I wish the brushes were labeled but the hair is so soft n I like that to work with! So far I have not had any issues with the hair callin out! I definitely recommend this set n for the price that&#x27;s a steel!&lt;br /&gt;P.s. The bag does smell but so does your car when it&#x27;s brand new. The smell doesn&#x27;t last!</li>
    <li> really good brushes in all! the bigger ones had brissles falling out but the resare awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I recommend these brushes highly! The price for these altogether are about the same for one brush you could buy in the store. The quality is pretty good, I only have 7 small fluffy brushes of the same material that shed. The rest I am very happy with!</li>
    <li> I received this item super fast and it was well packaged. All other review complained about the tiny bit of smell it has but its only cause its brand new!!     after using these things in regretting more and more that I wasted my money on these. I did not get the same set that is in the other pictures, the set I got had black plastic bristles and no I don&#x27;t mean synthetic I mean flat out cheap plastic!!! They barely pick up any product and what product it does pick up stays in the bristles and its the biggest waste of money. I&#x27;m throwing them away. Oh and the case mine came in fell apart. Uhg. If your considering this item, DONT. Pick another one besides this.</li>
    <li> Yes the delivery and quantity of brushes were good, but the quality and variety not so much.  I recommended saving up for better brushes to use on your face to apply/blend your makeup. (coastal scents and ecotools brushes!!)</li>
    <li> They broke easy, took a long to to receive,,,other than that they were ok</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this set, it had a wide selection of brushes and I was anxious to try them! Unfortunately, one of the tie straps was not sewn on very well and fell off the moment I took it out of its packaging - not a huge issue though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, upon washing them, I noticed a lot of bristles were falling out, uneven bristle ends, and one brush had a good amount of scratching on the metal part, as if it had gotten stuck somewhere in the manufacture line and just tossed back in. So overall, I&#x27;m seeing little to no care put into the manufacturing of these brushes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as I begin to use them, I notice the dark bristled brushes are extremely rough and uncomfortable on the skin... Also, plenty more loose bristles... So far the lighter bristled brushes feel much softer and are very pleasant to use, but I haven&#x27;t used a lot of them yet. I make good use of the mascara-style brush, but that&#x27;s about it for now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Regretful purchase. The smell was so horrendous I got a massive migraine trying to clean them! I threw the brush bag in the washer because i didn&#x27;t even care If it ruined! I had to let all the brushes soak in baking soda with water, clean with Savon de mersaille(can&#x27;t look up my spelling atm), then mist with alcohol. Only after all that scrubbing and cleaning and letting air out all night did the smell dissipate! It was like the smell of paint thinner! And there are multiple brushes that are the same! Why? That proved useless to me. There wasn&#x27;t any blending brushes either! Ugh! Hated this purchase. But you get what you pay for and the brushes work. They don&#x27;t shed on me, soft, work well.. I would have been happier with better choices and sheesh at least ONE blending brush would have been nice!</li>
    <li> I love the texture of these brushes, they make applying my makeup easier. Now I have every makeup utensil necessary, and like how it came with the carrying case. Would buy again; as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes but they need a blending brush</li>
    <li> good value for what I need, why would someone spend what places like Ulta and Sephora charge?</li>
    <li> TRASH!!!! MADE IN CHINA!!</li>
    <li> The makeup brushes are horrible! the bristles are hard and shed all over the place, even on your face while you&#x27;re using them. Also for beginners, the brushes don&#x27;t indicate what they are used for.. very bad for beginners. will never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Brushes are sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles do not fall out. Shape and formation of bristles are ideal for application.&lt;br /&gt;Love the pouch and colour.</li>
    <li> They are good quality, BUT the brushes are a bit stiff. I mean they are still useable maybe you gotta break them in first? haha overall they were good brushes . I would buy them again. OH and a lot of the brushes were duplicates.</li>
    <li> These are probably the worst make up brushes I have ever used. The bristles are rough, the hair is sparse and falls out. The brushes I received look nothing like the ones in the picture. The description says that the brushes are made from natural hair and synthetic fiber. I find this really hard to believe. These brushes were fully synthetic. Do not buy these.</li>
    <li> CHEAP....sent them back.</li>
    <li> The blending brushes really do the job, i was a bit worried that they would suck. But am glad that the brushes provied me wrong. Some of the bigger face,blush, &amp; powder brushes did have a werid smell to them, but after a wash there just fine. The ONLY thing i hate about them, although they can really blend, some of the fluffyer brushes will create a small ball of fluff when your blending, other then that they work just fine.</li>
    <li> Really good brushes. The quality is great and no hairs fall off. They do come with a paint scent however after one use I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
    <li> I thought with the price that they were going to be cheaply made but they are not they are perfect brushes</li>
    <li> I love love love this set it makes applying my makeup a piece of cake so flawless thanks!</li>
    <li> I have had these for about 6 months now and I love them. The quality is great!</li>
    <li> I like this set. They smelled bad but I washed them and it was great.  If you&#x27;re a hardcore makeup gal like me this set won&#x27;t have everything u need in it. A lot of the brushes seems replicated to me but this was something I needed in emergency after my brushes got ruined. The face brushes have a coarse texture which Im not a fan of, but they are good for the price. I use this everyday and am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous but the brushes are perfect! They are full size and so many options for eyes/brows/lips/face/shimmers/bronzers. Really everything that you need as a starter or addition to any make up and brush collection. Will buy this for my gals for gifts now that I own a set!</li>
    <li> The delivery was on point. As well as the item. I&#x27;m really not feeling the face brushes, the bristles are a bit rough, but I mostly will not be reaching for those, in my case I only wanted the smaller brushes. Which are perfect! Definitely a must purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like the brushes... I feel like people exaggerated the low quality of the brushes because they work beautifully for me especially at such a low price. Only problems that I experienced were shedding but it stopped after the first few uses. The initial smell of the brushes but they aired out within an hour and finally just one of the brushes the tip came off but it was easily fixed. So again I believe this product was worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> My set was fine, no smell, no excessive shedding. Not having the names helps you figure it out on your own(which is fun). I do wish some of the brushes were different material but great for the price and long lasting! (I use them everyday, had them for about 2 months already). And for all the people complaining of your face breaking out, it&#x27;s probably because you may not have washed before use.</li>
    <li> just what i was expecting!</li>
    <li> Ok! Honestly, was a bit skeptical about these because of all the reviews. I give these brushes 5 stars!! They are great. Yes some of the hairs on the blush brushes strayed off BUT it&#x27;s only common sense to check for strays before you are going to apply the makeup on your face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell goes.. It&#x27;s not that bad.. After airing it out of the packaging it will go away. No need to be so dramatic ladies..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all 32 brushes for under 15$ Can&#x27;t beat that or complain! If you are complaining I suggest you go to MAC or Sephora and get a set of 2 shadow brushes for 30$+</li>
    <li> It was ok the material used in the brushes falls out when u use it a lot so it&#x27;s kinda cheap</li>
    <li> A lot of the brushes were the same just in different sizes. A lot of the brushes weren&#x27;t really useful when doing my make up. And the bigger brushes shed .</li>
    <li> I have had many brushes and I can honestly say that I love love love these more than any I&#x27;ve ever had.  I am sooooo glad that I bought them.  I noticed that they don&#x27;t shed, which is a plus. I am going to suggest these to all my make-up fanatics. I am more than happy.</li>
    <li> I just loved them and they got here sooner than what I thought ....</li>
    <li> PERRRFECCTTTTTTTTTTTT!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product because who can beat 32 brushes for 20$ When I received this I opened up the package and smelled this nasty stench coming from the brush case, then I opened the brush case and saw DISSAPOINTMENT! The brushes felt like PAINT brushes. I decided to give it a go and just try them out and see if they worked, just because they look and feel like paint brushes doesn&#x27;t mean it wont work. Well that was pointless. THEY DONT WORK!! These brushes are terrible. I was so mad I wasted time and money on this. They don&#x27;t hold makeup on the brush, there was so much fallout. I will still stick to SIGMA brushes they are a little more expensive for each brush but hey at least I will get what I pay for. Lesson learned!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They&#x27;re soft and for the price how can you say no? I did the free shipping &amp; they came in the mail about 2 days later. So if you&#x27;re thinking about buying them I would just go for it, It was worth it :)</li>
    <li> The shipping of this kit really sucked although it was &amp;#34;FAST SHIPPING&amp;#34;. The brushes do shed a bit. There are several brushes of the same style. Overall this kit was a good price for the amount of brushes included.</li>
    <li> my female family loved them</li>
    <li> Love all the brushes I use them every day. They are very gentle and great for pigmented eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure when i purchased them I thought the brushes were going to be very rough, but im surprised they work very well. i use them everyday. 💕</li>
    <li> Only problem - too many choices! :)</li>
    <li> Like the fact that you get so many brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Hate the fact that the bristles or hair, fall out the brushes in chunks.</li>
    <li> Im happy with my purchased!! There are so many brushes. Luv it, thank u</li>
    <li> Received ahead of time, however, one of the brushes heads pops right off, which is annoying but otherwise, good set.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, all brushed were in great condition  and a large variety. They just need a good cleaning and they&#x27;ll be ready to go.</li>
    <li> The brushes work well, and have a pretty good selection of options to select from. Having said this, after using one of the brushes for about 2 months, the handle has already separated from the head. Overall, at this price, I&#x27;d still purchase them again.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really nice. The only thing is that the fluffier brushes and the smaller fan brush have quite a bit of fallout, but they don&amp;#34;t shed a lot when you are using them. The smaller brushes are great though! Also the case has an extremely strong smell of paint. Otherwise these brushes are great for their price!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I am pleased with the packaging. This was not expensive but it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
    <li> Overall they seem like nice brushes. Except one of them (I&#x27;m assuming it was a lip brush) was missing ALL of its bristles.</li>
    <li> Love these! And I&#x27;m picky,  I don&#x27;t mind spending $30 on one brush. So,  this was a great deal.  There is an odor when you open up the set,  but let it air out for a day and it will take care of the odor.  Otherwise,  I highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> I recommend these to a couple of friends after I purchased them for the amateur make up artist these do the job and if you lose them not a big deal.  So many great eye make up ideas with these brushes and hold product well on to the brush itself.</li>
    <li> Omg, these brushes left the hair all over , its impossible to finish your make up without leaving your face full hair from the brushes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;LL 1 deficiency, BUT IS a GOOD STUFF</li>
    <li> terrible quality. i wouldn&#x27;t even use these as paint brushes</li>
    <li> Horrible and they stink really bad . Mine are falling apart and I&#x27;ve used them 3 times</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed with these brushes, they are more like paint brushes and anyone who has had their fair share of makeup brushes knows that fluffy works best for blending out most eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the brushes are good for creme products but most of them I will not use. If they had cost more I would return them but its not even worth it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles of the eye brushes are stiff and impossible to blend anything and the face brushes blend patchy and aren&#x27;t very smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes just seem really cheap quality, which I suppose you get what you pay for. I opened them when I received them and haven&#x27;t looked at them since.</li>
    <li> Abosolutley love them.  They&#x27;re everything I wanted and more. They leave my make up the way I like it and everybody asks me where I got them. The eyeshadow brushes help you blend your eyeshadow really well.</li>
    <li> on time delivery and i like the brushes which is covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m buying this for my aunt, which she is going to by</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually very disappointed with this product. Upon opening the makeup kit, you can smell  a very strong odor of paint. It seems as if it wasn&#x27;t given enough time to dry.  It seems the brushes were painted and packed. Also, there was dust on the brushes, which means I would have to wash them before using to prevent any breakouts. I would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> The bigger brushes wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought they would be....but other than that its a farely good product</li>
    <li> great price  my daughter goes through make up brushes so when she saw these, she had to get them.  You get a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> Lovee it, didnt took long to come.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a great price.  They did have a funny smell so I left them air out for a day or so like some of the other reviewers recommend.</li>
    <li> This brushes were awful. Quality wasn&#x27;t good. I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The fibers come out of the big brushes as you use them but for the price, this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Came next day when ordered from Amazon prime. The quality of these brushes are okay, they are quite stiff and have some loose strands. But can&#x27;t complain for the price. This is a nice collection of brushes, has everything you need to do full face makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviewers say, the case does have a smell of paint but nothing to unbearable I&#x27;m just airing mine out and seems fine, doesn&#x27;t stink up the room or anything, you can only smell it if you put it to your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loved them.</li>
    <li> When I first got this I was hyped about the product.  There are a lot of copies, but that was okay with me.  I take proper care of my brushes; however, months later, the metal parts of the brushes are detaching from the wooden part.  I will be investing in a more quality brush set.  In the meantime, these will work as brushes when I am away from home, on vacation or on the run.</li>
    <li> These brushes smell awful and they shed black bristles everywhere. You get what you paid for. When it comes to makeup brushes, please invest in quality, not quantity.</li>
    <li> If I had to recommend this to a friend I wouldn&#x27;t. I would tell them to save their money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But If you are looking for a starter kit for a good amount of eye brushes this is it but you only mainly get flat eyeshadow brushes. Wish it had a variety of everything you would need for a starter kit. The smell goes away, didn&#x27;t bother me. So far they haven&#x27;t shed on me.</li>
    <li> Bruches are stiff. Worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Highly recommend you safe your money. One star is being generous.</li>
    <li> Two of the larger brushes have detached from their handles and required hot glue to fix. Biggest complaint would be some of the larger brushes lose their hairs by the dozen, even when only lightly brushing them over the skin. Pretty much makes those ones impossible to use. The eye shadow brushes are great, though.</li>
    <li> I really love it, its just perfect! thank you so much</li>
    <li> Love these bruches and the case it comes in! Buy it!</li>
    <li> Several of these brushes had hairs already coming out, before I even used them. You get what you pay for...it was a cheap price and I got a cheap product.</li>
    <li> Came on time and my daughters are happy with the product!</li>
    <li> It had alot of brushes but the quality of the brushes sucked!</li>
    <li> Not the kinda brushes I wanted</li>
    <li> The brushes dont really gather up the eye shadow or blush.</li>
    <li> Was hesitant on buying them because was unsure if quality. They are great and for the price u cant beat that... Last brush set spent over $200 and this one is just as good!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes definitely met my expectations</li>
    <li> brushes aren&#x27;t as soft as i thought they would be but they were still usable for sample makeup showing events</li>
    <li> Not a good brush for makeup, its stiff and does not pick up the makeup. I was very disappointed with this product. Won&#x27;t be buying from this brand AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I love some of the brushes in here. For the price you pay its an expectation for it to be low quality. I would say the smaller brushes are higher in quality and the bigger brushes aren&#x27;t trimmed easily, so I had to trim them myself. But they still do the work of good makeup brushes, as long as you blend and actually know how to do your makeup.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really very nice. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality for how much i paid for them</li>
    <li> received my brushes today great purchase no complaints not too rough or too soft perfect texture to them the bag does have a little smell of plastic but I am sure that will go away over time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will deff recommend this to a friend a must have for the price !</li>
    <li> the hair falls out, it&#x27;s ridiculous. I think it would be better quality if it were to be cheaper .</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve kept my old brushes these aren&#x27;t very good. Coarse hair and they shed</li>
    <li> These brushes are terrible.</li>
    <li> According to my wife, the small brushes are great but the larger ones, the hairs from the brushes come off/out as you are using them brush.</li>
    <li> My niece loves doing her make-up this was the perfect starter of make up brushes for her to get familiar in using.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the bomb! The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because I&#x27;ve experienced a tiny bit of shedding with maybe 2 or 3 of them. These brushes are the bomb though and I especially enjoy the leather case that they&#x27;re wrapped in. All in all I would recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
    <li> Small brushed are good, big ones are very harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> The brushes were what I wanted and expected. Thank you</li>
    <li> the only thing good about these brushes is the bag it comes in. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I don&#x27;t understand any of these comments because none of them are true the worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever gotten, and I even bought dollar ones never better</li>
    <li> Perfect price, nice quality, all perfect! In love!</li>
    <li> Never really use em like I thought but overall good</li>
    <li> The Brushes are very low quality and now a variety of different brushes. Just the same ones that serve no use.</li>
    <li> these brushes are okay if you are a bigger(which I am not) they tend to shed a lot and are not very good quality brushes, the handles are durable but the brushes are not</li>
    <li> some of the brushes are the same. expected better blending brushes for my eyes. wish there would have been a better foundation brush, and there&#x27;s not really a powder brush. BUT the contour and highlight brushes are amazing. and some of the eye brushes work good for the brow bone, lower lash line, and inner corner. Also good angled brushes to fill in eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased because it arrived within a week and was packaged properly. The brushes them self tend to shed on me which is a little annoying. Other then that the product and the bag to store them is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they don&#x27;t shed and they were well packaged √√</li>
    <li> I really like them they really work very good. The price is even better nice quality!!!</li>
    <li> Im in love with those brush , i recommend 😍</li>
    <li> It was a very nice set i really like all the shadow brushes but was a bit disappointed when u didn&#x27;t get a flat brush for foundation</li>
    <li> Way then enough brushes do whatever look you want.</li>
    <li> Every brush has it plastic cover so you would know it clean and all but the downside for me it has this smell that gives me headache. I guess its the pouch. Too bad there is no label on what kind of brush it is.</li>
    <li> Theyre ok i guess for the price they need to be trimmed and on some of them the hairs fall out</li>
    <li> Great product! Came with all brushes and they are all high quality. So glad I found them</li>
    <li> The best ever, great buy for its price</li>
    <li> rough kind of material but a TON of brushes.. a lot of them serve the same purpose though..</li>
    <li> Black tipped brushes were precise and soft, but the red tipped brushes were TERRIBLE. Brittle, rough on the skin, constantly shed. The brush holder was great - nice material and folded neatly. However, I had all of these brushes for about 6 months before I had to throw all of them away. The bristles fell off and handles came unglued and eventually they didn&#x27;t apply well anymore. I guess the price was decent for the amount of brushes I got + the holder + the amount of time I used them for. But overall, I&#x27;d just stick to buying better quality brushes if you can.</li>
    <li> Shipping was excellent but when it comes to these brushes they suck they are absolutely awful I was so excited to see these come in the mail and when I open them and use them nothing but hair shedding and falling out I&#x27;m so angry and so disappointed I just threw them out they are so not worth my $20, 20 bucks right down the toilet Man I&#x27;m angry:(</li>
    <li> LET&#x27;S START OFF WITH THE SHIPPING I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE HOW I RECIEVED MY TRACKING NUMBER THE DAY BEFORE MY PACKAGE WAS TO ARRIVE. BUT I DID LIKE HOW THE COMPANY PUT MY PACKAGE UNDER MY WELCOME MAT WHEN HE. DROPPED IT OFF EVEN THO I WAS AT HOME. NOW TO THE ACTUALLY PRODUCT, THE BRUSHES CAME PACKAGED NICE. BUT THE ACTUAL CASE DID HAVE A CHEMICAL SMELL WHICH I ALREADY KNEW BECAUSE I READ IT IN ANOTHER REVIEW. I LIKE THEY CAME WITH MULTIPLE OF THE SAME BRUSHES YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH THAT. NOW ON TO THE BRUSHES THEM SELVES , WHEN I WASHED THEM THEY WEREN&#x27;T DIRTY FROM WHAT I COULD TELL BUT THE BLUSH BRUSHES SHED A LOT NOT A LITTLE BUT A LOT FOR THEM TO BE MAKEUP BRUSHES.. BUT I DON&#x27;T PLAN ON USING THEM ANYWAY.. BUT BESIDES THAT THEY SEEM GREAT SO FAR BUT I HAVE TO ACTUALLY USE THEM TO LET YOU HOW THE WORK WHEN DOING MAKEUP.. SO YEAH THE 4 STARS ARE FOR SHIPPING AND PACKAGING NOT FOR HOW GOOD THEY ARE WHEN DOING MAKEUP</li>
    <li> Not liking the brush bristles coming out every time I use bigger brushes. A lot of brushes but I wish I had went with another one. You get what you pay for!! :(</li>
    <li> I had no issue with these brushes, they arrived on time and has no bad smell once opened as other reviews had stated (I&#x27;m glad that wasn&#x27;t the case with me). I washed them right away and did notice that the bigger face brushes did shed quite a bit, even once I used them to apply powder. Some of the hair would stick to my face as it fell out. However, it was not an insane amount of fallout. The rest of the brushes were very soft and of good quality. It is a good starter brush kit. I love the variety of brushes, can&#x27;t wait to use them all!</li>
    <li> when I received my brushes I was really excited they were so pretty and packaged nicely but soon as I add product to the brushes they literally fell apart worst experience ever I would NEVER suggest anyway purchase these brushes waste of my money I would not pay a penny for these brushes</li>
    <li> hairs fall out of brushes! the eyeliner  and eye shadow brushes are better but the bug brushes for bronzer and blush fall out all over your face</li>
    <li> i like it, it looks very professional but hairs do come out easily, for the price its good, the case is really nice.</li>
    <li> I use daily! I love the brushes, however they do shed a lot but for the price that&#x27;s okay :)</li>
    <li> I received my brushes 12 days after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off, the larger brushes I received are black, not maroon as pictured. That wasn&#x27;t a problem for me, but I just want to let future customers know that. Secondly, the bigger brushes are synthetic, and not as soft as the smaller brown/tan ones. The variety you get is outstanding, as well as the quality of the brushes. The brushes I received didn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell as others mentioned, they HAD a lingering new car scent (which I personally didn&#x27;t mind) but that is most likely seller-specific. The case is nice, I don&#x27;t really plan to use it as I keep my brushes in a brush cup, and have a different travel case. I had a tad bit of shedding (with the larger brushes), but nothing dramatic. I think even with a smell issue/shedding, these brushes are still a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to make up, or cosmetic brushes, or are just overwhelmed by how many you get; I highly suggest googling/youtubing different types of make up brushes, and how they&#x27;re used. It&#x27;ll make the brushes less intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean my brushes with soap and water, and dry them at an angle, with the handles elevated to allow proper drainage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update on the durability/lifespan of these babies ;)</li>
    <li> They stink but they are definitely worth the money I&#x27;m so excited to use them</li>
    <li> Love these makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I just wish that it had instructions on how to use each brush/what it&#x27;s for</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, came in a nice packaging. They aren&#x27;t the best brushes perhaps for eyeshadow since I kinda find it hard to grab eyeshadow with them and put them on my eyes because they kinda obsorb the color hard, and the smaller brushes aren&#x27;t fluffy soft and are more of a plastic typa brush.</li>
    <li> my wife tell me ,she like it .  sorry i do not now english very well to write ,  goood  good</li>
    <li> cheap don&#x27;t wast ur money</li>
    <li> These are horrible. They look fine in the pictures but as soon as I got to them, they looked so so cheap and they broke right the way, literally right the way. I&#x27;m so disappointed!!! I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Was excited to receive the brushes. Its very organized BUT when i used the bugger brushes i noticed the brushes shed!!! It was a mess. Couldnt even apply my liquid foundation because i would have brush strans every where on my face ! Havent tried the smaller brushes but will update.</li>
    <li> Falls apart, not worth it</li>
    <li> Not what I thought, but hey for the price...practice makes perfect.</li>
    <li> Brushes break, eyes shadow sponges fall off, parts of brushes come off wheelie applying bushes or powder to you face</li>
    <li> Lots of brushes. I love it</li>
    <li> Brushes are low quality. They shed constantly and are scratchy on the face.</li>
    <li> Bad smell , hairs fall off EASILY , brushes falling apart . bad choice I made there .</li>
    <li> They came in less than 2 wks. They are just lovely!!! They were each individually wrapped and nicely organized. The brushes are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend.  Its cheap for a reason.  Do yourself a favor and save up and purchase some real brushes or even opt for E.L.F brushes.</li>
    <li> Ok let&#x27;s be serious here people. These brushes are a GREAT price- and that is exactly what you get.  I personally do not need fancy 30$ brushes so this works perfectly for me, and there are a TON of them too.  Some work better than others (The blush brushes aren&#x27;t the best but the range of eye-shadow brushes make up for it. The case does smell very strongly upon arrival, like new vinyl, but that fades and the brushes have plastic covers. But I have not had any brushes &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; thus far and I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months</li>
    <li> I have no problems with them so far. they arent overly soft but they are much softer than i had expected for such a low price. they came in on time and are packaged nicely. definitely would recommend them</li>
    <li> I think these brushes are okay. When i first got them they didnt smell like plastic as all of the other review say. i took them all out, all of them were there, and ran my fingers through them. at first non of them seemed to shed and i was delighted. when i went to wash them the face brushes were shedding like crazy! when i pulled another hair out more hairs would be come loose. they are not unusable but they are kinda scratchy. i likes the eye brushes though. they come with a good variety, most just being the same brush in different sizes though. it did come with a blending sorta type brush but i found it too stiff.</li>
    <li> A great value for the price. Everything I needed was in this set. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the case &amp; brushes! More than I expected, You wont be sorry, Buy them!!! Perfect timing, I&#x27;m buying more for Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> Just as listed/expected!  A+++</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely awful! They shed like crazy (especially the larger ones) and don&#x27;t absorb the make-up the way GOOD brushes would. Now I know why they were so cheap. I suggest that you take the $14 and use it towards better quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Good brushes but after a few washes they start shedding a lot and the bristles get so nasty.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!! Bad smell, brushes are very stiff after you wash them and the smell never go away. They do not pick up product very well</li>
    <li> okay so i had them for about a month now and im like really disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;but u do get what u paid for and they really suck i dont  recommend them at all.&lt;br /&gt;i didnt mind the smell cuz it went away quick but the quality of the brush are just horrible. i ended up giving them to my toddler daughter to play with them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a month and still no brushes..</li>
    <li> Loved my brushes I was tired of using my figure once I got my brushes my problems were solved :)</li>
    <li> Most handy brushes and holder ever.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GIRLFRIEND ONE YEAR AND SHE REALLY LIKED THE PRODUCT. SHES A COSMETOLOGIST AND MAKEUP ARTIST SO I WOULD DEFINITELY TRUST HER JUDGEMENT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it three stars because, as anyone could imagine, for the prices, the brushes are cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these are perfect perfect perfect (Yes, I meant to say that three times!) brushes for someone who wishes to be a makeup artist, or a makeup artist who is just starting out. Every brush eventually broke, and it helped me because each brush that broke I knew what to replace and I just bought a better quality brush and before no time I had the same number of brushes (but better, of course).</li>
    <li> I am a high school girl who rushes to get ready in the mooring, so these brushes are something I use everyday. I use the smaller flat ones to do eyeshadow for eyeliner and it works perfectly. I also use brushes for my foundation and bronzer, and these hold up. I recommend these!</li>
    <li> The larger brushes shed really bad and are harsh against the skin. The smaller brushes are soft but it seems like they are all the same with the exception of like 4. You really do get what you pay for 32 pieces for 12 bucks what did you expect! Guess good brushes for the price...... FYI the smell is HORRIBLE when you first get them they smell like the strongest paint known to man!! I recommend washing and letting them sit a day or two which you should do anyways :)</li>
    <li> Its a great product for the price but the bad thing about it is when you receive it, it has a strong painty smell... and I also disliked the fact that the bigger brushes it sheds a lot sometimes... besides that its a great product for a great price !</li>
    <li> They are very good, but one thing I have to comment on is the smell when I got them they smelt of paint. Other than that... THEY WERE VERY GOOD!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are not that soft so it kind of makes it hard to put on makeup. I wish I would have bought some M.A.C. Brushes instead.</li>
    <li> The brushes aide me in accomplishing what I need to do, which apply makeup. I have only used two or three because I had older brushes that I still use. I am excited that there are so many for the price. I don&#x27;t even know what to do with all these brushes. I will say that the bag does have a strange odor that when you are around it for an extended period of time, it will become overwhelming.  I had it sitting on the table next to me while I was using my computer and the odor began to make me sneeze and become congested.  I ended up removing the brushes and storing them in pencil holders I&#x27;d bought for them anyway, and just put the bag in an inconspicuous area in hopes it will air out and the smell will dissipate.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush set! They are a little rough though. I recommend washing them with baby shampoo and then conditioning them with a hydrating conditioner! After the shampoo, conditioning, and over night drying process was complete the brushes were perfect!!</li>
    <li> When receiving my products they smelled terrible so be ready to wash them first thing.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are rough, splayed, shedding, no bueno!&lt;br /&gt;Every time you apply makeup you will be sure to have some extra facial hair from these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Just save up some money and buy some decent ones, you&#x27;ll just have to replace these anyway in a few months.</li>
    <li> Only issue I had with this was that it did shed a little and had a weird smell but I washed them and that fixed that issue. My main issue was that it wasn&#x27;t 32 pieces.</li>
    <li> shipping was good, but the fan brushes shed bad and the smell of the case is horrid it had my room smelling, but all that aside the brushes are worth it they are soft and a big variety.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality. I am better able to apply my makeup because I have a wide selection of brushes to chose from when applying my makeup.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Dont but waste of money, better to have 1 good quality brush then all of these...they shed!</li>
    <li> While a few of these brushes are very nice, the rest shed. A lot. The first time I used one particular brush, almost all of the little fuzzy bristles fell out of the holder and landed in my contacts. That wasn&#x27;t especially fun. I&#x27;m pretty sure the first time I try to wash these there&#x27;s not going to be much of a makeup brush left once I rinse out the cleaner.</li>
    <li> I had bought brushes before but not by this brand or seller and those brushes were ok but the price was $30 for 18 and only 5 were usable. The tops would come off and some came with the brushes hair 1/3 missing or hanging in until you did your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;These are amazing, the texture is very soft but firm, when you push it against your eye it doesn&#x27;t move it every direction. None of the hair has falling out. They are easy to clean but if you use the a lot of dark colors it will color the hair a lil. Even with that it doesn&#x27;t effect the next around of makeup. I would definitely buy this set again, its worth the money and the brush stays intacted!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes even though there are a few brushes that come in this set twice and there are some that I would never use or that I don&#x27;t even know how to use but its great and I use it everyday. I especially love the case for them it&#x27;s very organized</li>
    <li> I have not yet have the chance to really use these yet but they look great.  No fall out of bristles for me.  Might just be hit and miss or maybe temperature, but mine were perfectly fine:) Only a slight problem with the thin liner brush is that when I got it the bristles were all over the place and its not rly usable, but I am not rly sure if I would use it in any case.  I did get 1 brush repeated like 4 times which is a bit of a turn off, but I am sure I will find use of them.  I was sad that there was no fluffy blending brush in the mix and instead there was an array of brushes that were similar.  In any case I am very happy with my brushes, they are soft and well made.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my daughter who truly loves sitting and doing her makeup. She loves these brushes and says that even though they are worth lots more than what I paid for them!</li>
    <li> This was a really good priced set. The bigger brushes though where not good quality but all the others where awesome, and for the priced, i didnt care about the bigger brushes being crappy. All smaller brushes are good quality. I relpaced the big brushes ( blush, powder, ect..) with my nicer expencive ones. Very happy....</li>
    <li> *Husbands Account* I was really excited to get these in the mail. That work wonderfully, there are a few loose strands here and there but other than that they are perfect and for the price they are unbeatable. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it Besides the fact the two brushes were missing</li>
    <li> not very pleased with this product, brushes fell apart within only a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Good set but 2 of my brushes broke so I&#x27;m not to happy about that. I didn&#x27;t use the bag it came in because it had this chemical smell to it and I use my brushes on a brush holder on my vanity, cause its much easier for putting my make up on. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again nor would I recommend it because of how lose the brushes are by the stick part and because 2 broke off so easily.</li>
    <li> There all synthetic none good for eye shadow or blending of any kind . 32 brushes for foundation</li>
    <li> I love the bag they come in!! Super convenient and the brushes are awesome! So many brushes to use I don&#x27;t know where to start! The bag smells ALOT like nail polish but who cares you get over it I mean you got 32 brushes for less than 15$!!! Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> The package came right on time but just as the other reviews it does have a strong paint smell which is why I only gaveit 4 stars but besides the smell I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleaae with this product. The brush part break off the handle. It&#x27;s not usable. Would never buy this again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! They do the job!</li>
    <li> lots of brushes, bristles come out sometimes</li>
    <li> I told my boyfriend to buy this for me and i was so excited to get it in the mail. From being a review freak, reading all these reviews made me feel as if these were at least passable brushes. Quality is crap! It&#x27;s so rough and the hair on these brushes keeps falling off! The brushes are so stiff and rough that it made my face red. Literally felt like I&#x27;m scrapping my face with a paint brush. It&#x27;s really really bad quality, like its sooooooo soooooo crappy. I would rather use my fingers, no joke. Would never recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The brushes work well for their price. Personally, I feel there were many of the same brushes in the set and the quality is not great but they can get the job done.</li>
    <li> WOW.. .ITS LIKE A MILLION AND ONE BS BRUSHES IN THIS KIT. I ONLY USE ABOUT 5 OF THEM OUT OF THE 32 SMH. I GUESS ITS A GOOD PRICE AND I HAVE HAD THEM FOR A WHILE...</li>
    <li> Love these makeup brushes and the roll up  case they come in</li>
    <li> The brushes took awhile to get here, but they were worth the wait! Nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I just got the brushes today, theyre really nice but wish the brushes were a little thicker but for the price theyre ok super excited to use them</li>
    <li> Just as it looks in the picture. The only thing is that the strands come out easily, but is good to practice your makeup technique. I recommend if you use it to practice, but not for professional use.</li>
    <li> Nice make up brush set!</li>
    <li> Each brush that I used, the bristles just fell out in clumps.. This was a waste if money and did not meet my expectations</li>
    <li> Love this they work easily love it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this set because I need new brushes, and these were obviously inexpensive (I&#x27;m a bargain shopper). Well, I received my order in less than a week, which is always a plus. The case is pretty nice, not made of the highest end material, but then again they wouldn&#x27;t make a profit if they use superb material. Anyway, the brushes are very nice, I like how each were individually wrapped and some come with protectors to keep its shape. I read a lot of reviews saying the set smelled awful, for me, that is not the case. It has a \\&quot;new\\&quot; plastic/rubber smell, for example if you bu a new handbag, or shoes even, they have a smell. The smell isn&#x27;t over bearing at all and will eventually wear off. All in all, I am glad I ordered this set, and I do recommend it to bargain shoppers like myself.</li>
    <li> Many duplicate brushes and very hard fibers, easy to clean, but even the best cleaners end up ruining the brushes because it pulls the glue apart and the tops fall from the base of the brush. Super cheap and comes with many brushes! I only use the fan brush and the blush brush because all of the shadow brushes are unable to pickup any product.</li>
    <li> Bought them Christmas and still going strong! I love these so much!!! Strongly recommend!!</li>
    <li> horrible quality. they shed and they just don&#x27;t do anything for me.better off just spending the extra money on good makeup brushes. Personally I love Bubbi brushes! check those out at shopbubbi.com!!!!!</li>
    <li> I Am IN LOVE I Was so happy when I got and used right away it has a brush for the smokey eye and it came out so good I was in love... IT&#x27;S AMAZING!!!!!</li>
    <li> The are really good brusges but they can be alil harsh in the skin</li>
    <li> These are so bad omg.</li>
    <li> The brushes shed a lot... If I were you I would just save my money and save up for something of higher quality.</li>
    <li> The blush brush were horrible they poke so bad and hurt your skin</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t very soft, they also shed alot. They are do able but, they wouldn&#x27;t be recommended by me.</li>
    <li> I found these brushes and thought the price was too good to be true for a quality set of brushes--lesson learned. I am not a fan of this product.</li>
    <li> I liked them but one of the brushes was falling apart other then that i was satisfied...i say its worth buying.</li>
    <li> the 32 pieces of make up brushes is aweeeesomeeee.  i don&#x27;t use all 32 pieces but i know that some day i will.  the price is awesome btw.</li>
    <li> these brushes are just what i needed. i wold recommend this product to anyone looking for something temporary and cheap.</li>
    <li> I hate these brushes.They aren&#x27;t good at all the bristles are crap and the shed sooo much its ridiculous .</li>
    <li> It did come smelling a lot like plastic, but nothing terrible. The brushes are wonderful. A great, full set with brushes that are good quality (especially for the price!). Got here the day shipping said it would. I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> These brushes may be cheap for a lot, but they suck. They have many brushes that are the same, and theu smell really bad. Its a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set that comes in a great bag to keep it organized. It was delivered quickly and the teen I bought it for was very happy with it!</li>
    <li> When I got this item  my dad found it in my backyard idk how it got there brushes shed waste of money</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! They arrive super quick and the hairs don&#x27;t even fall out😍</li>
    <li> I am makeup hound love the quality of the brushes</li>
    <li> minmal to no shedding great for the price</li>
    <li> Very disapointed n a waste of money....Well to start i didnt even get the brushes i ordered n not to mention they are very cheap n not good quality!!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are pretty good. Whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a expert with make-up, these are a great buy. I still have my brushes and it&#x27;s been OVER a year and it&#x27;s still in good condition. They shed a little, but still worth it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes! There are so many to choose from and all work well. There is a bit of chemical smell from the case, but if you leave it open and let it air out, it goes away. The brushes roll up well in the little case they come in. The only thing I could say, is I&#x27;m a little disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t a fluffy blending brush...but other than that, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Brissels fall out easy</li>
    <li> The brushes she&#x27;d a few hairs when first opened but otherwise work great and are great quality</li>
    <li> I was pissing some brushes.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes very good buy although it came with some that i dont think i will ever use definitley going to order some more</li>
    <li> According to other reviews, these brushes are supposed to be soft and not shed. They are very stiff and leave bristles on my face after using. I was disappointed, but at least I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.</li>
    <li> Just got the item today so I have yet to use, but I felt the hair and it seems very nice. Good quality and very fast shipping</li>
    <li> when these were delivered i was really excited because of the amount of brushes i was getting for so little! BUT i was missing atleast five brushes, and almost every single one of the big brushes lost a lot of the actual brush part. My eyebrow brush completely fell apart the first day. Not to mention the fact that they are NOT soft and actually kind of hurt my face while applying. I almost feel like they wrote the good reviews on here because theres literally no way that that many people think these are good brushes because they&#x27;re not. I dont even have high standards, they just have to be kind of soft and firm.  Yes, they are firm, but not soft and they fall apart.</li>
    <li> these brushes are kool soft i washed bristles arent falling off great for makeup use no scratchy feeling on face:)</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes they did have a chemical smell at first but that goes away fast and the brushes shed a little but that also goes away but that&#x27;s not going to knock down a star</li>
    <li> 1/19/14 : I just got my package yesterday and it comes in a really cute bag. I recommend cleaning the brushes before you use them because they do have some type of powder on them. They are nice, and soft in my opinion. They look professional, and I have tested two out and they both pick up color just fine! I would compare them to the quality of elf brushes, which are not bad. Yes, they do shed a bit, but mine haven&#x27;t shed like everyone makes it seem. It&#x27;s natural for new brushes to shed a little bit, and that&#x27;s all the shedding I&#x27;ve seen so far. For 15-16 bucks I get 32 makeup brushes (some are duplicates)? Sounds great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to come back and update my use for the brushes and how they are doing in a few weeks-months. So far I&#x27;m loving my purchase!</li>
    <li> Yes, these brushes stink. It&#x27;s a combination of the paint used on the handles of the brushes, the dye used on the bristles and the faux leather roll case. Give the brushes a wash with baby shampoo and olive oil to get excess bristle dye out, leave them to air dry, and let the case air out. The smell fades quickly. Other than that, these brushes are surprisingly of good quality. While I had 8 repeats (for a total of 16 brushes that weren&#x27;t original), I am okay with this, as I am always searching for a clean blending brush. Another fault for this set is that my large fan brush arrived damaged, but it is still usable. If I ever needed a gift for a friend, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order this - at least a week in advance, though, so I would have time to wash them and let everything air out.</li>
    <li> I love the set but I wish the I didn&#x27;t have I pick the hair off my face from the brush and also I wish I didn&#x27;t have to wait so long to get my set in the mail</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price. I will have brushes for years, since I do not use makeup much and there are all sizes.</li>
    <li> I wanted a full makeup brush set but I didn&#x27;t want to have to pay the price of one, so I settled on this. After reading reviews I decided to buy it, and received  it within two weeks. Many reviewers had spoke of a plastic smell, but these brushes came to me smelling like absolutely nothing and had no sticky residue either as many claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the bristles and everything is great, the case is weird, but handy.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about these is the metal part holding the bristles pops right off of the wooden handle...all the time. I think I&#x27;m going to have to take some superglue to the metal hardware soon because every time I use these I have to pinch them back together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, fantastic quality for the money, and after some superglue I&#x27;m sure I will absolutely love these brushes!</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow brushes are great but the powder brushes I wouldn&#x27;t recommend because they are really rough and aren&#x27;t very good at spreading the product</li>
    <li> The brushes were of good quality.  One fault is that they are not labelled according to their use e.g. blush, powder, eyes. etc.</li>
    <li> Althought there are a handful of great brushes the hairs fall out WAY TOO EASY on a lot of the bigger brushes.</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes was great.  I will recommend my friends and family to shop at this store in the future.</li>
    <li> These brushes are decent, I suppose. You do get what you pay for, and while it is an extremely good price for so many brushes, it&#x27;s only slightly worth it. I&#x27;ve had them for about 2 months and the larger fluffy brushes have major fall out. the smaller brushes on the other hand are actually very useful, and better quality than the bigger ones. I would possibly recommend this set to any beginners with makeup, or if you would like cheap brushes you don&#x27;t mind ruining. If you&#x27;re looking for high quality brushes, shed the extra dollar and get some sigma or real technique. I give this four stars because the only issue i have with these brushes is the fallout on the larger ones, but those only account for less than half of the collection. The smaller brushes have not let me down thus far. (:</li>
    <li> These brushes went beyond my expectations. They are all new and wrapped with plastic covering. They are very soft and effective. Defiantly a amazing project for not that expensive!</li>
    <li> What do you expext for $15? Its doable... What can I say! You have to wash them when you get them because they do smell but not as bad as some described. I also aired them out a few days in the garage (forgot them there) and then washed them. Its a good way to get ufamiliar with using different brushes!</li>
    <li> They were okay when I first used them but when you go to wash them they shed and they&#x27;re no good anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these makeup brushes for over 6 months and not once have I had any problems. I get complimented on them all the time, I&#x27;m not quite a professional like the people who work at MAC or any makeup counter but these brushes are the best. You get a great bang for you buck and will use just about every brush. Some of the bigger brushes do shed but once you clean them with soap and water or brush cleaner the shedding will stop. Other than that, these brushes are the best and I would recommend them. GREAT USE!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I thought of giving it a try. I was disappointed. Only 3 of the large brushes are natural. The rest are but a repeating of the same. I am not sure what material they are made but by simply opening the bag they are already shedding. The smell is horrid and toxic. I had barely opened the package my eyes started watering. They are going back</li>
    <li> Found that if u spray the brushes with a little water they do hold the color and apply well some were cut crooked and they shed allot yet after washing them twice shedding quit overall cant complain toomuch great value for the price :)</li>
    <li> I totally luved them. I really dont know how to use them yet but i like them a lot. Luv da leather carrying case. Great price n buy</li>
    <li> The product was so helpful for my daughter&#x27;s dance performance. My daughter was doing Classical Dance last weak and we need different kind of makeup tools for that. Luckly my wife found this brush set in amazon and it happened to be the one that we were looking for.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Delivery was promt but i did not get 32 pieces as i thought i would three brushes were missing</li>
    <li> All the hair comes off the brushes, so i do understand the price</li>
    <li> these brush are so awesome they lay my makeup on y face nicely.</li>
    <li> Love itm.got it sooner than expected</li>
    <li> This is a great set for someone looking to either expand a limited collection or get started on one. Some of the brushes aren&#x27;t fantastic, but let&#x27;s be real- you&#x27;re not spending the kind of money you would on Sigma brushes here so don&#x27;t expect them to last a lifetime. That said, these are the brushes I use everyday for my makeup and have never had any problems. You get a few duplicates so you can switch colors in the middle of a look and not worry about having to clean in between light and dark colors. Some people have said there is a smell when they get these brushes, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be either too strong or terribly unpleasant, it went away within a day or two of being out of the box. I strongly recommend you clean all of the brushes before the initial use, lord knows whats on there that you don&#x27;t want on your face!!</li>
    <li> i like the brushes alot..some are great but a few are not so great...its a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Hard to keep in when rolled up if pick up wrong way they will all fall out</li>
    <li> They have some fall out but if you brush them against your hand the loose bristles will start up poke up &amp; I&#x27;m sure after they get washed the fall out will be gone....hopefully. There are alot of synthetic brushes which I didnt realize but I needed more concealer brushes so they will get used for concealers, primers, bases, highlighting with gel &amp; cream makeup. The other makeup brushes feel like sable and they have good thickness to them. So they will pick up alot of products. I may have to order another brush kit to get more regular brushes. Overall im happy with it. There was no weird smell to them like some people say. I will write another review once I use them for while.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! soft beautiful brushes, has a slight smell but its not really noticeable unless you have your nose all on the leather and brushes. NO FALL OUT, I love these brushes</li>
    <li> yes I love it...thanks alot</li>
    <li> the smell is strong, but its ok for the price</li>
    <li> Rough on skin, sheds a ton. :(</li>
    <li> Thank you, loved all brushes!</li>
    <li> I really likes it lot, but didn&#x27;t put name&lt;br /&gt;of brush like I expected to but so far I really likes it lot, not much smelly tho</li>
    <li> When it comes to shopping I live by &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. So I knew these brushes weren&#x27;t going to be high end quality. I bought these so I don&#x27;t have to run to the store every time I need a certain brush. With makeup I like having at least 2 of the same with smaller brushes and this set has that. I like the case they came in, it&#x27;s soft and I can wipe it clean when needed, which is just as important and washing your brushes regularly. The small fan brush didn&#x27;t quite hold it&#x27;s shape through shipping, the plastic topper had slipped down so it&#x27;s pretty deformed. Like I said though, it&#x27;s a great price so I still pleased. I&#x27;m going to attempt bringing shape back to it but no biggie if I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this brushes for about 2 years now and they get the job done, but mostly of the brushes i use for my face have started to shed. also, my set didnt come with a blending brush for the eyes. other than that, they really get the job done.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.... They come in many sizes.... !!!!! And i honestly never get tired of them.</li>
    <li> Very nice set with a large variety, the brushes are very soft and hardly shed. Overall they&#x27;re a decent buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Horrible overwhelming plastic scent. Almost like a chemical smell. Avoid if your sensitive, pregnant, have kids or if you think it would bother you.</li>
    <li> Very nice set, comes in a nice black carrying case. Each brush has it own spot. Cant beat the price for how many brushes you get.</li>
    <li> The brushes are okay. The spooly broke after I used it about 3 times and one unglued after washing it. Also majority of these brushes are the exact same. It doesn&#x27;t even come with a blending brush. I do like some of them which is why they got 3 stars. One is great for highlighting the cheeks and a setting powder and blush and one oddly shaped eye brush thats good for a cut crease eye shadow look. They do come with a strong chemical smell though but after washing it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so exited for my sister to open her present and see them. I don&#x27;t personally care much for them but I was amazed by the quality and such great price. I know she is going to love them. I highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;ve gotta say that this came to me real quick. Second, after reading the reviews and seeing a lot of people had awful ratty, shedding brushes, I was a bit hesitant to buy this. But I thought, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a good price for 32 brushes, so I&#x27;ll go for it and keep any that are good.&amp;#34; With the set I received, shedding was not at all a problem. there are a few loose hairs here and there, but no more than you&#x27;d expect from brushes straight from the package. They DO have a bit of a chemical smell, but if that grows to be an issue, I&#x27;ll update this review. The bristles aren&#x27;t too firm or too rough and, all in all, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: it&#x27;s been over a year. Still not falling apart. Brushes on the ends of the case fall out from time to time, but I can live with that.</li>
    <li> Brushes are no good. They she&#x27;d and leave hairs in my makeup. Not good quality</li>
    <li> the make-up brush kit shreds too much.... Don&#x27;t really like it...you put on make up and feel stuff on your face</li>
    <li> great I love them, use all the time and easy to clean, thinking about x-mas gifts for teen agers.Everyone should have a set .</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a manicurist, these brushes are great to clean the manicure off of your cuticles. Otherwise, forget it!&lt;br /&gt;They are very hard on your skin and most of the brushes are very similar to the others.&lt;br /&gt;The most useful brushes (fluffy brush etc) are not even there.&lt;br /&gt;My bad! I shouldn&#x27;t have ordered the 32 pcs as a trial.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this for herself and said it was one of the best investments she ever made!  Every brush has a purpose, and they are very well made.  She has yet to replace one for her eyes or face she says.  No bristles have fallen out and the kit is very easy to keep together neatly in the holder it came in.  &amp;#34;Ladies it is worth every penny&amp;#34; were her words exactly.  This will last a long time or share it with other ladies in the family or girlfriends because they are so well made it will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Brush handle fell apart after two uses. Bristles shed. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again or recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> Other than the smell the brushes are GREAT and I&#x27;m happy I purchased this set. Now I probably have to many brushes BUT I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry.</li>
    <li> I give 5 star , cosmetic set kit its increíble. They were on time and a beautiful case.  ?&lt;br /&gt;32 pcs for nothing</li>
    <li> I was so scared to buy these because I didn&#x27;t know how they were going to feel on my face but they are so smooth and soft I love them they are the best brushes I have ever owned , People can also see the difference in my make up I recommend</li>
    <li> I love this brushes i got another set off amazon i think its called famu or something idk its a great set but only has round eye brushes and blush this set lacks round eyeshadow brushes but has EVERY angled brush and i not feel like my set is complete! I love the hair on the face brushes but thats only about 4 for blush toning and fanning. The others are not the same material yet they still work awesome! I have yet to have any hair fall out and like anything leather/faux it has a smell but not the brushes... Imagine walking into wilsons leather (do they still have those lol) it smells like pleather! This set is awesome and i would recommend then to pro make up artosts or ppl like me who cant do make up unless i have the perfect angles and crease lines on my own face. My make up looks wayyyy better with the use of this set! Id reccommend keeping the plastic on the brushes... I am ocd about stuff like that lol</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy. Did have a really strong smelling smell when you unwrap them at first, but I just aired mine out for two days and they were fine.</li>
    <li> Omg. These brushes are so soft so cheap and well made. I am a makeup artist and was needing new brushes fast. I ordered these and two days later I&#x27;m here writing a review. I absolutely love these. All my clients ask where I got them and think they are great. These are well worth it. I love em. 💙💜💙💜💙</li>
    <li> these are for my wife. she seem to really enjoy using them. the good was in a brand new condition.</li>
    <li> BIG BANG FOR YOUR BUCK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered these brushes on December 17, 2013 and received them January 6th, 2014.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with how quickly they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the brush roll does smell of vinyl but it is not overpowering and fades over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush is wrapped individually in plastic upon arrival and in a VERY nice brush roll. Even if I hated the brushes (which I don&#x27;t), the brush roll itself would have been worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend with any brush purchase (whether you purchase it at MAC or online) that you wash the brushes before use. As the description states, these brushes are natural and synthetic. The natural brushes smelled slightly of horse when I washed them but I wouldn&#x27;t doubt they are made of horse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes held up very nicely when washed, the ONLY brush that shed was the large fan brush and even then, it was only a few bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is such a wide variety of brushes, I&#x27;m very pleased. There are only a few duplicate brushes and they are eye brushes - very useful duplicates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased with these brushes. I will update my review after I&#x27;ve used them and rate them based on application, too. But after just taking them out of the package &amp; washing they seem like one of the BEST MAKEUP PURCHASES I&#x27;VE EVER MADE!!!!</li>
    <li> This is honestly a fabulous product for the price. I am in NO WAY a professional make up artist, I just like make up. I was looking for a low cost foundation brush to test it out to see if I liked using one before I spent more money on a more expensive product. But I use most of the brushes. Some are duplicates, yes, but I like the variety the rest add to the brushes I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the reviews, I thought I would address some of the concerns from the 1 and 2 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Brushes shed-- I haven&#x27;t used all of the brushes yet (because there are so many) but I haven&#x27;t had this problem yet. Some of the reviews say that all of the brushes shed, and terribly at that...I haven&#x27;t experienced that yet. I even tried tugging on the large brushes, like the fan, and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out. Maybe they had a bad set or the problem has been corrected since then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The brushes smell upon receiving them-- yes, the entire package does smell of a polyurethane/plastic scent. Other reviews said to leave the brushes open over night and this removed the smell. The make up belt that they&#x27;re in is a pleather material so it supposed to have that smell and doesn&#x27;t bother me too much after airing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Some of the brushes are the same-- how many different kind of brushes can you have? Yes, some are the same. I counted 27 or so unique brushes out of 32. But I like that there are 2 of the eyeshadow brushes because you can use dark and light shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Non-brand name synthetic brushes-- no where does it say they&#x27;re brand name (MAC or otherwise) and perhaps the description saying their &amp;#34;quality natural hair and synthetic fiber&amp;#34; is a little misleading. I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re natural hair but for the price I&#x27;m not complaining. I&#x27;m also not sure why the description says &amp;#34;eco-friendly&amp;#34;...not sure how that&#x27;s the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall... the entire set is under 20 bucks. Take it or leave it, but it&#x27;s less than 1 dollar per brush and that&#x27;s unbeatable.t&#x27;s less than 1 dollar per brush and that&#x27;s unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Love my new brush-set. Shipping was a little long but sooo worth the wait. Great addition to my starter kit!</li>
    <li> When I opened the box and took the kit out of its plastic bag it stank of plastic and heavy ink. Almost like a sharpie broke onto it.&lt;br /&gt;Then when I got past the smell I saw there was a brush missing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;So then I start to check on the quality of the brushes and a good 80% of the brushes have this nice soft golden/tan hair on it and did not shed, which was a plus. When I got to the dark brown haired brushes they were a little rough and they shed.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great set. I would recommend this to anyone. I am surprised some people had complaints. Buy MAC brushes if you&#x27;re expectations are super high. If not, I dont think you&#x27;ll be disappointed with these.</li>
    <li> Okay. Let&#x27;s start from the beginning. I ordered this November 20th 2013. My estimated delivery date was December 17th-January 6th. I received it on January 11th. So almost 2 months later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it finally arrived, I ripped it open right away because I was super excited to finally get it! The other reviews were right when they said it had a strong paint smell, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me because its just the black &#x27;pleather&#x27; thing they come in, not the actual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushed themselves are OKAY. Some of the brushes are good, others not so much and about 5 brushes each come with a duplicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I inspected my brushes i looked at the packaging and they put my phone number on the outside of the package where my name and address are, I mean might as well put a picture of me on there as well. Thank goodness I haven&#x27;t had any weird numbers call. They also state what&#x27;s being shipped on the outside as well, so everyone that handled it now knows my name, number, where I live, and what I purchased. It just seems sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because some of the brushes work okay. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll purchase anything from them again.</li>
    <li> I Love these brushes. I uses them all the time. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t rate them five stars is because when using some of the bigger brushes then tend to shed.. the first time it happened I had so much on my face I had to wash my face. BUT now since I have used them more the shedding as stopped a little. Before I apply on my face I roll in my hand to make sure  thats its ok to use on my face.... over than that PERFECT !!!!! Also u get so many my girlfriends were jealous bc you rec so many and on retail stores u can can&#x27;t even receive half that this price.  And I&#x27;ve had these for about sic months and still get excited to use them every time.  Also they give u more than one size for the same brush. With these u can create the perfect eye each time. I always reciece compliments</li>
    <li> And it comes in a nice folding or &amp;#34;rolled&amp;#34; case with protection for the brush ends. This won&#x27;t fit inside a small cosmetic case like the Victorinox Hanging Toiletry Kit, so make sure you need this many brushes.</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes is not great. Yes, they are cheap, but in this case...you get what you pay for. There were only about 10 different brushes at best. The rest all duplicates. You would be better off saving your money and just purchasing a good quality brush 1 at a time.</li>
    <li> They smell &amp; are pretty rough on the face. Cheap in more ways than one! I should have sent them back when I opened the box &amp; took a whiff</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because of the price and knowing I would most likely be ruining them as I use them for special effects makeup (latex, wax, silicone, etc goes on the brushes) They hold up very well and I have not noticed any shedding even after the 5+ time cleaning them. I have not used the large fan brush yet but It looks cool. The case says MAC on it, which is OBVIOUSLY not true, but the case is GREAT. If you Roll it up with the brushes on the outside you can use it as a brush stand - its great when you have only one had free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only small tiny little itty bitty thing I can maybe complain about is I wish there was a little more varity on which brushes are included. I would like to see a few of the medium rounded brushes replaced with fine/thin top brushes for detail lines and such. I just ended up buying another small set of small brushes.</li>
    <li> These are some of the BEST brushes I&#x27;ve used. They feel and work like high end blushes without the high end price. Theres an awesome range of sizes so there&#x27;s a brush in there for EVERYTHING!! Came on time and are exactly what i was expecting!</li>
    <li> I received this item today after much anticipation to expand my makeup collection.  Upon opening the bag that contained the brushes I was met upon a very strong paint smell. Not sure if the bag was freshly painted but the supplier could have ensure to get rid of the smell before shipment. The large brushes make absolutely noooo sense plus they shed like crazy!!. There were lupms of hair on top of the large brushes.  And the small ones are just repeats.  The protection for the brushes were good. But overall I am disappointed and would not recommend this product.  Not because something is economical means a supplier should not produce the best to satisfy his/her customers.  If they continue they gonna only have one time customers.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They are soft and extremely professional. They do have a strong odor at first but, it smells like new material not like a funky odor. Fast Shipping and Great quality professional brushes. They go great with my CHANEL and MAC make up.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself. I love make up and always use \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; brushs/makeup. Ive never been so disapointed. The brushes are so itchy. After use I have to pick the little hairs off my face. I do use the conceler brush and spooly but thats all. Another disapointment is that it did not come with a full flufy blending eye brush. Will not be buying again and will be more careful when buying brushes.</li>
    <li> Lots of repeated brushes, like 3 of the same eye brush.&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are NOT soft, itches the skin a bit, but does the job.</li>
    <li> I hate this! I can&#x27;t believe I even spent a penny on these brushes. The hairs were already coming off when I first opened it and it doesn&#x27;t apply makeup to my face! These brushes suck. They are a bit rough on my skin too. Not soft at all! I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy it unless it&#x27;s for a little girl to play with make up. I am sticking with my MAC brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use on my clients instead of reusing my expensive brushes constantly. The hair is a little rough and scratchy, not really pleased, but some brushes are okay.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use these brushes when I first got them, but that was definitely a huge mistake because I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t return them now.  They must have been sprayed black because 1) the smell of paint wafted through the air when I opened them and 2) black specks came off of the brushes and landed on my face.  Get it together, Aukey.</li>
    <li> Because it was everything I expected it to be. Love the variety of brushes that it comes with. Great job.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box it had a nasty smell......I hate these,they smell like car oil,they are hard and rough ....</li>
    <li> Great buy(:&lt;br /&gt;so many soft brushes&lt;br /&gt;came with a strong smell but not over bearing&lt;br /&gt;kinda smells like cleaner which i think will go away after a few hours&lt;br /&gt;overall nice purchase.</li>
    <li> Brushes fall apart and shed to easy. I can&#x27;t apply makeup without getting the hairs in my eyes and face. Rarely even use these.</li>
    <li> It arrived early which was nice , the roll-up they come in had that weird new material smell ( I just layed it out open to &amp;#34; air out &amp;#34; so that was no big deal ) but there was nothing to describe each brush ( not a big deal ) , overall happy with purchase .</li>
    <li> There just brushes at the price who&#x27;s going to complain if your looking to spend less than 20 bucks these will do just fine</li>
    <li> They shed and are not glued well but not a bad price for how many you get, not to bad f a deal</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom as a Christmas gift, she wanted a nice set of brushes.  She ended up giving them to me a few months later because she never used them.  I&#x27;ve used a few of the brushes and they&#x27;ve falled apart.  The brush part breaks off the handle and the bristles fall out of the brush.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes it for generic use</li>
    <li> The larger brushes had different quality bristles in the brushes.  Not sure if was a manufacturing error or a cost cutting measure.  I probably won&#x27;t use them,  as they&#x27;re not very soft :(  However all the smaller brushes were really very soft and dense.  For the number of good quality smaller brushes in this set,  it was worth the price.  The smaller brushes were comparable to E.L.F. Cosmetics crystal series brushes as far as softness.</li>
    <li> Over all, the brush set is nice. The only thing is that the fan brush and all the larger brushes shed. The eye, detail brushes are great. The only complaint is that the large brushes shed and the stays in your makeup if you don&#x27;t catch it.</li>
    <li> Bristles come off every now and then but there makeup brushes are reliable</li>
    <li> now my sister inlaw wants to buy them. They are a little rough nothing your skin cant handle, and they shed just a little bit. But theyre beautiful.</li>
    <li> Need to be washed well and laid flat when you first receive but great brushes for the price and I love the case! Purchase a set for both my daughter and myself.</li>
    <li> I love doing makeup on my friends and family members. The brushes are perfect for everything I need to do for them</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited to get this in the mail.  When I opened it, however, the face brushes immediately started shedding when I took them out.  It might have been fine if it was one or two hairs, but it felt like the whole brush was going to fall apart.  Washing them was excruciating, there were so many hairs falling out that it took me forever to get them washed.  The bristles are very very rough on your face and I don&#x27;t find it worth it to use them.  The bristles were frayed when they arrived, and they are still frayed.  The angled bronzing brush got very tangled after its first wash.  I had to comb the large knot out and the hairs are more frayed and out of place than they already were.  The only face brush I will continue to use is the large foundation/concealer brush that is made from a different material than the rest of the face brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes are the opposite.  They are very good at what they&#x27;re supposed to be for.  I have no complaints regarding them so far.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to add that you don&#x27;t get what it shows you in the pictures.  All of my eye brushes are a yellow color, with some that are brown.  The large foundation/concealer brush is also a yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend.  There are just too many brushes I feel I&#x27;m going to end up throwing away.&lt;br /&gt;I have included some pictures.</li>
    <li> got 3 sets 2 for gifs we all love it my 2 girls love the set I was happy to see how much the girls loved the set</li>
    <li> What a quick shipping! I was surprised when this product came to my doorstep. And i opened it right away. I love how soft the brushes are and i sure can&#x27;t wait to use them. Great price for a bunch of brushes!</li>
    <li> This is no professional kit the brushes shed ect BUT if your using this for basic makeup application it&#x27;s great !!</li>
    <li> my 13 yr old g.daughter loves the  brushes quality is great</li>
    <li> I am Very pleased with my purchase.  It only took a week from time I ordered it, to time I received it. The brushes are beautiful and look like high quality brushes. There was no funky leather smell from the case. The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is I&#x27;m not sure What half of these brushes are for but there&#x27;s always YouTube.  Great product for my money and I&#x27;ll definitely buy again as gifts.</li>
    <li> great set my 3 daughters love them !</li>
    <li> Is okay product, NOT too bad NOT too good</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these! There&#x27;s soo many and they all work well!!</li>
    <li> So they are functional, but honestly more brushes than I know what to do with. The only negative I have to say about them is that my larger brushes for powder and blush shed a lot. ::as I&#x27;m using a large brush to wipe off loose eyeshadow beneath my eyes, I have to use it again to wipe off the extra brush hair that has come off on my face:: and the mascara brush (I use for my eyebrows) constantly becomes loose from the handle and I have to kind of screw/push it back in so it doesn&#x27;t roll when I use it. But other than that, they&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> very poor quality when you use them a black sut gets all over your face</li>
    <li> The product came in on time and the brushes work great!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!  Soo many of them, I don&#x27;t know what to do with all of them! :)</li>
    <li> I never actually recurved my brushed. This sticks</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I do makeup for people&#x27;s event and these brushes are amazing. I was iffy on how they would be for the price but they are so nice!! No shedding or roughness.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so much more than I expected. I looked like a little kid on Christmas morning when I opened the package. Everything was perfect as far as shipping, and I got the brushes before they were expected to come in. There are so. many. brushes! They&#x27;re all in excellent condition and the application is so smooth. 10/10. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone the brush are very durable and soft I received all 32 brushes for a great price I have nothing bad to say about this product or seller shipping was very fast and everything was up to par !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush set for my daughter. She uses them everyday, and I am happy with this product .</li>
    <li> Great fit. Great shipping</li>
    <li> Very nice set. Well packaged. Soft. Good quality. I recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Work great, smell is not as bad as the reviews make it out to be. I love these brushes, and especially the price! (:</li>
    <li> Tons and tons of brushes! The hair falls out a little at first, but they work great, and I love having all these choices! Great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> Look for the price of less than $15.00 you get 32 brushes compared to 1 brush at Sephora or Mac that costs about $32 or $40 bucks. The brushes are good. Yes a little hair falls out from them, but I suggest for you to clean your brushes beforehand or shake them a little to remove loose hairs before applying any makeup on your face. Also I recommend for you to air out the bag because it does smell a little, but don&#x27;t worry, the smell will GO AWAY!! Other than that, THEY ARE GREAT BRUSHES!  32 brushes for less than $15.00 bucks, that is a wonderful, amazing deal!!! I am satisfied with my brushes!!</li>
    <li> Ok so there were a few stray hairs that I had to clip but seriously for the price and the amount of brushes that was received who really cares? I love these brushes. You just have to take care of them like everything else. I would defintely purchase this for someone else if I knew they wanted one!</li>
    <li> these brushes suck. the larger brushes with the dark bristles for the face HURT. they&#x27;re really rough and really coarse. the smaller brushes for the eyes are super soft, but they don&#x27;t pick up any product.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason I didn&#x27;t return it was because I just didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;so, yeah, I really don&#x27;t like these brushes, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! They had a weird smell and feel to them when I first received them. I washed all of the brushes before using them and they were already better. Great price and great quality! Shipping was quick as well!</li>
    <li> I love my brushes, and a good price. However there isn&#x27;t variety, half the brushes are the same in my kit!</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice but as I started using them they began to fall apart and they are literally brand new. Some of them are even a little to rough and actually hurt!!!</li>
    <li> Lets put it this way. If your a mother getting this for your child that is very young then these are amazing for the cost. They will not hold up long. after a couple washes they will fall apart. In general they are crap .Perfect for kids that are just playing around.</li>
    <li> I got just within a couple days earlier than expected. I love all these brushes, but they did have a strong paint smell to them when I opened them up. I just cleaned them and started using them. They do work really great and are super soft!</li>
    <li> This is a must have for all makeup artist and those that love to use multiple brushes. Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Smells heavily like paint but great quality.</li>
    <li> I just got my black rod make up brushes today and I love them! a few of them shed,but that&#x27;s alright. They usually do. I can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
    <li> Brissels fall out when cleaned cant get heavy sewing machine oil smell out of case</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my teen age  grand-daughters.  They loved it!</li>
    <li> All the brushes you need to get you started and at a very cheap price. They aren&#x27;t Spectacular, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love this set!!! I was very surprised at the quality and quantity for the price. They were packaged well; each brush had a cover over them. The hairs on the brushes were soft and the case was organized. The kit had a faint smell of paint, but nothing overpowering. I have used every one of them and none of the hairs have fallen out. These brushes are amazing and the carrying case is very convenient!! Definitely worth buying!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great Price. Brushes are good, very soft. BUT the foundation brush broke within 3 uses. Had to super glue it today.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use any of the brushes due to the fact they are all far too stiff. There is an excessive amount of shedding with the face brushes and the smell reminds me of plastic. The only pro i seem to have gotten from this product is that it shipped in two days. It is a real shame too because I really would have loved to use every single brush in this case.</li>
    <li> These brushes are hard and hurt during make-up application.  Run! They are by far the worst make-up bruses I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Small eye shadow  brushes are great the face brushes kinda shed a little but nothing terrible where I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again</li>
    <li> Especially all the smaller ones for shadow, contour.  I&#x27;m VERY pleased, at the price point, they&#x27;re a steal, and the quality is above what I thought I&#x27;d be getting.</li>
    <li> When I saw this offer I thought it was too good to be true, and it was! I love these brushes! So many brushes for so many different makeup applications! You can&#x27;t get any better for this price, I&#x27;ll tell you that right now. I love this brush kit and would recommend it for anybody.</li>
    <li> These brushes are cheaply made and they shed like crazy. I tried to work with them but they shed extremely too bad. Money wasted. The concealer brushes in this set along with the eyebrow spooly are the only brushes that I am able to salvage.</li>
    <li> This Make-Up Brush Set is FANTASTIC! Really nice quality for every single brush/tool, very pleased with this purchase! The case has a strong scent at first but it goes away after a few days once you have opened the package. Fits great into any make-up box too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just received this set of brushes. I normally go through my Amazon purchases very thoroughly in case anything&#x27;s wrong. I found nothing bad with these brushes, perfect quality of the brush, &amp; quite soft brush hair as well. I only hate how the faux-leather case smells: very pungent, but otherwise everything is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth mentioning that the set has arrived one day earlier &amp; this was an absolute sweet surprise!</li>
    <li> My daughter is a professional dancer and I got this to replace a very expensive set of brushes.  SHE LOVED IT!  It folds up easily and the brushes get the job done.  All the girls in the company are ordering a set for themselves now!</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful especially for the price. The only problem is they shed. There are so many brushes that I have no idea what they are for</li>
    <li> Shipping time was a bit loooong. But for the price I guess it should be expected. Quality was also a 4 bc the big brushes aren&#x27;t too great but the rest seem okay. Not too much shedding and the smell everyone mentions wasn&#x27;t that bad. Yes there are doubles but it&#x27;s actually good. I don&#x27;t regret buying and would recommend for anyone who needs cheap but useful brushes.</li>
    <li> They are just perfect! They bring everything I wanted and more. I didn&#x27;t want to buy something really expensive because I am currently starting to use makeup a lot but I am still not used to it. I am obsessed and I love it but I also don&#x27;t know if it will just be a phase and I&#x27;ll stop using make up in a few months from now (don&#x27;t think so but you never know). I wanted to but something cheap so first learn how to use everything and upgrade to something better later on but let me tell you that these brushes are amazing! Mine didn&#x27;t have any smell or anything wrong with them they were just perfect.</li>
    <li> Although it was delivered on time, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the brushes because of their poor quality. I guess what can you expect for such an affordable price.</li>
    <li> First of all i want to thank the shipping company cause i didn&#x27;t receive my badge on time &amp; when i email them they just send me another kit , although it was my fault by not writing the apartment number&lt;br /&gt;They are really nice and good&lt;br /&gt;Second the kit is very nice &amp; the smell that some mention in the reviews it was the lather smell and it wasn&#x27;t so bad&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> I got these brushes on time they didn&#x27;t have a smell no fake logos and every brush was different from the other I ordered some eyeshadow pallettes from E.L.F cosmetics along with these brushes I had some trouble picking up the eyeshadow and when I would apply on my eyes it would look faded but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the brushes I think the eyeshadows were a bad buy because I didn&#x27;t have any problems with my victoria&#x27;s secret eyeshadows but as I was applying some of the eyeshadow was falling under my eye which I&#x27;ve never had a problem with before but I think for the price I&#x27;m happy with what I got some brushes alone can cost 60$ so to get 32 for under 20 im happy:-)</li>
    <li> Poor quality, most fell apart.</li>
    <li> So once my brushes arrived I cleaned them before using. I have used ALL the brushes except for the big fat ones (I.e blush brush etc) I finally used those big brushes last weekend and they were shedding. Mind you I washed them before using and they didn&#x27;t shed and all the others weren&#x27;t shedding either. I had a lot of brush hair on my face which I hate. Good thing I decided to keep them as my personal brushes instead of using them on my clients like I was going to do at first. Don&#x27;t NOBODY got time for that. Who wants hair all on their lips, face, and chest? Not me. Be careful when purchasing.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They make putting make up on super easy and glorious results. Cost effective and great quality</li>
    <li> I JUST GOT MY PACK OF MAKEUP IT DID COME WITH A WEIRD SMELL ON TOP OF THAT THEY ARE NOT SAME COLOR AS IN THE PICTURES THE BIG BRUSHES LOOK LIKE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LAST LONG SO I HAVE ALREADY ORDERED ANOTHER SET I GOT THEM REALLY FAST I ORDERED THEM FRIDAY RECEIVED THEN SUNDAY MORNING SO THAT&#x27;S GOOD BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THESE BRUSHES ARE THE BIG ONES FOR RIGHT NOW THE HAIR ARE REALLY HARD ALREADY SHEDDING THE SMALL ONES ARE IN PLACE NO PROBLEM YET THEY ARE REALLY SOFT HOPE THIS HELPS</li>
    <li> the powder brushes are to rough but everything else was good :) maybe a few more brushes that are needed should be incorporated</li>
    <li> I am a model and makeup artist, I ordered these brushes and absolutely love them! Wonderful quality, the case makes it super easy to transport and keep everything organized. You have a brush for everything you need, foundation, eyeliner, eye shadow, blending, you name it. Highly recommend to anyone who works in the beauty or fashion industry, or anyone who just wants good brushes. They make makeup so much easier to apply, and make it look flawless and well shaded. The brushes don&#x27;t shed and are easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t actually have any brushes and never used them before, I really saw the diference it made when I applied my make up.  I used it for my bronzer, power, and also my eyeshadows and it blends it perfecly well on my face! There are many different kinds and I love it! The smell is not that bad, but it has some smell when you open it!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. They are so professional. I love to show them off. Everyone thinks they are professional. I love them!!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them but them seem very good. Can&#x27;t wait&lt;br /&gt;Til I get to use all of them</li>
    <li> I like having a wide variety of brushes to chose from, especially when working with eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had two minor complaints:&lt;br /&gt;1) I am used to having labels on my brush indicating what they are meant for. These are not labeled.&lt;br /&gt;2) A few of the brushes had a few loose hairs sticking out at funny angles, but trimming them down was only a mild inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad set for a novice/casual makeup user like me.</li>
    <li> I looked the brushes up because they had all the brushes I wanted to try out. They came in this really cute leather case which I do recommend.  That seems to be the best part of the product the brushes were just the bad part. When ever I buy new brushes I wash them almost immediately. These brushes automatically started to shed as I was washing. I hadn&#x27;t even used them yet. The next thing I found was that they were falling apart after being cleaned. The handle would come apart from the metal piece holding the brush. That was happening as I was using the brushes the first time I used it to put my makeup on. That was terrible. They didn&#x27;t even make it one use. I do have to say I guess thats what happens when I dont just get the good brushes for a little more.</li>
    <li> I order the makeup kit for my neice. For the price this item is great,much better than what i was expecting .</li>
    <li> It arrived on time &amp; Exactly how it is shown on picture. But the brushes were kinda smushed. Its a good product for less. I&#x27;ll recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the price and was REALLY surprised with the quality of these! I am by no means a professional makeup artist. I like to dabble with makeup, these brushes are soft and have a WIDE variety for all those different techniques that you see in magizines and videos. The case makes it easy to keep things organized and protected. I for see using these for a long time as they are just a good quality as the ones you see in stores</li>
    <li> This set is cool cause u have every style of brush to eye and lip. It even come with mascara brushes. It does the job for me!!</li>
    <li> The brushes  are soft and way way way better quality than the price you pay for them. The bag smells a little but who really is putting their face to the bag? It&#x27;s probably just from packaging. And be sure to wash the brushes before use! but they are wonderful.</li>
    <li> The bristles fall out, and I don&#x27;t mean one by one, they come out in large chunks. Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and not to mention a very good price plus they came in a convenient carrying case!! Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> The set is good for its price but from the brushes that I have used, they are a bit hard when I use them on my face. A couple of the brushes have been shedding too but otherwise in good condition.</li>
    <li> The eye brushes are awesome for the price but all the face brushes and the blending eye brush shed WAYYYYYY too much.</li>
    <li> i recomend this product, there are good and is working perfect with make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the price is the best.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> This was also for my 13 year old grand girl who want to learn the profession of cosmetology</li>
    <li> The brushes and packaging look nice but smell horrible. I don&#x27;t know how this is packaged but something would need to be done about the strong, chemical like scent before I by anything else from them.</li>
    <li> Not all the brushes are soft. But all the eye brushes are soft. Those are the only ones I use but I love the brushes. I&#x27;m big into makeup and these are brushes you probably would want to start off with if your beginning into the makeup world. Instead of spending 12$ per brush at the makeup store. These are good brushes and I use mine everyday.</li>
    <li> They were nice for the first couple of days until they start falling apart. But they were pretty cheap so I guess I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I Got these a couple weeks ago and I honestly really love them !!</li>
    <li> One of the pieces broke immediately....so thats a bummer. Also the pouch it comes in smells strongly like paint thinner that I had to throw it out. Was afraid to be around it. Brushes are decent quality though.</li>
    <li> These are great and good quality. I love all the different brushes and the price was great too.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. As described. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great price but cheap</li>
    <li> Just like all the reviews said u get what u paid for half of them are soft and good quality the other half are rough and stiff it did come smelling like paint and one of my brushes was broken  but what do u expect for the price u still can use them</li>
    <li> I got the brushes the day that they were supposed to arrive so that was good... There was a couple problems with my order because my set was missing 3 brushes and the brushes are not very thick they are pretty thin but the eyeshadow brushes are very soft but the face brushes are kind of rough in the black 32 peice set. I also have the pink 8 peice set which has brushes that are a lot softer. Over all I am pretty pleased so far but there was only a few issues But for the price t is really worth it</li>
    <li> Hi, these cosmetic brushes rock! thank you. The only thing  that I regret, is that I received them a little bit late.</li>
    <li> Hair of brush is so soft that means it&#x27;s easy to use it for your male up. I liked it.</li>
    <li> Very good price and good product. So soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> When I read other reviews, I was surprised so many people commented on a smell...then I opened the package and wow - it&#x27;s strong!  I let them air out in an open window, then washed the brushes, and overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.  They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; - at least not yet, and they do a reasonable job.  It&#x27;s not a $30.00 per brush set - it&#x27;s a dollar per brush set...so if you keep your expectations realistic, you&#x27;ll be pleased with your purchase.</li>
    <li> Well, the smell was a bit plastic-like and a couple of the brushes were hard &amp; stuck together... BUT, they seem to be pretty good quality for the price, and the case is actually really nice quality as well. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use the heck out of these guys.</li>
    <li> These are good quality brushes for the price but to be honest the 32 pieces became kind of cumbersome because it took up so much space on my vanity</li>
    <li> So this is the second time I ordered these brushes with this description. I should have paid more attention and ordered from the same seller.  These were sold by  Galaxion, my first order was from digital_family. The brushes that Galaxion sold were not the same as the images. They are black bristled with stray stands and some of the tops came off of the wand. I had placed a reorder from my order at digital_family (see past review) but obviously did not order again with them (my mistake). These were as an overall backup set so I did not bother with making a return or anything. too much of a hassle for something I wont use that often.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not super fabulous high quality brushes, but there&#x27;s a bajillion of them in the case and they&#x27;re good for the non-professional makeup user. There is a smell as some reviewers have noticed. I thought it was the brushes themselves, but it&#x27;s actually the faux-leather case they&#x27;re in. It stinks! Take them all out, put them somewhere safe, and either toss the case or let it air out for a couple days in a bright sunny place.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE!! Average 5 hairs fall off every time you pick them up.... Get what you pay for</li>
    <li> These brushes are cheap, cheap, cheap!! Save yourself the money and invest in better brushes. They smell, they are not soft and they begin falling apart as soon as I used them. I can&#x27;t even imagine trying to wash them!</li>
    <li> I gave 3 stars because brushes and case smelt really bad and the brushes had a white powder coming out of them...weird I had to clean and sterilize them.</li>
    <li> It was a pretty good deal. Brushes shed a bit nothing I can&#x27;t handle. The shipping was great it came like in 2 days.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for the price not really expecting much but I was happily mistaken.  These brushes are very well made and every brush you&#x27;ll ever need to do any type of make up you want the price now is just the bonus.  I sent this link to my niece who is a make-up artist and she loved the prince and I can&#x27;t wait until she actually gets the brushes as I know she will love those too. Definitely a good buy and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the abundance of brushes and the variety. Although the do shed bristles when your first start to use them, they get better and are worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> honestly i was excited to receive this and shipping was on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;although they are true to description i have to say am a little disappointed on how some felt they were a bit rough and hurt my cheek so i guess you pay what u get i do still use them and they aren&#x27;t all to bad seems like its just the bigger ones but over all i think they are okay</li>
    <li> I bought this brushes to build up my collection and I absolutely hate the face brushes they are just horrible and harsh it doesn&#x27;t even apply the makeup on any way! Also there&#x27;s a lot of liner brushes which to me is useless like why would you want 5 liner brushes or more! I really have no complains on the shadow brushes as of yet but I would not recommend this garbage to anyone</li>
    <li> Average brushes, but they shed a lot and they smelled so bad before I washed them</li>
    <li> this are my Christmas gift &amp;&amp; I Lovit!&lt;br /&gt;and thr shipping are to fast ..</li>
    <li> Rough and irritating on the skin.</li>
    <li> This item is so so. I have one brush with glue or something all over the bristles making it unusable and another with a broken handle. The other brushes seem fine.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money didn&#x27;t even have the main brushes I need for my eyes. That&#x27;s what I get for not buying the expensive products. lesson learned</li>
    <li> The brushes are amazing quality. 100% perfect</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t soft and pliable. I much prefer ELF for the money.</li>
    <li> Not feeling these brushes at all. The hair comes out a lot in them. Not a good choice of brushes.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast. The smaller brushes meant for eyeliner are horrible..not well made stray bristles made them hard to use😔</li>
    <li> Well i paid little for this item i did not expect to get like fancy mac brushes but it does they job the bristles fall out a little bit but its does they job its nice for the prize.</li>
    <li> not sure what people say about the smell but when I open the there is no smell when I gave it to my mom on Christmas there is no smell absolutely love them would not believe the quality of these brushes</li>
    <li> Good price for 32 brushes. Some of the bigger brushes shed just a little. The smaller brushes are amazing and very soft. When you open the package it may had a bad scent to it &amp; wash brushes before use.</li>
    <li> high ratio the price quality, soft, natural pile, a cover from pseudo-skin, not from skin, but a cover convenient.brushes are perfectly cleared</li>
    <li> These brushes FELL apart very easily. I received broken brushes before I even opened the product. The hairs on them fell out of the brushes.</li>
    <li> the actual brush tip isn&#x27;t made of good quality tips they all look like the tips of a cheap paint brush tips</li>
    <li> Not sure what other&#x27;s experience is with this, but I love this product. All the brushes are soft. I am a MAC fan myself, and purchased mac brushes for a lot of money. These are great! No smell from these brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes shed a lot, horrible quality.</li>
    <li> Such a good price for the product. Just air the package out when you receive brushes. Very happy with quality of brushes.</li>
    <li> The fist thing I noticed when I opened the packaging was the smell, which by looking at the price of the brushes was expected. If you hate the smell of industrial adhesive , you may not want to buy these, the smell was very hard to remove. The brushes in this kit are more diverse than anticipated. I was expecting all flat brushes, this kit has a few liner and lip brushes, a pencil brush and a flat top blending brush. I would recommend washing them before use as they most likely have manufacturing chemical that will irritate your skin. The large fan brush shed like crazy the first five or six times I&#x27;ve used it. The same goes for most of the reddish colored brushes. The shedding did stop after a while. All of the brushes are very soft.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set. Lots of different brushes to get the job done. The brushes are holding up, not falling apart so far. The wrap case is light but durable.</li>
    <li> i purchased this for my friend who is a great fan of makeup and she just couldnt thank me enough for her brush set.</li>
    <li> It is just wonderful. Even more beautiful and useful I though when I first thought of getting it. I am very glad with it. Looks also very professional.</li>
    <li> Many of the brushes seem the same I didn&#x27;t not receive an array of brushes In my opinion especially since I am learning a lot if techniques. The Brushes Are Not As Soft As I Would Want them Be, Which I Think Has an impact on my application .</li>
    <li> When I purchases the brushes, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect them to be all that great.  Since they were such a low price, I figured I could give them a try and if they weren&#x27;t good, I wasn&#x27;t out much money.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and would tell anyone to purchase them.  Actually, I&#x27;ve already sent the link to a number of people in case they were looking to buy any.</li>
    <li> I received this item fairly quickly. For the price, a 32 piece brush set is an amazing deal. I am an esthetician so i am constantly using brushes and i really like these. There is a brush for everything. I actually used this brush set today for the first time and the first person who saw me said that my makeup looks great today, its because of these brushes!</li>
    <li> Being that I have worked with high quality brushes, I think these brushes are good for beginners . I personally bought this set for my professional makeup kit until I am able to upgrade to better . They don&#x27;t really hold the product to well when dealing with eyeshadow but it gets you by .</li>
    <li> They are nice. They did have a small when I opened them but I keep open for a few hours. Haven&#x27;t cleaned them yet so idk if they will fall apart.</li>
    <li> I gave it one star because I do use one or two of them but the others I don&#x27;t use because they are thin like paint brushes. Buy if you need paint brushes. Lol</li>
    <li> The brushes stink even after being washed. They shed like crazy and hurt your skin. Sorry but it&#x27;s true.  Bad quality even for the price.</li>
    <li> I just got the brushes and once i opened the package the smell of paint was so strong. I read some reviews before buying and most people said that they would recommend these brushes also that the brushes are soft. To me the brushes were very rough. And the I was expecting something better.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes for the one reason.  You have ALL the brushes that you&#x27;ll need for every part of your face. Its a wonderful set and it comes in so nicely wrapped. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this brush set. I use my brushes all the time and they are very important to me. When you have the proper brushes, your makeup goes on a lot smoother then trying to put it on with your fingers.</li>
    <li> these were only 25.00 they arent going to last forever. i bought them for my daughters and they work great. had them for months now. not bad for a cheaper set.</li>
    <li> This set of brushes is very nice , it bought it  for my daughter &amp; she likes the set so much , &amp; the price is very convenient for the quality of the brushes.</li>
    <li> The bristles starting coming out of the brushes. That is what happens when you try to be cheap. It is better to go for quality instead of cost.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with all of the eye brushes but the wool like face brushes were very hard to blend product with and some of the brush fell apart when using it. Over all the 32 brush set was worth buying for all of the eye/concealer brushes</li>
    <li> My bigger brushes were smooshed when I received this. They won&#x27;t go back into shape either. And lots of hair loss</li>
    <li> love them.. order was pretty fast too.!</li>
    <li> I am actually very pleased with my order the only things that were bad about this kit was the smell it smelled horribly when I opened the package and I had to air it out and spray perfume on the case and brushes at one point I had to take it outside because my whole room began to smell nasty. Also the bigger brushes shed ALOT I lightly tugged at the bristles and they began to come out in bunches but if you are a beginner I would definitely recommend this and the shipping was relatively fast too.</li>
    <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as I had expected, just a little when I open it. The shedding is pretty bad on the larger brushes that I had gotten and I&#x27;m not that pleased with the texture of any of the brushes especially the smaller ones. This just wasn&#x27;t at all what I had expected. They look nice initially but I don&#x27;t know if this shedding will stop. If it did I&#x27;d be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these brushes. Very poor quality. The bristles are stiff and will not blend your makeup well.</li>
    <li> Very nice easy use great product</li>
    <li> thanks for everything! I loved!</li>
    <li> The hair on the brushes fall off ! All the time , like when your applying your make up , in times you get the hair on your face .</li>
    <li> Pros: All of the brushes are there, good variety, came suuuuuper fast (ordered on the 18th and got it on the 24th so pretty much 5 days because there was a sunday in there), soft brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: customer service didnt answer me when I asked why there was no tracking info, some brushes shed (but some dont, its more of the bigger ones that do), and it smelled kind of bad of a chemical type smell but that went away, I just aired them out outside for a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s good and bad but all in all I&#x27;m happy. These brushes are more for beginners however, just to practice with. Like myself. I usually use my finger or the brushes makeups come with.</li>
    <li> The brushes started falling apart the first time i used them the hairs on the end fall out in chunks . I know it was on the cheaper side but i expected to be able to use them a few times before they started falling apart.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good for starters, I&#x27;d definitely let my little sisters use these instead of my more high end brushes lol</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged. Many amazing brush</li>
    <li> Excellent gift for cosmetology students. Every brush they could possibly need, but still inexpensive</li>
    <li> I ordered this amazing set and I have to say for the first ordering off amazon, I&#x27;m a happy customer. Not only did it come in one day also all the brushes look like the picture. Everything new and it was a great deal. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more things</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why these brushes were made at all.The manufacturers should have cut down on the quantity of brushes to offer better quality..This is absolutely ridiculous. All I&#x27;m asking is WHY? WHY are they so rough its like using steel wool on ur skin, then u have to have a tweezer on hand to pluck off the loose hairs from the brushes off ur skin, then u have to reapply makeup, then use the tweezer...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. .ANNOYING NUISANCE</li>
    <li> The smaller brushes are great! But my bigger brushes shed A LOT!!! other than that they are a great set for the price!</li>
    <li> I have a love hate relationship with this brush set. Here are my pros and cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* affordable, affordable, affordable&lt;br /&gt;* has all the sizes you will ever need for daily makeup usage and nice make up for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;* the case keeps all the brushes in place and ready for you to pick up and use&lt;br /&gt;* wash and dry easily but some shed and others don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;* Yes, the case does have a scent. I kept  case open and let it air out. Ive  had set a little over a month...no scent  now.&lt;br /&gt;* SHEDDING...oh boy, ok here it goes...ladies these brushes shed. At the beginning I thought it was just at first use. However, it kept happening. Now, if picking threads off your face most times than not doesn&#x27;t bother you then  great. For me,I want to put my make up on and GO. However, not  all the  brushes shed, only the black tip ones. I have not had any issues with the  lighter tip ones at all.&lt;br /&gt;* I just washed the brushes and yes, they shed a bit. I&#x27;m hoping now the brushes are over the shedding issue. We shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love them but hate them too.</li>
    <li> Good brushes but I had one brush missing and one brush was broken. But the brushes are pretty good considering the price</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this and thought wow this is a great buy t even includes the case. Now he brushes I have are pretty cheap ones so I don&#x27;t have any fancy MAC ones to compare them too.  I did like the selection.  There are quite a few similar ones in the smaller brushes which was great for me!  I loved the fact the biggest ones even came with guards though it would have been nice if they included the same for the medium ones too.  What I was daissapointed in was the softness.  They were rather stiff and bristlely though a few felt softer.  You definitely know their synthetic.  The case did have a strong oderk but left open to air it wore off.  Great starter kit but for a beauty guru get something else.</li>
    <li> the brushes are nice and they are a lot but the quality is kind of meh. there are hairs that are sticking out longer than they should and they are a bit loose where the wood meets the edge. other than that they are pretty good. i love the holder.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!! seem to be very high quality(time will tell) I washed these prior to use and am very happy with how they turned out. have used for only about 1 week so far and LOVE them!</li>
    <li> Dont buy this. It&#x27;s a waste of money. the brushes are like made of straw. that&#x27;s just unacceptable. Poor quality</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes and I did like that I received them quickly. What I did not like is that they broke easily. The first or second time using some of these brushes, the top that holds the brissels came off! I wasn&#x27;t putting much pressure on them but now most of them are loose and ready to come off. I haven&#x27;t been using them as of lately. It was a waste of my money and I wish I had returned before March to get a refund.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. I like the variety as well as the travelling case. My brushes initially had a scent but disappeared overnight. Most f the brushes don&#x27;t shed but those that do usually stops after washing and reshaping. This is reserved for my clients so I will be buying another for myself.</li>
    <li> Just got mine it took 1 day to get here , beautiful brushes and love them ! They do have that paint smell but other than that love them 💛</li>
    <li> Gave them away. The hairs were coming off. The product is cheap.</li>
    <li> I got really concerned when these brushes were so cheap but the are actually really nice quality. There were two brushes that came in not very good quality. One was broken and the other just wasn&#x27;t good quality. There good brushes though...</li>
    <li> Brushes were more coarse then I had originally thought.</li>
    <li> Brushes shred a lot !</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes are the same was missing to brushes</li>
    <li> never buy these, they are awful. the brush fibers fall out instantly, and it doesn&#x27;t stop. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> GREAT .... BUT SOMEHOW THE BRUSHY ONES STRANS COME OFF 😢😣😩 OTHER THAN THAT COOL LOVE IT 😍</li>
    <li> After reading reviewes i was nervous bout getting them...but very happy i did..they are great...the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as people are saying...doesn&#x27;t last long...just let it breathe..doesn&#x27;t shed ... Awesome brushes</li>
    <li> These are seriously good quality. I have no regrets.</li>
    <li> The handle fell off of the fat brush but overall my girl said they&#x27;re some good brushes and she likes them</li>
    <li> Love it... fast delivery...</li>
    <li> 3/4 of the brushes in the set are great- the larger brushes have bristles that are different than the smaller and they fall out much more than new brushes usually do- I am returning them</li>
    <li> The smaller brushes are good but theire mostly repeated with slight variations in hight, the big brushes are not made from the same material as the smaller ones [the bristles] they have a terrible shedding problem and are not soft</li>
    <li> GREAT SOLID BRUSHES , THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE WRAP HAD A FUNNY SMELL BUT BESIDES THAT THOSE BRUSHES ARE GOOD AND CAME IN A WRAP THAT MAKES IT LOOK FANCY</li>
    <li> Weakness:&lt;br /&gt;Low quality product&lt;br /&gt;Indicated only for non professional users&lt;br /&gt;The bristles don&#x27;t have a good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strength:&lt;br /&gt;Good cost benefit</li>
    <li> Very happy with set it had everything I needed to do my makeup and the brushs felt great well worth the money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not worth buying it. The brushes doesn&#x27;t go with liquid  foundation and I don&#x27;t like how the hair comes off when you put the brush on your face. It&#x27;s not too soft like baby skin.</li>
    <li> Yes, consider the price. You should have realistic expectations when you are buying this product. All the large brushes a pretty much useless, I use them for arts and crafts. The rest is actually pretty discent.</li>
    <li> Love the Brushes.it gots everything I need..arrived sooner than expected..They Great Love The New Scent....In Love With It!!! Can&#x27;t wait to start using them</li>
    <li> so many brushes to choose from!</li>
    <li> Highly suggest them, great quality and the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a total waste of money, I brought them based on customer reviews and boy am I sorry, if I wasn&#x27;t living in the Caribbean I would&#x27;ve sent them right back, as it is I&#x27;m not willing to spend any more money on these, the vinyl case smells toxic so it has to be opened in a ventilated area, and the bristles on the brushes are uneven, so I&#x27;m going to,have to sit down with a scissors and trim them. Should&#x27;ve spent the extra and get something better. The brush on the left end I think is supposed to be a highlighter brush, it scrawny and the fourth from left is supposed to be a lipstick brush I think, it&#x27;s even worse.</li>
    <li> I Love the brushes they dont have any fallout they arrived on time, the case smelled alittle but just left then out so they can air out and the next day the smell was gone good buy</li>
    <li> I love doing my makeup with these!! They are so nice. Shipped quickly, none of the bristles were messed up. They&#x27;re awesome</li>
    <li> Brushes suck but for the price not to bad but even elf brushes are better... It did have a slight odor upon arrival went away though..</li>
    <li> The price is great the brushes are great but the bigger brushes start to shed a lot of hair and leaves it all over my face , and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I love it !!! They&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> Love it! Haven&#x27;t used them all yet but the few I have give me that professional look! Love💕</li>
    <li> I am not super into make up but I wanted a cheap set so that I could at least manage basic looks and this set is awesome. Way more than I&#x27;ll use but at least now I&#x27;ll have everything I need for any project! Super cheap not bad quality.</li>
    <li> Great brush set foe makeup artist!</li>
    <li> One or two of the brushes came broken but other than that they work great.</li>
    <li> Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing! I think that this would be a really smart buy for anyone who craves really dramatic lashes but either can’t wear false lashes, or don’t have the time to apply falsies in their daily routine.

    <li> air out the roller bag on the 1st day -- burshes are HIGH QUALITY AND AMAZING...</li>
    <li> These are beautiful makeup brushes. The price is fantastic. I was amazed at the number of different brushes. You can&#x27;t beat this price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> these are ok dont regret buying</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes, I haven&#x27;t had time to use them yet. First impression, besides the smell when first opened, I was very impressed with the selection, especially for the price. I&#x27;m hoping that they don&#x27;t shed very easy as other reviewers are saying. I&#x27;ll update after I give them a try!</li>
    <li> its good, great brushes. just there&#x27;s a high scent.</li>
    <li> On time prime delivery, brushes are softer than I thought but still good quality</li>
    <li> The bristles are a little rough and scratchy. When washing them for the first time before use there was a LOT of shedding, but for the most part these brushes do their jobs. They have great coverage and pigment pick up. Still giving them a real test but so far I like them.</li>
    <li> Smelled of paint and the bristles fell out. Returned for my money back. Very bad product.</li>
    <li> Just got these brushes. Came way earlier than I thought they would and they&#x27;re amazing. There is a smell to the bag but I wouldn&#x27;t blame the company because it&#x27;s over 100 degrees where I live and so in a mailbox it probably brought out the smell of them. Anyway I love these brushes they&#x27;re so soft and great quality for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> love it i is the same as i saw it online . perfect  i really love it</li>
    <li> I am in love with this purchase. The brushes are very good quality for their price and you get so many brushes. I have all the brushes I need now and once they get old, I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Bought it a while ago and it still has bristles coming off. :/ But I do love the pouch it came in. Lol</li>
    <li> other than the minimal brush loss, there are plenty of selections (:</li>
    <li> My niece loved her brush set. Worth it for the price and for first time set.</li>
    <li> It came with everything as displayed. Packaged nicely also. I did experience some minor shedding when using some of the brushes. But I can&#x27;t complain due to the price and the quantity you receive. I would say its a good deal.</li>
    <li> These brushes are okay. The small brushes ,like the concealer brush, work pretty well. The fluffy brushes that you can use to blend your makeup are rough and they shedd pretty bad. I knew they would shedd, but not as bad as I thought they would. The brushes were cheap, so you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for over a year and I use them on a daily basis. There is some fall out, especially the brushes with darker bristles but after a few washes there&#x27;s barely any fall out. There is a great variety of brushes and I think for the rice the quality is pretty good.</li>
    <li> the brushes are really rough and they fall apart pretty fast. it was cheep but you get what you pay for with this.</li>
    <li> These are mediocre brushes. I understand that they didn&#x27;t cost near the amount higher end brushes would; however, I am still disappointed.</li>
    <li> Quality is really good and price is cheap! So nice</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! Item was in great condition when I received it!</li>
    <li> I use them every single day I love them!</li>
    <li> I read through the reviews prior to purchasing, and the smell everyone is commenting about only lasted for a day or so after removing the packaging. It was no big deal at all! This was a good value for the price. Among washing and cleaning the brushes, several bristles came out the bigger fuller brushes but it didn&#x27;t leave them bald. I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase, we&#x27;ll see how long they last but I estimate i will probably replace the ones I get most use out of after a year.</li>
    <li> I love this set so much it is great and the brushes have lasted through so much I defiantly recommend this set</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst brush set I have ever ordered! All the brushs are poorly made they shed and are very ruff and itchy. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty good for the price. The larger brushes shed really badly though. Id rather spend a little extra for everything to be a great quality. But the smaller brushes are decent! Also, it sucks that it doesn&#x27;t tell you an exact description for what each brush is used for! Anyways, I would recommend these for people with low budgets or beginners.</li>
    <li> There worth your money. I love it the brushes are so soft and the shipping  was really fast.</li>
    <li> These brushes were not the quality material I was expecting.  I tried using the eye brushes with simple make-up and I had the biggest problem with getting any product on them.  This product would be great for a teenager or a beginner, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone planning a career in cosmetology.</li>
    <li> It does have a weird smell but they are great for starters.Everything you need and more! The handles have a matte black finish which makes them look expensive. I have Sigma but you can never have to many brushes these are great back-up brushes</li>
    <li> I love them, the brushes are soft and very gentle on your skin. After cleaning them some bristles fall out but very little in my case and I did have to groom some of the brushes because of some bristles sticking out. But nothing out of the norm. There&#x27;s a brush for your every need practically. Very nice! The smell of the case is a bit strong after you first open it but it airs out pretty fast. And it ships fast as well, so that&#x27;s also a plus. :)</li>
    <li> These are pretty good do far. I just recieved them today and there in fact were 32 brushes. No shedding and very soft on my skin. There was a foul smell coming from them, but I planned to wash before use anyway.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t reccomend this set to anyone. The bristles scratch you and its made out of cheap material.</li>
    <li> They are made very cheap I&#x27;m very dissapionted . They were listed under Mac . Nothing like Mac brushes!!!!!!</li>
    <li> shipped fast and received as described!</li>
    <li> This is a nice set, I like it, I just wish the brushes were labeled like total face brush, blush brush, etc.</li>
    <li> Very satisfying brush set</li>
    <li> These brushes worked well after a couple of days, then they really hurt my face. Also the bristles on the brushes got out of place. I think I&#x27;m going to throw most of them away.</li>
    <li> Great value for the cost. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Pretty good deal for the money but I don&#x27;t use them much because they fall apart easily.</li>
    <li> The bristles are falling out but I can&#x27;t get past the smell...</li>
    <li> Love the selection of brushes! Excellent price. Wish they were labeled though, because I have no idea what each brush is for.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter to go with a makeup case I got her.  She loves them and they seem to be of good enough quality especially for a 12yr old girl.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews and seeing mixed reaction to this set, I decided that I would go ahead and try these. There are a lot of complaints about the smell. Yes, they do have a smell but that will air out and disappear quickly. I have no problems with shedding at all with these brushes. There are a good variety of similar brushes in this set but different sizes, which I like. Some are natural and some of them are synthetic, which I actually prefer the synthetic brushes, myself. Before you buy this, consider that these are not professional brushes. So if you are looking for a nice sized (there are a lot of brushes in this set) beginners set for a good bargain, then this may be a good buy for you. But don&#x27;t expect a Mac quality for a cheap price in this set. Overall I think this is a really nice set for this price.</li>
    <li> I really really love them! they are perfect!! Im so glad with this purchase</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the set yet which is why I gave it four stars. However, I got one for my sister and she loves it.</li>
    <li> awesome!! Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I Love the different textures and styles of brushes. Worth the price. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes have been nothing but great! The variety is awesome. The only suggestion I have is including an explanatory summary over each brushes functionality and proper usage. I am not familiar with all the brushes, so I think I would get more out of an assisting statement.</li>
    <li> Some if the brush come out too easy things fall out of the brush itself but other than that great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mostly good experiences with this set. I&#x27;ve had one break on me though which was very disappointing. Lucky I have plenty of other brushes to choose from.</li>
    <li> Very Good. worth for money</li>
    <li> I was looking for some good price but also good quality ...&lt;br /&gt;They do have a strong smell when they first arrive and they do shed a lot but after a few washes they work&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly fine I am happy with my choice ...&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes</li>
    <li> Smelt of an oder, gasoline type, eventually faded. A few heads fell off. However for the price, I wasn&#x27;t upset.</li>
    <li> relying on her she said put all stars she loves--but she also like bieber soooooo take her advice for what you will</li>
    <li> I love my makeup brushes and can&#x27;t believe I even contemplated not ordering them. They do have a new plastic smell to them, but I just removed all the plastic and let the brushes sit out for a day or so. I am very happy with these brushes and will refer them to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I love it it comes with a little smells like new but then it goes away after a few days</li>
    <li> They are not very good at blending, and they are kinda scratchy. They&#x27;re very cheaply made.  Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gonna say that I liked the product since I didn&#x27;t expect too much, I knew what I was getting, obviously they&#x27;re cheap brushes, so you&#x27;re not going to receive high quality and super soft brushes, but I believe if your not delicate or picky, these brushes are for you, in my opinion the small brushes works great and you receive like 20 different small brushes, they work fine when you apply your eye shadows, etc. but I&#x27;m not giving them five stars since I really hated the big brushes, I believe you receive like 10 of them or less,well I didn&#x27;t like it, since they&#x27;re synthetic fiber, it feels rough on your skin, so I don&#x27;t used them anymore because when you are applying your foundation or blush the hair sparse and falls out.</li>
    <li> Small brushes were fine but I expected the bigger brushes to be a better quality.</li>
    <li> When I use the brushes the all the bristles come off. not a very good item and not very happy.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the 32 pieces, in fact I received 18 pieces + the bag. The brushes I did receive did not look like the ones in the photo- they all look the same and are all black. My bag does smell like paint when held near my face, and it was not a tie up bag like pictured but one with a button (preferred but not what was technically ordered) and also has GAGA on the front of bag and brushes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are very soft however, and you get a lot for a good price. I have not tried washing them yet. The face ones do come with protective slip covers along with the fact they came brand new and plastic wrapped.</li>
    <li> Hair falls out of brushes, spend a little more and get brushes you can actually use, waste of money</li>
    <li> Works very well, I have no complaints for this product.</li>
    <li> The brushes are all very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and they get the job done so I was very pleased at first. However after about a week the handles started to become loose on some brushes and a couple even came off. A bit annoying but it can be fixed easily with a hot glue gun</li>
    <li> Brushes are very bad . Dont recommend them at all</li>
    <li> Honestly I havent really used all my brushes in this set but the brushes are steardy and they do work for the purpose I use them for. I would definately recommend these brushes.  I am hesitant to buy online because i like to see and feel what I am buying but honestly this was a good buy for me going in blindsided.</li>
    <li> The hairs from there brushes falls out a lot</li>
    <li> when i got the package, it was wrapped very nice. very safe and secure. The brushes did have a mild paint smell to them but it went away very quickly. I have a brush for everything now :)&lt;br /&gt;i love them :)</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for a friend, I almost kept them for myself. They were really great quality, although I can&#x27;t comment much on whether they shed or not...</li>
    <li> one for everything,i love them. I just wish they would have came in a pouch. they are very nice set.</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t as thick as higher end ones that I own but that is to be expected - especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I loved this set its great for the price it its a good beginer set i recommend it 100%! Thanks</li>
    <li> The hairs come off on my face, and are a little rough. Lots of brushes, but low quality. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Cheap cheap s***  why are they selling this on here</li>
    <li> I love these make up brushes all the brushes were different no duplicates. Had a strong smell like some cleaning agent or something. It has a little shedding but overall good brushes. And packaging is great.</li>
    <li> Very bad quality, first time usining it bristles were falling off very quickly. Unsatisfied but I guess that is why the price was low</li>
    <li> These brushes are so GREAT!!</li>
    <li> Super .. just love them i just didn&#x27;t really like the powder brush its not soft at all but the rest of the brushes are ★★★★</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money.  The brushed are too stiff.  Lots of the hair falls out.  I really don&#x27;t even like any one single brush.</li>
    <li> The brushes are fine.. I did wash them before I used them  I had no shedding at all I guess really the only thing that bothers me is the phony M* A* C symbol on the brushes and case .. the quality is amazing for the price. I just would have rather had blank brushes than to have forged company logos on my nameless brush set</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend these brushes to anyone!!!!  I am a part time make-up artist for stage performers....and I love them!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are as that already on the photos. They weren&#x27;t the best, buy they weren&#x27;t entirely bad. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s SUCK! Don&#x27;t believe on the other comments if you don&#x27;t want to be disappointed like me!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with these brushes. I first used the face brushes and had to completely remove all the makeup I tried to apply with the brushes off my face because LOTS of the hairs came out on my face with use. I then tried to clean them with professional brush cleaner to see if that would make a difference and it did not. I can only use some of the eye brushes now because the face brushes are so messed up and are terrible quality. The eye brushes are okay, but nothing special. Again, very disappointed and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> im pleased. i didnt see any shedding like everyone said. but im satisfied.</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful and are very high quality! I love them. My only issue is that when taken out of the bag it comes in, it smells like house paint sadly</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the smell of the shipment an I honestly prepared myself for that and I didn&#x27;t care. I mean come on ladies 32 brushes for 13.50 plus FREE shipping!!! That&#x27;s awesome. I don&#x27;t know why people complain about that you can just wash it and it would smell good (what I did) the brushes are soft and if they come hard I recommend soaking them in water then letting them air dry so it can become less crispy. Any ways I love this! Can&#x27;t wait to use them more</li>
    <li> The brush hair comes off easily.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous brush set! I love them! So much to choose from!</li>
    <li> I cherish these brush....my friends love these brushes i have no problem with it</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Came right on time &amp;&amp; the packaging was amazing. But the end of the brushes or NOT red just black but they are perfect! Get them definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Okay DO NOT waste your money on these brushes! there s*** they shed like crazy &amp; are not soft at all save your money &amp; get different brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I&#x27;m very impressed and pleased with this purchase. It got delivered right on time. I love the black leather case it comes in, the matte black material. You&#x27;re also getting a lot for the price. It is just awesome. So yeah I highly recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> So this is a late review. These are not the best brushes I&#x27;ve used, but if you are just getting into makeup then they will work for you. I find that I have 2 of the same lip , liner and concealer brushes. There also isnt much variety in this kit, for instance there are no crease brushes or blending brushes. The brushes also seem to be very poorly manufactured.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, a few of the brushes came apart and some bristles fall out sometimes.</li>
    <li> All the brushes work fantastically, except for 1 or 2 brushes. When I washed them very few of the brushes lost hair but even then it wasn&#x27;t a lot. The case smells weird but if you air it out a day or two it should be fine.</li>
    <li> awesome product! great arrival time</li>
    <li> Wife loves her brush set. Uses them every day. Fast delivery. Highly recommend seller.</li>
    <li> All of them came as expected. For me being a beginner with makeup this was good. It helps get the job done. Always choose quality over quantity though. Some of the brushes (not all) are kind of hard and not soft like some of the ones I&#x27;ve felt before. Maybe it&#x27;s just me again I&#x27;m new to makeup and brushed.</li>
    <li> Brushes SMELL HORRIBLE when washed!!!!! Disgusting! Not good enough to use on clients!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my daughter.  There were plenty of them, but the quality was not there.  But they do the job if you&#x27;re not looking for professional grade brushes.</li>
    <li> I wish I could write a nice review, but I can&#x27;t. the tracking information says that it has been delivered. the thing is, I don&#x27;t have my package. I don&#x27;t know if it is the fault of usps, but all I know is that I don&#x27;t have my package</li>
    <li> I own 3 sets of those brushes....I just love them!!!!</li>
    <li> Large brushes are slightly rough</li>
    <li> This was a great buy! But wished it had more round brushes in it. Most of the brushes are flat</li>
    <li> Bought this because the price was good and the reviews seemed good but they came and not what I expected. But you get what you pay for. I&#x27;m more of a higher end brush person and these are similar to the e.l.f. Brushes, but they get they get the job done. Smell a bit too but aim the end they are okay.</li>
    <li> Great deal quantity wise, but unfortunately not quality...small brushes are so hard, and as the brushes get &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; the little hairs fall out. Get what you pay for. Fun for a little girl to make believe with. Case is nice, vinyl.</li>
    <li> Bought as christmas present. . She liked it</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a bigger powder brush to come with the set. Overall it is useful and the brushes seem well made. They pick up the make up well.</li>
    <li> I must say I didn&#x27;t like how my fan brushes got bent but then again I expected it to be but other than that the brushes are Amazing!!!! they are definitely everything I expected them to be! absolutely worth the buy! I was expecting to be disappointed but nope(:</li>
    <li> SUCH A GOOD DEAL. I got so tired of buying &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brushes just to have half the bristles fall off after the first few washes. I&#x27;ve had this set for about a week and so far after the first wash ( before I used them ) there has been no shedding. I&#x27;m surprised at how well they are made. I did have one of the handles fall off after the first wash, but I did find it on the floor so I&#x27;m guessing it was my cat, lol. Nothing a little glue can&#x27;t fix. Overall, 10/10 do recommend, and will purchase in the future. It&#x27;s a great start for someone who is just learning to play around with makeup, or the college student tired of paying $20 for one brush that will break.</li>
    <li> I am downgrading these brushes now that I have used them for a couple of months.  The large brushes are not soft at all - in fact a little scratchy and are matting up.  After using for about a month the large brushes have matted up.  I have just ordered the Shany Professional brush kit - and the reviews say they are super soft.  Orig review:  what great fun to have 32 makeup brushes - I am not a professional so I don&#x27;t know what each brush is for - I wish there was some kind of package insert identifying the brushes - the quality seems great to me and I&#x27;ll just experiment - don&#x27;t worry about the vinyl smell from the case - it dissipates rather quickly</li>
    <li> Good for what you pay for. Brushes are very soft, also some pretty good blending brushes included. A few of the handles have fallen out, they&#x27;re  just glued and stuck on.</li>
    <li> I love the smaller ones there AWESOMEE for the price it is definitely a great buy the bigger brushes on the other hand shed like no other first i started to apply my foundation and once i felt the irritating feeling of the foundation brushes bristles just falling all over my face i mean literally with every stroke of the brush there was one falling off so i just start softly not roughly pulling the loose ones off hoping it will help which it did no more bristles hanging from my skin lol so thats the only negative all 27 other peices where awesome and i would purchase again foundation brushes are usually best bought alone anyways&lt;br /&gt;So Basically Great Buy! Great appearance me and my friends love it! extremely soft theirs a brush in this set for EVERYTHING! so you just cant go wrong besides the big brushes lol</li>
    <li> not great but good brushes and great for the price, and a lot of them, i just love good deals. if ou look for soft none sheddi brashes its not what you want but itll work.</li>
    <li> Product was coming from far so shipping time lengthy&lt;br /&gt;I bought a &#x27;22pc professional cosmetic makeup brush set with pink bag pink&#x27; by same seller that I like better.</li>
    <li> This is my first time as an online shopper and the outcome of receiving these 32 Pc brushes is definitely worth it they don&#x27;t have any quality of feeling cheap and clean great !</li>
    <li> The workmanship is poor the brittles are falling out and they are not soft.  I am a profession beauty consultant an makeup artist.  This is not what I expected, but for the price, one had little to loose.</li>
    <li> they are not made very nicely but there are variations in the types of brushes. But are nice to have in a brush collection. some of the heads fell of but are easily re-attached and this is an okay product</li>
    <li> am in love with these brush&#x27;s there hair on the other side not so much they ten to fall out a bit and are a bit stiff but for the price you&#x27;er getting a great deal!</li>
    <li> these brushes are great for someone starting out &amp; getting a feel for what brushes they do &amp; don&#x27;t like or may want in there brush collection. brushes are good, don&#x27;t shed hair. Like all brushes or new products a little smell off them when they first arrive, but with all brushes i give them a little wash before use.</li>
    <li> I like the brushes. They were really good except for the fact that they didn&#x27;t have a blending brush. I would have also liked a stippling brush too. And after a week of using them the glue thing came off from the metal  and the stick. Which to me it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, i just super glued it back.</li>
    <li> Been using these Black Rod Makeup Cosmetic Brushes for approximately two weeks now. Great product. So many to styles of brushes, sizes of brushes, for so many numerous functions. Now there&#x27;s a proper brush for each function. My face, eyes, cheeks and lips all look great. A proper brush for every use!  They are great. :-)  I&#x27;ve read several comments regarding a smell when the package was opened, however, when I opened my leather case the smell was so minor I hardly even noticed it. GREAT PRODUCT. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Amazing beginner brush set for any girl who loves to do her makeup! Makes a wonder gift. There isn&#x27;t a string smell and they work well! Good buy!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Use them everyday.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very well priced, but they do have a weird chemical smell that never really goes away. I&#x27;ve washed them several times since I bought them and I still smell it when I use these brushes. It doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, but it takes some getting used to. Also these brushes shed a lot. I still use the eyeshadow brushes every day but for blush, bronzer, foundation and powder, I bought a different set that is much softer and blends better. It was more expensive than this one but this is a case of you get what you pay for. The eye brushes work great though and don&#x27;t shed, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth buying just for those.</li>
    <li> Loved them!! Good quality. Definitely buy</li>
    <li> I love love love the brushes . Just wish they were labeled</li>
    <li> I had no idea this was a MAC brush set. Pretty awsome! I was so happy when I opened it!</li>
    <li> Brushes were decent quality for the price. Would not repurchase, though.</li>
    <li> greate price, awesome product</li>
    <li> Brushes  shed hair on clients with every use. Some I was able to use the others that shed I trashed. I guess you get what pay for in this case.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves these, she wants them for all her friends.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a large brush-set to avoid my usual 1 or 2 brushes a month purchase.  These brushes are very soft, the only bad thing I can say about them is that they do shed, the worst shedding I experienced is with the large fan brush, the others seem to shed a lot less.  All in all for the money I&#x27;m pleased, great kit for a beginner MUA or makeup junkie like myself :)</li>
    <li> When I received my brush set I cleaned all of them like I am supposed to do.....the bristles fell out! I thought this would be normal since they were new so I waited till they were completely dry, took them out to use and again the bristles fell out! The brushes are horrible!!!! Don&#x27;t waist your money like I did! You truly do get what you pay for. If you want good makeup brushes your just gonna have to splurge a little......that&#x27;s just the way it is :-(</li>
    <li> These are greatfor the price. They do have a strong smell when arrived but I just aired them out for two days. I also washed them before using them because they do shed a little. For the price its a great starter kit and works.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive n works well. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> There were so many brushes for such a great price and they do the job that they are made for but they do have an odd smell and washing them does not get rid of it. I still think they are amazing and if you can ignore the chemically smell go ahead and buy them.</li>
    <li> I found that the fibers in some of the larger face brushes weren&#x27;t as soft as the fibers in the smaller brushes.  Despite such, the set comes equipped with a brush for most eye makeup needs.  I do wish that the set had more fluffy blending brushes but I enjoy using the brushes that did come in the set. I am also absolutely obsessed with the fan brush in this set.  It is absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> There were no labels on the brushes to know which one was which&lt;br /&gt;(luckily i know my brushes) , I was very disappointed in the &amp;#34;blending brush&amp;#34; I had to go buy a separate one at the beauty store &amp; the hairs fall out of the brushes&lt;br /&gt; i will NOT BUY  from this person again</li>
    <li> i purchased this and it didnt come in a case as shown, it was a cloth material. i only realized the difference when i purchased a second one for my friend. i find it very unfair to me the customer.</li>
    <li> These aree good brushes for the price. Dont expect super high quality brushes for 10-12$ These are good brushes if your looking for a beginer set or something to tie you over until you can afford a better set. They dont shed if your nice to them. Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I saw a decent amount of positive reviews and I kinda wanted more brushes.  Certain brushes in here are great!  Most of them are flat, so they&#x27;re not what I wanted.  And the ones that aren&#x27;t flat the bristles just fall out.  You look at it and they just start falling out.  But the flat brushes are great!</li>
    <li> Many of the brushes were duplicates of each other. There were probably 5 of each brush. Some of the brushes shed a lot. I only ever use the spoolie, large powder, and large fan brushes. These seem to be of the best quality of all the brushes. I don&#x27;t use any of the other brushes because they don&#x27;t pick up much product and they shed. I don&#x27;t know what the material the hairs are made of, but they are soft. I&#x27;m giving 2 stars for the brushes I mentioned earlier. I use these brushes everyday, but I do not recommend this product. I guess you just get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> love love love these brushes!! Did have a funny smell, duplicate smaller brushes but overall I&#x27;m very pleased with my brushes!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft. The brushes I received were not quite as pictured. The handles and bag are black, but my bristles are black/gray, not brown like in the picture. The smudge brush wasn&#x27;t as nice as the one I already had. the bristles looked like they were cut a little uneven... kind of like a little kid who tried to cut their own hair. (my current smudge brush is rounded nicely) I haven&#x27;t used many yet, but from just running a comb through them to check for loose hairs, they didn&#x27;t seem to shed. You can&#x27;t beat this many brushes for under $20.00. The fan brush is huge, but it will be nice for applying finishing powder all over. There was a mild smell to the bag as noted by other reviews, but it went away the next day. I think this is what I&#x27;ll be buying as gifts for all the women in my family for Christmas this year.</li>
    <li> I bought this set not that long ago and so far I am very impressed at the quality of the brushes. BUT I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE I DID NOT GET 32 BRUSHES I GOT 31! so please! seller! check and make sure everything is in it before you ship.&lt;br /&gt;overall i give this only 4 stars because of the missing brush but quality is great for a set of cheap brushes :)</li>
    <li> I like the ones for eyes. There are some that work really nice. Some others just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Me gustan las de ojos. tengo mis favoritas que son geniales. Otras más o menos.</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t labeled and since I&#x27;m not a make up brush expert I am still trying to figure out which brush does what. The brushes should have been labeled and that would have made the set perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought for my teen daughter.  Great set for her.</li>
    <li> i just got my 32 pack of makeup brushes and im really pleased with them, i got my order really quick and the quality of the brushes are awsome! the hairs in the brushes dont fall out. i have a brush i got from ulta and the brush hair fall out all over my face which is annoying so now i wont have that problem:)</li>
    <li> Lots of brushes, but the brushes shed. They distribute product well though. It was an ok purchase. Not sure that I&#x27;d buy makeup products from this seller again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are good I&#x27;m not a makeup person so I don&#x27;t know what they all are for so it would have been nice if they could have labeled them they are sturdy the only one I had to fix was the foundation brush the top came off the handle but super glue fixes it. I also suggest washing them with soap and water. It&#x27;ll make them smell nice an take some of the fallout out :) their good for the money the</li>
    <li> Gift she loves. There are so many brushes she will enjoy trying them all</li>
    <li> The girlfriend gives these 4 stars, says they are pretty good brushes and she likes them.</li>
    <li> Great item.good shipping</li>
    <li> The hair falls out worse brushes ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Brushes smell horrible. They really shed alot too. But there&#x27;s all the brushes you&#x27;ll need</li>
    <li> I love these, they are very soft but not too soft. I only wish that they said what kind of brush they are on them because 1/2 of them I have no idea.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with my purchase and plan to order another for a Xmas present</li>
    <li> cheap brushes. If you were hoping for Sephora type material you need to hunker down to dollar store. I had to return it. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money... the brushes are stiff and not good for applying any sort of makeup.You get what you paid for...</li>
    <li> Best bargain and good brushes</li>
    <li> When I first received my brushes, I fell in love with them and gave them a 5 star rating. They became my go-to brushes and i used them to apply my make up every day. Of course that came along with the need for them to be cleaned every day as well. With that being said, I think I take pretty good care of my brushes. While these brushes do get the job done very well, and are very good quality, with the exception of all the bigger ones, I was dissatisfied to notice that the paint of the brushes began peeling after just 2 months of having them. I also found that one of my eyeliner brushes broke of of its handle. Originally, I highly recommended these brushes to everyone that I knew, but I am now sorry that I did because they aren&#x27;t durable at all. So I am now in search of some new brushes.</li>
    <li> This set is great, it has every type of brush you need plus more. You can&#x27;t beat the price, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> Its not the best set of brushes but it gets the job done I guess.</li>
    <li> They were very poor quality.</li>
    <li> Very cheap,,, but then again I only paid like 10 bucks for em so it was expected .&lt;br /&gt; Some of the brushes are not bad at all but the main ones that I would have like to use are horrible!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I had to return these.</li>
    <li> This brush are ok but they are falling apart</li>
    <li> I like all the different sizes of brushes, but the brushes fall apart fast and there is no blending brush</li>
    <li> Kit is very nice. Leather pack with all brushes. Very very nice. My girl loves it. Recommend it to anyone that loves makeup etc.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I was very upset that two of the brushes were missing. They don&#x27;t work good.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just got my set in and absolutely love it.. Some brushes do shed a little,its not that bad but you do buy for what you get.Im not complaining.. When you open the package it has a smell of paint but its just the pouch that holds the brushes. All in all im enjoying this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell of the brush bag they came in.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes for multiple applications.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes especially for beginners exploring the routes of makeup, very soft, but the do have a strong plastic stench</li>
    <li> I like the product but was disappointed that the product shipped did not look like the image and the brushes have a smell. The smell goes away after washing and air drying. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Horrible cheap brushes</li>
    <li> Pretty good enough quality for the price! happy with my order doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like others claim, nicely packaged. Definitely recommend them</li>
    <li> The set is phenomenal for the price! The case and brushes smelled like paint thinner however, i took all of the brushes and washed them in a brush soak and put a few dryer sheets in the case and poped it in the dryer for 20 min... problem solved. A few of the bristles</li>
    <li> For the price really good! Brushes did shed a little and did have a weird smell at first but I just left it open and a couple of hours the smell went away. So overall really good product a lot of brushes to choose  from  and for the price totally worth it :]</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. They have a weird industrial smell to them and they shed all over your face but hey I&#x27;m still happy with em.</li>
    <li> The big brushes are a bit to soft but the smaller ones works perfectly</li>
    <li> Good brushes for a teen whose starting to be interested in make up but kinda low quality for a MU enthusiast...</li>
    <li> first off, the other reviews are right.  The face brushes are terrible and dont&#x27; stop shedding.  The thing about this product is that you honestly don&#x27;t know what kind of product you&#x27;ll get because some people have great result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This said, I had a wonderful experience because as a person who doesn&#x27;t use face makeup except eyes and lips, that didn&#x27;t matter at all to me.  The eyeshadow brushes are fabulous.  Some are firm and precise while others are soft and easy to blend with and seem like the consistency of real hair.  And the case for me didn&#x27;t smell at all like strong plastic (maybe a very slight residue).  Overall, a very good buy for the price.  And only a few brushes were unusable.</li>
    <li> I received my brushes 3 days earlier than the expected delivery date , i really loved that .! {:&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of nervous about these brushes due to some of the written reviews that I had read before purchasing this set . Regardless , I still purchased this set , and it was a GREAT IDEA .!!!  They work W O N D E R F U L &lt;3 . They are so soft . The only complaint i have is that the fan and powder brush shed not a lot but they do shed . Overall , great product {:&lt;br /&gt;I am going to wash the two brushes to see if the shedding stops and update this review c:</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice and really soft ,but the bristles are coming out a little and it would be really cool if u guys cone add a list of what the brushes are used for , for the beginners like myself , but I love the brushes and I would recommend it ☺</li>
    <li> They are good for the price. You get a lot of brushes. They do shed a little a first but overall good product</li>
    <li> I was really excited about these brushes but I did no receive all of the brushes listed, they don&#x27;t pick up much product at all, and they shed ALOT. I only used them once and would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> Soft, look nice, great variety! I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> i have never used brushes before im learning new techniques for make up and bought these because price was great and i LOVE THEM!!! it really does make a difference when you have the right tools!!</li>
    <li> I love this set! It is a great deal for the amount of brushes you get. The only thing I don&#x27;t like too much about it is the quality. Some brushes shed a little but the majority of them were awesome and applied makeup smoothly. It&#x27;s definitely very good quality for the money!</li>
    <li> the bigger brushes are very rough a nice beginner set... its cheap.. and the smaller brushes arent too bad. the carrier is decent as well overall was satisfied with the purchase as some of these brushes can cost twice the price of the whole kit! you end up getting more than what you pay for fortunately.</li>
