      <li>Great soap for pore and oily skin</li>
      <li>It is very beautiful and amazing results</li>
      <li>Good and i will buy agine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product, it makes a clear and smooth skin and it has a wonderful smell.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t notice a difference between the two except for the smell, but I love them!</li>
      <li>product works AMAZING on my skin.</li>
      <li>one smells kind of like apricots</li>
      <li>Soaps lather up nicely and all my teenagers use it.</li>
      <li>More of a cute novelty item honestly.</li>
      <li>This soap makes a significant difference in the size of my pores the smell is bearable and the packaging is super cute ideal for gift giving.  </li>
      <li>The oiliness goes away, but for some reason the shine is still there, so I use power on my nose, but the power effects last longer :D</li>
      <li>So much better than any drugstore brand.</li>
      <li>I personally love it.</li>
      <li>Love these...</li>
      <li>I love the packaging!&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>The lather up REALLY easy so you don&#x27;t have to use much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine to use as a body soap though, if you moisturize afterwards.</li>
      <li>The very first time I used these my skin felt noticeably softer!</li>
      <li>and it makes my skin feel so matte and shine free.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t leave them on for more than 10 seconds</li>
      <li>/&gt;These make my face feel super super clean</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty cool!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better to let some natural oils remain to keep your skin balanced.</li>
      <li>it is magic i don&#x27;t have black heads any more</li>
      <li>first time I used these, I saw a difference.</li>
      <li>The Brown egg is much more pungent, but I actually like the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy how soft my skin feels  when washing with these egg soaps.</li>
      <li>use this after a more gentle rice cleansing soap and lather either the brown (night) or white (day) egg up right onto my face.</li>
      <li>This strips too much and leaves your face dry and completely oil free, which sounds good, but actually is not.</li>
      <li>only a little big and do a great job!</li>
      <li>My husband says it dries the skin too much</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft!</li>
      <li>this is fine as a regular soap, but as a facial soap it strips the natural oils off your face, which is not good because it causes your skin to react by overproducing more oil, which then starts a cycle of breaking out.</li>
      <li>the other has mild gardenia-like scent.</li>
      <li>so I just wash it off early sometimes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this about 3 months ago and the size has barely shrunk.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The white egg for morning use isnt that strong smelling, but it does have an odor to it, not pleasant, but bearable.</li>
      <li>It really works in clearing up any skin blemishes, and slowing down the oil/sebum production on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> and I also didn&#x27;t use any other products, and these left my skin SO DRY.</li>
<li> Alright let me start by saying I have moderate to heavy oily skin.</li>
<li> Plus, there really is no convenient storage besides the carton it comes in which breaks down after a few weeks of putting the wet soap back in.</li>
<li> So use these soaps in conjunction with other products.</li>
<li> Sometimes it causes me to have little break outs.</li>
<li> I was confused as which was day and night, so I just used the white in the morning and the brown in the evening.</li>
<li> Usually if it is bad i break out right</li>
<li> I did get a few break outs the 1st week but have not had one since, not even during that time of the month which is a miracle for my skin!  </li>
<li> While it didn&#x27;t break me out (small blessing) no noticeable reduction in pore size.  </li>
<li> Also VERY delicate, any little thing will make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It could definitely be my weird skin and not the product</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product, it makes a clear and smooth skin and it has a wonderful smell. I will buy it again 👌.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy how soft my skin feels  when washing with these egg soaps.</li>
    <li> cleary and refresh the skin</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft! I did a 60x zoom picture of my skin before and after. After one use it definitely unclogged my pores!!</li>
    <li> This soap makes a significant difference in the size of my pores the smell is bearable and the packaging is super cute ideal for gift giving.  If you skin is oily this soap is for you!!!!</li>
    <li> Delightful. If you have oily skin, this is the product for you. Soaps lather up nicely and all my teenagers use it. So much better than any drugstore brand. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I have ever used on my combination skin! It controls my ultra oily t-zone but does not dry out the other areas of my face. I did get a few break outs the 1st week but have not had one since, not even during that time of the month which is a miracle for my skin!  Edited: 4/13/16  My skin has started acting out on it. Sometimes it causes me to have little break outs. It could definitely be my weird skin and not the product but I have stopped using it for now. Plus, there really is no convenient storage besides the carton it comes in which breaks down after a few weeks of putting the wet soap back in. And travelling with this soap was not the easiest thing either.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used these my skin felt noticeably softer! I was confused as which was day and night, so I just used the white in the morning and the brown in the evening. Honestly, I don&#x27;t notice a difference between the two except for the smell, but I love them! I bought this about 3 months ago and the size has barely shrunk. These will last for a long time!! My skin is oily and was rough, but after using these for some time my skin feels soft even when I don&#x27;t use these. (But softness is always increased when I use these.) The oiliness goes away, but for some reason the shine is still there, so I use power on my nose, but the power effects last longer :D I will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love these...that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a repeat customer....I will keep buying</li>
    <li> only a little big and do a great job!</li>
    <li> Just a beautiful smell .. do not work with pores</li>
    <li> it is magic i don&#x27;t have black heads any more</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty cool! I love the packaging!&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;I use this after a more gentle rice cleansing soap and lather either the brown (night) or white (day) egg up right onto my face. I leave them on for about 10-15 minutes, but the white one will start stinging so I just wash it off early sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;These make my face feel super super clean and they smell like egg whites. At first I didn&#x27;t leave them on for more than 10 seconds and I also didn&#x27;t use any other products, and these left my skin SO DRY. So use these soaps in conjunction with other products.</li>
    <li> Used it once didn&#x27;t break out. Usually if it is bad i break out right away.&lt;br /&gt;lets see how it work after a while.&lt;br /&gt;smells awesome. one smells kind of like apricots the other has mild gardenia-like scent.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Alright let me start by saying I have moderate to heavy oily skin. Also VERY delicate, any little thing will make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works AMAZING on my skin. It really works in clearing up any skin blemishes, and slowing down the oil/sebum production on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white egg for morning use isnt that strong smelling, but it does have an odor to it, not pleasant, but bearable. The Brown egg is much more pungent, but I actually like the smell of it. The lather up REALLY easy so you don&#x27;t have to use much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, will deff buy again, when these run out.\</li>
    <li> It is very beautiful and amazing results</li>
    <li> Excellent for oily skin!.The first time I used these, I saw a difference.I Recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i gave it a three star cuz of the cuteness i havent tried it out yet..</li>
    <li> Wonderful product .. recommend it</li>
    <li> While it didn&#x27;t break me out (small blessing) no noticeable reduction in pore size.  More of a cute novelty item honestly.</li>
    <li> I personally love it. I have very oily skin and it makes my skin feel so matte and shine free. My husband says it dries the skin too much but he can always use moisturizer.</li>
    <li> this is fine as a regular soap, but as a facial soap it strips the natural oils off your face, which is not good because it causes your skin to react by overproducing more oil, which then starts a cycle of breaking out. It&#x27;s better to let some natural oils remain to keep your skin balanced. This strips too much and leaves your face dry and completely oil free, which sounds good, but actually is not. it&#x27;s fine to use as a body soap though, if you moisturize afterwards.</li>
    <li> Good and i will buy agine</li>
    <li> Great soap for pore and oily skin</li>
