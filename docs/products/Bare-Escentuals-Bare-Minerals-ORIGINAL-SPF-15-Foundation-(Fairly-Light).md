<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love, love!  color is very close to my skin tone, love light feeling of powder versus a liquid makeup, also!</li>
    <li> I am 22 and I have sensitive acne prone skin. This is the only makeup I can wear that won&#x27;t make me break out. It doesn&#x27;t give me oily skin and with the right brush covers well. Buildable. I will be reordering</li>
    <li> Used this before...always happy with Bare Minerals products!</li>
    <li> I have been buying Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals for years - so unless they have changed how they make their product -then this is a knock-off version.  Not sure, but it&#x27;s too expensive to go try purchasing again.  This specific product is lighter than usual and doesn&#x27;t offer the same kind of coverage.  Not sure what happened, but if the company went cheaper - then I&#x27;m definitely no longer a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I am finally completely satisfied with this makeup, as I was when I first started using it.  I&#x27;m not sure if the one I ordered from a different buyer wasn&#x27;t what it claimed to be, because I see a huge difference.  It arrived very quickly as well, so I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the original bare minerals foundation. You can not go wrong with this product. Use a kabuki brush to get maximum coverage and to really buff it into the skin. I&#x27;ve been using bare minerals for about 3 years now and have to say its my favorite foundation of all time, and ive tried so many in the past 8 years. If this is your first time using bare minerals, do not expect a thick full coverage out of this makeup. It gives a soft breathable coverage on the skin and really evens everything out. Love love love this product! I would recommend that you go to an Ulta store to get your shade matched because there are so many shades and under tones in this range. That&#x27;s another thing I love about it. Give this a shot, you&#x27;ll love it and you skin will too.</li>
    <li> I love this product and how it covers, but I made an error in choosing the Fairly Light shade.  It makes me look really washed out.  I should have gone a little darker.  It&#x27;s great that it doesn&#x27;t feel cakey and thick when I wear it, unlike liquid foundation.  I have a darker shade of mineral makeup from another brand that I mixed with the fairly light.  Now, it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
    <li> I have combination, acne-prone, skin, and this mineral powder is the only stuff that&#x27;s been able to cover up even my worst breakouts. I&#x27;ve actually been complemented on my skin after using this product. It looks very natural, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few buyers have cried counterfeit, and I&#x27;m not sure what that&#x27;s all about, but mine looked and felt exactly the same as my old jars. So... believe what you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first time buying this product, I highly recommend visiting the cosmetic section in your local mall to have your color matched for free by a professional before you order online... and don&#x27;t forget your primer. If you don&#x27;t have primer, any oil-free moisturizer will do. The full kit is nice, but hey, we&#x27;re not all made of money. This and a pair of soft, clean brushes are all you really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived fast and feels great!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation,I wear it all the time!! Great product,you can put it on in am and it looks the same at 10::00 pm that night! You can even sleep in it!! Amazing product!!</li>
    <li> I usually buy Bare Minerals at the mall. I get the same thing every time and know what to expect. I buy the fairly light shade and it blends perfectly with my skin tone. THIS ONE DID NOT. It says fairly light on the container, but is NOT the right shade. It&#x27;s darker &amp; more orange. Not sure what happened here. Maybe this seller bought a bad batch from the manufacturer to sell at retail? Will not purchase again online.</li>
    <li> Around Xmas 2010 I saw a sample set of Bare Minerals at Penney&#x27;s and bought it. I was thirty three at the time. I have combination skin. I need to use lots of moisturizer but not too heavy of a moisturizer or my skin gets oily. I have purple bags under my eyes. Seriously dark purple. This makeup is amazing. The bags under my eyes have always been there. It&#x27;s just part of me but now they are barely visible. I used to always make jokes about them. The other day I made a joke about them to a friend who has only known me since I&#x27;ve been wearing Bare Minerals and she looked at me like I was crazy and said \\&quot;What bags under your eyes?\\&quot; in that way women do when we&#x27;re saying \\&quot;knock it off, don&#x27;t put yourself down when you knew that isn&#x27;t even true.\\&quot; I was stopped in my tracks. To her, I don&#x27;t have bags under my eyes. My skin looks healthy and young. I would not say that my skin has improved, I don&#x27;t have bad skin to start with. I can get acne though if I wear this make-up to bed. So, wash it off. Your skin needs to breathe. As long as they keep making this make-up I&#x27;ll keep buying it. FYI- I accidentally bought the Matte off Amazon and I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much. It&#x27;s fine, but I immediately ordered the original to replace it.</li>
    <li> The foundation is the wrong color for m. I ordered it so its my fault not yours.,The mineral veil is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I like this because it does not make me break out even if I sleep in it. It is light and does not feel like you are even wearing make up.</li>
    <li> In my opinion there is no better makeup! There are many mineral makeups on the market but none compare to the quality of this one. It is easy to apply, stays on all day and looks amazing. No irritation, no reapplying and feels light as a feather on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation, but I have to say there is something different about the one I have bought off of Amazon.  It takes more of it for the same amount of coverage and the texture is slightly different.  I was forced to go back to paying more on the Bare Escentuals website to get a quality product.</li>
    <li> If you have never tried bare minerals I urge you to do so.  If you do you will never go back to liquid makeup again.  I certainly won&#x27;t.  It is not a powder but a mineral and goes on with a brush in circular motion.  You can buy a kabuki brush for this application, it is wonderful.  It goes on dry and stays all day without an oily shine.  You need very little product and the 9 gram container will last for months. If you have an oily complection you will certainly like the mineral veil that goes over the top of the foundation.  It gives you an airbrushed finish you will love.</li>
    <li> It gives a good glow to the old skin.  As long as I&#x27;m working, I do my best to look my best.  Norma</li>
    <li> Her skin is luminous! No one she works with thinks she wears anything but eyeliner and lipstick. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product</li>
    <li> This order was made because I cannot buy Bare Escentuals in The Netherlands.  The price was fair, but when my order was delivered I was asked to pay another 19 Euros.  This nearly doubled the price of the powder and I did not accept the order and asked for it to be returned to sender.  I was sorry because now I have run out of my favourite mineral powder.  I think it was to do with customs duty, but it made the order too expensive.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and this is no way the real deal.  I could tell the first time I used it.  It does not cover or flow like the product it claims to be, though it is in the right container.  It has a shine to it and the real product is matte.  Returing for a refund!  I see I am not the only one reviewing this product that is unhappy.</li>
    <li> I was a Bare Minerals girl for many years.  I loved the coverage, I loved the color options (between summer and winter), and I loved that it was all natual, and I could sleep in it if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bare Minerals was definitely the cutting edge in mineral make-up that pushed many of us early 30&#x27;s girls away from the liquids and creams of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue now is the price.  As other companies began doing a fabulous job of creating their own mineral make-ups, Bare Minerals became the &#x27;expensive&#x27; version that was equal in quality of some of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently am on my third jar of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s version and am very satisfied.  I especially love that in addition to a great product, the container includes a brush that I don&#x27;t have to buy separately, clean regularly or replace.  Each new container comes with a new brush that lasts the length of the make-up plus some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying that Bare Minerals should not be purchased.  In fact, I love the product.  Just be savvy of how much you want to spend for products that are equal in quality.</li>
    <li> It is always difficult buying foundation that matches your skin color even when you are doing it in person at a department store under lights. So, trying to find the right shade ONLINE is an even bigger challenge.&lt;br /&gt;My summer tan is long gone and I have brown hair, blue eyes and ruddy, pale skin with huge pores. I am a make-up junky but am desperate to find a foundation/primer combo that does a good job of disguising my skin flaws. I tried the &#x27;Fair&#x27; and the &#x27;Light&#x27; and wouldn&#x27;t you know that neither was the right shade. So, like Goldilocks I ordered \\&quot;Fairly Light\\&quot; and it was just right.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the powders do not do anything for large pores. In fact it seems to make them more obvious. But then I use one of my many pore reducer/primer products (right now it&#x27;s Benefit&#x27;s &#x27;dr. feelgood&#x27; balm) and that seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Love the new container that lets you twist it &#x27;closed&#x27; so that the powder doesn&#x27;t get all overflowing when you are ready to use it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have to use much of this--if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t want to LOOK like you&#x27;re wearing makeup, this is the foundation for you.</li>
    <li> This is not the same as the original!  The color is off and it&#x27;s very glittery.  I would not buy this again here</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Bare Minerals since they came out on QVC. That is the first place that I saw the product. It goes on smoothly, and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s true, if you are tired, and forget once in a while to remove your make-up, no problem. I have never had a problem with that.&lt;br /&gt;I use all Bare Mineral products. Their blush is fantastic. MAK, PA</li>
    <li> Great product, at a great price. The powder style is a bit messy, but the comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Coverage more than makes up for it.</li>
    <li> She likes it and uses it regularly.  I don&#x27;t. tho I have tried it in the past and use it occasionally .</li>
    <li> my favorite type of makeup!</li>
    <li> I tried several different foundations before finding this one. I purchased several &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; drug store brands and was always frustrated with the results,but not with this! LOVED it. It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t give that fake and cake on look. It looks natural. I do suggest using a primer, I didn&#x27;t purchase the bare minerals primer. Use a nice brush and you&#x27;re good to go. Highly suggest this!!!!!</li>
    <li> I would totally suggest this makeup to anyone who wants light feeling makeup but that covers up like you wouldn&#x27;t believe, yet still looking natural, not all makeup clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;If you cannot afford this, I have found another great one that is half the price, Loreal&#x27;s mineral makeup, amazing also......BUT GET THIS ONE IF YOU CAN!  This is THE best makeup ever in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Bare Minerals and they continue to produce a great product. The foundation covers well and my skin loves it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ordering online unless you know the exact color you need. I apparently didn&#x27;t remember correctly and the color I ordered was too light and slightly iridescent, but that&#x27;s what I get for guessing.</li>
    <li> Have been using this makeup for years and really love it.  It goes on evenly with a brush, which must be purchased separately.</li>
    <li> It is helping to clear my face.  I use it after I clean my face and it is really helping as i sleep.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for many years now and love it.  I will never go back to liquid foundation.  This is so much better feeling on your skin.  Love that you can sleep in it without fear of ruining your skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what the other reviews were talking about. This is just the same as I buy in my local Ulta and at much less cost. I have been using bare minerals for ten years so I can tell the real deal!</li>
    <li> A love powder makeup. It&#x27;s not heavy and covers nicely. Light and airy.</li>
    <li> do you like mineral makeup? Then you will like this--same thing you can get at Sephora or ULTA only without the driving or dealing with stuck up sales people</li>
    <li> I love the way this foundation makes my skin look! I went to a BE boutique and was advised what color best suited me, I bought some foundation, ran out then went searching for the best price, and found it here! Win win!</li>
    <li> I had tried another type of minerals makeup several years ago and I wasn&#x27;t really crazy about it.  I erroneously bought into the hype and sprung for Bare minerals, hoping it would cover the redness.  It does cover when you first put it on but by around 1pm, it is mostly gone.  When I get home and wash my face, there is just a slight amount of makeup on the washcloth.  I definitely won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter we love this makeup and it&#x27;s healthy for our skin! This make up looks great</li>
    <li> I am very pale but tan in summer the fairly light seems very nice for both! Just wish if kept me from getting shiny/oily in the summer humidity.</li>
    <li> I love the color (fairly Light) it matches my skin tone perfectly. I haven&#x27;t found another brand that matches as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve actually found products that I like better than Bare Escentuals Mineral Makeup, ones that don&#x27;t make me shiny by the evening, and cover better. I prefer the all natural vegan mineral makeup from an esty shop called Madison Street Beauty.</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals and have used this product for years. I liked being able to buy JUST the make up and not having to get it in a starter kit or sign up for monthly shipments. This is one of the best covering makeups I have ever used and it is so light.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals is my makeup of choice.  I have used it for years and don&#x27;t want to try any other.</li>
    <li> This goes on perfectly smooth if you use it according to instructions.  Your face does have to be dry before application.  If it isn&#x27;t, it will not apply smoothly.</li>
    <li> I know they say to just use it as a powder but I am a busy mother and am always on the go.  I need to put a light layer of foundation first and then use this as a powder on top.  I love it, it is soft, light and doesn&#x27;t make you look like you have &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; your makeup on.  My mother also liked it when she used it while at my house and my friend let me try hers years ago and I finally bought the product!</li>
    <li> The thing I love about this foundation is that you can essentially pick how much coverage you want, It builds very nicely, and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of effort. You can use the same foundation as a concealer as well. I bought mine in a set at the Bareminerals store in my local mall. Works well with or without primer and blends very easily. Overall, this is my favorite foundation. Nothing else compares if I want a more opaque coverage without looking like I caked makeup on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for YEARS.  I LOVE it.  I am 65 years old and get compliments on my complexion all the time.  This is CLEAN make up and does not clog pores!  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> After a couple uses, I could tell this is not the true Bare Minerals foundation. I have been using this foundation for 5 years. DONT BUY</li>
    <li> IT WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL.... IT WAS MATTE OR SOME FAKE SENT OUT BY WHOMEVER. I THREW OUT THE SLIP. CAN&#x27;T REMEMBER WHO I PURCHASED IT FROM. VERY DISAPPOINTED AS I KNOW MY PRODUCTS WELL. I JUST WANTED TO SAVE A FEW $  AND SINCE THE WOMAN AT &#x27;DAY FACE SPA&#x27; IN BEND WAS SO SNOOTY AND RUDE TO ME LAST TIME I WENT TO MAKE A PURCHASE, I SWORE I WOULDN&#x27;T BUY ANY BARE MINERAL PRODUCTS THERE AGAIN.  OH WELL, I&#x27;LL KEEP LOOKING THROUGH AMAZON BUT WILL PAY BETTER ATTENTION TO WHOM I&#x27;M DOING THE PURCHASING WITH!</li>
    <li> This color is for you if you are fairly light skinned, but not very fair, it is a loose powder, but ingredients are better for your skin than most other products, and I have no problems with its removal. I have been using it for about 6 years. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and looks very natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  My only complaint was that the white cardboard inside the lid came unglued... and that&#x27;s hardly a big deal!  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love the coverage that Bare Escentuals gives me but it never looks caked on or really powdery. I don&#x27;t use the mineral veil I just use this and it lasts all day. I like that I can use the same color even if I get a little tan. It doesn&#x27;t make your face look whiter than the rest of you like some makeups! Definitely a great buy. I have freckles and the smooth coverage is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Like this for a change up. Thank u</li>
    <li> Use it everyday... love it!</li>
    <li> This is the authentic product! Great coverage and perfect finish. Minimizes fine lines and covers imperfections. Feels so good and lasts all day long! What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I love make-up, I always have. I have tried every foundation on the market, and for years was a Clinique or Lancôme fan. Then, I tried Bare Escentuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bare Escentuals Foundation comes in 14 different shades. I use Fairly Light, and the shade is perfection. I use Bare Minerals Prime Time Foundation Primer as a base over my moisturizer. Using the Bare Minerals brush, I swirl the brush in a small amount of foundation minerals, tap,the brush then apply the foundation to my face. I start at the outside of my cheek and work inwards, then forehead, nose, over and under eyes, chin and neck area. All the time buffing the skin and foundation with the brush using a swirling motion. A little foundation goes a long way. I prefer minimum coverage, but you can place as much as you prefer. I usually swirl on some cheek blush and then using the same swirl, tap and apply motions, cover with Bare Minerals veil. This provides such a complete package. The foundation evens out fine lines, there are no pores, and the skin seems to shine and gleam. I am so completely happy and satisfied with this loose mineral foundation. The price is right for the product. It is the best foundation out there, bar none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.  prisrob 09-26-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000V9EDV2 bareMinerals ORIGINAL SPF 15 Foundation with Click, Lock, Go Sifter - Medium]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001VA8PWI bareMinerals Get Started Kit with Bonus Gift - Medium]]</li>
    <li> Used this product for years. Light on skin. Never looks heavy. Great coverage.</li>
    <li> Does not go on the same as the Bare Minerals that I buy on the official site. It doesn&#x27;t blend into my skin and cover spots, freckles, etc like the original. Takes a lot of this stuff which then clogs my pours and make a me look like a clown!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with foundation. I can never find something to match my skin tone. I either look pasty or orange. I used Sheer Cover, thinking it was a better alternative than liquid foundation. I was wrong, as that product was just terrible. I decided to finally purchase Bare Minerals, and I&#x27;ve never looked back. I order the foundation in Fairly Light, which matches my skin tone perfect, giving just a slight tan. The 9 gram size lasts me months! I will never purchase any other foundation, as long as I have Bare Minerals. It covers up some of the discoloration from blemish scars. It also makes my skin feel as if it can breath, even with makeup on. It goes on well, I&#x27;ve even had to start using less because I realized I didn&#x27;t need so much. My skin is so soft and it looks very natural.</li>
    <li> I gave this foundation three stars only because the tint is much lighter than the fairly light I buy in stores. In fact, I have to mix this foundation with another store-bought foundation in the same tint to make it work for my face. Otherwise, I look like a ghost wearing it. Great price, though.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for the past 3 years and have loved everything about it. I have oily/acne prone skin and this is the only that gives me coverage without having to load myself with makeup. I always buy my makeup at department stores but this time thought of buying it through amazon because of the huge $$$ difference and I&#x27;m so sorry I did. Just for saving 5 to 7 dollars I received something that is worthless. Even after I keep applying this product on my face again n again it just doesn&#x27;t hide my imperfections like a regular Bare Minerals does. I am so sad and will never buy from this merchant.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised how quickly I received my order.  My order was exactly what I wanted, I will be ordering more very soon.  Thanks GL</li>
    <li> This is the same makeup you would purchase if you physically went to the bare minerals store. I already know my perfect shade so that really helps, I never have problems with too light or too dark. I wen to the little shop in the mall and they matched my shade and after that all my purchases have been made online. I don&#x27;t like the crowed at the mall where i live and I have children so its much more convenient to order it. Also the shipper always gets it to me on time if not sooner :) fantastic service!</li>
    <li> I have always liked Bare Escentuals. I was nervous about ordering online but I do not seem to have any issues. I have no complaints will order again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It goes on evenly and lasts all day.  It looks very natural.  It was nice to get it for a good price</li>
    <li> There is simply nothing better than this foundation.  I have had so many people ask me what type of foundation I use.  It covers beautifully and covers any and all flaws.  Leaves your skin looking smooth and finished.</li>
    <li> This stuff covers great, feels smooth on, doesn&#x27;t make you look over-made up and stays on all day.  I love all the Bare Escentuals makeup!</li>
    <li> This is the only foundation I would ever use.  Great price for an excellent product.  Fast shipment. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> it turned out to be ALOT lighter than it looks or says.&lt;br /&gt;it is actually not (fairly light) it is actually. REALLY LIGHT.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this brand for a few months now and absolutely love it! It goes on smooth, fills in all the lines and wrinkles so they look smooth and overall leaves your face looking flawless. True to color. Will keep using this brand and I buy it on Amazon to save me a trip to the store or to call the company that charges you shipping plus the price is higher. I&#x27;ll keep with this brand and color. I love it.</li>
    <li> I recieved the item in a timely fasion, but was not happy with the way that it looked on.  It did not apply the same as the other bare minerals i have been using.  I contacted the seller to see what i could do about a exchange or refund and they got back to me right away and just refuned the whole transaction.  They thought it may have been old product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love this product.</li>
    <li> darker than previously purchased, Not sure it is the real thing.</li>
    <li> Not sure whats going on here but I feel like its not the same as the stuff I buy at the mall. I have to really load it on my face and even then it doesn&#x27;t have the same coverage. I&#x27;ve gone through it twice as fast as my original one from the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought something was wrong when I first used it but I had just cleaned my makeup brush and had been out of powder for a week or so. The difference was almost not noticeable but after reading the lower reviews and I&#x27;m going to have to agree. Also, I bought the fairly light shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, not sure if related but since I&#x27;ve been using this my breakouts have been a bit more noticeable. Not sure if because coverage sucks or something in it is not agreeing with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will not be buying this product online again.</li>
    <li> great buy for the price, got two for the pirce of one always looking for a deal , and got it right away</li>
    <li> For the price and the speedy shipment also the quality, gives this product 5 stars. I still believe this is the best powder foundation on the market. It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores, has excellent coverage (especially for acne) and with a little eye cream. handles wrinkles very well.</li>
    <li> The formula has been changed. It it orangy and doesn&#x27;t cover nearly as well. Buy Merle Norman mineral make-up and save your time and money.</li>
    <li> If you have not tried the Bare Minerals you are really missing out.  I started using it several years ago and cannot imagine for going back to the liquid make up.  With the old liquid it was hard to find the right shade and then the right formula that had coverage without being to much.  Bare Minerals colors look great on everyone. You can even blend two shades together to make the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; color for you.  It goes on light and you add on for more coverage if you want it.  It is breathable and does not clog my pores. It does cover up imperfections again, use as much as you need.  I promise once you try it you will be hooked and never again want to touch the liquid again!</li>
    <li> Great Product...It was larger then I thought..The new lock down cap keeps you from wasting what you don&#x27;t use. lightening fast shipping !</li>
    <li> I love Bare Minerals and this product is a must!  The size of this for the price is a must have!  Fast shipping and great product.  No more liquid make-up filled with harsh chemicals!</li>
    <li> Bare minerals is something I have always wanted to try. Love it, a little goes a long way. I am 49 but I have taken good care of my skin, I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup , this product is just right for my needs.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Amazon instead of purchasing it from Sephora as usual because of the convenience and because it was a few dollars cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for 10 days.  The jar is almost identical to my old (real) one, but the font is slightly different.  Enough to wonder about.  The product (Fairly Light) is SIGNIFICANTLY lighter than my last container.  I know Bare Escentuals would not have changed the tones of their product this much over a few months.  I have to layer on bronzer afterwards in order to even out the tone of my skin since it&#x27;s so light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that my skin has been getting worse and worse over the last week with terrible breakouts and I finally realized that it is probably because of this fake product.  After reading other reviews from customers who purchased through baremakeup4less, I see similar complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  It is fake, terrible for your skin, and I am shocked that Amazon is carrying it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I switched to bare minerals from more common (and less expensive) foundation thinking that I was doing something good for my skin. The words all natural can be quite deceiving. Natural does not always mean healthy, or healthy for everyone. After I began using the product my skin gradually became more and more irritated. I would get breakouts because my skin was irritated and more prone to being affected by natural oils and bacterias, and it was constantly red and itchy and inflamed. I didn&#x27;t even think this could be caused by my make-up; Bare Minerals is supposed to have the opposite effect. I blamed stress at work, my job not enough sleep etc. to be the culprit of my worsened skin condition.    Finally I decided to start looking into the ingredients of the things I was putting on my face to see what could be causing the irritation. Granted there are products out there with a lot nastier ingredients in them. But Bare Minerals have two ingredients in particular that can be highly destructive to some sensitive skin:  Bismuth Oxychloride, and Mica.  Bismuth Oxychloride may not be problematic to everyone, but it can be SEVERELY damaging to some. Mica is potentially less problematic than the latter, but may still pose a problem to sensitive skin.    What is Bismuth Oxychloride? Glad you asked.    Bismuth oxychloride is an inorganic white pigment, and usually comes in two forms: diamond and pearl finishes. The diamond is shimmery and the pearl is more matte. It&#x27;s formula is BiOCl.  If you look on the periodic table of elements, you&#x27;ll notice plain old bismuth at atomic number 83, with the symbol Bi. It is the least toxic of it&#x27;s periodic table neighbors like lead, tin, antimony and polonium. Bismuth in itself is not safe for use in cosmetics, and must be refined and combined with other elements to produce bismuth oxychloride.  Bismuth occurs naturally, but in very small amounts. Most of the bismuth produced in the USA is as a by-product from refining lead, tin, copper, silver and gold ores.  Once the bismuth has been harvested, it is further refined through several processes to remove dangerous elements like lead. Then it is chlorinated, which gives us bismuth chloride (BiCl3). It still poses a severe risk at this point, smelling of hydrochloric acid. When bismuth chloride is combined with water, it starts to decompose and part of the chlorine is replaced by oxygen from the water. This process is called hydrolysis. The remaining compound is bismuth, chlorine and oxygen; Bismuth oxychloride.    Article Source: [...]    After finding this out I stopped using Bare Minerals immediately and my skin felt better within days; less itchy, not \\&quot;on fire,\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t have new welts and hive patches popping up every day. It will take a little while for the skin to heal completely from the damage but I have noticed very rapid improvement within a week.</li>
    <li> The product was what was expected and happy to get it for a cheaper price than any store would carry in my area</li>
    <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for several years now.  it&#x27;s not flaky and provides great coverage for my face.</li>
    <li> Very good product. This is my seconds time getting this makeup and I absolutely love it. Doesn&#x27;t feel or look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup and gives great coverage. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals. I have never felt so fresh after putting on makeup. The shipping was fast and the rating was perfect for this product. I will definitely refer this product and amazon to buy it. It was such a better feeling to buy bare minerals at a lower cost!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought Bare Escentuals at the store and this was not the same.  It feels coarser and doesn&#x27;t cover well at all.  I would return it, but I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> I have never tried Bare Escentuals before, and wanted to see how it compared with the other makeup I use. I loved the feel of it, like I was wearing nothing on my face. The color was not right though, it was too dark, so now I have a foundation I can&#x27;t use but would if it were the right shade. So, please make sure you order the color for you.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Escentuals, but around here it&#x27;s really expensive and only sold in one high-end salon.  I found this one on Amazon, so bought a back-up.  It&#x27;s a great product and the price was fantastic.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a while, I realized it didn&#x27;t provide near the same level of coverage as when I purchase it directly from the local Bare Minerals store. The product ordered here didn&#x27;t even work well enough to continue using, so I ended up paying full price at the store for new product and throwing this away. After close examination of the lettering on the lid and the &amp;#34;made in&amp;#34; info, I&#x27;ve decided that what I purchased for half price on Amazon was a knock off. I have continued to purchase this foundation from the local store since then, and even though paying full price makes me cringe a bit, the coverage that the real product provides is well worth it.</li>
    <li> My favorite. I have tried every alternative but can&#x27;t find the same coverage. Its easy to fool yourself and think you have found a good alternative, but once you go back to Bare Minerals you&#x27;ll realize you never should have gone somewhere else! It simply has the best coverage and doesn&#x27;t make you breakout. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the matte foundation, it goes on uneven. The SPF is great, I feel like powder usually covers the spf in your normal foundation so this makes up for that. I am a makeup guru, I have tried everything cheap and expensive and I&#x27;ve never found the same type of coverage in a loose powder.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products</li>
    <li> Great product, and fast shipping!  I was a little worried that the foundation would come in the travel size, but it WAS the full sized priduct :) Thanks!</li>
    <li> As a teenager, I had medium troubled skin. I started proactive, and it helped, but didnt make my acne go away completely. Then, I switched from a  liquid foundation to this light powder foundation. My skins great! I havnt had a breakout in three months! The lightness of the foundation dosnt clog pores as much as normal foundations do. On top of all that, it also provides sun protection! No need to put on pore clogging sun protection. This is really a good product. The only thing I dont love about it is that it doesnt cover undereye circles to well. For those, I recommend erase paste, as well as for big acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for a few years now and I absolutely love all of their line! It feels light on your skin and I get comments all the time on how flawless my face looks - it&#x27;s not me, it&#x27;s the product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this foundation for several years.  I find it flattering to my complection and is light and natural.  I also like the new packaging</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is going on with this product it does come in correct packaging but it&#x27;s NOT bare escentuals looks horrible on!! Very Dissapointed!! BEWARE</li>
    <li> Great product, just as described!! Color matched almost perfect and is much cheaper than anywhere else I can find. Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> this arrived on time and it was exactly what I wanted.  I thought it was in great shape and it looked brand new.  I ws very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This doesnt seem to be the exact same but it does work well. I&#x27;ve quit using bare minerals because it DOES clog pores and now my skin has tiny calcium deposits, especially under my eyes. Most people cant see them but I can and my dermatologist recommended me to quit using this product. I love the coverage but it does tend to be shiny. I&#x27;m going to clinique products because they clog pores less than this does. I wanted a pure product and this caused tiny bumps all over. Sad because I loved bare minerals.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> As always a great product.  Cover well without settling into fine lines and pores. Great for &amp;#34;more mature&amp;#34; skin. You can never go wrong when ordering a Bare Minerals Product!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS LIGHT FEEL LIKE IM WEARING NO MAKEUP FEEL THIS PRODUCT GIVES YOU AND THIS COLOR WORKS GREAT WITH MY SKIN TONE.</li>
    <li> TOO MUCH PEARLY REFLECTIVES - i dont usually use this color - has more reflectives and pearly&amp;#34;esque&amp;#34; color to it than the others seem too - but the price is right and I have been mixing it with may darker colors</li>
    <li> This product shipped much more quickly than I had anticipated. I have been using Bare Minerals for a long time &amp; the quality is consistently good.</li>
    <li> While the product came to me promptly from the Seller (good seller), I don&#x27;t like it at all.  If this is supposed to be a foundation, it&#x27;s not.  I like the other Bare Escentuals and Bare Minerals products - their Concealer is fabulous.  This Foundatoin covers nothing, and doesn&#x27;t spread evenly with a brush.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals are the greatest product for sensitive skin. I love all of their products, especially the blush, it is so natural looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product from here 2 times. The first time i though maybe it was a bad batch. But after ordering it a second time i realized this is NOT THE REAL PRODUCT! It does not stay on, does not cover blemishes at all. Very poor product.</li>
    <li> Best makeup I&#x27;ve ever tried. Best coverage and your face looks airbrushed. The original formula is the best!</li>
    <li> What an absolute fraudulent product!! I put the fairly light, which I regularly use from Sephora, on my face and it appeared WHITE, like clown make-up.  This is most definitely NOT the real thing.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this product, but I would not trust putting it on my face regularly.  I want my money back.  What a shame,</li>
    <li> Made my skin look orange, coverage not so good. Used fairly light, and I have average complexion skin. And just didn&#x27;t work as I had imagined.</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals &amp; have been using fairly light for 3 years. However, I purchased fairly light on Amazon &amp; received a counterfeit.  The makeup was noticeably lighter.  I purchased at Ulta to replace b/c it doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone (and also made my face break out) &amp; compared the lids of the amazon &amp; Ulta bare minerals.  The font is different.  The stickers on the bottom are different.  Really frustrated that Amazon will let people sell counterfeit goods on here.</li>
    <li> Bare essentials has a great line of products which help with your overall skin health and this product is no different.  In my opinion you should skip the sephoras and ulta stores and only shop with competitive pricing on amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I appreciate that it was shipped in such a timely manner.  The product was at an excellent price and made it very affordable for me to order the makeup that I love so much.  Thank you again.  Would recommend the seller or product to anyone considering a purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought my first jar of bareMinerals from Sephora and LOVED it.  When I ran out I found it here on Amazon for less and jumped at the chance to buy my favorite foundation inexpensively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this one for about two months now and was absolutely stumped by the fact that my skin began breaking out.  I&#x27;d try to cover up the pimples with the bareMinerals but to no avail.  Then this morning I let my mother borrow the bareMinerals.  She commented that it seemed slightly different from the jar I had before so I got the old, empty jar and compared it side-by-side to the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT.  THIS IS NOT BAREMINERALS.  I did some follow up research and confirmed that counterfeit products are indeed out there.  The counterfeit powder is even a slightly different shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope people see this review and avoid breakout calamity!  I wish I&#x27;d figured it out sooner.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I bought the bare minerals starter pack at Ulta and absolutely loved the foundation, so I went on Amazon to find a cheap extra for when I ran out of the first stuff. I still haven&#x27;t run out of the first one...after a whole year. The one that I got off Amazon is still sitting in my makeup box, waiting to be used. Now about the foundation itself: it&#x27;s amazing. It doesn&#x27;t take much, it doesn&#x27;t clump, and you can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s there. My boyfriend tells me he never knows when I&#x27;m wearing makeup. Add the foundation and some undereye concealer and ba-boom. No lines or bags under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;Downside: It&#x27;s not water proof AT ALL. Is waterproof foundation a thing? I don&#x27;t know. I haven&#x27;t tried very many brands. But Bare Minerals is better than both the powder and liquid Neutrogena foundations, that&#x27;s for sure. It&#x27;s pricey, but...totally worth it.</li>
    <li> For some reason this tub of makeup isn&#x27;t working the way all my other ones have.  Maybe they changed the ingredient ratio?  Or maybe it was old.  For whatever reason, I&#x27;m not real happy with it, Maybelline is working better than this.</li>
    <li> I like the ease of using this product, and love the fact that I never feel as if I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t cover quite as well as I wish it did, but I&#x27;m 62 and my face shows it, so I probably shouldn&#x27;t expect to have the same results as younger people who are featured in the infomercials.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!!</li>
    <li> I was concerned when I ordered this product that it would not be as described. People had commented on the color not being true and I was afraid because of the price that it would be a sample size. All of my fears were unfounded. The product is the factory produced true color and the size is the much larger normal container. As luck would have it, the shipping was quick. I was grateful because I ran out of my trial size the day before. I plan to order my Mineral Veil from them soon. Why pay full price?</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this.  This is the only foundation that doesn&#x27;t make me break out more or feel like it&#x27;s sliding off my face by the end of the day.  It doubles as a concealer.  The best part is that to wash it off at night I just need to use warm water.  Makes my sensitive skin happy.</li>
    <li> I bought Bare Minerals a year ago and loved it, but this time I can&#x27;t say that.  I wonder if they changed the formula, because this one has no coverage and is just too sheer.  Was very disappointed in it this time.</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals is a great powder foundation. Love the coverage! I dont think I will ever go back to regular store bought powder foundation. This foundation also gives you a bit of a glow which I love!</li>
    <li> Nice coverage at a good price. Love this product line. It does not feel like anything on your skin but leaves awesome coverage behind</li>
