      <li>The product is great, i use nothing but Bumble and Bumble for hair care.</li>
      <li>then this product would work great.</li>
      <li>and this gives it a great salty matte texture and brings out the wave.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to work that great for my hair.</li>
      <li>I already had a spray for beachy waves that worked great.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t understand why people claim this stuff is so great.</li>
      <li>I tried this out attempting to create those beachy waves in my hair, and it came out great.</li>

      <li>It was four times the price and not as good.  </li>
      <li>I read a lot of good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.</li>

      <li>Absolutely love this lightweight product!</li>
      <li>This product is great for adding volume and body to fine hair.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Also, it smells AMAZING.</li>
      <li>and it created a nice wave when I used it.</li>
      <li>nice texture, nice smell, not sticky at all,and</li>
      <li>and it does keep a nice, wavy look.  </li>
      <li>Its a nice \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look.</li>
      <li>This does the trick nicely for me.</li>
      <li>If you really want to counteract the dryness, Bb&#x27;s Grooming Creme is an oil-based cream that works excellently in conjunction with the Surf Spray.</li>
      <li>Its nice but works just as well as the cheaper brands.</li>
      <li>Love how this spray makes my non shampoo hair days, style even better than when I shampoo!</li>
      <li>Soft waves look best when shiny, and well conditioned looking, this stuff does not shine or condition.  </li>
      <li>This by far looks the best.</li>
      <li>Functionality-wise, it does give a nice tousled, beach-hair texture, but I felt compelled to find something better.  </li>
      <li>(I have very fine hair.)</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, good price.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair and love the sea salt texturizing effect, Bumble and Bumble is the clear, best choice.</li>
      <li>This product is okay.</li>
      <li>I like it better than the John Frieda Ocean spray, which was too oily for me</li>
      <li>This is definitely one of the best hair products I have every used.</li>
      <li>I have Pantene products that are better.</li>
      <li>But for my short pixie cut, it is perfect!</li>
      <li>It gives you a sexy beach or bed head look.</li>
      <li>I put this product on blow dryed straight hair, and it created a great looking wave with lots of volume.</li>
      <li>I love how my hair looks after a day at the beach!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Again, some people may be able to carry off the look; for me, I just look like I&#x27;m not taking care of my hair.  </li>
      <li>It takes me forever to work some blow-dryer magic in the morning to get my hair to a point where I am not ashamed to leave the house.</li>
      <li>I think that my cheaper producg it ALOT better.</li>
      <li>and I scrunch it to get more curls.</li>
      <li>There are better sprays out there.</li>
      <li>The more you use, the more of an effect you get, so</li>
      <li>This is my favorite texturizing spray.  </li>
      <li>On top of that, my boyfriend complimented my hair.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>There are also recipes online for homemade ones that work better</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically a hair spray more than a wave enhancer.</li>
      <li>You can also scrunch it up with your fingers while you are drying your hair if you want some more volume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really more wavy</li>
      <li>I think this product is more suited for those who already have waves in their hair.</li>
      <li>the price is much more affordable - it runs about $11 for 6.8oz.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to find a product that holds my hair like this</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been buying in stores for a while, but it&#x27;s been nice to be able to buy online and ship right to me!</li>
      <li>I would recommend looking for another product more effective and price worthy.</li>
      <li>For fine-hair sufferers, this provides all the virtues of a wonderful day on a breezy beach minus the Margarita.  </li>
      <li>And it looks great, no other work needed!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome especially for the hot summer days where you just want to go and enjoy the sunshine!</li>
      <li>It gives my fine hair texture.</li>
      <li>I was originally turned off by Bumble &amp; Bumble surf spray&#x27;s high cost, but I read some good reviews and decided to try it anyway.  </li>
      <li>Like the Brilliant Brunette, it makes your hair more greasy and less separated than the original Ocean Waves.  </li>
      <li>It is great for a short, cropped haircut where you want that wind blow, beachy</li>
      <li>Surf Spray is a fantastic product that truly makes your hair look and feel like you have been at the beach.  </li>
      <li>and I get great curls the next day.</li>
      <li>Gives great texture and an extra boost to my waves like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
      <li>They looked fantastic.</li>
      <li>(I make two to achieve extra-wavy hair), secure with hair elastics</li>
      <li>Definitely a new favorite!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been purchasing this product for a long time. It is great for a short, cropped haircut where you want that wind blow, beachy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I have long, very thick wavy hair and never have time to style it in the morning. Lately, I have been leaving my hair mostly damp and spraying this on before I leave. I have a 45 minute to an hour commute. By the time I get to work I have beachy looking waves with no frizz ( I live in Houston so having no frizz is a BIG deal). If I have a some odd tangles I just comb them out or scrunch up my hair for extra waves. On top of that, my boyfriend complimented my hair. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Love how this spray makes my non shampoo hair days, style even better than when I shampoo! It never makes my hair sticky or feel untouchable!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product to have that really awesome summer beach hair feel.  And WOW!!! It really does feel like you just came from the beach.  just spray a bunch of it on as you kinda scrunch your hair (depending on how much hair you have of course) and let it air-dry.  It&#x27;s awesome especially for the hot summer days where you just want to go and enjoy the sunshine!</li>
    <li> Surf Spray is a fantastic product that truly makes your hair look and feel like you have been at the beach.  I dry my hair first and then use this to bring out the wave in my hair.  I always get several compliments and it is easy to use!</li>
    <li> I have straight, superfine hair that doesn&#x27;t do much on its own and so I started using this about three years ago. I LOVED it! I like working it into damp hair, or even using it over other products after I&#x27;ve dried my hair to give it some extra texture right at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I got tired of paying so much for it and found out after a simple web search that you can make your own similar product by diluting two tablespoons of sea salt in four ounces of water. I even poured this right into my old Surf Spray bottle and it has worked like a charm! This little secret has probably saved me over $200 so far. I still love and use other Bumble and Bumble products like Prep, Grooming Creme, Texture, and Thickening Spray, but for the Surf Spray I now make my own!</li>
    <li> This product is okay. I feel like my hair needs to be damp, not totally wet, to spray on and then continually scrunch and play with so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> I usually like Bumble and Bumble products but this was a disappointment as it did not do that much for my hair. It is like spraying salt on your head and make your hair dirty and greasy after having washed it. Very hard to brush my hair after having used this product.</li>
    <li> This product was a very big disappointment and waste of money. I have almost completely straight hair and was hoping this spray would give me somewhat beachy waves and a little body. But once I spray it on my hair it just weighs down the curls and makes my hair stiff and stringy. It&#x27;s basically a hair spray more than a wave enhancer. I think this product is more suited for those who already have waves in their hair. Other sprays that I have bought for less than five dollars worked better.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for the \\&quot;beach hair\\&quot; look.  Although I struggle with letting my natural waves free, this product helps create the look. While I would not recommend for a serious job interview, it is perfect for the days you want those natural waves to come out and I have not found anything on the market quite as good for relaxed waves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is fine for some people, but I have naturally curly blonde hair.  Naturally curly hair is naturally dry hair, so the matte finish of this is not good for me; I want something that will add a little shine.  As well, the fact that my hair is a golden blonde makes it worse, because after using it my hair looks like dead, sun-bleached seaweed and FEELS like dead, sun-bleached seaweed.  Again, some people may be able to carry off the look; for me, I just look like I&#x27;m not taking care of my hair.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the product&#x27;s fault, I just think it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
    <li> Great for lots of body and curls are Like ocean waves!!! Smells great and a lil product goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This was an impulse buy for me, but I was very surprised with the results. I have semi wavy hair if I let it air dry. I put this product on blow dryed straight hair, and it created a great looking wave with lots of volume. It gives you a sexy beach or bed head look. Its hard for me to get my wave looking good. I have tried gels, air drying it, mouse, you name it. This by far looks the best. It does make your hair a little gritty, as previous reviews say. When you brush your hair, the brush does stick a bit, but I think it&#x27;s well worth it. I wake up for work, and spray this stuff on my hair, and I&#x27;m out of the house. Quick solution to a bad hair day!</li>
    <li> I spritz this on my hair after I towel it off.  Then I let my hair air dry and it does keep a nice, wavy look.  If you blow dry too soon after applying this product, your hair will become a matted mess.  The turn off for me is the smell!  It&#x27;s horrible.  I don&#x27;t notice it after I&#x27;ve applied it, thank goodness.  But, while spritzing it I&#x27;m always thinking \\&quot;e[...] HATE this smell, I HATE this smell!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product is great for adding volume and body to fine hair. I really like it.</li>
    <li> All this did was make my hair sticky, tangled , and it was still pin straight with no &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have very thick, but very fine, limp hair.  I have always dreamed of a short, tousled, textured hair cut, but once I get my locks lopped off, I am left with either a dandelion puff, or completely flat, skull-hugging hair. I&#x27;ve tried everything, since the &#x27;80s; mousse, gel, pomade, wax, styling paste, freeze spray, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. To get any texture, my hair would either be left stiff and poky, gummy and gooey, or greasy and giving me breakouts. I had almost given up, until I was introduced to this Surf Spray.     All I can say is, finally!  All I need to do is spray a few squirts into my damp hair, muss it around, and that&#x27;s it! I&#x27;ve spent hours in the mirror before, trying to achieve some movement and texture, only to rinse all the stiff sticky goo out in frustration right before I leave the house. Now I can finally just mist and go! And it looks great, no other work needed!  I can run my fingers through it after it&#x27;s dry and it can stand up, but still be soft and only mildly coarse feeling.  Or, I can keep it flatter and it has nice little wisps and tousles. I don&#x27;t know how this would work on my hair if it were longer, it might mat it down into dreads.  But for my short pixie cut, it is perfect!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work that great for my hair. I have curly/wavy shoulder length hair so I thought it&#x27;d be good. It just doesn&#x27;t do much for it. It&#x27;s pretty expensive too. It may just be my hair type, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer. This product makes my hair look oily and flat. Not for fine straight hair unless you really want to use it at the beach to keep your hair flat to your head. (I have very fine hair.) This is the only B&amp;B product I haven&#x27;t really liked.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy but very fine, and this product is a miracle worker. Just a little spritz brought out gorgeous, non-crunchy waves that don&#x27;t fall. I just wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a big fan of this brand, but this product is a big rip-off. Not only is it the same as any cheaper beach wave product, but you can make it at home for free.  Just mix 1/4 cup water with a tablespoon of epsom salt and a splash or olive oil in a spray bottle. Mix. Spritz.</li>
    <li> I was originally turned off by Bumble &amp; Bumble surf spray&#x27;s high cost, but I read some good reviews and decided to try it anyway.  My first impressions were that the spray makes my hair sticky and the smell is not attractive at all.  Functionality-wise, it does give a nice tousled, beach-hair texture, but I felt compelled to find something better.  I tried KMS hairplay sea salt spray and have been using it ever since... nice texture, nice smell, not sticky at all,and the price is much more affordable - it runs about $11 for 6.8oz.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your Money!  Although the product does smell nice, it definitely does not give you the beach waves it promises.  My hair has a natural wave, especially in the humidity, but this product just weighs it down and makes your hair dry and stiff. I can&#x27;t believe Elle McPherson endorses this product.  Sorry I purchased it, will never use it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a response to the John Frieda Ocean Waves being discontinued. It was four times the price and not as good.  Like the Brilliant Brunette, it makes your hair more greasy and less separated than the original Ocean Waves.  Bring back Ocean Waves!  How do we do that?</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I like it better than the John Frieda Ocean spray, which was too oily for me (I have normal textured hair--neither fine nor coarse--that is straight, silky and with oily roots) I got my hair layered recently in an effort to get it to do more than just lie there like a limp curtain and I&#x27;ve found this styling spray to be a big help in achieving beachy hair. I wait until my hair is damp, then spray this all over, put my shoulder-length hair up into two ridiculous little buns on either side of my head (I make two to achieve extra-wavy hair), secure with hair elastics (could never figure bobby pins out) and leave my hair to dry while I do other stuff. Sometimes to speed things up I blast my hair (still up in buns) with a hairdryer. Then I take it down, shake it out, spritz some light-hold hairspray all over and voila! Casual, messy, beachy waves that last all day (and my hair usually refuses to hold styles). Of course, if you have dry or damaged hair, then this is not for you. I would also recommend using a clarifying shampoo at least once per week because this stuff can build up in your hair--there IS salt in it after all.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it creates \\&quot;beach hair\\&quot; with very little effort. I have very long, straight hair and it created a nice wave when I used it. It also does a great job of creating texture and volume, but it&#x27;s going to give you a slight \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look and it will leave a bit of a residue feel in your hair, much like if you spent the day at the beach. I don&#x27;t mind the feel of it though, because if you want a casual, beachy look, this stuff is perfect. Just spray it in your damp hair, blow it dry for a bit with your head turned upside down and spray it again when it&#x27;s half way dry. You can also scrunch it up with your fingers while you are drying your hair if you want some more volume. When you are done, don&#x27;t comb it out, just style it with your fingers and you&#x27;ll be ready to go!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;m impressed! I tried this simply out of curiosity and am very glad I did. I used to be hooked on Bed Head&#x27;s \\&quot;Headbanger Wax\\&quot; spray before it was discontinued, and since then I&#x27;d sort of abandoned styling products. Well, not anymore! This spray is very versatile and can create definition, separation, body/volume, hold, texture, and messy style (in curly, wavy, or straight hair!). The more you use, the more of an effect you get, so it&#x27;s very customizeable. It smells like sunscreen... and YES, it DOES make your hair salty/dry-feeling, which is to be expected (salt absorbs/neutralizes moisture), but I don&#x27;t mind it. If you really want to counteract the dryness, Bb&#x27;s Grooming Creme is an oil-based cream that works excellently in conjunction with the Surf Spray. Just playing around with this spray has taught me just how versatile it is, but three constants always remain: volume, hold, and texture. If that&#x27;s what you want, this is your product!</li>
    <li> I have been using it over a year and it adds volume to the hair, I highly recommend it for thin hair, I will definetely buy it again until I find somehting that works better and it is chaeper.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair crunchy and not the nice soft beach curls I was expecting.  My hair forms perfect curls at the beach but this stuff does nothing for me.  If I use less it just looks frizzy not curly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lightweight product!</li>
    <li> For fine-hair sufferers, this provides all the virtues of a wonderful day on a breezy beach minus the Margarita.  Have to use quite a lot to get the desired fullness and body.  Good stuff, and Amazon delivers in a wink.</li>
    <li> I hate flat hair and this definitely gives you the beach volume hair, you just need to know how to use it.  You can see how on the official Bumble and Bumble website.  Now that I tried this product I dont know how I can live without it!</li>
    <li> I have never been able to find a product that holds my hair like this does, i just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> My hai is shoulder length, slightly longer in back. Has a slight wave, very slight, and is thick and coarse. Also colored and highlighted. The first time I used this I soaked it with product and it felt too heavy. Second time I waited until it was damp, then used not as much. Instead of hairdryer I drove somewhere with the top down. Wound up with very nice beachy waves. I assume a hairdryer would work as well. The waves have lasted for several days. I would like to find a lower priced product though that does as well, it&#x27;s the only turnoff. The small bottle I have does not list ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely AMAZING. I use it whenever I put my hair up. I used to hate pulling my hair back because even though my hair isn&#x27;t short, it&#x27;s fairly silky and my bun would look absolutely wimpy. This stuff thinkens my hair such that i get an awesome, messy, \\&quot;effortless\\&quot; bun every time. The matte finish is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> The product is great, i use nothing but Bumble and Bumble for hair care. However this purchase was badly packed, and the product casing was dirty and had a really bad smell to it. I would highly recommend the product, but the seller is a bit in question here as to how they store and pack Amazon products.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks!  I wash my hair, spray this in, and my hair look gorgeous! Absolutely no maintenance needed (and I am a high maintenance kind of girl)</li>
    <li> I am a mature woman with thinning hair.  My stylist used the spray after cutting a few layers into to top and sides of my bob.  While blow drying, hold hair up with round brush, spray at roots and a then another quick spray on brush itself.  Hold blow dryer on for a few seconds.  MIRACULOUS!!!!  Volume, hold (not stiff) and texture.  She did this in sections all over and I looked 10 years younger.  So cute!  It is a little tacky like salt spray from the beach, but who cares when the look is great.  I can do it myself at home, also.</li>
    <li> I personally really loved this product when my hairdresser used it in my hair.  If you read the ratings of people who rated it poorly, I would probably agree with them--it makes your hair feel gritty and a little stiff, like you took a dip in the ocean and didn&#x27;t wash your hair.  THAT&#x27;S THE POINT.  Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray gives your hair the texture and hold of ocean mist without actually making your hair \\&quot;dirty.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s awesome, but you have to know that THAT&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting yourself into.</li>
    <li> We had a water softener put in our house &amp; I have been crying about my lost curls ever since.  But this product spritzed on damp hair works miracles.  Start with damp or wet hair spray all over then add a little gel to hold and bingo curls galore.  Your hair will feel a little stiff just like hair spray. But wow what a difference.</li>
    <li> For the money that this costs its soooo worth it! it makes my hair pretty and wavy without making it too greasy or hard looking like other sprays. Also, it smells AMAZING. definitely 5 stars.</li>
    <li> love this for perfect beachy waves. i&#x27;ve been buying in stores for a while, but it&#x27;s been nice to be able to buy online and ship right to me!</li>
    <li> I purchased both the surf spray and the thickener.  The spray makes your hair tacky and the thickener too soft.  Neither products were worth the $.  I have Pantene products that are better.</li>
    <li> This is a product that my wife loves. She says it gives her the &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; feel she was so use to in Brazil.</li>
    <li> I may not use this product the way it was intended, but I use this product every day on my naturally curly hair. It&#x27;s really more wavy and I scrunch it to get more curls. My mom initially tried this, but gave it to me to try because she didn&#x27;t love it. I&#x27;ll admit, I didn&#x27;t know how to use it and I didn&#x27;t love it at first either. I first sprayed it on when damp, and it gave my hair a weird sticky texture. However, I started using it as a finishing spray on my dry hair and LOVE it now. It has a great smell and it gives my curls some definition (but pliable unlike hair spray). I&#x27;m not sure if I can attribute it to this spray, but I only wash my hair every other day now. I just pin my hair back and the steam from the shower seems to reactivate my products and I get great curls the next day. I will say that I also use Aveda Be Curly when hair is damp.</li>
    <li> You are paying for the name on this one.  I was looking for something that at least resembled the John Frieda Ocean Waves spray, this was not it.  For $21 for a scant 4 ounces, don&#x27;t bother.  They tout the \\&quot;matte finish\\&quot; on this as though that were a good thing.  It makes your hair dull and dry looking.  Soft waves look best when shiny, and well conditioned looking, this stuff does not shine or condition.  I have naturally curly/wavy hair and just wanted that \\&quot;just been to the ocean\\&quot; look.  Surf Spray, once applied and dry, makes it impossible to run your hands through your hair and nearly as impossible to brush out. It leaves a flaky, powdery dust on the brush.  The only benefit I could get from this spray was that it did make my hair feel about 10 times thicker than normal, so if you have thin hair, this would be great for you, but don&#x27;t expect any shine from it.  This isn&#x27;t what I expected for the money.</li>
    <li> There are better sprays out there. After a few hours it just felt like i sprayed a general &#x27;gunk&#x27; on my hair. :-\</li>
    <li> This is my favorite texturizing spray.  It gives just the right amount of curl.</li>
    <li> I do not reccommend this for thin hair. It just makes it look like you need to take a brush to your head, not like you&#x27;ve been relaxing at the beach. I gave it 3 stars because my thick-haired daughter thinks it work well, but for us fine haired women, not so much.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It gives my fine hair texture. The only issue is that it goes fast because you have to reapply it frequently.</li>
    <li> I have really straight hair and this product didnt&#x27; do much for me. If you have naturally wavy hair then this product would work great.</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed, came in a similar bottle with a home made label. Not what I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> It took the seller 3 weeks to ship the product! On the positive side, Surf Spray works very well, although it is more expensive than your average hair care product. I have semi-curly hair and the product really helps to keep my hair straight and under control. I combine it with Bumble and Bumble Sumotech, which is a great combination.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended I try this product, and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since!  It&#x27;s great without being heavy.  I have long, fine, curly hair and this provides just the right amount of texture without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> For far less money I could have bought a cheaper &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34; product. This had high reviews in a magazine I read. I bought this to use on my daughters long straight hair. Followed the directions to a T....either wet or dry you have to use so much product is is absurd. The waves even using a diffuser did not stay in sadly. There are others on the market that do work and a MUCh cheaper! I would not waste my money.</li>
    <li> Bumble South Surf Spray is an excellent salt spray fro windswept wavy hair.  I have thick, long, naturally wavy hair that always looks great at the beach and this certainly recreates that look while landlocked.  I have used \\&quot;Not Your Mama&#x27;s\\&quot; salt spray which has an awful smell and is very dry, leaving your hair feeling like it is truly coated in salt.  The one con of the Bumble South is it still seems a bit too dry.  Pairing this product with morrocan oil (or probably any oil/serum) helps a lot!</li>
    <li> I love this product! it adds the finishing touches to beachy waves in my hair. It also smells soooooooooooo amazing!</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair and love the sea salt texturizing effect, Bumble and Bumble is the clear, best choice. First, sea salt gives both body and texture without weighing hair down. Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Surf Spray seems to have the most salt in it, and it gives hair gentle hold. Second, it does not have ingredients that overly condition or do other things to hair that are counter-productive to the \\&quot;surf effect.\\&quot; If you find the salt too drying after a few days, use a separate moisturizer or scalp conditioner. Third, and really important to me, it has no odor. Others smell too much like perfume or coconut. Is it worth the price? Absolutely.</li>
    <li> Garbage. It&#x27;s hairspray in a small bottle. Doesn&#x27;t give you much a wet look as it gives you a crunchy hair look.</li>
    <li> To say that I have fine, stick-straight hair would be insulting to the stick. It takes me forever to work some blow-dryer magic in the morning to get my hair to a point where I am not ashamed to leave the house. If I don&#x27;t do that, it remains plastered to the sides of my face, a pathetic, limp, and lifeless disaster. Enter Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray. I have had mixed luck with B&amp;B haircare products in the past, but I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a try. I have tried using this spray various ways: applying it to shower-fresh wet hair and letting it air dry, and also using it to prep my hair before blow-drying and styling. I can honestly say that I noticed absolutely no difference in my hair whatsoever after using this product. It was a major waste of $25. I&#x27;ve read other reviews and I don&#x27;t understand why people claim this stuff is so great. Most of the five-star reviews come from people who already claim to have wavy hair, or who use this spray as the first step in a 50-step process. Well, if I sprayed this on my hair, blow-dryed it, curled it, teased it, and applied some other styling products, I bet I&#x27;d have beachy waves, too...and still would have wasted $25 and several extra minutes of time during the styling process. Bottom line, if you have hair like mine, I suggest avoiding this product.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this adds just enough volume and waves. It is light and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> After my pregnancies, my thick, long hair fell out by the handfuls.  Overnight, it went from gorgeous to thin.  It was awful.    My hairdresser suggested this spray.  I thought, forget it.  It won&#x27;t do anything.  I was so wrong.    10-12 sprays of this while your hair is damp before blowdrying is a miracle.  My hair stays nicer longer, too, like after a blowout.  With a bunch of little kids and babies, I need all the help I can get.  Definitely give this a try!</li>
    <li> I tried this out attempting to create those beachy waves in my hair, and it came out great. My hair was wavy and not crunchy, hard or stringy. They looked fantastic. The trick is to use it on wet hair and then put up in a bun or two, sleep on it, and then let it out in the morning. Definitely a new favorite!</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray does exactly what it was meant to do:  It give you that just from the beach look and feel.  I&#x27;ve used this product periodically for many years, and have never been disappointed with the outcome.  As a southern California coastal dweller, I find the slightly tacky feel of the hair true to the feel of hair after a dip in the ocean.  I definitely recommend this product for those looking for a hair product that produces the sunny, healthy look of a day at the beach.

    <li> Quick delivery, good price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to add to my damp hair after a wash that would dry into a natural wave. The surf spray was recommended to me. I have normal, thin hair that tends to get oily at the roots a day or two after a wash. I wash and condition my hair like normal, towel dry and when its damp, comb it out and spray the surf spray onto my hair letting it air dry after the that. The result for me is gentle waves in my hair that are natural and volumous. I have noticed that if i go to hard with the spray that my hair feels gritty, like i spent the day in the ocean. However, its not a huge inconvenience. Especially when i tie it back or pin it up. Its a nice \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look. I like the spray. I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have wavy hair, not truly curly and definitely not straight.  I usually blow it out straight except when I go to the beach, because the salty winds seem to bring out the best curls and waves in my hair.  This stuff is exactly like washing your hair and letting it air dry on the beach!  Gives great texture and an extra boost to my waves like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
    <li> Although this product is true to its claims and delivers, I recommend that this product be used sparingly and not daily. I have fine, limp hair and it created a lot of volume and texture but also made my hair look borderline frizzy and dry. (and my hair NEVER frizzes naturally, it usually hangs limp) I used it in conjunction with the hair thickening shampoo and hair spray, and I allowed it to dry naturally at first on my hair, using a blow dryer on a low heat setting to style once it was almost dry naturally, so I can&#x27;t blame the hair dryer for the dried out look. I also used the surf spray alone on my dry hair to style it with the same dried out results. My hair DID look much fuller and I will only use these products when I go out on the weekends and want to look extra special.&lt;br /&gt;Although I rarely use conditioner because it flattens my hair, I am going to buy the thickening hair conditioner to use in conjunction with the thickening shampoo+conditioner+surf spray+ thickening  hairspray to see if that will improve the dry, frizz hair results. I&#x27;ll keep you posted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.... Bought the B&amp;B thickening conditioner and my hair still dries out with this product. I think overall it is unhealthy to use on your hair. My hair never looked so frizzy after using this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this in search of a replacement for the John Frieda surf spray that was discontinued.  I have very thick wavy hair and the John Frieda product was perfect for volume and actually curled my hair.  The Bumble and Bumble added texture, but weighed my hair down.  It  actually pulled the wave out of it.  It left my hair very knotted and tacky feeling.  My biggest issue with this product and the reason for this review was washing it out.  I had to wash several times and use a massive amount of conditioner to do so. I lost so much hair from combing the tangles out WITH the conditioner still in my hair.  As I am writing this 20 minutes later my scalp is still tender.  Buyer beware! Especially those with wavy, curly or thick hair! Big ouch!</li>
    <li> I love how my hair looks after a day at the beach!&lt;br /&gt;This is the closest any purchased or homemade product has come to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus points for smelling awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it in place of other products before styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work equally well for men, I&#x27;ve caught my very short haired boyfriend using it often.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the best hair products I have every used. I&#x27;m almost out it&#x27;s time to buy some more!</li>
    <li> The product is very overpriced for it performance and amount. The product becomes super flaky like dandruff when dried in ones hair. I would recommend looking for another product more effective and price worthy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, but it&#x27;s so much easier to order online than have to go to my salon to get it.  Makes your hair full and really makes your styles last.</li>
    <li> This is great! Really~ I have curly hair and just recently had it cut shorter I have tried many products to get it to settle down. This does the trick nicely for me. Expensive yes worth it yup! All I do is spray it on and scrunch and go or blow dry as it is freezing here now.</li>
    <li> Amazing! A must buy!! Celebrities use it to keep hair still without gross hair gel! Definitely recommend it everyone! Bumble &amp; Bumble! &lt;3</li>
    <li> Its nice but works just as well as the cheaper brands. . There are also recipes online for homemade ones that work better</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is $25 everywhere, don&#x27;t pay more!  Like the product and would buy again. If you want this spray don&#x27;t buy it here unless it is priced at $25 or less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen many websites where you can make your own, but why mess with something when Bumble and Bumble have already perfected it for you. It works well. I find that a little bit goes a long ways. It smells a little funny when you spray it but not after your hair dries. Your hair feels soft and light, not weighed down or sticky. Overall, I enjoy it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have slightly wavy, thick, smooth hair and this gives it a great salty matte texture and brings out the wave. It works best if you spray it on your hair when it&#x27;s just starting to partially dry, depending on the texture you want. Some people hate that sticky matte feeling in their hair. If so, then use less or put it in when your hair is still really wet. You can use it on dry hair too but that&#x27;s a bit too sticky for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this on Amazon though. Why on earth are they charging double for only this B&amp;B product only on Amazon? A 4 oz bottle is only $23 in salons and on B&amp;B&#x27;s website! WTF?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can say that it leaves actual &amp;#34;beach waves&amp;#34;, but it gives a nice style to it. Really like it and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite, its great for wet hair or dry hair. It makes pretty waves, even in my very straight hair.</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair looks at the beach with a little salt spray in it, but this did not give the same results. Made my fine hair look limp and dirty.</li>
    <li> Overall the product really didn&#x27;t do much of anything, and I&#x27;m not the type of guy to use a diffuser or a hair dryer (which defeats the purpose of a product not damaging your hair).  I did not see anything about the application until after I bought the product, though I did read reviews about using it only on damp hair. Definitely not worth $25. If anyone wants me to mix up some salt water and sell it to them for $25, let me know: it would probably work</li>
    <li> I already had a spray for beachy waves that worked great. I bough this on the recommendation of my hair stylist, she said it was the best. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of it. It left my hair feeling greasy and the waves didn&#x27;t hold for long. I think that my cheaper producg it ALOT better. I&#x27;ll use this bottle up but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying another one.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product.  When I used it, I was disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t result in wavy, beach swept hair.  It made it a little rough and you could see the product coming out of your hair every time you would use your hands to reposition your hair.  Let down of a product...what a bummer</li>
    <li> Definitely adds volume and texture. I have fine, long hair that can be teased into waves, and this product (when used on dry hair) gives my hair the appearance of having been hot rollered and sprayed. It&#x27;s pretty sticky at first but  you can brush it out. This will diminish the volumizing effect somewhat but if you wanna run your fingers through your hair without getting snagged, it will need to be brushed first. On wet hair it has a bit of a dulling effect. I know people who use this almost as a dry shampoo, to slightly dry and fluff dirty hair but add shine (which dry shampoo will not do).</li>
    <li> Thick/Fine Hair: What I mean by that, is fine hair (aka, the diameter of the follicle is smaller than average-like most natural blondes), with thick hair (aka, a person with a lot of hair follicles on a given area). In other words, I have a TON of hair, but each strand is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a SLIGHT natural wave that really only happens if I go to bed with wet hair, otherwise, my hair dries mostly straight because of how heavy it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hair tends to get oily quickly, and because I have very long hair (hits mid-back/waist) I have trouble holding some hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surf Spray: I have tried at least 6 \\&quot;beach wave hair&#x27; type products. This is the ONLY one that works for me. I get a ton of compliments and my hair looks great all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: pricy, I have to use quite a bit of the product because of how much hair I have; I can&#x27;t use it sparingly or it won&#x27;t work; and I wish they had an aerosol bottle-my fingers start to hurt pressing the pump down so many time to apply it to my hair.</li>
    <li> Surf spray adds great texture to my thin hair, allowing me to use heat styling more effectively</li>
    <li> Love this spray! Just wish it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair so much :/</li>
</ol>
