<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased the Fromm Razor Strop 2 1/2&amp;#34; X 23 and it seems to do a good job keeping the razor&#x27;s edge sharpened.</li>
    <li> This is my first strop, but it arrived with no quality issues and works surprisingly well to keep sharp edges straight for kitchen knives.  I did add a few drops of Neatsfoot oil just on principle, but it breaks in fast.</li>
    <li> I am still a beginner when it comes to using a straight razor, tho I may have mastered it by now. My stropping technique is a little shaky, but, using this regularly has kept my razor pretty sharp</li>
    <li> This was a very fine strop for the price. I hone and restore straight razors and I feel these strops will hang in there with many costing much more.  A well made bargain product that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought this before buying the strop with green compound rubbed on.  I assumed this strop would work well with fixed blade convex knives.  The stop with green compound works better.  I would probably recommend this for straight razors.</li>
    <li> Good quality leather and fine canvas. Overall good quality strop</li>
    <li> I got this for my first straight razor and found that if you can use it right there is no problem. I&#x27;ve knicked it and whatever but it works fine just add some strop dressing and your good to go.</li>
    <li> leather is defective--lumpy/not smooth</li>
    <li> This seems to be an OK strop. I really have no experince with stropping other than with this one. It seems about 1/2\\&quot; thinner than it should be for my razor, and I really don&#x27;t get the bull&#x27;s head embossed at the top -- it just reduces the useful length of the strop. It also seems to twist slightly when I hold it taut. The finishing on the edges is uneven and the thing is really pretty ugly, but my razor is still shaving well, so I guess it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
    <li> tl:dr - \\&quot;Great decorative item or commemorative gift\\&quot; translates as, \\&quot;Not suitable for actual stropping your straight razors\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of good reviews on this item so I may have simply gotten a lemon, but this is why I rate it so low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It came heavily cupped, making it unable to strop a razor at all.&lt;br /&gt;2) Stiff as a board, (made correcting the cupping a real pain).&lt;br /&gt;3) It was waxed too heavily, it had no grab whatsoever on my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;4) It came with no instructions on breaking in a strop, when it so desperately needed it.&lt;br /&gt;5) Useless bull&#x27;s head imprint means 5 inches less of usable strop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know what cupping is, it is where the edges of the strop are raised higher than the rest, so when you strop the only parts of the blade that actually touch the strop are the toe and heel.  To correct this, I had to do a lot of research online to find ways of flattening the surface without damaging it, and put in about 4 hours of work over a few days time to finally get it into a state that where it would actually strop the whole of my blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the cupping, it was waxed too heavily so it didn&#x27;t grab the razor at all when I finally did get it flat.  This involved more research and treatment to correct.  Meanwhile I can&#x27;t shave because I can&#x27;t properly strop my razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t give it 1 star because after all the work I put into it to make it usable, it does a decent job, and probably will get better with time.  It was simply unusable out of the box, with no instruction on how get it in appropriate condition.  This was the real deal breaker for me.  If an item needs breaking in or conditioning, fine, but that needs to be part of the product description, or at least come with information on how to get it into proper condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Don&#x27;t buy unless you are willing to put in a couple days treating this strop to get it in a usable condition.  I&#x27;ve since foundthat even the best strop makers have plain strops that are not much more expensive than this one, do yourself a favor and get one of those.</li>
    <li> Works great after I sharpen a knife on a ceramic rod.</li>
    <li> I purchased this strop while looking for a second strop to use, in order to allow me to try out some pastes.  My original came with the set when I purchased my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This strop is significantly nicer.  It has a rather long usable area compared to my other strop and others I have seen.  Unlike some other reviewers stated, the logo on the one I received was not too large and did not interfere with the use of the strop.  Strop was shipped by Amazon.com in a long sturdy box, so it was not rolled up or twisted like I was worried about when I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather side is flat and smooth.  The canvas side is stiff and flat as well.  The handles are comfortable, the hardware is secure.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more out of a strop, and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay the prices some places ask for &#x27;nicer&#x27; strops that I would not consider nice than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets not forget how BASIC a strop really is.  Honestly, if you have a nice heavy leather belt it would work just as well (Ive talked to people who do this actually, with good results).  This is just easier due to the handles and hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking here, dont hesitate to buy this one.  Price is better than you will find elsewhere and dont be fooled by the price, this is a quality item.</li>
    <li> This strop is a good beginners strop.  Doesn&#x27;t cost too much.  So, you won&#x27;t cry when you nick and slice it up!  (You will.)  Once you are better, you can reorder this strop (for it will do well), or a better strop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of advice though.  If you intend on pasting your strop with abrasives like Dovo Red and Black paste, or Chromium Oxide, use balsa wood for your strop for the first few months.  Then, start using a leather strop when you are less likely to newbie fashion destroy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a 4 inch by 3 foot balsa wood strip at a hobby store, cut in half, and use it as is.  No need to paste the balsa to anything.</li>
    <li> This is a quality strop that is wide enough so you do not have to do the &amp;#34;X&amp;#34; stropping pattern. Leather is thick and flat (no crowning or dipping) that creates high or low points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to straight razor shaving, but I think this strop would benefit from some conditioning.</li>
    <li> When I got this, it was as hard as a rock.  No oil, cream, or careful rubbing could make this thing any softer. What&#x27;s worse, the strop was uneven, with creases running down the length.  It seems as if this was rotting somewhere in a warehouse in Arizona for a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s simply not suitable for a razor.  They only practical use for this is either as a decoration or a means of abusing pledges in a fraternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this one at all costs.</li>
    <li> The Only thing I like more than how well this product works is that it is made in the U.S.A.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a nice strop at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It was as represented. Good quality!</li>
    <li> Itwas a gift to my Grandson and he was&lt;br /&gt;thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer here stated, this strop needs some work to get it to the point of offering adaquate draw.  Used as is from the box it was shipped in, this strop is too fast for my likes.  I bought it to strop straight razors I shave with.  At first I tried adding some shave soap lather to the top of the leather component.  That did virtually nothing to slow it up.  Next up was to use a pumice stone to sand the leather a bit.  That helped but what really got this strop to draw was adding neatsfoot oil to the leather then using the flat side of a coffee mug to press the oil into the leather.  I used the coffee mug handle to hold onto the mug and pressed for all I was worth as the strop was laid out on a countertop, moving slowly from one end to the other.  You may find you&#x27;ll need to add oil to the leather in several applications, I did.  Note!, I used the vertical side of the coffee mug, not the bottom.  Some like fast strops.  If you do, this strop is perfect, but if you are like me and want some draw when stropping, you&#x27;ll have to work some leather conditioner or neatsfoot oil into the leather before using.  Worth mentioning...if you do add oil or another leather conditioner to the leather, you&#x27;ll want to remove the linen fabric component first so the oil you add to the leather will not be absorbed by the linen.  Easy enough to do, there is one screw at the top of the strop holding both components together via a clamp</li>
    <li> Used for the second reason for owning one.  Just hang it up, behavior improves immediately.  Top quality at a great price!</li>
    <li> It works well, the linen is quite stiff and needs to be used quite a bit for it to feel comfortable.  The handles are soft and don&#x27;t provide enough support for the strop when you hold it out firmly.  The leather is of decent quality but as someone else mentioned- the logo is large which reduces the space you have to do actual stropping.  I bought Fromm Strop Dressing with this and that made a world of difference- the leather holds the blade ever so slightly (if that&#x27;s the term to use) so you know you&#x27;re getting good contact.  So for a working strop this is okay- buy it if you can&#x27;t get into a more expensive one.  It works!  The shipping from this company was great, they sent it in a long box so it wasn&#x27;t bent up when I opened it. Good thought to packaging, I appreciate that!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and was just as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Appears to be of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend to round out a Christmas present and he loves it! We just tied it to our towel rack and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fanatical about my kitchen knives and keep them arm-shaving sharp with a stone and a ceramic rod.  I thought I&#x27;d play with a strop to see if I could make it do anything.  It does, sometimes.  Life is a learning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
    <li> Gets my straight shave-ready every time! I definitely recommend this strop. Great price and great results!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received this strop. I thought it would say Fromm as the description says etc. However, it does not. It says Illinois Razor Strop Co. Chicago. Did Fromm make this or not? Somewhat misleading if you ask me.</li>
    <li> This is my second razor strop.  My first strop was a Col. Conk strop that came with a straight razor starter kit.  This strop is of very high quality.  The leather is wide and very smooth.  There is the animal&#x27;s head imprint on the leather but it is not in the way.  The linen side is the same width as the leather and works great before final stropping on the leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t claim to be an expert on all things concerning straight razor shaving but this strop does everything I need to get my straight razor ready for my morning shave.</li>
    <li> Strop works really good. This is my first strop so I can not compare it to others, but the design is pretty sturdy. I have been using it for a while now and it holds up to sharpening my blade. The leather was a little stiff at first, but using it a couple times I has loosened it and made it easier to refine the blade. Would suggest it to others</li>
    <li> Works great, I&#x27;m just a beginner but its exactly what I needed, couldn&#x27;t have gotten a strop for a better price.</li>
    <li> its a nice looking strop but I feel like I nicked it up pretty easy and I was really trying to be gentle. Yes I&#x27;m new to the whole stropping but i&#x27;ve even watched demos and stropped as they are and still nicked it.</li>
    <li> After using this for the 3rd and final time the leather actually started peeling off!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Oh and the thing is stiffer than hardwood.</li>
    <li> Strop is wide enough for beginners to use without being unwieldy. The swivel clip at the top secured easily to our door hinge in the bathroom, providing a great location to strop the straight razor as well as a place to store the strop.</li>
    <li> My older brother has my grandfathers&#x27; staight razors that he used in his barber profession in the 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s and he misplaced the strop.  So, I saw this on Amazon and purchased it for him at Christmas.  He told me that he didn&#x27;t know they made them anymore.  He said it was as good quality or better than the one that he had from my grandfather.</li>
    <li> A little short, but it sure does the trick. No need to spend lots of money on a strop. A strop is just a simple piece of leather. This one does the job great</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased a Dovo best quality straight razor and bought this along with it.  I don&#x27;t have any previous experience with stropping, but this strop seems to work just fine.  I like that I have the option of using the canvas which I understand it useful in getting a sharper edge, particularly when the blade has been used a bit.  I do wish the clasp at the top was larger, but if needed I can always attach a carabiner or something to it.  The width and length are perfect for the razor I have.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted to strop and polish my knives.  Ready to use right away - keeps my blades razor sharp.  Good value.</li>
    <li> such a nice strop  feels like we paid TOP dollar.</li>
    <li> The person that we purchaased this for has been very satisfied with our purchase.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a cheap strop for my straight razor and I found this one on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say it&#x27;s one of the better strops I&#x27;ve used and for the price it&#x27;s impossible to compare to other strops of the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather is excellent quality, helped me when I was honing my seventy-year-old blade and helped align it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The canvas keeps my hone on my blade fresh and I haven&#x27;t needed to hone it again since purchasing the strop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Top quality leather! I was very impressed with this item right out of the box! Highly recommended for any serious shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly good strop and a great value for the price. Unfortunatley, people don&#x27;t do enough research before jumping into the straight razor shaving world and wind up not getting a strop until their razor is too dull to shave with.  Then they get this brand new strop that isn&#x27;t broken in and, coupled with their inexperience with stropping, can&#x27;t get it to make their razor shave-ready with little to no effort. When you order it, go ahead and order some Fromm Strop Dressing with it and know that you&#x27;re going to put the dressing on and wait 24 hours before you can strop your razor. Check out videos on youtube (for starters, look for GeoFatBoy, he&#x27;s got good demonstration videos) for developing your technique. This is a USA made product, even though the company has been bought out by Fromm (the strop still says Illinois Razor Strop Co on the handle).</li>
    <li> I would have given this item a Five Star Rating if it wasn&#x27;t for my over kill construction ideals. I like my stuff a little on the heavy side as in you would possibly hang from the type of swivel I would like on this strop. The leather is great; the other material appears to be sturdy as well. I like that you can replace the straps if you would like to but for the price and quality of the leather you could purchase another by the time you need it. The only non issue I have a pet peeve I have is the swivel appears on the dainty side but maybe it will prove me wrong. I still would not hesitate to purchase another one if I needed a strop.</li>
    <li> The title of this review says it all; \\&quot;I told you so!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the metal components of this Illinois Strop are good looking, the stuff that counts, like the leather used for stropping for example, are not. The other posters for this item were right on the money. The leather is hard and warped and cupped. In no time, your straight razor will need to be honed; count on it. Do yourself and your wallet a favor - now and later, spend a bit more and get a strop that works and is of good quality; example, the American Made strop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you read the description and recommendations for the Illinois 127 strop, you&#x27;ll think, ah - they recommend using the strop dressing. Perhaps that will soften and flatten out the strop and it will work just fine. Not! (Take it from me as I know first hand.) The leather is too curved and too hard even after 4 applications of the dressing you buy separately. (The leather was hard and warped and cupped even before applying the dressing.) As I said, the hardware is nice - but not as heavy gauge as it should be. (The American Made has some real heavy hardware, 3 inch width and plenty long enough to strop - 17 inches. I paid about 10$ more for it and no dressing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Illinois 127 strop I bought is now a great decoration that&#x27;s hanging somewhere in my house... I forget just where though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I don&#x27;t sell American Made products; I just know a good thing and like to share with others to check out so they don&#x27;t waste 50$ for this strop and the dressing that&#x27;s recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert when it comes to strops and straight razors, but if you are a knife collector (as I am) a strop is a must-have for finishing off those knives and getting a razor edge.  This does exactly that, and does it well.  Plus it is a good price, made in the USA, and is eligible for Amazon Prime shipping.  You can&#x27;t beat this, get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2¢</li>
    <li> My first strop, I couldn&#x27;t be happier w/ it. Did the job just as I expected and will keep a keen edge on your blade.</li>
    <li> Some buyers have apparently had issues with these strops, such as the surface not being nice and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine arrived in very good shape and seems quite flat.  The hanging hardware seems sturdy.  I prepped the leather with the Fromm strop polish and started using it straight away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with this product, would buy it again if needed and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Poor - Almost good, but had 2-3 waves (cupping) down the right side of the leather - about 3/4 of the way down.  Have been trying to condition the leather, press and hold under a stack of books, etc to try to get it to flatten out.  Not sure if the problem came from the factory, fro incorrect storage, or incorrect shipping, but it is not very functional as delivered.  How hard can it be to create a flat piece of leather.</li>
    <li> Use it very often. This is just like you use to see hanging from the back of the Barbers&#x27;s chair. Well worth the money</li>
    <li> This is a very nice strop. Top quality leather that is thick and flat. The linen side seems a bit stiffer than the leather side and looks resilient. The stitching around the handle doesn&#x27;t look that sturdy but I pulled on it pretty hard and it didn&#x27;t budge. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the jinky looking hanger, but it didn&#x27;t bend when I put some weight on it so I am convinced its going to last a long time. There are better strops out there but good luck finding one for this price.</li>
    <li> strops are way too pricey - this one is priced affordably and works just great</li>
    <li> This review is for the illinois #127 Strop (which I believe is this one?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This strop is a little rough around the edges but with a little work it turned out better than some more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the surface of the leather was a little crumbly and had a few small imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a light sanding with Wet/Dry 500 grit paper with a square block behind it to even and smooth it out.  Sanding was very light so no particles would come off the paper and get into the leather, and also only enough to even out the surface a little taking off some of the dark color but not going all the way through to the lighter suede or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then quickly rinsed the strop under water and quickly wiped the water off with a paper towel so it wouldn&#x27;t soak in too much.  Wiped most of the dark surface residue off and let it dry for about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came back and rubbed a very small amount of neatsfoot oil onto my palm and then evenly and very sparingly across the strop. (I&#x27;m sure face/forehead grease would work just as well if not better but take a bit longer to apply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then Rubbed a rounded piece of smooth wood up and down the surface lightly for a while, while I watched TV.  Then worked it with my palm and thumbs for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that I have a nice supple piece of leather,  It&#x27;s stiff enough not to cause the blade to round, but soft enough to grab the razor evenly and have a medium resistance to the draw.  The surface is smooth but matte so it feels nice to run the razor over it.  Overall it&#x27;s perfect for me and even though I typed a lot above it really wasn&#x27;t that much work.  Before this I scrubbed the cloth strip with a wet sponge and ran that piece of wood back and forth over it for a while as well.  The cloth strip was somewhat hard.  Anyway now both pieces are perfect, and I like this strop more than more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried, or my horsebutt strop (which I don&#x27;t like at all because even though it&#x27;s a smooth nice piece of leather, the skin is so thin on it that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it evenly grips the razor across the bevel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This strop definitely isn&#x27;t a luxury strop from the get go, it&#x27;s a budget strop, but with a half hour of your time (most of which you can watch TV for) you can make it perform like one.  If you get one that&#x27;s so damaged that the surface is full of large nicks that wont sand out with a few passes of sandpaper or wrinkles from being folded (which are worse)  then just send it back.  It happens.  If it&#x27;s lightly uneven in a few places and has some minor scratches that a few swipes of paper will take care of,  I would suggest doing that process anyway.  It makes the surface a lot nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To anyone concerned about losing the natural silicates in the surface of the cow skin, just don&#x27;t sand a lot, the surface skin part is like a mm thick or something, you don&#x27;t have to go all the way through it to the suede.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;m by no means a strop or leather expert, but I found this a great strop.  Good luckcause even though it&#x27;s a smooth nice piece of leather, the skin is so thin on it that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it evenly grips the razor across the bevel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This strop definitely isn&#x27;t a luxury strop from the get go, it&#x27;s a budget strop, but with a half hour of your time (most of which you can watch TV for) you can make it perform like one.

Good luck</li>
    <li> After reading the one negative review, I was a little nervous- but I had no reason to be.  The strop was shipped in a 4&amp;#34;x4&amp;#34;x32&amp;#34; box and arrived perfectly flat.  The materials and construction are excellent.  This strop has four stropping surfaces, two sides of the substantial linen strop (with it&#x27;s own leather handle) and the two sides of the thick, perfectly flat leather.  The two parts are held together with a brassy swivel clamp that is secured with a knurled nut and a little carriage bolt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I care a lot for my razors and knives, and for a production piece, this is the nicest strop I&#x27;ve seen.  I&#x27;ll probably treat one side of the linen with green chromium, and if the leather ever needs some attention I&#x27;ll give it a light smear of mink oil and a light pass with a heat gun (on low) or hairdryer to wick the oil in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignore the negative review.  The problems he mentioned have clearly been addressed.</li>
    <li> This is large enough to work well and attaches firmly to a hook in the wall. Did a lot of research and the full leather side and linen side (two belts, back to back) are both great for keeping the edge on a straight razor.</li>
    <li> Terrific quality leather and canvas strop combo.  I use this to remove burs from sharpened edges on everything between steep angled kitchen and hunting knives to axes, hatchets - even chisels.  Nice swivel hardware.  I am exceptionally pleased with the quality and function of this strop.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants a professional edge to a sharpened surface,</li>
    <li> I purchased this strop Illinois 127 for a woman I work with as part of a Father&#x27;s Day present for her husband to get started using a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good basic strop to start out with. There are better strops out there but are much more expensive. I&#x27;ve found that 99.9% of all beginner straight razor users WILL cut and nick a strop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an Illinois 827 that is my go to strop right after honing a razor, I do finish up and use as my daily strop a Straight Razor Designs #1 with English Bridle Leather and Neil Miller Genuine Linen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this strop for anyone interested in using it for straight razor shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it came in a 3\\&quot; width as it&#x27;s easier to use on straights especially for those just learning.</li>
    <li> As a newbie to razor honing I felt like this item required a little bit more skill to use. I left this at a 3 because I am sure others use it just fine. For me it was not an easy concept (also I did not have a convenient place to hang this in my bathroom.) Now i have a paddle strop!</li>
    <li> Great product. Just work the leather soft by hand.</li>
    <li> Abysmal. Unusable even after a week&#x27;s worth of work. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Great strop but the icon towards the top reduces the amount of travel room when stropping. Also, it was a bid bowed side to side, but I think it will flatten out with time.</li>
    <li> If you use a straight razor, you need a strop.  This is a strop- nothing fancy, just good hard linen on one side and nice smooth leather on the other.  The price is right on this one, and it leaves my razor with a perfect edge every time.</li>
    <li> This is the first strop I have ever owned and I am impressed.  It will take a sharp knife and make it sharp enough to split atoms, or at least hairs.  I usually sharpen knifes up to 6000 grit, almost a mirror polish, and at that point they cut hanging paper with ease, but after stroping they just glide through the paper.  As I said this is the first strop I&#x27;ve owned so I have little to compare it to, but it seems very high quality for the price.  The handles are on really straight with even stitching around, and the clip at the top is pretty sturdy.  The leather is kind of hard and slippery out of the box so I bought some dressing,[[ASIN:B001DYHMK8 Fromm Strop Dressing, 4-Ounce Bottle]], and it seems to soften the leather a little and grab the edge of the blade better.  I would highly recommend this strop, and because of the quality with a little care it should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This strop is really for decorative purposes only, unless you plan on putting a few hours a night work into it just to get it into working condition.  As a previous user mentioned, their are better strops that don&#x27;t require the effort at similar prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up replacing this strop with an Imperial Russian leather strop made by the same company (Illinois) and was quite happy with my switch.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. It works. Could have been better.</li>
    <li> This strop is of good quality at a great price. It is easily as good as ones sold for 3 times the price. It came to me in a large box, no wrinkles in the leather and ready to strop out of the box, no conditioner of softening necessary. Very Satisfied.</li>
    <li> My first strop. Looks to be a very high quality strop at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Nice quality starter strop.&lt;br /&gt;Value for the price.  As a beginer didn&#x27;t want to spend more until a learned some technique</li>
    <li> I FIRST NOTICED THAT THE HARDWARE IS NOT THE GREATEST BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO BREAK AND IT DOES THE JOB IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. THE LEATHER IS A REALLY HIGH QUALITY NAPA LEATHER AND NICE AND THICK. THIS IS GREAT FOR ANYONE TO USE AND NOT A BEGGINERS STROP. THERE IS NO SUCH THING.A BEGINNER NEEDS A STROP JUST LIKE THE SEASONED USER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A REVISED REVIEW I ALREADY DELETED MY FIRST REVIEW??. A THREE INCH STROP IS EASIER TO USE BUT THEN YOU NEED TO CONSIDER CUPPING. THE WIDER THE STROP THE MORE CHANCE OF CUPPING. SO THIS IS FINE AT 2.5 INCHES. I PURCHASED A BUFFALO BRAND STROP FROM ROYAL SHAVE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOIULD BE BETTER BECAUSE OF THE PRICE TAG(150.00) THE HARDWARE LOOKED BETTER BUT THE LEATHER WAS TERRIBLE AND IT HAD A DEFECT IN IT. I RETURNED IT BUT THAT WAS A NIGHTMARE. THAT EXPERIENCE ALONE WAS A WAKE UP CALL AND I REALIZED WHAT A BARGAIN THIS STROP REALLY WAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOUR NEW TO WET SHAVING WITH A STRAIGHT EDGE? YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT A STROP IS PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN A HONE. HAVING A STROP IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY!!!!! A STONE IS NOT BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS SEND YOUR RAZOR OUT TO GET SHARPENNED EVERY 3-6 MONTHS BUT YOU WILL NEED TO STROP YOUR RAZOR BEFORE AND AFTER EVERY SHAVE. AFTER SHAVING IS JUST A GOOD WAY TO MAKE SURE YOUR EDGE IS DRY BECAUSE THE STROP WILL WICK AWAY ANY MOISTURE IF STILL PRESENT. ALSO USE A PAPER TOWEL TO DRY YOUR BLADE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN YOU STROP YOUR RAZOR THERE IS NO NEED TO BE FAST ABOUT IT. TAKE YOUR TIME AND DO IT RIGHT AND TRY NOT TO CUT YOUR STROP. SEVEN ROUND TRIPS ON THE CANVAS SIDE AND FIFTY ROUND TRIPS ON THE SMOOTH LEATHER SIDE. LIGHT PRESSURE BUT NOT FEATHER WEIGHT PRESSURE. HANG YOUR STROP AT A HEIGHT SOMEWHERE AROUND THE HEIGHT OF YOUR BELLY BUTTON. SPEED WILL DEVELOPE OVER TIME. YOUR MAIN CONCERN IS DOING IT RIGHT. WHEN YOU NICK YOUT STROP ON THE SIDES IF IT IS A PROBLEM JUST SAND IT DOWN WITH SANDPAPER UNTIL IT IS SMOOTH. I HAVE NICKS ON MY STROP AND I DON\\&quot;T DO ANYTHING TO REMOVE THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK AND REMEMBER THIS IS A GREAT STROP REGARDLESS OF YOUR EXPERIENCE LEVEL. ALSO YOU MAY WANT TO RUB STROP DRESSING ON IT TOO.</li>
    <li> This is my first Strop. It is well worth the 30 bucks I paid for it. I figured it was a good middle of the road Strop to start with. One that if it got damaged I would not worry about it. When I master the use of the Strop I would buy a more expensive one. However if I do need to replace it I will probably order this same Strop.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed!  Excellent quality and the perfect size strop for my sharpening needs!  Arrived promptly and straight, not rolled up.  Ready for use!</li>
    <li> The strop looks and works great. I cannot wait to hang it up. In addition to being a great tool, it will be a nice decoration and conversation piece.</li>
    <li> As a beginner straight razor user I knew very little about strops other than the youtube videos demonstrating how to use one. The number of reviews coupled with the favourable ratings convinced me to buy this strop despite the low price. I soon found out that the reviewers That rated this product know what they&#x27;re writing about. All the symptoms were present. Hard leather, warping, &amp;#34;cupping&amp;#34; as one writer described in which the middle of the strop bellies vertically causing only the tip and end of the razor to touch. I thought this was expected so I went ahead and put my brand knew hart steel to the belt. I realized after a few shaves that this could not be normal. I will likely have to send my razor for honing. It gets one star since unlike other buyers, I don&#x27;t have the patience to bring this strop to condition and therefore it&#x27;s useless to me.</li>
    <li> The first thing involves the shipping, It showed up in a fairly large box so the strop only had a slight curve during shipping.  This was very appreciated since once I hung it up it straightened right up.  Before use I used some strop dressing and then waited a full day because I had heard it could effect the razor&#x27;s finish.  Even though the length is limited because of the logo at the top it does work really well for a first strop.  especially since it has plenty of slight nicks etc...since I am still learning.  Also as others have stated it is an Illinois Co Strop.  Definitely worth the money, and I am not that worried about cutting it.</li>
    <li> the length and width of the strop are quite generous. I got good feed back and results during my strop. The canvas is a good material with and without paste.</li>
    <li> Linen side was good, leather was very poor and uneven. I ended up making my own leather side instead of returning.</li>
    <li> Nice strop.  AKA Illinois Strop.  The clip and swivel at the end are too cheap.  You&#x27;ll probably end up replacing them</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with Fromm’s strop that I recently purchased. I can understand some customers being dissatisfied with the strops out of the box condition. It is not ready to use right of. I took the advice of another reviewers comment and have used 600-grit sandpaper to lighten the color of the leather and texture, rinsed with water and dried, and sanded again with an 800-grit sandpaper to give it some extra smoothness. Make sure to sand carefully to avoid removing too much of the leather. I have been applying Fromm’s 364 Strop dressing once a day—for three days now—allowing it to dry over night and continue to use a steel roller to flatten it. As of day three the strop is breaking in nicely and is as smooth as can be. I will continue to apply the dressing and rolling it because this is a beautiful strop I plan on getting a lot of use out of it. I strongly recommend this product to anyone who is on the fence about purchasing it. I am new to straight razor shaving, however I have enjoyed taking the time to break in the stop properly.</li>
    <li> this strop could not be used since the leather had rolls and dips in it right out of the box. Tried in vain to straighten it out with strop dressing to no avail. Ended up spending more money to purchase a new one of a different brand that works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> looking forward to using it over time.  quite impressed so far</li>
    <li> It is what it is, looking back I probably should have gotten a 3&amp;#34; wide strop simply for ease of use.</li>
    <li> this was a great gift for my friend.  he loved it.  he says it works great and said it was the best gift he got.</li>
    <li> not bad for knives and such. the leather is not flat or straight though. i read other reviews, thought id try it anyway. but yeah, others were right, definitely not for straight razors, way too warped.</li>
    <li> it works, but you need to buy the compound to rub on it.if you are going to use it a lot get a lot of the compound. mine also came with a nylon linen type strop that i don&#x27;t use. If you have an old belt you could probably try that first,but you still need the compound. I use mine to give a nice finish to some knives. I do not use it on a straight razor&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&#x3D; After a few weeks of using this getting to use it on a couple different blades,I am sure you can use an old leather belt or if you have any kind of leather you can use it for knife or axe work. the coumpound is what you need to buy and the leather should be glued with the finished side down on a piece of wood or other hard material. I can get my blades razor sharp with a sharpening stone wet or diamond. but the leather and coumpound gives the blade edge a smoother sharp feel.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my father, who is a trapping enthusiast. One notable thing is the fact that this was shipped properly for what it is. The integrity of the leather is compromised if folded or packed incorrectly for shipping. Fromm International horseshoed the product in a large box so that the leather&#x27;s integrity was intact. Constructed well, and keeps the edge supreme!</li>
    <li> works well, arrived with a scratch in it but tolerable</li>
    <li> For the price this strop does a great job does what I expected and more I put it in the category of the higher price strops</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just starting out and a few guys said to start with this one, I nicked it the first time I tried to go fast, not the products fault, lol, it has worked very well, I will never buy another cartridge razor again...</li>
    <li> The leather side of this strop was and still is warped-even after treating with dressing and pressing it flat for several days under the pressure of a flat surface. I do like the linen side of the strop, and do use that side, however the uneven surface of the leather side makes it useless for stropping razors. Spend the extra money and buy a good strop ($60-90.00) to begin with.</li>
    <li> First this is NOT a Fromm strop.  It is however a quality Illinois #127 strop at a great price.  Was everything I needed. I was impressed with how soft this one was right out of the box.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son, who started using a straight razor. After reading reviews on the many different strops available I decided that this one seemed to be a very good value. It arrived within a couple of days and was just as advertized. My son is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like it and use the strop a lot to finish my knives off when I&#x27;m sharpening them but it&#x27;s not a great peace of leather.  I won&#x27;t be buying another one when i wear this one out.</li>
    <li> Works as intended. No assembly required, unless you feel the need to apply chrome oxide to one side of the linen. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more out of a strop</li>
    <li> I think this strop damaged my razor...  It is not flat and I ended up buying a more expensive one that makes a world of difference.</li>
    <li> This strop did what I needed it to do, which was to help me perfect my stropping technique on an old 2.5&amp;#34; straight razor.  The leather wasn&#x27;t perfectly smooth, it has several deep crevasses in it, the strop also came packaged in a box half it&#x27;s length so it took a few days of hanging  for it to completely in-curl.  The reverse side takes Chromium Oxide paste well and works decent.  All in all this product is not bad, but it&#x27;s definitely worth spending like 80 bucks and getting a high quality hanging strop from Straight Razor Designs or some place like that.</li>
    <li> great quality, works like it should</li>
    <li> I just got into straight razor shaving and this is a fantastic starter strop for what I need.</li>
    <li> Great strop. Arrived without any cupping or anything. Just a nice, plain strop.</li>
    <li> I got this strop a little while ago and it has been hiding up very well to these novice hands. It arrived well packaged. I made a few knicks and they were easily fixed. The leather if supple but not too soft. I loaded one side of the linin with paste which has worked out well. I will buy another when/if I wear this one out. Oh, I aIso like how you can unscrew and flip sides easily</li>
    <li> I received the product ontime....nice job! Its a very nice product; the leather/nylon combo is good quality and has been a great pleasure to work with. I expected a lesser quality for the price, but on the contrary, its awesome! Nice job, Fromm!</li>
    <li> It came flat, and is in great condition. I am learning, so maybe I don&#x27;t know enough, but it seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> It looks, smells and tastes like a strop but requires some treatment to make into a superb strop but is functional in its natural state.</li>
    <li> I must echo another user&#x27;s issue with this strop.  There is an imprint in the leather that really does decrease your stropping area.  The linen side of the strop seems to work fine.  My strop did not have any issues with cupping, though.  When my blade is flat on the leather (both the spine and the blade), I do not see any gaps along the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip to attach the hanging strop also seems a little weak.  I&#x27;ll probably be buying a different strop in the coming months.  I can keep this one to teach my sons how to strop in another decade or so.</li>
    <li> This strop is just as good as strops that cost double.  I would encourage people who are just starting out stropping straight razors to purchase two of these.  Why?&lt;br /&gt;I learned the hard way as a result of slicing my first strop up as I learned to strop.</li>
    <li> Ok starter Strop.  Canvas works great but leather is too soft.  Nicks easy but cheap.  Buy this one or cheaper ones to practice on before using higher quality strops.</li>
    <li> Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Relatively inexpensive way to sharpen your razors. Provides a very nice clean shave every time on different brands of razors,  disposable and otherwise.  While I have never used this Strop to sharpen a traditional straight razor, I am sure that it can handle the task. I have used this particular Strop for over a year and it extends the lifespan of my razors for several months.  This has cut down on razor purchases and I now buy a multi pack of Gillette razors for 2-3 years instead of just 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was concerned that razors would cause too much irritation due to their age,  but I found a very handy trick: moisturize your skin BEFORE shaving. You see, the little blue or green strips on the razors are lotion to keep the razor from irritating your skin. That is why a new razor feels so good,  that moisturizer keeps the razor gliding smooth. So, sharpen your razor with this Strop,  lotion up and then happy shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Sharpens variety of razors,  disposable and non&lt;br /&gt;-Saves money&lt;br /&gt;-Extends Life of razors&lt;br /&gt;-Durability: &amp;#62;1 Year&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to master&lt;br /&gt;-Hook allows stability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-If razor sharpened wrong way, can flake off leather,  damage Strop&lt;br /&gt;-Must attach to something steady&lt;br /&gt;-Takes getting used to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Useful Feature:&lt;br /&gt;The hook to attach the Strop. Luckily I had the perfect railing to attach the Strop in my closet.  But,  the hook is very small so you may have to be creative where it is placed. The hook is not only useful but necessary, I would not suggest lying on the counter top to sharpen, much of the reason this Strop works is dues to friction against the leather.</li>
    <li> Bought this from Zali and contrary to other reviews it arrived in a nice LONG box, perfectly flat and not cupped or anything. I don&#x27;t find the logo to be in the way at all when stropping my razors. The leather has a nice grab to it and my blades stay nice and sharp.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Amazon Trader / experience. Highly Reccomend.</li>
    <li> The leather and canvas are fine, but all the other hardware is SUPER cheap. I wish I would not have bought this one.</li>
    <li> Awesome strop! I purchased an old straight razor from an antique shop and used this strop on it and it definitely have the blade a nice sharp edge. You can spend big money on a strop but this one will work just fine.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband to use with his new straight razor (a beginner). It works great enough, and I will upgrade to something nicer later on. It was an anniversary gift that he had been asking for, and I&#x27;m glad I found this one at a decent price.</li>
    <li> Awesome strop. So far it&#x27;s lasted through 5 years of armature straight razor sharpening. Would totally recommend.</li>
    <li> A good strop. I have had no issues with this strop and am happy with its quality</li>
    <li> Received this strop today and it has a hole in the leather just about in the middle. Maybe the text should include &amp;#34;You may receive a second quality item&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It works great on my so-so knives.  It does make bunch of scratches on the damascus of my nice knives.  Since then, it becomes less useful.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this gift! He has been wanting the whole set up for quite a while now. I got him everything. Straightedge and all!</li>
