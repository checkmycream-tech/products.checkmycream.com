<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I use it once a week, and it leaves my skin soft and glowing. I really like it alot!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it said it was good for acne problems. It made me break out very heavily and I don&#x27;t even have bad acne. This product made it worse. Very disappointed because I was so excited about it.</li>
    <li> It goes on nicely, feels great, smells pleasant, easy to wash off, can&#x27;t say enough good things! I am super impressed with it, it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking clear.</li>
    <li> This mud is awesome. I love the way it smells. I don&#x27;t know what it is. It smells like something you would experience at a salon. It is a product you use 1 to 2 times a week for 15-20 minutes and then wash off. There is no testing of animals which is important.The ingredients are impressive too. Here are some of the ingredients: Dead Sea mud, shea butter, sunflower oil, aloe vera juice, glycelin,and  jojoba oil to list a few. I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> What an amazing product.. it goes on easy and actually has a decent smell. I love the way my skin felt after I washed it off. I recommend it definitely.</li>
    <li> Love this face mud. I use it once a week and my face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Left my skin feeling great afterwards.</li>
    <li> I used a discount code on this product in return, I am giving my unbiased opinion. I really liked this mask. I try and use the mask once a week at least and so far have used it only 4 times, but it smelled better than some I&#x27;ve tried and it was really relaxing.</li>
    <li> really good product! pulls out gunk in skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times now and it leaves my face feeling SO smooth and silky that I will be ordering another jar when this one is gone.</li>
    <li> I like this mask, but not certain I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin.  I do like that when it dries it isn&#x27;t all hard and cracked like other clay masks I&#x27;ve used, but it does take some time to wash off my face.  Haven&#x27;t noticed elimination of blackheads at all ... had hoped (especially around and on nose) this would take care of them.</li>
    <li> It was fun using this!  My skin definitely feels fresher after using this.  I&#x27;ve never used mud masks before though, so don&#x27;t have much of a comparison for it.  It goes on smoothly, dries pretty quick, doesn&#x27;t flake off, and rinses off pretty well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It makes my skin feel clean and healthy. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery. Gives me a soothing feeling while wearing it, and after it&#x27;s washed off my skin feels great. Love the scent too.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It is so awesome !!  It makes my skin amazing !</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing. I saw results after 1st use. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or gross u tend to not like facial masks cause I don&#x27;t like the feeling of stuff on my skin and I didn&#x27;t have that issue. It also doubles as a scrub if u make it damp and rub in circles it exfoliates</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! Makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cool Mask! My daughter was happy to have it. Thank&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I have only used this one time but so far good. My skin had been very greasy and broken out. I&#x27;ve had dry patches with dead skin and most of the time I don&#x27;t have these issues but recently I&#x27;ve been experimenting with new makeup. I put a nice even coat of this mask put a timer 4 15 min and rinsed it of. I didn&#x27;t see any huge instant result I had no oil but  I had also just gotten out of the shower. Over the next week the dry flaky skin excessive oil areas and blemishes have all become less each day. Another this is the seller is very nice. I received and email reminding me not to just leave the mask in my medicine cabnit use it. The company believe in its product and wanted feed back. I cant say this is a miracle and will take ten years off but my skin surely is much more healthy and will continue on a weekly bassis. ps most products give me a rash unless its got mostly natural ing. this stuff did not give me a rash.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Skin so soft!! Love it! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have used so many of these masks and been dissapointed. ...this mask is very interesting. ....it dries on your face and pulls any small pimples to the surface. The interesting thing about this mask is when you add water to wash it off. ..it turns into the most amazing hydrating Lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and has all the benifits of a good mask. I use rose water as a toner after this mask to get the residual clay off and I have seen an amazing improvement in my skin.  It is not near as oily and it is blemish free!</li>
    <li> Wife likes product. Says her skin&#x27;s looked and felt better even after 1st use</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month, 2x a week. I really like the feel and look of my skin, I have noticed I have better skin tone and color, and my skin is softer. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Love love love this mask!! Would highly recommend! You get a lot for your money!</li>
    <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I saw - and felt - immediate results. My husband was so impressed he tried it too.  We both use it every 3rd or 4th day now and the mud mask appears to have repaired a fair amount  of  sun and age damage as well as reduced the oiliness of our skin.</li>
    <li> This product was way better than I expected. I was expecting it to leave my face stiff once applied, but it wasn&#x27;t and still got the job done! It dries within 2-3 mins which is awesome since I needed to put my glasses back on ASAP. I left it on for the minimum amount of time stated on the package which is 15 mins, I believe? Removing the mask was a breeze! I like to use a wet paper towel to remove face washes (feels more sanitary) and my face felt so moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give any feedback of the &amp;#34;gets rid of blackheads&amp;#34; claim since I only used it once, but I&#x27;m definitely going to use this weekly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all-natural face mask since I ran out - I had one for years and the company no longer makes it.  I only just got it today but I&#x27;ve already used it and my face feels so soft and clean! I&#x27;m honestly so excited about this product and so happy to find a company that makes a 100% natural face mask for ache-prone, sensitive-skin girls like me. It goes on so smooth and it smells great. Hours later and my skin is still so smooth and way less oily than it would normally be. 5 stars so far!</li>
    <li> Worked great, but...make sure to remove the product gently and with your hands. I used a damn scrubber by mistake (not really, but I&#x27;m going w/that), and my skin was very irritated. After reading the instructions, it went a lot better the second time around.</li>
    <li> During the first time i used the mask it worked perfectly for me. The second time i used it it left my skin itchy and red. I am so sorry to say this, as to the fact that i think this company is amazing and i still plan on ordering the eye gel?cream. I would love a refund because i will not be using it again and it really did hurt my skin.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  The first time I used it my blackheads were reduced by at least 30%.  It also has almost completely eliminated my acne.  This will become part of my weekly routine.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. Actually I&#x27;m becoming a big fan of the aria star product line. So far this is the fourth product I&#x27;ve purchased and my skin has never looked better. I&#x27;m getting complements on &amp;#34;my beautiful complexion &amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not used to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve had such good results with the other products I decided to order this mud mask and I was not disappointed, well except that I didn&#x27;t get to put it on quicker. I wanted to wait until I could relax and feel pampered. The product felt soft and silky like a good quality mask should. It spread easily and helped relax my muscles. I&#x27;ll definitely get it again.</li>
    <li> I like this mask. ..it is a real mud mask. It made my skin very soft and clean.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. Wonderful product. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s face as well as mine. So far we&#x27;ve been using it once a week. The results are a evenly toned face, minimal to any blemishes, smooth, and healthy glow. You can feel it working from the moment you apply it to your face. I will be ordering more of this in the near future!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love everything about this product. From the way it smells to the way it applies to the end result. My face looked phenomenal!! Great customer service. I have been looking for something that made my face look and feel cleaner and this was just that extra for my face. Love it all. Thank you so much. I have told my family and friends about this mask. I know every face, skin is different but this worked miracles for me!! Just try it. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Have only used a few times but notice pores are reduced and face looks clearer. Has a good fragrance and easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I like this mask. Its not overly drying like a lot of mud masks. Its smell isn&#x27;t overpowering either. Also for the price you get a lot of product. I&#x27;m not sure if its different enough from other masks to make it my go to though.</li>
    <li> This mask feels, smells and works great! After one use my face felt cleaner, less oily and refreshed. In my opinion, a lot of masks have an &amp;#34;institutional&amp;#34; smell to them, like they came from a hospital or something. Aria Starr mask smells like roses no joke! If you&#x27;re in the market for a product that works and isn&#x27;t full of chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce, then this mask will be worth your time and money.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Skin felt wonderful after using it and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Felt like my face was very oily after use.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. It leaves my skin feeling soft. I&#x27;ve been having problems with breakouts lately so we&#x27;ll see if it helps with that.</li>
    <li> I REALLY love this mask!  After using the only ones I could find at the drug stores for years now,  this one is so refreshing. It goes on very smooth and smells really nice. My face is softer and my breakouts have almost cleared up just in the week I have used it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my face as much as other masks I have. I&#x27;ll be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> Feels very refreshing ! A nice wind down to have in the evening</li>
    <li> This mask had instant results. It is messy to remove, but that&#x27;s the price you pay for smooth and noticeably better skin. I recommend this to everyone who wants better skin. Plus, it smells really good!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Cleared up my skin and gave it a glow. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Love this mask, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and cakey, left skin feeling clean</li>
    <li> Good use was thinking too.&lt;br /&gt;I think the skin is brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I constantly use</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t irritate it at all.it smells great and left my skin glowing.</li>
    <li> This mask it amazing! I love it! I saw a huge reduction in pore size, and my skin looked and felt amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for natural face treatments because pregnancy sends my skin in to freak-out mode. This one has no bad smell, doesn&#x27;t burn my face, and makes my skin feel amazing. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time and was so refreshing and my skin was so soft.</li>
    <li> Love love love this mud mask.. Seriously my skin has never felt better. I think I&#x27;m going to treat my sisters to a girls night so they can love it also</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple Dead Sea Mud Masks before and I like this product because it is different from the other products I have tried. I have sensitive skin and while using this product, my skin wasn&#x27;t irritated and it didn&#x27;t make me break out. I really like that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other products have before. I would definitely recommend to people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loves this mask.  It is helping with her treatment of mild acne.  She loves how the mask feels on her skin.  Very rich and organic in texture and smells good too!!!  Recommended to all who want a spa treatment in their own home at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter used this mask only one time.  She had a fairly serious contact dermatitis reaction within just a short period after removing the product.  It started feeling hot, then her face become bright red like a sunburn, and within several hours became so swollen she could barely see out of one eye, even blistering in a few areas.  While the product was highly rated by many, I want everyone to be aware that there is the possibility of an adverse reaction.  My daughter has used other masks previously and never had a problem.  There is likely just some ingredient in this one that she cannot tolerate.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 13 yo daughter and apparently my wife likes it too. Next time I will be buying two!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but, purchasing this face mask was probably the best investment  i&#x27;ve made all year. It was easy to wash off and it left my skin feeling silky and smooth. Ive also noticed a difference in the texture of my skin which has me oozing with confidence! Oh and never the less, it&#x27;s like going to the spa in your own home.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. As described.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I have used it several times so far and I love it. It goes on easily, washes off easily, is not uncomfortable as you let it sit on your face and my skin looks great the next day!</li>
    <li> This is a great mask for my break out prone combination skin. It seems to really clear up my blemishes and still leave my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love it make my face nice and clean for deep cleansing and detoxifying</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and she absolutely loved it! She said it left her skin feeling beautifully smooth, soft, and clean...would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It works wonders, it&#x27;s exactly what I needed and expected</li>
    <li> My review is coming in sadly late, but not for lack of love! I have very sensitive skin that reacts horribly to most masks and peels. Most times I avoid things that have &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sea&amp;#34; in the name because I can almost guarantee that I&#x27;m going to wind up with an awkward, dry-skin break-out. I decided to give the Dead Sea Mud Mask a try after a stressful work week and an hour or so of browsing through pages and pages of reviews and I am VERY happy that I did. The scent is so subtle that I hardly noticed it until the second use. Results, however, were instantaneous. My skin was immediately soft, smooth, and now, much more even-toned. The texture is very smooth and I could hardly feel it on my skin, even once it dried. Rinsing it off is quite easy as well- just some warm water and it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I&#x27;m happy. Very happy. You will be too.</li>
    <li> Fantastic mask! My skin was SO smooth and glowy after. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works very well! Great Product!</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase!  Everything shipped and arrived as quickly as promised.  It is a very good product and a great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, an excellent product!</li>
    <li> My face feels great after using this mask.  It has made my fave feel smooth.  And a more even skin tone. And I love the smell. Update- after days of using this every night I feel amazing! My skin looks radiant and smooth.  Love love love this</li>
    <li> I just finished using the Dead Sea Mud Mask on my face.  I can&#x27;t believe how soft my face feels.  It was easy to apply and a little bit went a long way.  My face was feeling fresher as it was drying.  After drying, the mask rinsed off easily and the results felt fantastic.  This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My skin feels so nice after using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mud (no surprise), but goes on smoothly and afterwards my face feels toned and fresh afterwards.</li>
    <li> I luv it, it does exactly what it says it will do</li>
    <li> First time trying this product and skin feels soft and clean after firs use. It did sting when it first went on but it didn&#x27;t leave any irritation so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Wife loved this mask and said she will buy again</li>
    <li> My face feels baby smooth (: I love it and don&#x27;t have to use an excessive amount for amazing results. 1 to 2 times a week and a little goes a long way (:</li>
    <li> This mask is awesome! I&#x27;ve used it four times (twice in 2 weeks) and my skin is so much brighter. There are fewer blackheads on my nose too, which is my most troublesome area. And after my skin is left feeling so soft. I&#x27;m so glad I found this mask!</li>
    <li> Great price, I have noticed a difference in just 2 weeks use at three times a week. Definitely purchase again. Just bought more products from their line.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have notice a great appearance to my facial skin! I would definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love love love! I have been searching high and low for a mask just like this and here it is! I love it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as I was with any other facial products but this stuff is awesome! love that its made in Isreal and its against animal testing!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!  Makes my skin feel wonderful</li>
    <li> I love this mask.It really did wonders for my skin. I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin. It really clarified and helped reduce the redness in my skin. I also noticed my blackhead on my nose reduced too..... I always have a hard time getting rid of those that I&#x27;ve stopped bothering with it. But it&#x27;s nice to see most of them gone. I would definitely repurchase this.</li>
    <li> It does not only clear my skin of acne but also makes it smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Love the product....love the feeling....love the results ....thank you...will reorder when I&#x27;m out</li>
    <li> I have tried several mud masks in the past few months and this one far exceeds all the others.  What all the others &amp;#34;claim&amp;#34; to do this one actually does.  My pores are on the larger side so you can really see the dirt and crud that collects in my nose and cheeks.  I used this once and I could actually see it working as it dried.  I had little oil bubbles on my nose where this mud extracted the gunk and minimized the size of my pores.  It did not dry my face out like most mud masks do and it dries soft and didn&#x27;t crack or flack.  I have used it every other day for about a week now and the difference is considerably noticeable.  I have had friends and family say how much more youthful and health my completion is, which has never happened using any other product.  I&#x27;m a buyer for life with this product.</li>
    <li> after use, soft feeling is good!</li>
    <li> It really helps. Nice smell and most of all.wife doesnt complain.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I bought it for my niece that was breaking out from her face. She has used it twice and you can notice the difference.  Her face is clearing up and feels softer.</li>
    <li> Have used twice now and can already see a different in the oilyness of my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and my face looks a lot clearer. It also helps a bit with breakouts.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper/more readily available replacement for a Fresh clay mask and read the reviews of this. If I hadn&#x27;t use the other I would rate this higher, but that one was wonderful! This is a bit harder to get off and my skin feels clean, but not super smooth. If you&#x27;re looking for a clay mask that helps unclog your pores - this works perfectly well. If you also want your skin to feel baby-smooth when you&#x27;re done, it doesn&#x27;t do it - at least not for me. It smells nice.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my skin feels squeaky clean, after only a couple of uses my face is softer and my dry patches are almost gone. I will continue to use this and hope they go away completely.</li>
    <li> SMELL VERY GOOD!! works good too</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way this product leaves my skin. It leaves my skin feeling very clean. It is a little drying, but I am enjoying it all the same.</li>
    <li> I have Sensitive dry skin and I bought this product after reading the reviews. I wanted to try it out, out of curiosity. I have been wearing it twice a week for about three weeks now and I have been completely satisfied with the results. It doesn&#x27;t burn my face, it smells great, and I love the finish my face has after every use. The packaging looks small but the product goes a long way. I love it, my mom loves it, and even my boyfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> Very great! Leaves my face feeling very soft and I can tell a difference in my face. My acne marks are fading away, no more blackheads, and my skin isn&#x27;t oily as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Just after one application, I saw immediate results, as did my friends and family who saw me days later. It cleansed my pores well and gave my skin an instant glow. My teen son also used it and saw quick results -- less blackheads and redness caused by teen acne. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This feels amazing on my face, goes on easily, face feels clean and soft afterwards :)</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this.  I&#x27;m sure how effective it has been, as my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as I had expected it to be after use.  It&#x27;s also messy (ok, this is a DUH moment, as what should I expect from a MUD mask)</li>
    <li> This goes on so smoothly and made my face feel so soft and smooth after wards. I love it. The consistency is just right not thick and gloppy. I love  it.</li>
    <li> This is my second week using this mask and it is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin tight when it&#x27;s on but I can actually feel it working. It pulls all the dirt and oils out and when I rinse it off, my skin glows, yet is very soft and silky. I recommend using the product at least twice a week. Your skin will love it.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t take care of acne and scars, but it does help the skin moisturize.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. it&#x27;s relaxing and even smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far this morning and WHAT A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN! A little goes a long way too, very small amount makes for a nice even mask that feels super luxurious.  I cannot wait to see a difference a week, a MONTH makes! I&#x27;m definitely sold on this product and hope you at least give it a shot.  I have very sensitive skin and it tends to get oily by the days end.  So far the days not even over and it was used this morning, not as much oil production on my skin! I&#x27;m a firm believer in the ingredients this product boasts and I&#x27;m pumped to see where continual use takes me with this mask :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Aria Starr for such a wonderful at-home spa treatment, especially for us busy moms who don&#x27;t have time to deal with the hassle of caked on masks that take forever to rinse off and deal with.  I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> Seems to help my skin.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This product has helped keep my skin clear. It doesnt flake off and has helped minimize my pores.</li>
