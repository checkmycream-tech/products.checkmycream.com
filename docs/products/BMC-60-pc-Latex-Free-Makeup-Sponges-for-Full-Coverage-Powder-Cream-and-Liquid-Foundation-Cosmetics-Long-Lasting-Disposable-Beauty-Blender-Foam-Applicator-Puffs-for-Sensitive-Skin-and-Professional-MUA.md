    <li> This is an amazing bargain for all these sponges.  I get so sick of getting ripped off on sponges, paying a fortune for only 1 or 2 in a package.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen these many sponges for such a small price!  I love the texture of these, as they make applying liquid or whipped foundations a breeze without &amp;#34;dragging&amp;#34; on the face like some latex sponges will do.  Another reviewer said these are small.  I disagree.  How large does a sponge have to be to apply foundation without it being awkward or too big?  These are the perfect size without being too big or too small.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very soft and solid, love it..</li>
    <li> Pads were much smaller than I expected. However, you get plenty of them. I was hoping to use them as blister pads in my roller skating boots. Have yet to try them, and I&#x27;ll give a further review after trying them out.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my makeup and great for the price</li>
    <li> These sponges are pretty good and flexible.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay will not order again but large quanitity of product lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I like it but sponge could be a little bigger didn&#x27;t realize they were so small</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Soft, smooth and large enough to apply foundation well. No roughness to them whatsoever, which means no skin irritation. Love them!</li>
    <li> I love thIs omg they so full and thick and smooth perfect 😍😍😍</li>
    <li> Just as good as the expensive ones for half the price!</li>
    <li> Quality sponges I love this sponges they are washable and reusable. Very good quality will buy again</li>
    <li> Theses are terrible sponges. I have small hands and these sponges were too small for even me to hold onto to apply or even blend make-up. Not a step up from discount brands.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price for bulk thank you</li>
    <li> this is useful and i use this for my foundation and i usually keep one in my bag just incase i need it</li>
    <li> These are gentle on my face and I can wash and reuse them and finally throw them away. I like the two colors and shapes.</li>
    <li> These are the exact type of makeup sponge that I like. They apply my liquid foundation very evenly and they don&#x27;t soak up too much product.&lt;br /&gt;I replace them after about every 7 uses, but I know that they can be disinfected if you don&#x27;t want to replace them so often.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin, as well, and they cause no irritation or breakouts as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to say other than that. I just love them!</li>
    <li> I only use these twice one side at a time. They are great!!!! They allow me to throw them out without guilt. I wet them with water they apply foundation doing this keeps foundation from being so absorbed into the sponge.I have been using these for over a year and no complaints.</li>
    <li> I use these for a completely different purpose, applying automotive treatments to parts in confined areas. And they work great for that. Last a good long time and don&#x27;t crumble.</li>
    <li> Love this for applying foundation and it comes with variety but the circular pads are my favorite. I will buy again</li>
    <li> Just what I needed!  And, a bunch of them for a very reasonable price.  Bravo!</li>
    <li> I like the convenience of only having to buy makeup sponges every so often.  I wish they were a little smaller and thicker.  Cutting them in half is too small. Otherwise they are fine.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Was my first time trying this brand so I was skeptical. They are good quality tho they don&#x27;t fall apart at all and they last a long time ! :)</li>
    <li> Delivered on time but not what I expected.  They are very small sponges and not great quality.</li>
    <li> These applicator sponges work extremely well, allowing makeup to be applied smoothly.</li>
    <li> very soft. A lot of sponges, I might take a year to use everything. Great product.</li>
    <li> I use these for many things, and like them.  I can cut them up into smaller sizes for whatever, such as applying glue, or painting, etc.</li>
    <li> Makeup goes on smooth.  Sponges are soft and cheap enough to toss every couple of days.</li>
    <li> I use these for applying PanPastels in art projects, and they&#x27;re great for that purpose. They&#x27;re soft, and big enough that you can cut them into smaller pieces. Great value.</li>
    <li> These are a little too small, I guess u are not paying for the size of these sponges but the quantity (plenty of them).</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. I&#x27;ll never buy a beauty blender again!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I tried the first sponge out of this package. Given the low price compared to other vendors, plus the high number of sponges in the bag, I was expecting a lower quality product. So far, this has proven to be the opposite.

    <li> Great size! Huge amount! Shipped quickly.  So far I am very happy.  They are soft &amp; seem, so far, to be every bit as good (or better) than higher priced ones I&#x27;ve used before.  I will have plenty for myself &amp; plenty to share!</li>
