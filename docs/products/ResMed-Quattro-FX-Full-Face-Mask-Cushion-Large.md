    <li> Dog chewed previous mask cushion. This replacement was exactly what was needed. Hope I won&#x27;t need another but I know where to get it.</li>
    <li> Came in Resmed OEM packaging..just as promised, arrived promptly and in apparently in good condition. Would definitely purchase again (although ALL these products are terribly over priced)</li>
    <li> Great service,great price</li>
    <li> Comfortable, easy to clean. Easy to remove and install.  I use the full face mask when my allergies are bothering me.</li>
    <li> very good. fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This was an original item not a knock off and works well, I would recommend to others . Good Value.</li>
    <li> This did not fit as well as the old one and air leaked in a number of places</li>
    <li> The cushion did not fit.  It states clearly that it is a med.  So I order a large and it did not&lt;br /&gt;fit.  Now I am out money for 3 cushions.  Very  unhappy.  Would like my card credited back.</li>
    <li> Did not fit! I don&#x27;t know what else you want me to say other than it didn&#x27;t fit! Alright, ok!?</li>
    <li> It was quite pricy but I had prepared for that.  It shipped quickly but i accdently ordered no problems with exchanging them.  Over all a good experience.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. It is all about price for these since I pay cash for them these days.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect, Feels Good, and most important Does the Job&lt;br /&gt;(Why do I have to type ten more words? Because the computer tells em so!)</li>
    <li> It fit.  It works in my CPAP.  Not exactly rocket science but necessary when the old one tore.  My apnea is under control!</li>
    <li> I like this product for it OEM qualities.  Not a knockoff.  The price however is steep for these types of medical products but was on par with all other offer on the web.  I ordered through Amazon for the ease of ordering without having to set up a new account elsewhere.  If you are looking for a quality cushion replacement this is exatly what you need for your ResMed mask.</li>
    <li> Was the incorrect size it was opened and couldnt be returned. I cannot order another I am in need of a replacement</li>
    <li> Very good quality CPAP Mask, do recommend washing every day or at least every other day, this Mask lasts three months or so, d recommend using</li>
    <li> I have only been on CPAP for two months. However, I always like to have backup items in case something breaks or stops working when I need it. This fit exactly as the OEM.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit.  Way overpriced.  It&#x27;s medical equipment.</li>
    <li> Great deal on CPAP supplies......fits perfectly......easy to clean and is more sturdy then one supplied with machine.....great value for CPAP users</li>
    <li> Just as described. Fit. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Costs less here than my copay through insurance.</li>
    <li> They last longer than 6 months.</li>
    <li> I always get extra cushions as I some reason bite them at night, I guess the mask slips up and I don&#x27;t know.... With all of the oils and dead skin the mask can get nasty as well even after cleaning it several times its just nice to replace it also it looses it&#x27;s cushion over time as well.</li>
    <li> I have a 2 year old mask of the same brand and type but the cushion is  too large by just a little to fit in my mask.</li>
    <li> I had been putting off getting a replacement cushion, I should not have waited.  I found this offering on Amazon, the price was great.  The product arrived in 2 days and I have been very happy, its like having a new mask</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best customer service that I&#x27;ve ever received in my life, period. After a delivery problem, caused by the carrier, they could not do enough for me to get me the product that I wanted including late-night email replies and special trips to the carrier to send out by overnight the correct item after I received the wrong item, which was my own fault.</li>
    <li> These are the best cpap supplies available...I have been on a cpap machine for 10 years now and it is always a struggle to find a good fit.....and now I know why....I had never had ResMed before.....amazing fit no leaks....sleep thru the night.</li>
    <li> Been on cpap for 6 months was recommended the quattro fx. Struggled with constant leaks and was very unhappy with mask. Recently got the Mirage Quattro mask and was so much better the first night I used it. No more leaks and better sleep. If you&#x27;re not a active sleeper or sleep on your back the quattro fx is ok. But if you turn alot or sleep on your side the Mirage Quattro is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This whole CPAP supply thing is a scam. No one has prices that are even close to reality, all are inflated.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I ordered a large one and the one I received says L at the bottom.  I could not get the cushion onto the clip.  I took it to Lincare and they also could not get the cushion onto the clip.  I tried again and broke the clip.  I went to cpap.com and bought the cushion and clip together and it arrived with the cushion already on the clip.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Kinda sticky the first couple of nights but work great.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly - Fits as described</li>
    <li> I would recommend this cushion to anyone who uses the c pap machine. It fits nicely &amp; no leaks.&lt;br /&gt;If you take care of it like cleaning it will last a long time.</li>
