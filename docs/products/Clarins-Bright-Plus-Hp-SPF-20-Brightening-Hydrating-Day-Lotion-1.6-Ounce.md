      <li>IT IS EASY TO USE AND DISPENSES THE CORRECT AMOUNT   </li>
      <li>Product seems fine, but wasn&#x27;t sealed.</li>
      <li>I also love the light fresh scent it has.  </li>
      <li>AND SO FAR FEELS GOOD.</li>
      <li>I thought since it was significantly cheaper than the one in store, I&#x27;d give it a try--bad idea.</li>
      <li>so in love with the whiting products&lt;br /&gt;It really works&lt;</li>
      <li>Ive been searching for a good moisturizer for a long time.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I was just looking for a oil free daily lotion with SPF15 or more.</li>
      <li>Great product for mature skin....gave my skin that extra ump</li>
      <li>It has a nice perfumey scent and it doesn&#x27;t make my combo skin oily by mid day.</li>
      <li>BUT THIS ONE FEELS RIGHT.</li>
      <li>I have active acne right now on my chin and this product is light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores (any more than I have right now).</li>
      <li>IT IS NOT HEAVY FEELING ON THE SKIN AND EASY TO USE</li>
      <li>THANKS CLARINS AND AMAZON!</li>
      <li>The only issue I have is I feel like my skin is a bit more oily.  </li>
      <li>Thanks !</li>

      <li>I highly recommend it for oily or porous skin.  </li>
      <li>my boyfriend loves this stuff.. clarins has a high quality spf.</li>
      <li>I only wish it was a higher SPF.</li>
      <li>This may be a genuine Clarins product as I think it&#x27;ll be pretty hard to replace the lotion with that type of packaging.</li>
      <li>I HAVE NOT LIKED MOST SUNSCREENS FOR THE FACE UPTO</li>
      <li>SO FAR</li>
      <li>A little to thick for me... if you do not have an oily face this would be a good product for you.</li>
      <li>However, I think the product has been on the shelf for a while and is pretty old because the consistency was not the same as the ones I bought at Macy&#x27;s or other retailers.</li>
      <li>The only con (but a pretty big one) is that this really does not moisturize my skin, it feels a bit tight even after I apply this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product and would recommended it to friends&lt;br /&gt;Everyone and me love my skin alooooot 10/10</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is so aaaaaaaahh nice on my face and neck! I love CLARINS products. Makes my skin glow and radiant! I agree with the previous reviewer, she couldn&#x27;t have said it any better! I am so happy! THANKS CLARINS AND AMAZON!</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT SO FAR AND I WILL PROBABLY RE-ORDER. IT IS NOT HEAVY FEELING ON THE SKIN AND EASY TO USE AND SO FAR FEELS GOOD. I HAVE NOT LIKED MOST SUNSCREENS FOR THE FACE UPTO NOW BUT THIS ONE FEELS RIGHT. IT IS EASY TO USE AND DISPENSES THE CORRECT AMOUNT   I HAVE OILY SKIN, PARTICULARLY IN THE SUMMER AND I DID NOT WANT ANYTHING HEAVY, RUNNY OR CHALKY LOOKING</li>
    <li> I really am liking this lotion. I have active acne right now on my chin and this product is light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores (any more than I have right now). It feels so good on my face! I only wish it was a higher SPF. I know Clarins has an SPF 40 that is nice as well. I also wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have tried different moisturizers and this one stands out, i usually get oily with other moisturizers. This one gives my skin a certain glow. I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I do like this product.  I have seen some good results.  The only issue I have is I feel like my skin is a bit more oily.  (I have combo skin.)  With that being said, I have found a smaller amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Been a user of this moisturizer for years. It may be pricey but definitely does what it claims. The only moisturizer that never gave me pimples or clogged my pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never returned an item before this one, but it was horrible on my skin. It was extremely drying and my makeup wore terribly over it. I hated it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell . Also it keeps the skin nice and moist. This will be part of my daily routine. Ive been searching for a good moisturizer for a long time. Found it ! Thanks !</li>
    <li> This may be a genuine Clarins product as I think it&#x27;ll be pretty hard to replace the lotion with that type of packaging. However, I think the product has been on the shelf for a while and is pretty old because the consistency was not the same as the ones I bought at Macy&#x27;s or other retailers. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years so I know how it&#x27;s supposed to be, and the stuff in the bottle was not the same! It had a yellow tint to it, not the white that it&#x27;s supposed to be. With that being said, this lotion made me break out really bad! I thought since it was significantly cheaper than the one in store, I&#x27;d give it a try--bad idea. I had to go to the store to get the real thing and my skin is just now getting back to how it used to be. I&#x27;m not sure whether I got a bad bottle but please be cautious when buying these products online!</li>
    <li> Great cream. makes the skin even.</li>
    <li> Love. Moisturizing and brightening.</li>
    <li> is one of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased, my skin feels smooth and even toned.</li>
    <li> Great product for mature skin....gave my skin that extra ump that recently it was missing!</li>
    <li> consistency : too thick for me. Makes face look greasy. But i will still use it when going out on a sunny day because of the sun protectant it has.</li>
    <li> This lotion is excellent.  It has a clarifying, moisturizing, and firming benefit when applied to the skin every day.  I highly recommend it for oily or porous skin.  The price on Amazon is $20 cheaper than at Clarins.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was just looking for a oil free daily lotion with SPF15 or more. I have to use 3 pumps for my face &amp; neck, this melts into my skin immediately and the finish is matte. It has a nice perfumey scent and it doesn&#x27;t make my combo skin oily by mid day. My skin is also pretty sensitive and this hasn&#x27;t broken me out either. The only con (but a pretty big one) is that this really does not moisturize my skin, it feels a bit tight even after I apply this product. I was not able to continue using it</li>
    <li> This product does have a scent, so do not purchase if you desire unscented.</li>
    <li> Nothing feels better on my skin  than clarins products&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so in love with the whiting products&lt;br /&gt;It really works&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit expensive though,</li>
    <li> This product lasts a long time and applies smoothly to skin. I use it under my makeup during summer months</li>
    <li> This product has turned out to be very good. Is clearing my age spots on my face and dark spot on by upper back between shoulder blades. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Lived up to it&#x27;s promises. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and it came very quickly!  I also love the light fresh scent it has.  Will buy again from you!</li>
    <li> My favorite day sunscreen and moisture day lotion.  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This is a really great moisturizer, I have very sensitive skin, rosacea, and this does not bother it at all :)</li>
    <li> My mom uses this and swears by it to keep youthful looking skin.  She is 59.  She has been asking for this as a gift for 2 years now and every year this is what I get.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend loves this stuff.. clarins has a high quality spf. A little to thick for me... if you do not have an oily face this would be a good product for you.</li>
    <li> Thought it would even out my skin tone. &amp; It&#x27;s very dry for a lotion</li>
    <li> I use this as an all over sunscreen when I want to Sparkle.</li>
    <li> I JUST LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and is not greasy. I use as my sulu moisturizer. Not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything for my skin but it very light and at least I can say I&#x27;m moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying this product from Clarins, but this is another seller. Product seems fine, but wasn&#x27;t sealed. Just a heads up.</li>
