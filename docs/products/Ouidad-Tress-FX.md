      <li>Love it and the service I received.</li>
      <li>The Moisturizing Gel is much more quality.</li>
      <li>I have tried every product imaginable for curly hair, and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>and it looks even better</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>My perfected regimen is this: I use a light leave-in protector (by L&#x27;anza) on wet hair and then apply a good amount of the Tress FX over that.</li>
      <li>Tress Effects has a great holding ability without making my hair crunchy (as long as I don&#x27;t use too much!).</li>
      <li>Great product for tight curls, holds well.</li>
      <li>It works well with my fine but very curly hair.</li>
      <li>This gel helps keeps my hair smelling fresh, gives it body, keeps it from from getting frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair (tight spiral curls) and this is the only product I have found that will keep my curls in perfect form without the frizz.</li>
      <li>It was delivered on time and was exactly what it was supposed to be.</li>
      <li>After trying many different curly hair products, ​I found this line and have been using it for over 10 years.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just a litle crunchier than the other kind I was using.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product that really works on my curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Try using it without towel drying too much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a user of Ouidad products for a long time - sometimes straying, but always coming back - as there is nothing which manages my curls better!</li>
      <li>The Ouidad products used to be amazing, but now they seem no better than what I can get at any drugstore.  </li>
      <li>It is the only thing that totally works to make my waves and curls get more shaped and not frizzy.</li>
      <li>so I had high hopes.</li>
      <li>I love how well this holds...not too sticky, but it is a little.  </li>
      <li>After using it for 2 weeks my hair is naturally curly without any frizz.</li>
      <li>It allows my naturally curly hair to stay shiny and hold its shape.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair, and after a lifetime of trying different product, I will only use Oiudad.</li>
      <li>my favorite leave-in conditioner... enhances curls and keeps frizz down... took a bit to learn what&#x27;s enough but not to much to make hair stiff.</li>
      <li>This gel feels light and has just enough hold without making your hair stiff.</li>
      <li>The first few hours it seemed to be working well.</li>
      <li>I like that though because my hair is fine and thin and I need the texture.</li>

<li> I like that though because my hair is fine and thin and I need the texture.</li>

<li> I use the Ouidad Rake &amp; Shake technique, blow dry using a diffuser and go.  </li>
<li> I used to buy direct from Ouidad until I found it on Amazon for a few bucks less.</li>
<li> This gel leaves part of my hair crunchy and wet looking and the rest frizzy.</li>
<li> This product, even if I used only a bit of it, made my hair stiff, crunchy and stuck together like shellac.</li>
<li> The product can cause a very slight \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; on the surface of the hair as the gel holds each curl in place, but this disappears instantly if you run your hands over the hair once it&#x27;s dried.</li>
<li> My curls were weighted down by this product.</li>
<li> but it makes your hair stiff and hard and not natural looking it.</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t get the little travel size samples, though.</li>
<li> After your hair dries it&#x27;s not sticky or heavy-</li>
<li> but, I found this one too heavy for my hair.</li>
<li> It held my curl and didn&#x27;t het hard.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>
<li> Worst Ouidad product around.</li>
<li> It was awful.</li>

    <li> After trying many different curly hair products, ​I found this line and have been using it for over 10 years. I used to buy direct from Ouidad until I found it on Amazon for a few bucks less. You don&#x27;t get the little travel size samples, though. This gel feels light and has just enough hold without making your hair stiff.</li>
    <li> Still on the hunt for the perfect gel but this one is great.  Nice hold and it smells like cloves.</li>
    <li> GREAT for curly hair.  I love how well this holds...not too sticky, but it is a little.  I like that though because my hair is fine and thin and I need the texture.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, and after a lifetime of trying different product, I will only use Oiudad. It keeps the frizz away without getting crunchy or drying out my hair.</li>
    <li> This held my curls together without feeling overly crunchy.  Good of you like the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look.  Climate control gel will give you a softer hold.</li>
    <li> I had thought I was getting their humidity control but I bought this by mistake.  It works the way it should, it&#x27;s just a litle crunchier than the other kind I was using.  I will switch back once this is used up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years, no surprises.  It works well with my fine but very curly hair.</li>
    <li> This gel helps keeps my hair smelling fresh, gives it body, keeps it from from getting frizzy.  It allows my naturally curly hair to stay shiny and hold its shape.  I have used this product for two years and it is one of the must haves for me.  Great product offered at a great price. It was delivered on time and was exactly what it was supposed to be.</li>
    <li> This is the first product that really works on my curly hair.  After using it for 2 weeks my hair is naturally curly without any frizz.</li>
    <li> Definitely NOT for thinning curly hair. adds terrific shine /gloss to hair though. Would be best for non-frizzy hair also.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and it&#x27;s simply the best. I have very curly hair (tight spiral curls) and this is the only product I have found that will keep my curls in perfect form without the frizz. Love it!</li>

I get lots of compliments on my curls with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this!  Tress Effects helps keep my curly hair frizz-free.  I use the Ouidad Rake &amp; Shake technique, blow dry using a diffuser and go.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This works great with my curly hair!  I have used many products and this works great!  Will buy in the future.</li>
    <li> Worst Ouidad product around. Creates that stiff, crunchy curl v. loose and soft. The Moisturizing Gel is much more quality. Do not buy Tress Effects.</li>
    <li> my favorite leave-in conditioner... enhances curls and keeps frizz down... took a bit to learn what&#x27;s enough but not to much to make hair stiff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Ouidad products for a long time - sometimes straying, but always coming back - as there is nothing which manages my curls better! Tress Effects has a great holding ability without making my hair crunchy (as long as I don&#x27;t use too much!). My hair also feels like and bouncy, just like it should. A little goes a long way with the Ouidad products, so I also find that these bottles last me MUCH longer than any of the store brands, and the product is way less damaging to my hair.</li>
    <li> Best gel for curly hair! Love it.</li>
    <li> Love it been using all Quidad products for 9 years!</li>
    <li> Love it and the service I received.</li>
    <li> it hold your hair and style well but it makes your hair stiff and hard and not natural looking it. also it flakes</li>
    <li> The best gel for curly hair. Try using it without towel drying too much. After your hair dries it&#x27;s not sticky or heavy- just nice.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed. I hoped getting a product by a company that makes things for curly hair, that they&#x27;d understand the needs. This product, even if I used only a bit of it, made my hair stiff, crunchy and stuck together like shellac. I tried to squeeze and decrunch the hardness out of it, but I lost my curls. It took care of flyaways, but only because it made everything glued together. I&#x27;m going back to Crew forming cream. It is the only thing that totally works to make my waves and curls get more shaped and not frizzy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have used a number of Ouidad  products but, I found this one too heavy for my hair. My curls were weighted down by this product. I may try diluting it with water and spraying  it to refresh my curls after sleeping on them.</li>
    <li> I love this gel b/c I can wear my hair curly two days in a row without washing, sleep on it and it looks even better (NOT FRIZZY) the second day.</li>
    <li> The Ouidad products used to be amazing, but now they seem no better than what I can get at any drugstore.  This gel leaves part of my hair crunchy and wet looking and the rest frizzy.</li>
    <li> Great product for tight curls, holds well.</li>
    <li> Great product for curls!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a friend so I had high hopes. The first few hours it seemed to be working well. It held my curl and didn&#x27;t het hard. However by mid day my hair started to frizz and I had white flakes all over my clothes. It was awful. I will not use this product again.</li>
