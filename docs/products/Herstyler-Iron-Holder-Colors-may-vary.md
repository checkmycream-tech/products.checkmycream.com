### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Well, not anymore, I purchased this holder and it is perfect.</li>
      <li>Ideal to keep your countertop from burning&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great design allowing you to mount your iron holder on wall, glass, or countertop</li>
      <li>Holds some of the time great idea needs help.</li>
      <li>Great price also.</li>
      <li>Wish you could choose your own color.</li>
      <li>We love it very good grip, and very safe, plastic does not melt even though the curl maker it gets extremely hot.</li>
      <li>Very light weight and does not do the job intended.</li>
      <li>VERY NICE AND CONVENIENT WAY TO SAFELY KEEP HOT IRON TOOLS AWAY</li>
      <li>just love it</li>
      <li>the suction is OK, haven&#x27;t tried to mount it to the wall yet.</li>
      <li>At the time I purchased my Herstyler flat iron I noticed this holder and thought what a great idea!</li>
      <li>and my new straightner fits great</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll have to make sure that any surface you attach it to is non-porous and clean.</li>
      <li>This product works great and keeps my flat iron in a safe place.</li>
      <li>This goes just perfect with the straightener I purchased on Amazon a few weeks before I purchased this holder.  </li>
      <li>HerStyler iron holder will help you store your iron comfortably and safely&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; (from the tip to the inside)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several flat irons and perhaps these are the best match to the HerStyler Iron Holder.  </li>
      <li>I got the hot pink its great</li>
      <li>&quot;  iron holder... it was actually \\&quot;Ceramic Tools\\&quot; and it had a different shape but it works great with the Hersyler flat iron I ordered and it came with a sample of Rusk Deep Shine Oil which I love!!!</li>
      <li>If you opt for a more permanent installation, you can remove the suction cups (they are screwed into the holder) and mount it on the wall via the hole in the back.  </li>
      <li>and so your hair straightners drop out and burn the very worktop that they are meant to protect!</li>
      <li>Overall ok.</li>
      <li>The Herstyler gets pretty darn hot, and I was concerned about leaving it setting on my bathroom countertop.</li>
      <li>It was pretty straight forward, although the suction cups did not stick well.</li>
      <li>I can leave my iron on my dressing table ready for use now that I have the holder.</li>
      <li>I do like the fact that it&#x27;s now an Amazon Add-on, a real plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
      <li>It arrived in Pink so be sure to pay attention to the colors may vary tag.</li>
      <li>I do like the fact that it&#x27;s now an Amazon Add-on, a real plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
      <li>fast ship , and</li>
      <li>but it is too big to fit in the container.</li>
      <li>mo1LYNDEMYNYJB8]]I do like the vibrant purple eye-popping color of my HerStyler Iron Holder.  </li>
      <li>The main problem with this product is that it cannot stand up to heat.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised when I took it out of the box and just put in on my counter.  </li>
      <li>This product makes it so much easier to use my flat iron and provides an element of safety as well.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because it was recommended to me for my herstyler curling wand, not flat iron.</li>
      <li>I have a babyliss and it just barely fits, so be warrned about that, and mine was pink, not black as in pic.</li>

    <li> This product does not stick to the surface and so your hair straightners drop out and burn the very worktop that they are meant to protect!</li>

    <li> I purchased this because it was recommended to me for my herstyler curling wand, not flat iron. My curling wand will not stay in the holder. Also I have a straightner but it is too big to fit in the container. This product is useless to me.</li>
    <li> This goes just perfect with the straightener I purchased on Amazon a few weeks before I purchased this holder.  Should have got it when I bothght the straightener but I didn&#x27;t realize there was a holder until later. Great price also.</li>
    <li> Suction doesn&#x27;t stick to anything. I place my flat iron in it and it flips off the counter!!</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1LYNDEMYNYJB8]]I do like the vibrant purple eye-popping color of my HerStyler Iron Holder.  I was really surprised when I took it out of the box and just put in on my counter.  It immediately adhered to the counter and decided it wasn&#x27;t going to budge.  You&#x27;ll have to make sure that any surface you attach it to is non-porous and clean. Also wipe down the inside of the suction cups as well. In order to get an air-tight mount, you might want to moisten the inside of the suction cups a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HerStyler Iron Holder also works well on mirrors.  Once again, I got that instant seal and in order to remove the holder, I had to put my fingernail beneath on of the three suction cups.  If you opt for a more permanent installation, you can remove the suction cups (they are screwed into the holder) and mount it on the wall via the hole in the back.  The hardware is not included if you go this route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several different flat irons and had no problem with anything falling out.  The one that came closest to falling out was a curling iron / wand with a barrel, or rounded surface and end.  There&#x27;s a 5/8\\&quot; hole at the end of this holder that will accommodate any curling iron with a tip.  If I simply tossed the curling iron in, it might have ended up on the counter.  Placing it in I had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  HerStyler iron holder will help you store your iron comfortably and safely&lt;br /&gt;►  Great design allowing you to mount your iron holder on wall, glass, or countertop&lt;br /&gt;►  HerStyler iron holder will prevent your iron from dropping&lt;br /&gt;►  Ideal to keep your countertop from burning&lt;br /&gt;►  Measures approximately 1-3/4\\&quot; x 5-3/8\\&quot; (from the tip to the inside)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several flat irons and perhaps these are the best match to the HerStyler Iron Holder.  The opening is around 1-3/4\\&quot;, wide enough to accommodate any flat iron or curling iron / wand with a rounded surface.  It&#x27;s 5-3/8\\&quot; deep from the tip to the inside.

    <li> VERY NICE AND CONVENIENT WAY TO SAFELY KEEP HOT IRON TOOLS AWAY AND NEARBY WITHOUT ANYBODY HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT BEING BURNED</li>
    <li> fast ship , and i like it too</li>
    <li> We love it very good grip, and very safe, plastic does not melt even though the curl maker it gets extremely hot.</li>

    <li> The main problem with this product is that it cannot stand up to heat. Not good for a flat iron holder!. Very light weight and does not do the job intended. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t state FLAT iron.  I have a ceramic curling iron and thought it would hold that.  I think it will melt my holder if I put the curling iron in it.  Will it?</li>
    <li> Wish you could choose your own color. I like it but when I recieved it I got the color pink and I hate the color pink! Overall ok.</li>
    <li> At the time I purchased my Herstyler flat iron I noticed this holder and thought what a great idea! The Herstyler gets pretty darn hot, and I was concerned about leaving it setting on my bathroom countertop. Well, not anymore, I purchased this holder and it is perfect. No more worries about burning the countertop or the house down, I know right where my flat iron is.</li>
