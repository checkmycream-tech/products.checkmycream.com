<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had this curing light for a year now.  It&#x27;s works well but a couple of months ago my time stopped working. When I switch it over to the timer, the lights goes off. I&#x27;ve been using my phone as a timer.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap.  You could have your nails under it all day and they would&#x27;nt dry!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this. It makes my nails look so much shinier. I do my toenails a lot and my teen does her fingernails even more. She have a habit of chipping the polish off and this added with a top coat gloss helps here nails look nice a lot longer. I have seen this same one in a salon and couldn&#x27;t believe I could buy it at a great price. The lights are pretty easy to change too when needed. The bottom comes completely off if needed and the timer is really helpful too.</li>
    <li> Product works as described and is a good value.  My only beef is that the lights inside the product burn hotter than the one in the salon I&#x27;ve gone to.  Not a big deal,  Other reviewers of this product have complained that their nails still come out tacky after 2 minutes of curing.  That&#x27;s no problem - they are still cured.  Wipe your nails with alcohol and the tackiness will be gone.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works excellent for the price. Love it</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I could do these nails at home, but with this dryer, there is no problem.  I love it and it dries fast.  I bought the starter kit of nail products and a color.  It all works great.  Now for the best part.....I have HORRIBLE nails that chip, flake, and break.  The polish stays on for at least 10 days and I have only used it twice.  I am sure I can get better at doing my nails, and with this dryer it only takes about 30 minutes for the whole process and absolutely great looking nails.</li>
    <li> Ummm... the power cord is the type you find in Asia and other countries.  Was wanting to use it tonight, but was disappointed to see that I can&#x27;t plug it into the wall - pretty annoying.  Now I have to return it and wait for a different one.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Omg I just got this and it works great and I have to say it dries them pretty fast like for two mins wow and it also came with a free nail file love it!!!!!  I recommend buying this:()</li>
    <li> I use this light when I Shellac my nails. It works great.  I use Shellac Color plus Top and Base Coat.  It is a great little system that will save you lots of money.  I use this light which was priced reasonably and it works just fine. It even has a 2 minute setting. I would recommend to anyone planning on using shellac and saving a little bit of money.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Does not cure gel nail polish whatsoever due to the fact that it does not actually have UV light in it, just regular light bulbs. Big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to my daughter. She is very happy with it. Good Product. Works as described. Recommended</li>
    <li> I use it for my hands and feet.  So simple, the timer does all the work and my nails come out perfect! Well, not as perfect as a professional, but pretty close for the price difference.</li>
    <li> Came with an American plug (some wrote they received a European plug). As some other reviews stated, it&#x27;s important to remove the blue filming on the tray.</li>
    <li> For gel-mani/pedi aficionados who would like to treat themselves at home, this UV lamp will get the job done. This is a basic lamp; the timer on my unit did not seem to be functioning properly so I just use a kitchen timer (for the price it was not worth the hassle for me to return/exchange etc). As with salon UV lamps, these bulbs get pretty hot, so I&#x27;d recommend using sunblock or white fingerless cotton gloves to protect the backs of your hands.</li>
    <li> I’m very happy with the Salon Edge product, it’s easy to us and it works great on my nails they very happy customer. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love that in 20 minutes you are done good to go. No smudges, no indentations if you use you fingers. Your nails stay beautiful for at least 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> The UV Lamp is in a perfect working condition. Bought it for myself to use it for shellac manicure and pedicure curing process. All bulbs were in a working condition. It is inexpensive and has 120 seconds timer which is perfect.</li>
    <li> OK, so I am a big, burly kinda&#x27; guy and my stepdaughter about fell out of her chair laughing when I opened this one. She thought I lost my marbles.&lt;br /&gt;I proceeded to explain to her that this unit was just an UV light curing booth that happens to be just the right size to speed up the curing process on my pens I make after I apply the finishes.&lt;br /&gt;In between each coat I put the pen blank, still on the mandrel, in the machine and cure each side for the timed two minutes, then sand with a fine grit paper and apply another coat of clear Urethane finish. Normally you have to wait 72 hours between coats but this little gem gets it done in less than 5 minutes. After all, time is money, right?</li>
    <li> opened it up. attached the bulbs...and it didn&#x27;t work. I took a chance and ordered the exact same item and so far so good. works fine but ive only used it a couple of times. Maybe the first one was just a dud.</li>
    <li> I like doing my own nails and enjoy the look of gel nails.  This does dry quickly and sets the nail.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Delivery was FAST and it was packaged very well. The only problem I had was that the so called instructions were not as detailed as I was expecting. It didn&#x27;t provide a step by step on how to remove tray or how to install bulbs properly. I use this for my Gel nails in which they do come out perfect and i love the timer option.</li>
    <li> The lamp is larger than I expected.  The timer is a great feature that takes all the worry out of it</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp about 3 months, everything is ok but the wire was break after 2.5 months. I feel so bad for this lamp wire. The wire cover so thin and easy to break out.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this UV curing light.  Arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.  Does exactly as it claims - although as I already knew before I ordered - it does NOT have a drying fan.  They should remove that from the description as it is deceiving. Affordable product.</li>
    <li> This lamp was EXCELLENT for 6 months.  Turned it on today and it is smoking and ready to catch on fire (according to my husband).  Contacted seller, will update if any help comes from it.</li>
    <li> Okay so this thing is totally awesome and looks sooo expensive! I got this at a super great price and came packaged awesome and just LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> The main reason I purchased the  36 watt UV LIGHT was for the FAN --- Im not happy about it and will contact them...they have listed a product, and it is False...I sell on E-Bay,  the listing has to be Accurate!!!!!</li>
    <li> My gel nail polish only last just a few days with this lamp.....very easy to use but doesn&#x27;t last! Maybe you can use another polish, I used red carpet gel polish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m cheap and frugal, so buying products that help me out is a blessing.  This nail dryer works miracles.  It dries quickly and easy to set up and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of room.  Just wished the cord was longer.</li>
    <li> i ordered 6 units, one of it exploded shortly after 90 days.</li>
    <li> When I first open this product up and put in the light bulbs nothing happened. I shook around the light bulbs and heard something jingling I thought it was broken! I called customer service and they told me that often when u push in the light bulbs U may thing they are in but they are not, I used more force In putting in the lightbulbs and they lit up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BULBS ARE NOT BROKEN IF U HEAR A JINGLING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do say it was very frustrating that this thing came with no directions from the company!!! Atleast it works  I RECCOMEND GETTING THE BMC GAIL NAIL POLISH! It doesn&#x27;t have the stickiness most polished have!</li>
    <li> NOT TOO SURE HOW IT WORKS BUT I GAVE IT TO MY WIFE AS A XMAS GIFT AND SHE LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> Bulbs dont work, after receivieng this lamp I was so excited to set it up and do my nails, however after setting this up only 1 bulb worked. so disappointed. not worth the money, Will try to get replacement bulbs if they are not too expensive, if not will have to return.</li>
    <li> This product had an European plug, so I was unable to use it.</li>
    <li> The lamp came in timely manner and works to cure the gel but it&#x27;s timer does not work.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on until you turn it off. I have to set the phone timer so I know when it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;Also one of the bulb keeps turning off and I have to move it and it comes back on.&lt;br /&gt;I would spend little more and get a better one.</li>
    <li> when i received this one of the bulbs was out of the housing and unusable. salon edge made that up to me so i&#x27;m very happy with the seller. and the product works great!</li>
    <li> I got this item 2weeks ago and it came in perfect conditions. I use it to cure Shellac nail polishs and it works great!!! It came with the bulbs so far no problems. The timer works fine. I I have used the machine multiple times already and it never lets me down!! If you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to do your own Shellac manicures at home this item is it!!</li>
    <li> Buy yourself a decent lamp and, once you have spent the money on the four layers of nail (bonder, base, color, top) needed to get the salon look, you can save yourself a ton of money!  Takes about 30 minutes start to finnish and my gel nails last me about 10 days, hands in water a lot.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lamp to replace my current one.  This is worth every dime and came quickly.  I plugged in the four lights as soon as it came, plugged it in and it appears to be in 100% working order.  It is exactly as shown on the picture and appears to be high quality.</li>
    <li> Work as it should on the gel color. Just need to know how to use it.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping.  Lamp came just as pictured above.  I noticed that one light wasn&#x27;t coming and thought I just didn&#x27;t push it in good enough.  I tried wiggling the bulb even though the bulb couldn&#x27;t go any further.  Next I tried switching the bulb thinking maybe it was just a bad bulb, it still didn&#x27;t work.  Even though that slot doesn&#x27;t work, it still cured my nails.  They turned out great actually.  The lamp gets a little warm after doing two peoples nails, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.  I just bought my lamp for my own personal use.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for salon use.</li>
    <li> I added this review for people who need a UV lamp for non salon reasons. I use this lamp to cure LOCA for repairing mobile phone screens and it works very well. It also has a timer so I do not need to remember to turn it off. This is very inexpensive and I have not had an issue yet.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a defectivr device but I&#x27;ve used mine all of 3 times and the actual light sockets have stopped working. I can switch the bulbs to another socket and the bulb it fine, but sockets just don&#x27;t work. It now looks like a third socket is dying since it flickers. So, maybe I&#x27;ll get to use this heap a total of four times before It&#x27;s completely useless. I do NOT recommend this. At this point It&#x27;s just a piece of garage.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says that it will, however, you need to make sure that you know a few things about it before purchasing it and using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It comes with a European plug and it will need an adapter if you are using it in the US. I was fairly upset when I opened the box being here in America and having to run to the store to buy an adapter before being able to try it out. If you&#x27;re in America add an adapter to your cart before you check out and save yourself the hassle. If you&#x27;re in Europe then your plugs look weird lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Make sure that you really press the bulbs into place. It took a little more force than I would have thought but the bulbs didn&#x27;t break and they made a snapping sound when properly installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There is a tray at the bottom of the lamp that slides in and out. It is coated with a sheet of blue plastic protectant that must be pulled off PRIOR to use. If you don&#x27;t pull it off then the UV rays won&#x27;t be able to bounce around the product and you may not get the drying effect you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. YOU WILL HAVE TO CLEAN YOUR NAILS WITH A COTTON BALL DIPPED IN ALCOHOL. Yes, they will be sticky when they come out even if you process them repeatedly. This isn&#x27;t because the lamp isn&#x27;t working; you just have to clean them afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cured my daughter&#x27;s nails tonight with Gelish Top It Off over regular polish and it cured them great. I processed them with the 2 minute timer on the machine and it was great. I am giving this product 4 stars because I had to purchase an adapter to make it work; it was not clearly notated that it comes with a European plug. I&#x27;ll edit this review after I&#x27;ve used this product repeated times to see how long the bulbs last and if the product holds up.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, but one of the light bulbs doesn&#x27;t work :(. May have to exchange.</li>
    <li> the lights will be keeping bright after flashing for a long time! And they are not easy to be installed...</li>
    <li> This was exactly what i was expecting. I love that there is a timer on the light although it would be better if there were more options than 120 seconds. Other than that I have no complaints. It was very easy to install the lighbulbs and it couldn&#x27;t work much better than it does.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t personally use this drier for myself, the gift served as a wonderful present on Christmas morning. The packaging box was professional and sleek, although I had a bit of trouble when the cardboard unravelled. Despite the box&#x27;s temporary disconnection (which was easily fixed after placing the folds back together) I found that the drier was fairly big for someone with hands as small as mine, and that the bubble wrap within it would likely protect the drier from harm. When perusing the instruction manual I found it to be short and concise, although I didn&#x27;t fully read it or attempt to discern the knobs and switches on the drier.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of months now with CND products.  The bulbs were easy to install and I have had great results. I use an extra cycle of time between the color and top coats, just to make sure; but I&#x27;m not sure its necessary.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I originally got a black light through the Sally gel kit. Worst ever. I could only dry one nail at a time and even then it didn&#x27;t work. So, I bought this light instead, and i love it. You can dry a whole hand and it even has a timer. The lights were easy to install and will be easy to replace when they go out. All in all, this is a great product.  I have had this light for many years now. It still works great and I haven&#x27;t even had to change out the bulbs yet.</li>
    <li> Just used 3time one light not working anymore</li>
    <li> One of the bulbs doesn&#x27;t work. But If replaced quickly, I would rate it better.</li>
    <li> 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it didn&#x27;t come with any directions at all.  Other reviews helped guide me in learning you could not be weak about installing the light bulbs.  If I felt them jiggle around at all I pushed harder until I felt them snap into place.  I had no idea if I should remove the blue film on the bottom tray so I did it anyway.  Someone else said to be sure you use sun screen on your hands before using which I did.  I love the timer and being able to fit my whole hand in.  This summer I&#x27;ll even be able to use it for my toes!  So far it seems to be worth the price!</li>
    <li> This lamp is a great deal for the price. It works well, the bulbs work well. The tray is annoying at time and sticks and seems flimsy, but that doesnt really bother me. GREAT DEAL and works great!</li>
    <li> The bulb is a bit hard to install the key is to wiggle it in. Very nice</li>
    <li> awesome lamp, especially for the price</li>
    <li> I have been doing Gel polish over year and this is my second UV lamp however they are all same level of quality  if you purchase $30 price range. I simply think no matter what I spend less polishing nail on my own and I have more freedom for changing color or repairing.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to gove this to my daughter for her birthday. She opened it up amd I discovered it has a European plug. We were both terribly disappointed and I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> Mine came with a European style plug in the US.  Totally useless.  Nowhere does it say that, and many people are saying they got US style plugs.  Company must send them out at random.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and works perfectly, easy to use, easy to deploy, easy to care. Dries nails perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> two of the lights dont wont and i have to keep pushing the other two in to work</li>
    <li> Not amazingly fast drying but still very helpful</li>
    <li> Works Great. A little trouble inserting the bulbs at first, but other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this one star because it does not dry gel nail polish very well. I have been doing about 5 minutes of dry time per hand/foot and it is still not doing the job. I would recommend spending the extra money and buying a good quality lamp.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife . It is the third person I know that now owns this exact one and love it .</li>
    <li> Work great to help repair my Galaxy S4 screen</li>
    <li> Great little light. Portable and light.  Fast delivery too  Does a great job with my brisa removable gel set great price as well</li>
    <li> Very Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered, takes longer to dry UV top coat (or that could be the top coat itself, not sure).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this lamp. I love doing my own nails, so it was worth it for me to get all the polish and the lamp. After getting all the supplies it is a much better deal than always going to a nail salon to get shellac. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the lamp, I use the preset timer setting after each coat and it&#x27;s perfect. I love shellac!</li>
    <li> Takes forever to almost dry nails</li>
    <li> Do not pay extra for uv if you&#x27;re doing it yourself. This works perfectly and you can order replacement lights for cheap. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this lamp so I could do Shellac affordably at home. So far, it has worked great, at a fraction of the cost of other lamps.</li>
    <li> This light works perlfectly with cnd shellac!  My only complaint is the lightbulbs were hard to get in.  I had to try a couple of times to really get them to snap in.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice light. I have used it quite a few times and have had no problems. The bulbs come separately wrapped to prevent breakage and were very easy to install. Lots cheaper than the local vendor.</li>
    <li> I tried countless times to cure my CND Shellac manicure.  The base coat should take 10 seconds to cure, but after 6 minutes it was still very tacky.  Even after thinking my polish was cured long enough; when wiping the top coat with alcohol my color would come off on the cotton ball.  It simply does not cure CND Shellac.  On the plus side, return/refund was easy.</li>
    <li> Not really a necessity, kind of a lame purchase. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again,,</li>
    <li> Fused and exploded as soon as I plugged it in!! Causing a small smoke cloud. No warning of different voltage or handling-bought many related nail polish that I cant use unless having a lamp like this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the UV lamp and it does exactly what it says it will do.  I&#x27;m very happy.  And the price was right!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Great price.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for some sleek-chick-glam design, this items is probably not for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the item that does the job, sturdy enough and does not cost arm and leg - take it.&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Sturdiness:&lt;br /&gt;  This item is made of thick reliable plastic, but you still want to handle it with care because lamps are delicate anyway.&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Size:&lt;br /&gt;  One can place whole hand in it and dry all 5 fingers at the same time, that is the main reason why I took this instead of LED lamp of the same price (those tend to be small and you only can dry up to 4 fingers at a time). Sometimes I even squeeze both hands in it for final minute to ensure that all the layers of my creation are polymerized.&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;  All the features as advertised: 2m timer and nonstop light (for people who want to tan their hands probably lol).&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;  Save the box to store your lamp in it, that way you wont have any dust on and in it, no one likes dust and lint in their mani &#x3D;) I like that box, it looks pretty on my shelf.</li>
    <li> Difficult to put the bulbs in until I pulled the tray out completely to have full access  inside, use both hands to press each bulb into the cavity well and plug it in, turn it on and I was happy to see the light, am now ready to use it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Cheaply made though...</li>
    <li> This UV lamp really didn&#x27;t dry my nails. I used Sensationail gel polish and it took FOREVER to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;. But it never dried all the way. I was disappointed because I was really looking forward to it working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read other reviews about how people complained about screwing in the bulbs and I was a bit apprehensive about ordering, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problems inserting the bulbs.  I realize the description said a fan, but I didn&#x27;t really need one so it was fine if it came with one and fine if it didn&#x27;t.  I didn&#x27;t have a fan, but I don&#x27;t need one in order to do gel manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer is about 3 seconds short and I&#x27;m sure some would say you get what you pay for.  I know you do, but I also know I didn&#x27;t have big bucks to spend and this does just what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> This came with a Europe plugin.  We live in the US and it was a huge pain to get returned!</li>
    <li> 1 month ago I ordered Shellac  dryer “Salon Edge “  I was sure that would  be satisfied for your service and product quality again  ,but… I received damage product  despite  shipping box didn’t damage .&lt;br /&gt;Now I m not in USA  it  too expensive to back machine</li>
    <li> it stopped functioning after a week. without any reason, no refund was given! i don&#x27;t recommended.</li>
    <li> Well built. All of the features and specs of the expensive models without the ridiculous price. 1 2 3 4</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp because of the great price. I love it. Was easy to install the bulbs and all four worked.  I used it today and I&#x27;m very satisfied. I used the timer and that worked well also. I&#x27;m thinking of getting another one for future or multiple use.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because at times the timer wants to work and other times it does not so you just have to leave the light on which is annoying because you then have to time it on your own. Besides that it is a great lamp! Also there are some reviews that say it comes with a European plug... mine did not. It was a regular U.S plug.</li>
    <li> Just got my light today...Works well and I am so glad I can paint my nails with shellac at home now! Love it!</li>
    <li> Omg this lamp is awesome! I got the cnd nail polishes but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price e they ask for the cnd curing lamp so I did a little research and got this one it does work buy it ! It really doesn&#x27;t look like much when you get it and the bulbs were a bit stubborn to insert but hey it works  ! With cnd shellac top and base coat and cnd shellac nail color I&#x27;m just saying it does nothing with regular nail polish</li>
    <li> Nice product at a nice price. I use it with any kind of nail polish and my pedicure lasted for weeks. I would recommend this product. Lots more economical than going to a salon.</li>
    <li> This is my first lamp.Lamp works very well. I received it yesterday and used it with the ibd soak off system. I don&#x27;t know how to use the timer though. I use it with the blue film on it and it cures my nails very well super smooth after I wipe of the residue. I cure all 5 fingers at once its huge enough,see pics. Also if didn&#x27;t get hot it took me about 30min start to finish and coloring and stamping. Considering it was my first time doing everything I think it went fast. The cord is generously sized and it came with a standard nail file for free!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cure your nails!&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 30 minutes to cure 1 coat of gel polish or shellac. Plus it gets really hot and feels like you are getting sunburned while your nails are drying.&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrible product and not worth the money I will be spending more money to buy a new one</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t complain, I really didn&#x27;t want to spend much. I&#x27;m no nail pro, I just wanted to try to DIY Shellac, since salon shellacing can really add up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ones at the salon normally have three settings: 1min, 2min, 3min. This only has an on-off switch, and a timer switch. The timer is two minutes, there&#x27;s no changing it. But that&#x27;s okay, because that&#x27;s what most gel polishes call for: 2 minutes per hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, however, I&#x27;ll do the timer twice: 4minutes total, just to be safe. I just don&#x27;t feel like this lamp gives off as much heat as the more expensive ones, and one time two minutes wasn&#x27;t enough, and my shellac coat didn&#x27;t dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have small hands like me, you can fit both hands at once. But you probably should up your time to 4 mins if you do that. You definitely can&#x27;t put both feet at the same time.</li>
    <li> Nice and work it very good!  worth it</li>
    <li> The lamp works perfectly</li>
    <li> Works really well and it&#x27;s a decent size.</li>
    <li> Works so great. Nail polish stayed on for 2 weeks. It is super hard to take off though. Takes a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp to use with the Finger Paints gel nail kit I bought at Sally Beauty Supply because it was way cheaper than any others I saw.  It works great!  All the bulbs plugged in easily and all worked right off the bat.  Because it&#x27;s UV bulbs instead of LEDs, I know I will have to replace the bulbs at some point, but the price difference made that worth it to me.  My only complaint would be that the unit is larger than I expected; however, it&#x27;s nice to be able to get your whole hand/foot in - doing all 5 nails at the same time (as opposed to doing the thumb separately).  We don&#x27;t really use the timer since Finger Paints only requires 30 seconds to set.</li>
    <li> It is awesome, save myself alot of money since the nail salon charge additional 25.00 to do shellac nail and 20.00 extra for shellac pedicure.  Worth the investment. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Lamp seems to be working pretty well! It takes a little while longer to cook, but for the price I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This was totally worth getting! I&#x27;m addicted to doing my nails! AWESOME PURCHASE! Would definitely recommend this product! Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Ladies...save your money!!! The item is poorly designed; The tray does not slide out smoothly. The lamp I got appeared to be used and there was a deep  scrape at the top. Also, one of the four 9W bulbs included in the package did not work.  I am really disappointed with this purchase and would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer from another seller but LOVE it so I had to post a review. It is a great deal for the price. It take 2 minutes for each layer, the timer is a nice feature. Remember to use alcohol to wipe off the top &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; layer when you are finished with the top-coat. I have used it with various brands (cheaper and name-brand) and haven&#x27;t had a problem with any. Will buy again and am giving for gift! :)</li>
    <li> This works great. Whole hand fits and it sets my gel polish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a UV nail lamp before, so this is my first experience purchasing one.  It seems to be working well, and it does its job.  The only thing negative I can say about it, is that the 120 second timer is not quite 120 seconds every time.  It&#x27;s actually less than 120 seconds.  Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.</li>
    <li> When I received the item I could tell right away that it was not brand new, as it was marked. It had clearly been opened before and taped back up afterwards. After pulling out the unit I realized it had a chip and crack in it. The light works but I&#x27;m very disappointed in what I received.</li>
    <li> This light is really big and feels flimsy. Once I was able to get the lamps locked in place (one was very stubborn), it does work pretty well. I wish because of the size that they had a button on the front as well.</li>
    <li> Compact, portable and easy to use. Has a 2 minute timer switch that one can use or not. Happy with product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately after first plugging in and 1 minute of using it&#x27;s burned!&lt;br /&gt;The package and lamps inside were good. But after 1 minute of using the lamp it&#x27;s started to flash and sparks, fire and reek came out.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the lamp inside and the full chip is burned and black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost got a fire in my appartment.&lt;br /&gt;Was really excited about making shellac at home and after all need a new lamp:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s dangerous!</li>
    <li> Works just like it should.  I love doing my own manicures.  Haven&#x27;t yet tried it on my toes, but will soon.</li>
    <li> I found this machine easy to use and it has helped cut down on salon expenses in regards to no-chip manicures.</li>
    <li> Bulb was broken , not seeming to be getting warm or working ! Bought because the price was good but would not reccomemded ! Thinking about purchasing a different one!</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use.  I save a bundle doing my nails myself. So get to treat myself more often</li>
    <li> I just got my lamp yesterday and I have already used it.  LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the machine doesn&#x27;t come with good instructions, it is important for you to do your research first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things to remember:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cure after each layer...base coat, color, top coat&lt;br /&gt;2. Definitely use a cleanser after you cure your top coat to remove the sticky film left behind.  At first I thought my nails hadn&#x27;t cured long enough, but the cleanser takes off any remaining gunk and leaves your nails extremely shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIMER: my automatic timer was not accurate at 120 seconds.  At first I thought my timer didn&#x27;t work, but then the light turned off seconds later.  One time it turned off at 127 seconds and once as long as 143 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this machine and have already recommended it to several people!</li>
    <li> I worked with gel nails for a long time and I tried it right away. This is a great product :-) the gel hardens quick and great..</li>
    <li> This is perfect for Shellac, as well as nail polish! I could not live without it!</li>
    <li> mine must have had a defect of some sort. lamp was great in that it was a nice size to fit my hands &amp; feet comfortably. seemed to heat up well too. looks just like the ones they use at the nail salon. only issue is that it would NOT dry the gel on my hands. had to get rid of it. company did deliver on time and it was new in the box. i just never got around to returning it on time...</li>
    <li> Have had it for 2 years and it still works great!</li>
    <li> It work well. Can fit my whole  hand  at one time. Curing  is good  just like I got my nails done professionally</li>
    <li> This lamp is very easy to set up and use. It comes with 4 bulbs that are individually boxed for protection, you just need to place each bulb into the slot in the lamp and make sure it clicks into place. I did not remove the blue film from the slide out tray, but the lamp still worked great. I used China Glaze Gelaze color and top coat, and cured my nails after every coat. Because it was my first time using it, I clicked the timer twice after every coat to make sure it cured. I did not remove the sticky coat after each cure until the last top coat and my nails turned out great! Make sure you READ the instructions and understand that there will be a sticky layer of residue after curing, you just need to take it off with an alcohol swab or gel cleaning pad.    This lamp is AWESOME and it is a great purchase, I&#x27;m saving so much money from not going to the salon!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!!! for $28 plus a $14 BMC starter kit (base, top and red shellac) you can have numerous salon quality manicures for the cost of ONE visit! Absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using, make sure to:&lt;br /&gt;Remove blue plastic cover from tray&lt;br /&gt;Apply THIN layers of nail polish (I have only tried BMC brand and so far so good)&lt;br /&gt;Cure after every layer for the entire 120 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Damp a piece of cotton in alcohol and clean all nails after last curing</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS TO DO NAILS AT HOME FOR ME AND MY DAUGHTER, LOVE IT. ITS COMPACT ENOUGH THAT I CAN MOVE AS NEEDED , THE SLIDE OUT TRAY IS NICE TO HELP KEEP FROM BUMPING NAILS AGAINST EDGES, THE TIMER FUNCTION IS NICE TOO. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND FOR A FRIEND</li>
    <li> Love this. Works well so far. Way bigger than i thought. Easily fits a hand or foot. The people having problems clearly don&#x27;t know how to apply the gel polish.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I did my research before purchasing a lamp and I can tell you that this lamp has been wonderful!  Works well.  ONE of the lights tends to come out of the socket between uses but I just tap the end of it with my finger and it&#x27;s all good!  I really recommend this lamp as it was an inexpensive purchase and it&#x27;s lasted for over 2 years with the same bulbs and is still going strong!</li>
    <li> This works really well. No need to spend a lot of money on any other light. I&#x27;m am happy with this one and think you would to. Nails looks great after using the UV light.</li>
    <li> Great lamp... used it once so far an it worked well. I used it with sensationail base/ topcoat and gelish polish.  It shipped pretty fast too.</li>
    <li> I am happy I bought this.  It works well with the ASP Gel and Gel Polishes from Sally Beauty Supply.  The only thing I wish it had is an actual dial to set 1, 2, or 3 mins.  Other than that it&#x27;s okay.  The package arrived earlier than expected as was undamaged.</li>
    <li> This arrived on schedule.  It works well, I have not had any issues with the unit at all. For the price I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife was looking to save money and trying to alleviate the difficulty in scheduling nail appointments with kids, so she figured she&#x27;d give this a shot and she absolutely loves it. She can relax with a glass of wine, and do her nails after our daughter has gone to bed, when it&#x27;s convenient for her</li>
    <li> I just needed something to cure my UV Glue when fixing my cell phone so I can&#x27;t speak on it&#x27;s behalf in regards to nail curing, but for UV glue curing this thing is worth every penny, plenty of space inside, just be gentle with the bulbs.</li>
    <li> Did four sets of shellac the first day the uv nail light came in! Worked great.</li>
    <li> my lights are not All working and they don&#x27;t fit securely in the slots, I need to return it to you, thanks.</li>
    <li> My light came with two light bulbs that were broken..</li>
    <li> A very helpful product !Me and my boyfriend really like it. And its come with 2 set of brush!!!!  A very good one !!</li>
    <li> I love my Shellac products. You MUST have the lamp or the products will not work. The lamp is pricey but so worth the money especially if you get them done professionally.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Takes 2 minutes per round to cure.  I didn&#x27;t look into it enough.  I will replace it with an LED whenever the times comes.</li>
    <li> One of the light bulbs not working</li>
    <li> Gr8**** Awesome it dried my nails soooo quick. I recommend it to all my friends that do their own nails</li>
    <li> This just stopped working after only a few uses. I tried to replace the fuse and the lamps but nothing worked.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great uv light for gel nails this is it! I was a bit sceptical because the price is so good, but it works just as well as the ones at the nail salon. Please take in mind, if you&#x27;ve never had gel nails before, you need to apply bond, foundation, color of choice, and a top coat. And you need to let your nails sit under the light for 2 minutes between each step! Also after the top you, you have to wipe your nails with the nail cleanser to remove the coat of sticky stuff. Also buy a good gel starter kit. I suggest the kit by gelish.</li>
    <li> It was not put together so I had to set it up and it works great.</li>
    <li> Great little table light. Perfect of doing shellac manicures. Easy to assemble, easy to take apart to clean. The timer feature is great!</li>
    <li> The stupid dog knocked it over and that lovely fall didn&#x27;t affect it at all. I used it right out of the box, had no problems with the set up and it is all I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly!! Simple to set up, I used finger paints brand gel top coat over traditional sinful colors brand polish and it&#x27;s fabulous! Price is great and product works amazingly.</li>
    <li> i use this product for my shellac and gel polish and it works wonderfully. i can fit my whole had in comfortabley. the slide out tray keeps you from bumping your nails when inserting your hand. I usually use it longer than recommended which i probably don&#x27;t need to. but I have a job that tears up my hands and nails. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love my new lamp. Never had one before, it&#x27;s easy to use and has the timer.</li>
    <li> This may seem over simplified but it is true. I expected it to cure gel nail polish and it does. It is light weight and compact and easy to clean with a damp cloth. I would recommend it to anyone in need of a UV lamp.</li>
    <li> This worked great! I bought one for myself then one as a gift. Cures gel polish fast. Make sure to rub cured nail with rubbing alcohol after to remove stickiness! And I like OPI top and base coat best.</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  didn&#x27;t work.  it made me waste too much time doing my nails.  the nail polish just didn&#x27;t dry.  it was a waste of time for me.</li>
    <li> works great, great price.</li>
    <li> My mom bought me one for curing acrylic nails and I LOVE IT. it&#x27;s the only thing that hardens them properly. And it has an automatic timer so you don&#x27;t have to guess how long is enough.</li>
    <li> Very very happy with this!  The 36 watt is a huge step up from the cheap 9 watt dryer that I bought at Sally Beauty Supply for the same price.  Worked great and now I don&#x27;t have to pay $30 every time I want to change my nail color.  Gel is definitely more difficult to work with than regular polish, but the shine lasts for the entire time.  I wish it were easier to take off though, but that&#x27;s another subject!  Bulbs in this one are a little hard to get in, but I eventually got them in and gave myself a nice manicure.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T remove the blue lining.  It works great as it&#x27;s supposed to with the blue lining/tint sheet on it.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time today.I like the product. It dried my nails in about the same time the salon does it. Now I can do my nails in between nail appointments and get good results.</li>
    <li> Works well.. Easy to use. Compact for storage. It can only dry one hand at a time but I can only paint one at a time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this uv lamp to cure my clients who have acrylic nails and use opi,essie nail polish,  three mins and their done... fully dryed!!!  I also use it for brisa gels and gelish nails and it fully cures them. Great machine at a good price. I will be ordering a led lamp just for the fact it cures a lot faster, but will still use my uv lamp for the uv tops..</li>
    <li> Do NOT waste your money. When I received my lamp, the light bulbs were broken. All I wanted was replacement bulbs to be shipped to me so that I could start doing my nails. That was too much to ask. I had to repackage the machine, take to the post office (10 miles away), send it back and wait for my account to be credited before ordering another machine. A huge waste of my time. I did buy another lamp, but NOT from this manufacturer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lamp twice now with CND Shellac polish (awesome stuff!) and it works perfectly.  I love that it has a 2-minute timer, but also gives you the option to turn it on for an unlimited time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to fully remove the bottom tray before attempting to install the bulbs.  Makes it much easier to reach inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror backing on the bottom tray arrived not fully attached at the corners of the tray (the corners were lifting up).  It makes it look very cheap, but it doesn&#x27;t affect functionality.</li>
    <li> This is the exact same product that is used in the salon! Easy to put together and works great with my Shellac polishes! Great seller in regards to ease of payment and shipment time</li>
    <li> As advertised it was new.  I  installed the lights and it seems to work just fine.  I do not have any base coat or top coat yet, so I have not actually tried it out on nails.  I am sure it will work just fine. Can&#x27;t wait to get started.</li>
    <li> Great, I use it for gel nail polish</li>
    <li> very pleased with the product! shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Takes hours to do nails and it didn&#x27;t notify me I needed adapter.</li>
    <li> Liked the idea that I was able to put my whole hand in it but it does seem to worry me because it gets a little too warm at times.</li>
    <li> I used the nail jell and base, and top coat and tryed to dry each one, and my nails were still sticky..I would like o return all the items, as they are not worth th $$$</li>
    <li> Works great to cure my shellac products.  I use CND, Sensationail, and Bluesky shellac polishes, and it works on all of them.  I also love that the bottom slides out so that you can shellac your toe nails.  Now my pedicures last a really long time!  Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast and the salon edge was easy to assemble</li>
    <li> As said before no fan but this works just fine. It cures Gelish polish great. I would recommend it to someone just starting out with Gel polishes.</li>
    <li> This lamp is awesome!  I do my nails every 3 weeks, and it&#x27;s never given me any problems and does a great job. Best thing I have ever done was to get this, I save so much money not having to deal with a salon.</li>
    <li> This item is priced reasonably, but you get what you paid for. The past reviews are fairly accurate, the bulbs are not so easy to install, however what the minute instructions do not mention, the bottom has a door that opens and this resolves any issues installing the bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a fancy, nor highly sophisticated unit, it does what it is intended for. The reason I chose this model over the higher priced models is due to the lower wattage as I recently read a doctor&#x27;s report how the UV light can cause cancer, as can a tanning UV light. Use sunscreen or cover your hands as much as possible to safeguard.</li>
    <li> i havent used it yet but i received product very quickly..i hope it works great..will add more once i use it</li>
    <li> I was slightly apprehensive to buy this product in fear of it being poor quality. I have now used this nail light several times and it works just as good as the pricy high end ones. I would suggest this product to other buyers. It also arrived in a timely manor.</li>
    <li> works perfect... one thing I have learned is make sure to buff your nails really good and clean them with alcohol  before hand or the gel will come off way quicker. Perfect money saver</li>
    <li> I love the timer function, it is easy to use, fits hand or foot. You can use the time or use the regular on off switch. The cord is okay, ut it could be longer.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a few similar examples of these online but I&#x27;ve been really please with this one.  It feels to have solid construction much like I&#x27;m used to at salons.  The difference here is that there aren&#x27;t other timer options.  When I first got it and plugged it in it lit up and stayed on for what seemed like a while and then it turned off. Don&#x27;t be alarmed this is just the time cycle for the auto timer setting.  Seems like a while but works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I have had this almost a year now, works fine, does the job and saves me lots of money and time not having to go to nail salons anymore.</li>
    <li> Well I like it cuz I dont expend much time driving my nails&lt;br /&gt;and do the job I have it for monts now&lt;br /&gt;and of course I recommend these products to any one looking for dry nails at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these is not for professional using tho is only one hand at time.&lt;br /&gt;and dont have a fan. Is only the purple light.</li>
    <li> There was no fan on this light. There were scratches on it so I don&#x27;t believe it was new. The light bulbs won&#x27;t stay in the sockets. My gel polish is not curing properly because sometimes one of the bulbs will go out during curing. The price was good though....</li>
    <li> Cures builder gel and shellac quickly and I love that it&#x27;s big enough to fit a whole hand in it at a time.  So glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s quite powerful enough for Gel, because the Gelish I have won&#x27;t dry with it.  But for most polishes, really helps dry them fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a month but it works great, and was a great value.  Lights were super easy to assemble</li>
    <li> The lamp works wonderful.  I would recommend it to any nail tech.  Also the price was very affordable and it did not take forever to receive it.</li>
    <li> This is A very good product, Works as stated, I would recommend this product. The UV lamp dries the nails quickly.</li>
    <li> I looked at a lot of reviews before I ordered this product.  The reviews really helped sell this curing lamp.  It is just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Have used a couple of times, roomy and no issues</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE customer service. Emailed them twice about a defective product and no response. Product DOES NOT cure gel polish. Spend the extra dollar and purchase a real salon quality light instead of this hunk of junk.</li>
    <li> One of the bulbs was broken upon receipt.  The bulbs also do not stay in place. Which means the entire thing has to be packaged up  and wrapped carefully with every use.</li>
    <li> Quite large. The bulbs don&#x27;t stay in very well.</li>
    <li> Got it for my friend&#x27;s birthday gift and she tested it out on me by applying gel nails. I think the gel did cure within the 120 second timer, but I did it twice just to be extra sure because I have no idea what gel nails are supposed to feel like/look like. Also it dried my regular nail polish fairly quickly considering I like to put on extra layers of nail polish. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Finally got the chance to use it, plug it in ONCE and the fuse blew within 2 minutes of being turned on. I really want my money back but I&#x27;ve left the country now so shipping to manufacturer will cost more than the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So frustrating</li>
    <li> Works great for Shellac - I haven&#x27;t tried it for anything else.  I&#x27;ve had mine going on 2 years now and it&#x27;s still working.  All the bulbs are fine.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but it does what i need it to do! A+ shipping! Would buy one again if need be....</li>
    <li> Use it for a week, the lamp works great, I hope it won&#x27;t break soon))&lt;br /&gt;Good size..not small not very big. Great buy overall</li>
    <li> This item is such a gabage. It didn&#x27;t  work and light keep disconnected from machine.also didn&#x27;t  work for uv gel nail .It is waste money to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I got this for personal use to do my nails at home with the UV gel  nail polishes.  I t is easy to use and I have not had a single issue with it.  I have used it with all the brands.  No issues.</li>
    <li> It works but not as good as I thought it would I have to leave my hand in there for like 20 minutes and also they gave me 4 bulbs that didn&#x27;t work! I would not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Affordable and very easy to use! I recommend getting the gloves or wearing spf when using the light because it is very powerful.</li>
    <li> Thank you I used this lamp to fix my cell phone screen. Worked perfect the lamp was well made lights was a little hard to press in but thay snaped in. Dried uv glue in minutes.I read the reviews about this not working in the usa.dont know what that was about mine pluged right in didnt need anything.also mine looked just as picture.</li>
    <li> it came with broken light bulb.  bought new light bulbs but can get it to stay in place  I should have returned it.</li>
    <li> yayyy.. finally got my light! i ordered it on the 1st it was shipped the 6th and received on the 10th.. although it was a long time it was well worth the wait! cheapest light i was able to find and it works with gel and shellac.. definite plus :) i used it immediately with IBD gel and it worked perfect. i love that it has a time on the back i just wish you can set it because its already programed for 120secs. but that would be my only complaint. its completely plain white which is nice and the inner tray slides all the way out for easy cleaning or for pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;cant express how stoked i am!</li>
    <li> I am buying this for a Christmas present, so not sure about this item. I&#x27;m sure it will be fine though.</li>
    <li> The Lamp works pretty well except one light keeps going out but every time i manage to fix the problem. Was worth the purchase because the price was good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine about a year now and it still works perfectly. I&#x27;ve probably dropped it about 300 times and it has sustained no damage! I will admit I was concerned when I first bought this but it has been a great purchase!</li>
    <li> This works great...only thing is when I received it some bulbs were out and they rack a hefty price to replace...around 10.00 each bulb.  Other than that, did exactly what it promised.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time,  was in perfect condition and works exactly as expected. The lights gave me a bit of trouble because you have to make sure they are all the way pushed in to the sockets. And it was a little smaller than expected,  but it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> It works great. Only wish I bought two. I can do my nails at home now. I love it. :)</li>
    <li> This is good lamp for the price. You cant beat under $30 to cure gel polish. I just recently upgraded to an LED lamp and love it so much more. It was about $80 but well worth the price. LED lamps are not harmful  and it cures in 10-30 seconds as compared to over a minute. It makes the whole process a lot quicker. I also do not like that the buttons are on the back. It is much easier when the button to turn it on and off are on the top and makes it more convenient. Overall it works well for the money and I have not had any problems with it and it does its job well of curing gel polishes. It was a great starter light for me, but I do prefer the LED light for a little more money.</li>
    <li> Works very well! Great price! Compared to others this is a steal, and the timer works great. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> With the timer is easier than guessing!!!! Works as expected and everything arrived nicely wrapped!!! Love my gel lamp!!!</li>
    <li> Finally got to use it. Did a good job. Just wish I had more instructions on how long to dry nails.</li>
    <li> Half the lights in the lamp don&#x27;t even come on. The lamp doesn&#x27;t cure gelish polish. I had too keep my hand underthe lamp for 3 time the recommend time and still had awful results. D</li>
    <li> I use the lamp for curing &amp;#34;Lisa Pavelka&#x27;s&amp;#34; Magic Gloss for jewelry making. It was very fast ... and works great !</li>
    <li> Still going strong! My daughter uses this atleast once a week. Great investment!</li>
    <li> on the recommendation of a co-worker purchased this for my granddaughter for her birthday.  She liked it so I would say it was a hit.</li>
    <li> I love this nail dryer. It&#x27;s great! I use it with my gelish base and top coat and it works perfect!! I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been having my nails done for over 30 years. Every two weeks. I finally decided to try it myself when money got tight. This light works great and I paid for it with my first savings by doing my own nails. It is as good a quality as any I&#x27;ve seen in my years of getting my nails done by professionals.</li>
    <li> it works, but one of the bulbs keeps getting lose, and if I am not careful to notice that before I dry my nails, I noticed when I try to wipe the excess and realize that it didn&#x27;t cure properly. So, yes I can use it, but it is a PITA</li>
    <li> I have to push the light bulbs back in every time I use it.  Sometimes one or two of them loosens up when in use.</li>
    <li> I have had this product about a month now.  I&#x27;ve done my nails twice and it works fine.  I use the gelish nail product and this lamp cures my nails fine.  The only drawback is that both hands cannot fit into the lamp at that same time...but for the price that is understandable.</li>
    <li> this works just like one in a salon.I am able to buy gel polish now and do my own nails - saves me a fortune. I have used &amp;#34;Finger Paints&amp;#34; and Orly gel polish with it. the gel polish cured with this light lasts two weeks just like the salon gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has a 2 minute time which is great for UV polishes. the bulbs go in easily. I am not sure why the bottom tray is removable but it goes in easily. I use this with the UV protection gloves to keep myself from being overexposed to UV rays.</li>
    <li> Product was received as promised. Works great. My daughter loves it (age 12). Considering the amount of time she spends playing around with her nails, I can&#x27;t imagine how much money would be spent going to a real Salon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this light thankful it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money but wished I would&#x27;ve just spent the $30 more for a nicer one. I received my first one and the same day the light was flickered like crazy like it was gonna start a fire or something, and yes I did plug the bulbs in right.  Then I had to send for another one. Their customer service wasn&#x27;t so bad but it took practically a whole month for me to receive a somewhat working light. The timer doesn&#x27;t work in this machine but at least it works!</li>
    <li> I just received my UV lamp, and everything was fine with shipping. As everyone stated before, there is not a fan dryer within this lamp. The dryer does cure the nail polish though. When you install the light bulbs, just push them in until you hear a click and then you will know the bulbs are in place. Anyway, this is a very good reasonable priced lamp. Also, it is wide enough that you don&#x27;t have to do your thumbs separately. Your whole hand can fit under there. I gave this a 5 star for the price and the great results of the nail polish curing.</li>
    <li> Lights buzzed and went off on 4th use.  Turned off and back on and lights flickered but didnt stay on.  Says  it is unit.  Not lights.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a dud, won&#x27;t turn on</li>
    <li> This is a great machine.  It works well with shellac and gelish.  It is very light and easy to move around.  The 2 minute timer is perfet for shellac.  It is big enough to fit the whole hand inside to ensure complete light exposure to all nail surfaces.</li>
    <li> Never disappoints. Doesn&#x27;t have a fan but gets the job done .comes in a nice box and with some nail files.</li>
    <li> The dryer was just delivered.  And I had just put a topcoat on my nails.  So I got a chance to try it out with regular polish and it work just fine.  I will be using it for gel manicures as soon as those items arrive.. It arrived reasonably fast, Thank you for offering this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after the Sally Hansen UV lamp&#x27;s bulbs went out. Which are unable to be replaced by the consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product however, is wonderful.  It&#x27;s powerful enough to dry in 2 minutes and its cost is very fair.  My wife is nail fanatic and hasn&#x27;t complained about anything.  Eventually, the bulbs will go out, which are easy to be replaced.</li>
    <li> I purchased this light thinking is uv light, it is not, it does not dry any kind of gel polish,  do not buy it.</li>
    <li> This product does do its job but, its really big and bulky and seems to take forever.. Next time I will definitely throw out the little more for the LED light.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my gel nail set , it arrive with bad packaging that may be brooke and it doesn&#x27;t work at all , i really wast my money and I&#x27;m not bothering return iy back cause i bought a new one from different store .</li>
    <li> The bulbs need to be inserted into slots.  I was afraid of how much pressure to apply, but it all worked out.  Is this the same as a nail salon, NO, but I knew that going in and I&#x27;m pleased with what I got.</li>
    <li> love the lamp it works great for DIY at home gelish that my daughter and I love to do f</li>
    <li> I recommend this for anyone looking for a home shellac machine. It only has enough room for one hand at a time, but if you carefully lay your hands on top of another you can do both at the same time. I&#x27;ve also used it for a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this lamp to use for replacing my shattered screen on my galaxy s4. It was the perfect size to slide my ohone into to dry the glue.  But i have used it multiple times to dry my nails.  I even use it with non gel nail polish and it dries it so fast.  I no longer have to sit around waiting for my nails to dry and then screw them up because I rush the process.  I did my nails late last night, with 1 coat of bonder, 3 coats of polish (it went on thin and streaky so I needed an extra coat) and a topcoat.  I used the lamp after the first 2 coats of polish and every coat there after.  I was able to go straight to bed after painting my nails and woke up without blanket marks in my polish.</li>
    <li> Bought to cure LOCA glue for LCD refurbishment. Works perfect!</li>
    <li> This lamp is exactly what I expected. And it&#x27;s great! Easy to assemble (putting the bulbs in) and so easy to use! I&#x27;m so glad I got this lamp!</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble bulbs, very light and have timer which is perfect to prevent over exposure.  Is perfect, I love it!</li>
    <li> This does not work at all. It did not even dry regular nail polish so you can guess what it did to gel polish when I tried. I baked my nail in this thing for almost 20 minutes each and even after that my gel polish felt sticky and anything but dry. My hair dryer works better than this. Not worth the money at all!</li>
    <li> WoW Excellent~~ Thank You so much! A++++-+</li>
    <li> I love my new product it definitely works wonders! You should try it out, I recommend it I love it</li>
    <li> It works very well, the only problem I saw was the lamp kept going off and the manicurist had to keep turning it back on.</li>
    <li> Works very well for me along with the lbm uv coat for a super shine. 2 minutes with the UV light and done</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. She loves it! She uses it constantly and has no issues.</li>
    <li> The item defective. Not working.  Damage. Return it and wil buy different brand.</li>
    <li> Dries everything super fast. A must have if you use gel anything. No need to put your thumbs first, because the mirror reflect the light all around.</li>
    <li> Loved loved loved this item!! It works great I use it at least once a week or every other week and it definitely gets the job done. Only thing is that it came with a ding on it and it looked like it had been used. Other then that works great!</li>
    <li> This light works perfect !  Easy to use and it works as well as the one I used at the salon.  I don&#x27;t think it could hold up to commercial use, but for once a week manicures, it&#x27;s great.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> i was disappointed because one of the bulbs came broken so i had to buy another set but that worked out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m saving so much money!  Very easy to use.  Takes a little longer to do your own nails vs having them done, but worth it.  The key is to put each coat of polish on very thinly, otherwise it will look too thick and peel off easily.</li>
    <li> It works, but I should have spent a little more and got something better. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good!! I love it!!! And shipping was fast, I was suprised when I get it. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This light works with CND shellac polish system.  The only complaint I have is the size….it is really big. It measures 8 3/4&#x27; wide x 9 3/4&amp;#34; deep x 4&amp;#34; tall.  The one good thing about the size is you don&#x27;t have to cure your thumb separately, you can do your whole hand at one time.  I have an LED light that is 1/4th the size, so it is easily stored and travels well.  I will probably send back or get a smaller UV light to use with the shellac product.</li>
    <li> I love gel polish, but it costs $35 to get done!! So buying this along with many colors, nail jewels, the starter Gelish kit, nail art brushes and other things, it saves so much money! And you can do it from home!</li>
    <li> I got mine, and had no issues installing the four bulbs which came with it. However, without it having a fan, it didn&#x27;t cure/seal the gel polish. It took me 4 hours to do what should have been finished in just 1. Not happy with this product at all.</li>
    <li> This lamp is great! I use it to cure my gel nail polish and it does a great job. the lap is big enough to put both of your hands at the same time. you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I have been using my nail lamp for about 10 months and it has worked well.  I would never have spent the time or the money to go for professional manicures, but I have really enjoyed being able to have nice nails and be creative with them.  The gel nail polish actually keeps my nails from breaking as much and lasts much longer than regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> I gave this one star because despite coming right on time, this product didn&#x27;t work right of the box. Spend a little more and get a decent one. I&#x27;m so frustrated.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife who has been a licensed nail tech for 13 years.  She has used the lamp on herself as well as several other people.  It works great and the timer is a HUGE plus!  She would highly recommend this lamp for anyone who is looking to purchase one at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> This lamp works great. Use it to dry my gel nail polishes. Everything works as described and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas along with some shellac nail polish and she loves it! She enjoys doing her one mani/pedis at home. The lamp has a 5 minute timer setting that she likes to use.</li>
    <li> 36 watts is all the necesary that you need for dry your nails.  Is nice, clean and fast.  And one more thing, cheap.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a really great product. I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, great size and ease of curing an entire hand at once. Bulbs went in relatively easy (wiggle them a bit at the base until they snap in). Perfect time on the timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Ended up loving this so much, bought a second one for my mom**</li>
    <li> I was not expecting a large item like this. very pleased with the purchase, have not used yet due to other packages that I am waiting on. So far not a bad item. Arrived in days of ordering and perfect condition. Will purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> After a friend did my nails I started looking for a UV Lamp. She gave me the link to a lamp here but, it was rather pricey I wanted to invest in the products to give me a salon manicure at home but, money was little tight. So, after carefully reading tons of reviews and comparing lamps I decided to give this one a try. I was a little worried that the quality wouldn&#x27;t be good since it was a lot cheaper but, to my surprise this has been a great little lamp for the money. It&#x27;s not salon quality lamp but, for me it does the job and I have gotten tons of compliments on my nails!&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews of this product are very misleading. If you do not use this lamp properly it will not work! Use must cure after every coat you apply and after you cure the top coat you will need to take a cotton ball soaked in polish remover and remove the sticky residue left on your nails! You must do this with any lamp you buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;Cord is a bit short for my liking but, it works&lt;br /&gt;Bulbs can fall out if you move it around a lot&lt;br /&gt;Only fits one hand/ foot at a time&lt;br /&gt;Did not come with instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;Has a timer 120sec&lt;br /&gt;Does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future I might upgrade to a bigger UV lamp but, for the mean time this lamp works great.</li>
    <li> I use this product for myself , not for salon use, and it works perfectly. East to clean, and i think easy to change the lamps also ( after a while when needs it) Usually i use with the gelish gel product, but used with different brand also, and it worked. Goid to have at home, and do your own manicure.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item because was not expensive and most of the reviews were good. Opened the box and put all the bulbs in (all the way to the back so I read in one of the reviews this may be a reason why the lamp may not be working for some people) the timer was working fine and the lamp seemed to be working fine too, but just did not work Shellac at all and I was not using a cheap brand or something (I was using CND Shellac) tried several rounds of 2 min sessions and the Shellac was still coming out wet... I even tried to leave the lamp on for 20 min before using it, that didn&#x27;t fix the problem either..I ended up returning this lamp. Very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Not powerful enough to get the job done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have a suggestion please  require less words and probably have more feedback.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail lamp without very high expectations but it has exceeded all of them is a great lamp it works perfectly I use it all the time I love it I definitely recommend it and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Really cute and lightweight but the setup is HORRIBLE! Every time I put the light bulbs in they kept falling out and eventually one of them broke.</li>
    <li> I have a nail and cuticle disorder and had to wear the acrylic nails just to be able to use my fingers. I switched to the gel nail polish to see if it would help and it did! Using this product at home has SAVED ME HUNDREDS of DOLLARS SO FAR over going to a salon to gwt my gel nails. The timer makes it so simple their is no thought involved!</li>
    <li> I like this light it came quickly and packaged nicely it was easy to assemble and easy to use the light bulbs wiggle loose sometimes but other then that&#x27;s it&#x27;s perfect for gel nails</li>
    <li> I returned it because it was clearly a used machine.  The description doesn&#x27;t say that it could be used or refurbished.</li>
    <li> I was tired of having to spend $35 every 2-3 weeks at the salon.... a girl friend of mine had this machine, she loved it so I figured I&#x27;d get one. One the best purchases I&#x27;ve made. I received my product within 3 days and used it right then and there... the bulbs were very easy to install, i love the 120 second timer, makes it very easy. All in all its a great, works very well, the polish lasts such as long as if i were to have gone to the salon and after using it the first time it already paid for itself!!</li>
    <li> This UV Lamp is the same as the type in nail salons.  It was a little difficult getting the bulbs in correctly but once that was done it works great.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. Works great at curing the nails. However sometimes the bulbs become detached when I&#x27;m drying my nails so a nail or two won&#x27;t get dried correctly and will get messed up if I don&#x27;t notice before the next coat. Anyways if you just check to see if all the lights are on you are fine. They are easily pushed back in. Also careful when carrying so bulbs don&#x27;t fall out and break. You really can&#x27;t ask for more for the price its a great deal!</li>
    <li> The UV lamps works.  However, I can never seem to get the polish I bought to use it with dry - don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the polish or the lamp (I suspect it&#x27;s the polish).</li>
    <li> This product works great. The only thing I would say, is that you make sure you let it heat up before you use it. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> It works well enough but it&#x27;s just too big to put anywhere and why bother when you can buy a much smaller unit that works the same and takes up way less space?</li>
    <li> My daughter has owned this lamp for about 18 months. Today she was doing her little sister&#x27;s nails when the lamp started sparking, then caught on fire. She quickly unplugged it and took it outside. The wiring inside the lamp looks fried. Very unsafe!</li>
    <li> This worked great at first, but it caught on fire last night!!  Luckily, we were able to get it out of the house before it caused any problems.  I would imagine it was due to faulty wiring.  This product is not safe to have in your home.</li>
    <li> The product worked well enough although seems very cheap and not sure how long it will last.  One of the bulbs has a rattle,  was afraid when plugged in it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  It did but for how long?.  One of the plugins is showing a wire across the hole and was very difficult to plug in.  So providing it lasts it dose what it is suppose to do. My nails look fantastic!</li>
    <li> I love for my nail to be painted and they will not stay that way over 2 days with regular polish. I decided to stop paying Salon prices and do it at home,This works great,I painted my daughters nail in less than 15 min, I had mine done with doing one hand at a time in less than 30,The lights work great and the drying was fast,I do recommend for anyone using UV lamps to  buy the proctive gloves to wear on your hands while exposing you hands to the lights</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife she likes it, its light, powerful, and dries the nails very fast. She uses it regularly and has experienced no problems with it.</li>
    <li> Overall, I am pleased with this light.  I took off a star because the bulbs are continuously coming loose.  I had read this in other reviews and thought maybe it was from people moving the light around to store it, or something like that.  Before I use the light for the first round of the UV timer, I make sure the bulbs are secured in their sockets.  But I find that randomly, after a few rounds of the timer, one or two of the bulbs has stopped lighting up because they have become loose again.  It&#x27;s a little annoying, but I am still pleased with the the light.</li>
    <li> For the price it is a great deal. Its a little on the cheaper side but bulbs and all are included and it has a timer setting which is really convenient. My mom and I both own this lamp and use it to do shellac. Perfect for our in home and personal use! I even took mine to the dorm, it doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t waste my money on the more expensive product.  This does everything that the more expensive ones do for a third of the price.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> very good product and works great. its not the super fast UV light cure but great for the price. very well made</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, the wife loves it</li>
    <li> I bought all the supplies to do my own gel polish and, quite frankly, it did not go with the ease with which I expected and getting the gel polish off was not a walk in the park either. I did find that this works fine for regular nail polish of which I have many colors. I used my regular base coat, color, and top coat, and voila! It dried it in no time. This was the main reason I was interested in the gel nails...the annoying drying time of regular nail polish, but this works quite well with my regular nail polish in making it dry quickly. Though I have no plans in using the gel stuff again, I will continue to use this great gadget for drying my nail polish quickly!</li>
    <li> I just received this product, and i&#x27;m disappointed because i attempted to use this uv lamp several times and it does not work. I watched tutorials, read multiple reviews, and can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s wrong. It appears to be completely broken. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that this was broken before I even got a chance to use it. This was not what i paid for!!!!</li>
    <li> After reading the comments and reviews on this lamp, I was confident with the purchase. The reviews and comments helped LOADS. My plug came just as hoped - US AC. The bulbs were a little tricky to place and the film was near impossible to peel off. Thanks for all the great information!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my first set of gel nails with a basic method:&lt;br /&gt;basecoat - 60 secs&lt;br /&gt;color - 60 secs&lt;br /&gt;topcoat - 60 secs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wipe clean with rubbing alcohol and voila. I&#x27;m very happy with the result.</li>
    <li> Love It  So Happy I Bought It :)</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite toy.</li>
    <li> I love this UV Lamp! I wanted a good one but thought you had to pay a lot of money for a decent one. I got this one because the reviews seems pretty good but I did see a few complaints. The one that is true is the bulbs can be a pain in the butt to install and once you get them in leave it on ON for a minute before using the timer for the first time. I&#x27;m not sure if it just needed to warm up but I thought the timer was broken until I used the ON switch, then it worked. Also I used it for a considerable period of time, doing my own nails and someone else&#x27;s and it got pretty dang hot so be careful. This lamp is great especially for the LOW PRICE! I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s just starting out or a pro looking for an extra lamp.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter a year ago and she uses it just about everyday works great.</li>
    <li> The item looks very nice. I bought it for a Christmas gift for someone, so have not personally used it but, the recipient is very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Lightweight unit that has worked well for the past year that I have been doing my own gel nail manicures.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS. WORTH IT! not even expensive and cures really fast! love it!</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware.  The bulbs don&#x27;t even stay in the unit.  You get what you pay for here, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Very nice and exactly as described</li>
    <li> Does not work well at all, a waste of time and money, don&#x27;t bother purchasing.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works for what I need it for. I am a DIY&#x27;er and I love doing my own nails and this is great for me. I put the lights together with ease and use the 120 second timer I just wished that it gave a signal at 60 seconds but all is fine with the nail lamp no complaints and I have had the lamp for a couple of months now.</li>
    <li> Although this light works wonderfully, I used it for a LONG time and no lights ever burnt out, it&#x27;s UV.... It&#x27;s basically a mini-tanning bed and thus it&#x27;s damaging your skin with every use.  I&#x27;ve replaced it with an LED light which does not damage skin cells and LED lights take HALF THE TIME TO CURE!!!!!  I don&#x27;t want skin cancer on my hands and I don&#x27;t want them to look aged since it takes about 5 minutes per hand every couple weeks, after a few years.... not good for you.  Although this lamp works wonderfully it has been sitting under my bed collecting dust since I got an LED one for $10 that works great.  So -1 star because it&#x27;s UV rays, -1 star because that can cause cancer, and -2 stars because it takes 2x longer to cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/16/17 - I just donated mine to Goodwill. Worked great, but I like my $10 LED one that cures in half the time and isn&#x27;t going to age my hands with UV light.</li>
    <li> Love this. I wish I would have known about long before now.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome light! I use Gelish polish with a top coat and my mani pedi will last for weeks! I don´t bother with the basecoat just use the bond then a minimum of 2 thin coats color and 1 coat top coat. Be sure to keep the coats thin too thick and you´ll get wrinkles. You should paint the edges too because often there&#x27;s shrinkage. Great product, well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Everything appeared to arrive in perfect condition. But the lamp would not turn on. I do beleive there was power because when I turned the switch on I could hear a click. I tried different outlets, putting the bulbs in again, no luck. Just doesnt work. It was shipped by Amazon. Easy return online, it say UPS will come and pick it up within a few days. Hopefully it will be smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a total newbie to home manicures. I was afraid when I bought this light, that it wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough to effectively cure my gel/shellac polish, but my nails came out as beautiful and as hard as when they were done in the salon. At first I was a little freaked out when my nails were still tacky after 2 min. under the light, but then I wiped them with rubbing alcohol and they finished perfect. Bulbs were straight-forward and easy to insert. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Well, I tried to go cheap and even with doing extensive reviews on lights (to use with authentic CND shellac polish), I got this light.  Mistake. After going to a salon and getting a few shellac manicures and then comparing manicures I do at home, the results are staggering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salon manicures (with a CND light and CND shellac) ABSOLUTELY lasted 2 weeks with no chipping.  (NOTE: I live on a farm and I&#x27;m EXTREMELY hard on my nails.)  The only reason I had to get a new manicure was because of grow out, that&#x27;s it.  Still as shiny as the day I had them on.  Granted, there was a little wear at the tips, but you had to look close to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the results with the same polish, done at home, cured with this light....  The first manicure, using cure times that come with the CND shellac instructions, had the polish peeling in huge chunks the very next day.  So after a little research, I did the manicure all over again and cured 2 times longer on the color and top coats and WAY longer on the base coat.  That worked, the manicure didn&#x27;t lift and peel, but it did chip within 3 days.  Plus, the polish kind of \\&quot;sags\\&quot; and the finish is not as shiny.  Again, after research, I attributed this to curing times.  So manicure number 3 took me two hours!  No joke!  I cured at least 3 times longer than instructions and since you can only do one hand at a time in this thing, it took forever.  I still had polish that I could kind of \\&quot;dent\\&quot; with my finger nail and again, chipping within 3 days and dull finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After even MORE research, I am convinced that I will never get salon results with this light.  Plus, I offered to do my family and friends&#x27; nails when I got all the stuff (polish, light, etc) and there is no way I&#x27;m going to do that with these cure times!  I&#x27;m cutting my losses and buying the Royal for $50.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Be very careful with the light bulbs in this light.  They fall out easily and you have to be very careful to get them in without jamming and breaking things.</li>
    <li> works GREAT and I used it with the Gelish kit and my nails turned out amazing. Would definitely repurchase it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always doing nails so i bought this item and i loved it. It works very well so BUY IT</li>
    <li> Works like a charm or my OPI too/base coat. I use CNDc Tropix as my color and sometimes requires a second dry, but I don&#x27;t know if that is because of the polish or if my coat is just too thick but after the second time it&#x27;s perfect. Just don&#x27;t forget to rub down with alcohol and that gets rid of the stickiness that will make it seem like it&#x27;s not dry. If the polish stick but does not smudge, just swipe with the alcohol.</li>
    <li> if you plan on doing your own gel polish this is a great machine ... there might be better ones on the market but i&#x27;ve been very happy with this one. has a timer or you can leave it as long as you decide</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lamp with a couple different brands of gel polish and so far it&#x27;s worked really well. It is a little flimsy, but for the price it&#x27;s an excellent product and does what it&#x27;s advertised to.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! No complaints what so ever! Fast shipping works as great as a salon with great results &amp; great price</li>
    <li> Great item fora great prove! The lamps are kind of cheap,  but I am still happy with my purchase. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I WENT AHEAD AND MADE THIS PURCHASE EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE REVIEWS WERE NOT TOO POSITIVE, BECAUSE THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.  THE THING DOESN&#x27;T EVEN WORK.  HOPING THE COMPANY HAS THE INTEGRITY TO LET ME RETURN IT!</li>
    <li> The ONLY complaint about this product is that the timer on it broke the 2nd time i ever turned it on! But i can just manualy turn it off and on and its no big deal! Works Great and Hardens my gel super good!</li>
    <li> Needed it to glue a screen to the phone using LOCA.  It definitely did the job making the glue dry fast.</li>
    <li> Quit working after one month of use!!!  Bulbs do not stay in sockets and become loose and fall out easily.</li>
    <li> I love doing my own gel nails and this UV Lamp does the trick and . . . it was very affordable!</li>
    <li> love the nail system.  my family and friends love it also.  lasts a long time. very durable nails.  love it</li>
    <li> Why pay more when you can have this professional style UV light at home? I love using it and saving money!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok but not something i&#x27;d buy again or as a gift...  just doesn&#x27;t have the power  you need to get a professional finish...</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product. Or it may just be that I am disappointed with gel shellac nails. I thought that this would be much quicker. I felt like I could have done my nails the old way in about the same amount of time.</li>
    <li> works great for my gelish and shellac nails</li>
    <li> Works great and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this, along with a starter kit of polish. This cheap is very poorly made. The sockets for the bulbs don&#x27;t fit properly (they wiggle around badly) and only one of the bulbs even worked. Very very very disappointed. I&#x27;m returning this for a refund and I will be purchasing another brand.</li>
    <li> One of the fuse want working. Had to return</li>
    <li> Does a good job and has a built in 2 minute timer.  Only issue: order extra bulbs right away.  The bulbs that came with the lamp did not last long at all.</li>
    <li> I had to cure the nails under the light at least twice to get it to cure properly. It isn&#x27;t the worst by far but it not the best either.</li>
    <li> this was a good deal and worked as intended</li>
    <li> Does a really good job on curing my shellac and gel home manicures. You don&#x27;t need to get a lamp any stronger than this one. 2 minutes under the lights, then some rubbing alcohol on a lint free cloth, and your nails are ready. Really happy I made this purchase - I have saved a ton of $ not going to the salon. It pays for itself if you do your own nails twice!</li>
    <li> I ordered this lamp and it was fantastic. I&#x27;m a nail tech and I wanted a lamp to have at home and definitely this lamp is exactly what I was looking for. I received it super fast and it does an excellent job. Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this and used it with the Gelish brand gel polish.  Works quickly, best price for the quality I found.</li>
    <li> Works just like the beauty shop. I have been able to do my own nails at home and it didn&#x27;t take long before it paid for itself.</li>
    <li> The dryer was broken out of the box. I&#x27;m not sure how this would have worked for me if it did work.</li>
    <li> I use this lamp maybe once a month and so far so good. I place my nails under it for one minute and they are dry. Good quality, I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Works great! Strong. Makes my nails dry quickly. Works great with gel nails ands helps them dry pretty quickly. 1</li>
    <li> Purchased this item as a gift.I received it within a few days of ordering it. It has worked fine and has not had a problem.</li>
    <li> I was leaving the country so wanted to get this quick and when I got a package from Amazon it was a book... I don&#x27;t know what happened but this was my first Amazon experience and it was bad.  I didn&#x27;t know how to do returns or anything and then the book was misplaced and there was nothing I could do.</li>
    <li> Purchased this lamp, installed bulbs, but never made it to work. No detailed manual included and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why the machine doesn&#x27;t work. Returning.</li>
    <li> Not only is the price fantastic, the product came just as stated! I am so happy that I no longer have to go to the salon and pay the high prices!  Can do this at home!!!  The light is sturdy and comes with a timer!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this lamp for quite some time and use it frequently.  It was easy to assemble, basically you have to install the lights. It is a 36 watt so it cures in 2 minute increments.  With gel polish you apply foundation, cure, then polish, cure, 2nd coat of polish, cure, top coat, cure.  Doing my own in home manicures, one hand at a time it takes about 30 minutes but overall has saved a lot of money from avoiding the salon and it takes time to adjust to the gel polish.  The trick is not to put it on too thick.  This lamp is a great value for the price.  I am very happy with it and If I ever need another I will buy the same.</li>
    <li> Has a timer ,  works great with the CND shellac polish and OPI gel color (have to convert timing )  Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better price !</li>
    <li> I bought for my daughter and is happy with this lamp, it is very useful for nails recommend is a good buy</li>
    <li> Takes forever to dry nails.  It really doesn&#x27;t work as well as a professional nail lamp.  Even after five minutes (they recommend two minutes), the nail shellac is still tacky -- and I have tried several brands of nail shellac.  I think the problem is the lamp.</li>
    <li> Most  of  the  lights  don&#x27;t  work.  Quite  disappointed</li>
    <li> I think this is the lamp.  I tied this lamp with OPI products and polish pills off in 2 days, I increased the drying time and it did not work</li>
    <li> The slide out tray is nice to be able to get your hand in without bumping the bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;It cured gel polish perfectly in 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Get it!</li>
    <li> Not a big deal but when I opened it one of the bulbs was broken.  Easy for me to go buy a new bulb but a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is nice for setting your nails and warming up my hands.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has rh arthritis I told her she needs to borrow it would make her&lt;br /&gt;hands feel so much better. I don&#x27;t do tanning beds any more but ladies&lt;br /&gt;would come in with arthritis because they said it warmed their bones (I worked&lt;br /&gt;at a place that had tanning beds} this sure helps my hands.</li>
    <li> Came defective . Returned</li>
    <li> It works perfect. The only thing is I can&#x27;t put both hands in the lamp at the same time because it&#x27;s not wide enough</li>
    <li> Got it on time. Works great. You just have to put the bulbs in. Which is no problem.  You just slide the bottom off and insert . Be sure to remove the blue film off the bottom tray. Thanks for the great job.</li>
    <li> Love my Salon Edge! Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I bought this more than a year ago and at first I hated this and just put it away instead of sending it back.  Later I got it out and tried again to no avail.  Like all the one-star reviewers, I thought it wasn&#x27;t curing.  As some of the reviewers, who love this product, have said, \\&quot;The bad reviewers don&#x27;t know how to use it.\\&quot;  THEY WERE RIGHT!!  It really pays to read these reviews when you get a product that even the makers don&#x27;t know how to use as indicated in their lack of useful directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was looking for another UV light, higher wattage because I thought it would work better.  In reading over the reviews and watching a few YouTube videos I found 3 very helpful things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  After curing, there WILL be stickiness that must be removed with alcohol on a cotton cloth (lint free).  Who knows to do this when they don&#x27;t do it at the salon?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  I was reading a review for another product that said you are supposed to remove all the blue film from the mirrors.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the instructions for Salon Edge didn&#x27;t say to remove the blue film from the bottom (and not really sure you should) but I can&#x27;t be sure because I cannot locate my directions and could not find it online.  You tube videos show the film still there.  In any case, I DID remove it which was very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  You should cure after each coat of polish: base, color, another layer of color, top coat.  I was not doing this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did my nails again armed with helpful hints and after removing the blue film on the bottom.  There was still that stickiness but seemingly not near as much as before.  I am not sure if it is from removing the blue film, curing after each layer of polish, or both.  Either way, I just wiped off the stickiness with the alcohol and cotton cloth (cut up old t-shirt) and VOILA!  I went about my day with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice inexpensive UV light that works well.  Oh and BTW I&#x27;m still using my original light bulbs after over a year but then I have only used this 3 times.  I think when I have to replace the bulbs I might just get an LED lamp since you don&#x27;t have to replace the bulbs near as often.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping got it basically the next day. I decided to paint my toes the same day I received it and  tried drying one coat at a time but once I got to the third coat which was the last of clear. The polish took over 20min to somewhat dry. I touched the nails afterward and it still left my fingerprints in the nail pretty disappointing. Maybe I did it wrong with too many coats or ur being regular nail polish idk but hopefully once I receive my gel polish I can update on this review</li>
    <li> I bought 2 and both of them went to crap after a few months. 2 bulbs flicker on and off on one and 1 bulb on the other. It will not cure the side the bulb is off. The bulbs are securely clicked in, that is not the problem. I can&#x27;t return them because it&#x27;s past the return date. They are cheaply made, will slide off the table if you don&#x27;t put something under them (no they didn&#x27;t hit the floor). I am really unhappy. I just picked up 2 more for a friend.</li>
    <li> I love this machine.  It is an absolute MUST for curing your gel polish.  I checked out the prices, and this was the best price, by far.  If you need the UV Nail Lamp, this is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> As a cosmetologist and Nail technician I LOVE shellac. I wanted to invest in my own home UV lamp but found all the name brand ones were well over $100. I found this and on a whim and not a lot of expectations ordered this one. It came in the mail nicely in a fitting box with instructions and everything wrapped up brand new. It&#x27;s so esy to put together, all you have to do is pop the lightbulbs in and slide the bottom tray in. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that there isn&#x27;t a timer for how long you can cure your nails, you kind of have to keep track or count in your head. For the price thats the least of my worries and can be handled. So overall it&#x27;s a great product, it works as it should! I swear its identical to all the other name brand curing lights just without the name. GOOD BUY!</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with the UV lamp! It dried the gel nails very fast.  It was very easy to install the bulbs too, and you deff. cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> Complete disappointment.  I take the reviews on here with a grain of salt but this is one time that I should have listened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-As soon as I opened it, I knew that it wasn&#x27;t new.  It arrived with scratches and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;-The light bulbs are difficulty to install and come loose VERY easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Didn&#x27;t work so now I have to go through the process of returning it and apparently be charged a return shipping fee so I&#x27;m actually out money.</li>
    <li> The lamp works like the description, I think i have to find the right gel polish because my gel nails peel off easy and quickly.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s awesome! Works great for gel manicures. I&#x27;ve done 3 so far and it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> This UV lamp is perfect for at home use! the timer setting is spot on and putting the lamp together took all of two minutes! For less than $30 it was a great buy!</li>
    <li> Works like the ones used in the salon. I love being able to do my own shellac nails. This item pays for itself in a couple of manicures.</li>
    <li> Junk. I tried multiple outlet in my house. The thing didn&#x27;t even turn on. No instructions...nothing. I think I got the bulbs in correctly...but can&#x27;t be sure. I&#x27;m pretty intelligent and can figure things out. Not this! Huge waste of money. I&#x27;d spend the extra 20 bucks and get a better one!</li>
    <li> at first one of the uv lights was off. then i fixed it and it works great!</li>
    <li> Great little machine.  You will love the results. guides you through the step by step process.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves using gel polish on her nails now. Very affordable, and super easy to use. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> Just like the salon. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> Meet my expected servivces. My wife loved product</li>
    <li> This thing is terrible. I used it once and the on/off button to turn the lamp on became loose so now I can&#x27;t use it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I can&#x27;t return it because I didn&#x27;t use it right away and now I&#x27;m just a few days over the 30 days. I order a lot of things on amazon and am usually pretty happy with my products but this one was just a terrible.</li>
    <li> Great item for the money. Easy to install and works great with all the gel polish i have at home.</li>
    <li> I bought this light as a gift for a friend. I spent at lot more on a light at Sallys with the same features. Just lacks the extra timer setting that I have on mine. Otherwise they are the same and it works well for Gelish too.</li>
    <li> Lightwieght, bulbs on top and sides.  Allows you to cure your gel/shellac polish without trying to turn your thumb upwards.</li>
    <li> This product is just as good as the higher priced models. Although you can only do one hand at a time, I&#x27;d definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp because I needed a UV lamp rather than LED for a certain brand of gel polish. After reading the reviews, I half-expected to receive a broken lamp...wrong! It works well, it was easy to assemble (all you need to do is stick the bulbs in), and it has a 120sec timer. Not to mention its a great price!</li>
    <li> My clients are still amaze after getting their mani and pedi  done, the UV light drys the polish instantly ...</li>
    <li> When I got this product I was super excited. My husband put in the bulbs, read the directions, plugged it in, and turned on the power switch ready for it to turn on (like the directions stated). It never turned on. We even took all the bulbs out, switched them around, plugged it in again, turned the power switch on, and still nothing happened. I&#x27;m thinking that this product was defected, which really stinks. :( I guess I will have to buy another one, but not online.</li>
    <li> Finally got all the pieces together to be able to do my own Shellac polish, and love it!  For the price, this light is awesome.  I have been doing the polish at $30 to $35 a pop, ever two weeks - it adds up.  Watching them helped me know what to do, and my FIRST time of doing it, everyone thinks I paid someone.  :)  I still plan on going to my salon occasionally -but this will save me SO MUCH MONEY.</li>
    <li> Works Great, just be careful of the bulbs, they can break very easy.</li>
    <li> just as advertised.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Shorted out (smoke, sparks and all) after only using a few times (but alas warranty is only 30 days). Also despite following processes very carefully CND polish (and others) didn&#x27;t last as long using this lamp. I am guessing the UV range for this lamp might not be precisely aligned with the actual polish, also now understand that some polishes work better with LED than UV so that might be some of it</li>
    <li> Does wonderfully and easy to set up! The shipping was fast and well protected!</li>
    <li> Poor. Come without instructions and one bulb did not work. In process of returning this item.</li>
    <li> You can not get a better lamp for the price. I used it for 4 mins for each drying session and had no issues what so ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products used with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MP0T2Q/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_31&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AA5VZY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037O2J7I/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NJE3M4/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/CND-Shellac-French-Manicure-Polish/dp/B009A9LALU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1408769178&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;cnd+french+manicure+shellac</li>
    <li> I love this lamp because you can take the bottom out and clean it, where you see at the salons (which get tons of use) they have foil that they put in there and have to take out to keep them clean where if they had one of these they just pull the bottom out and clean it and &amp;#34;wal la&amp;#34; its sanitary again. I dont use the timer too much but it is a nice option.</li>
    <li> I have purchased cheap UV lamps in the past and you really do get what you pay for. This one was not super expensive and it works Great!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works really well and big enough to use on your feet too. Good for price. Lamps are hard to get in it but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> It does not work on gel nails. Such a waste of money!!&lt;br /&gt;Wish I would have gone with a better brand!</li>
    <li> Great for salon, will get one that holds 2 hands</li>
    <li> I do my own shellac nails at home.  Curing time is perfect, love this light.  Finally a nail polish that will stay on at least a week, sometimes two!</li>
    <li> Works great, love the price. The only negative is that the lightbulbs don&#x27;t fit snuggly and will sometimes turn off while you&#x27;re using the lamp. Have to be very careful because if this happens while your doing your mani, it won&#x27;t cure your gel polish. Always check to make sure all 4 bulbs are on when you stick your hand in the lamp. It&#x27;s a bit of a hassle.</li>
    <li> I bought it about 5 months ago and it worked well up until this week (used it maybe 5 times). Doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore!! went to see about purchasing new light bulbs but those are $50 for 4 which is more than I paid for the lamp itself. So now I&#x27;m looking for an LED one. I guess you get what you pay for!! :(</li>
    <li> to save money and for the convenience I ordered the Salon Edge Nail UV lamp and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this online because in stores they retail for over sixty dollars. I was concerned of the quality but have been very impressed by this light. It was incredibly easy to put together and runs exactly as specified. If you want a light for just home use or business this one is up to the task. Works great for acrylic, gels and just regular polish.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my daughter&#x27;s birthday,she was very happy with it.Said it&#x27;s easier than it looks to install the lamps included.&lt;br /&gt;There are no directions for installing the lamps,so when you receive this item and start to install the lamps,be sure to pull out&lt;br /&gt;the bottom plate,then install the lamps and it&#x27;s really easy.</li>
    <li> This UV lamp works perfectly and was reasonably priced. I use it for at-home gel manicures and it&#x27;s never let me down. I may invest in a pricier, higher wattage version further down the road (only to save 30 seconds per cure), but I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Perfect for home use. Works great, glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this lamp, it appeared that it wasn&#x27;t curing the base gel polish.  I found that it was necessary to complete the steps with the polish and top gel.  The polish was cured completely after I wiped my nails with alcohol as the final step.  I used the lamp as directed a second time and it worked very well.  I believe there is a little getting used to the process of a gel manicure.  I would recommend this item because it works as advertised and is much less expensive then the LED lamp.</li>
    <li> It is so nice to get a product that is simple to assemble. I took the bulbs out of the protective wrapping, popped them in and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I got this for myself as a christmas present along with all the other CND products so I can do shellac myself at home. This lamp works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who rate it low obviously did not read the instructions on how to do shellac nails. There will ALWAYS be sticky stuff on top of your nails when you are done curing them with the lamp. All you have to do is wipe your nails with 99% alcohol and they will be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems with this lamp. It does exactly what you want it to do.</li>
    <li> I received the item and tried to put light bulbs into the unit.  All the sockets are made of poor quality so the light bulbs cannot fit in well.  Returning the product.  Wasted my time!</li>
    <li> works great and saves me a lot of money from going to the nail salon all the time!</li>
    <li> Works great! love this light!</li>
    <li> I got this lamp not too long ago and it worked, I suppose, as described. It was kind of annoying that every coat took 90 seconds since the timer has only 1 setting (I realize I could just have the light on, but then I&#x27;d have to have another way to keep time). I found myself curing for an extra cycle or two per nail, which at 90 seconds a cycle, really tacks on time. Maybe this is just because I like to do things like putting fruit-shaped 3D add-ons on my nails, but I think it might been the lamp too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OKAY - my actual point and reason for giving this a 2 in review ratings is that after only 2 or maybe 3 times using this lamp, one of the bulbs totally quit working. I wiggled and reset all the bulbs. 3 continued working, the broken one....was really broken. Soooo, because I&#x27;ve had difficultly replacing the bulb - and because it&#x27;s convenient to replace a practically brand new bulb - I&#x27;ve spent a few more times doing my nails, this time curing even longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, much to my boyfriend&#x27;s dismay, instead of replacing the bulb, I&#x27;m going to make (yet another) &amp;#34;investment&amp;#34; in an LED lamp with a few more credentials. Darn!</li>
    <li> very nice nail lamp, so far have had no problems with the lights!</li>
    <li> The outer shell of the lamp is a bit cheap feeling/looking but could still definitely be used in a salon- it has 4 bulbs on the inside and works GREAT. Bought 2 and will use both at my salon. If having trouble w the bulbs- make sure they are correctly inserted. I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Total disappointment!  Was all excited to try a shellac manicure at home.  Started setting up everything and low a behold I got a lamp that does not work.</li>
    <li> One of the best invests I have ever made!</li>
    <li> the bulbs do get loose and fall out. I have to secure them before every nail session. the cord is super short so you have to either use an extension cord or be right by the outlet. but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I have four kids and as much as I would love to go get my nails done and a pedicure, I just don&#x27;t have the time.  I purchased the lamp to use with the gelish nail polish. I have only used it once, but it worked great! My nails look just as great as they do when I go to the spa.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! The UV lamp does not cure nails even if you leave them in there longer then the directions say.</li>
    <li> The unit works ok, but the timer switch doesn&#x27;t.  I didn&#x27;t realize this until after my daughter had used it a several times.  I did not contact the seller because my daughter needed it immediately.  She just times it herself.</li>
    <li> This is the least expensive of all the Curing Light Timers.  As such you can expect it to get the job done, though it is not spectacular.  It won&#x27;t last long and it is hard to find light replacements.  In many cases the light bulbs are more expensive than the machine itself.</li>
    <li> This item did not work! It could be the fuse, but I have plugged it into two different outlets, reattached the bulbs... it will not turn on. I am extremely disappointed!</li>
    <li> Waste of money, returned.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.  It is suppose to cure Shellac in increments of 2 minutes.  The timer worked but the nail polish is as sticky as it was when I put my fingers in.  I read the instructions and did as it said and then repeated but it is still sticky.  I am highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Used to take hours for my nails to dry and I still woke up with prints all over my nails even when I thought they were dry. Not anymore! This little gem took a lot of hassles away from doing my nails. Initially it was a little difficult for me to put the light bulbs into the device because it did not come with instructions and I was scared of breaking the bulbs but once that was done, it was a breeze to use the product. Packaging was good since none of the bulbs was damaged. Overall, a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> Lamp did not come with instructions.  Instructions would have been very helpful.  I had to read previous reviews on Amazon to find out how to get this lamp started.  The blue protective film has to be removed before using and the lamps have to be pushed and &amp;#34;clicked in.  After I got everything started I used the lamp and it works great.  I like that it has an automatic 2 minute timer.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, still trying to get the hang of it all</li>
    <li> I love it but one of the bulbs are blown out</li>
    <li> Great product! all my friends are jealous of my nails and this purchase!</li>
    <li> cures great. fits in my case, i like that its small and i can carry it any where with me.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with a discount i got with amazon. I recieved this as a birthday gift and i was previously using a very cheap gel LED lamp. I was only able to fit 3 fingers in at a time and and the timer was automatically set inside the lamp to last 30seconds. Sometimes the gel would not dry and it was a hassle to continuiously restart it. This LED gel lamp allows you to set the timer to how long you want it on and also has a timer and an On/Off button. Which you cannot find on a cheap LED lamp. Drys my gel polish everytime. Can get a little hot but it doesnt have a fan. Cant complain when it doesnt have it in the first place. Over all i am very happy with this product. Deserves a smiley face.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Works great! I painted my nails (with shellac polish) and it lasted for 3 weeks with no chips! I love it!</li>
    <li> I really loved this machine.  I have saved TONS of money doing my own gel nails.  I also do my friends and families, so it&#x27;s great all around.</li>
    <li> Does a great job and I especially like the built in timer. Fits a whole hand quite comfortably and does the job.</li>
    <li> This works GREAT. I used a cheaper/smaller version and I hated it. Couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and use this one. Your whole hand or foot can fit in the opening and it&#x27;s quite sturdy !!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a UV curing lamp for making PCBs with the UV photoresist method. With the tray removed it only takes about a minute of exposure to make a good quality board, vs exposure lamps meant for PCBs that cost hundreds of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this with MG Chemicals positive presensitized boards. Sadly the entire board does not fit (6x4 is about an inch or so too long) but I can&#x27;t argue with the results, just cut or buy smaller boards. I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of removing the lamps and circuitry to make my own exposure box but this works great for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture is 16mil traces, my first ever attempt.</li>
    <li> I bought this product so I could do the gel polish at home and save myself some money rather than going to a salon to have my nails done. The bulbs were easy to install, and it worked great to cure my polish. The timer worked great and did shut off when it was supposed to. All in all I think it will be a great nail lap!</li>
    <li> After attempting to use this , with the appropriate type of UV gel polish- a very thin coat, the polish was still not dried. I allowed my hand to rest in the dryer for literally two hours with the results being very tacky polish. While this product is not expensive, it does not &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; polish in two minutes as it was suggested. Buy a different product.</li>
    <li> Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp Acrylic Gel Shellac Curing Light Timer 36 Watt Dryer With Slide Out Tray (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;Great!</li>
    <li> This is a great lamp, I started doing my own gel nails at home ( overlay)  and I loved it!! It&#x27;s so easy to assemble you just have to push the light bulbs a little hard and the lamp is good to go.</li>
    <li> I purchased this light to replace another full-size light that I have been using for over a year. The original light was perfect, I just wasn&#x27;t too happy with its size. The lamps were easy to install - and I have not had any issues using it so far. It also allows you to cure the whole hand - which plenty of smaller lamps do not , I had no interest in another round of curing for my thumbs.</li>
    <li> came with a broken bulb, but still works good</li>
    <li> I love this!  At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working but all I had to do was push the UV lights into place.</li>
    <li> Works well. We have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 6months now. Works like a charm :) Have saved som much money doing my own Shellac!</li>
    <li> love this lamp .  its really good quality compared to other expensive ones .shipping was fast .</li>
    <li> This lamp works as described but did not cure any of the UV polished or shellac I have. I tried several brands of UV polish, but I think the watts are not high enough. Too bad, I was so excited to skip the salon! Gave 2 stars because it arrived very fast and was exactly as described. I read other reviews of folks saying it worked but didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I got this because I am addicted to the gel nails and wanted to do them at home to save on money. The item came in good timing and it works great. I have used it on my nails a few times and on my toes once. It was easy to put together. Just put the bulbs in and you are done!</li>
    <li> Love it! so great to do your own nails at home!&lt;br /&gt;Just had a hard time putting the light bulbs in. They have to almost like snap in  - I was way to gentle you have to use force which made me nervous because I didn&#x27;t want to break the bulbs.</li>
    <li> They should make this larger since I&#x27;m only able to tan one of my hands at a time. I just have to make sure I can flip my hands to get the proper tan and coverage on both sides. The blue color is nice. I just stare at it. My eyes hurt.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it was a 36-watt UV lamp, advertised with fan. That&#x27;s not what I got--the item I received didn&#x27;t have a fan. The seller said that the only item that has a fan is the 56-watt lamp so why they advertise one of their 36-watt lamps as having a fan when it doesn&#x27;t--even after I&#x27;ve told them their product is listed incorrectly--I don&#x27;t know. So be warned--if you&#x27;re looking for a UV lamp with a fan, forget what they&#x27;re advertising because this isn&#x27;t it. If the fan is essential to you, go for the more expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, while the item is light-weight and looks cheaply constructed, it does work. It was hard to get the bulbs in and I was afraid I&#x27;d break them but once in, the bulbs sit very securely. I use regular polish with it and it dries my nails on the 120-second setting, which is nice because then my hands are under the UV for just 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m giving this 3-stars because it didn&#x27;t have the fan advertised but the lamp does work as it should otherwise. If it had included a fan, I would have given it the 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product is being advertised as a UV lamp and fan dryer . This product is ONLY a UV Light! There is no fan . I personally bought this because the price was right and because it had a fan with the UV lamp like the salons do.  So Im a bit pissed off. However, the UV light is very hot and does it&#x27;s job.  I&#x27;m just not happy this product is being falsely advertised and I&#x27;m going to contact amazon about it as it needs to be fixed online before another buyer falls for the plunge! I&#x27;ve seen another buyer mention the exact same thing as me. I should have read all the reviews before buying this one and not just looking at it&#x27;s overall rating.  SELLERS YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE DARN ADVERTISEMENT FOR ALL SELLING COPIES IF THIS SAME LAMP UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME. THATS FALSE ADVERTISING FOR THOSE WHO REALLY ARE SELLING THE UV LAMP AND FAN DRYERS.</li>
    <li> This UV lamp is the perfect size to set one hand of nails at a time</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure gel polish with one or two rimes running 120 secs more like 5 or 6 times at 120... would NOT recommend,  I hear the LED ones work Much better, I will buy the LED one next time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to start saving money on using this instead of paying salon prices.  What a good deal. The cost in my small town was so much higher.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product and although it took about a week to get here I was hoping it would be worth the wait and it was. It appears to work great! The timer works and all bulbs went in easily. Happy with product.</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time tonight. plugged in all the lights, plugged it in and it did not work! so Unsatisfied! I would not recommend it at all!</li>
    <li> The light works perfect for Gel polish and so far I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different gel polish brands and it&#x27;s perfect. I enjoy doing my own nails and I save a bunch of money compared to what the nail shops cost. I gave it a 4 only because there was a light bulb that didn&#x27;t work...I was still able to use even with 3 lights but just thinking they should make sure the bulbs work before sending it out to customers.  But all in all I&#x27;m happy with the product. I contacted the seller and they shipped out a light bulb a.s.a.p thanks again.</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend this lamp if you are looking for one to do your own Shellac at home. Dries fast and easy to put together. I already recommended it to a friend and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> I love this because it&#x27;s small and it does the job! The only bad thing is that it does take a lil longer to dry my shellac but I guess it&#x27;s cuz of the low Watts...but I don&#x27;t mind!</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Salon Supply. I was kind of nervous to order this lamp because the reviews are either excellent or terrible. I figured its 28 bucks why not give it a try, out of the cheap UV lamps this had better ratings. Once arrived I put the bulbs in which were a little difficult because the lamp doesnt leave much room to get them in and pop them into place. I turned the lamp on and 2 bulbs came to life, inserted the 3rd bulb and then it shut off the other 2 lights!!! terrible right? well i removed them all and unplugged it and gave it one more try. all 4 lights were working! I just got my shellac polish today in the mail, I put on the base coat and wasnt sure if it was \\&quot;curing\\&quot; the polish, maybe I need to wipe every layer with the alcohol? Whatever it was just a test run, then put on the top coat and this time held my finger right under one of the bulbs instead of at the bottom of the lamp, it cured in no time! Now I know it all works and I am very happy! I hope I get some good use out of this lamp!</li>
    <li> extremely happy! It drys my gel nail polish fast unlike a lot of others that I have tried! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Not worth your money. Save your money and buy a better quality one. Bought 2, one already broken. Not a Salon product</li>
    <li> OMG! This is awesome. Love it! Great Seller, great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lamp about 6 months ago and love it! I used to pay to get gel nails every couple of weeks but couldn&#x27;t afford to keep that habit up so decided to look into my own home kit. I looked at a lot of lamps in all brands and prices. This was the one that seemed to have the best reviews at the best price, so I purchased it. It&#x27;s been great! It works just as well as the professionals. Learning to paint your own nails with gel takes a bit of practice though, so good luck on that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the timer and typically go one full cycle then half a second cycle. This isn&#x27;t because i&#x27;ve had any issues, i&#x27;m just playing it safe to make sure the polish is cured enough. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I plugged it in, immediately started smoking! I reached for the off switch and all of a sudden the back exploded and sparks flew everywhere!!!!!! The lamp exploded!!!!!!! I was terrified!!!! Didn&#x27;t even get to use the item!</li>
    <li> This light works like its suppose to... But if I could do it over I would just spend the extra money and get an LED light...This one takes too long to cure.</li>
    <li> Ehhh! We didn&#x27;t buy expensive polish so I don&#x27;t know if that was the issue but this didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
    <li> I decided against gels&lt;br /&gt;This unit worked well though got HOT&lt;br /&gt;I passed it along to a friend</li>
    <li> I have been using this lamp for a while and have never had a problem. Works great especially for the price</li>
    <li> I gave it 2 stars becuse it did work as advertised. Only problem was that only 3 of the 4  bulb sockets worked. I bought a new bulb for the non working one ( I thought the bulb had broken during shipping) and when it still did not light, I knew it was the socket. I wonder how well it might have worked with all 4 bulbs lit. I think it was rather cheaply made, flimsy. I didn&#x27;t bother to return it because it would probably be too much hassel for such an inexpensive item</li>
    <li> great product!  i bought it to use with soak off polish and it works perfect with it.  i highly recommend it to other people.  worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Although I saw some negative views this product came as expected the bulbs fit tight and came on fine. I plan to do my nails after Christmas for the first time and can wait. By by salons</li>
    <li> Came with European plug, I live in the US.</li>
    <li> I never thought that I would own one of these so when I finally chose to get one I did some research. I knew what I was looking for and what I wanted but I never thought that when I ordered this I would be exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month and it&#x27;s already paid itself off.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with light bulbs had to go out and buy them!!! WTF!!!</li>
    <li> the one I got had a burned out light and a defective plug for one of the lamps, ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I tried 3 other machines. This was abt $10-12 more expensive, but totally worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Love it. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Nice timer function, roomy interior to allow entire hand to rest inside. I&#x27;ve used it a lot - probably 20 hours of lamp use so far - with no sign of the bulbs needing replaced.</li>
    <li> Very good idea to do this at home as opposed to spending so much money having someone else doing! One time investment saves me a ton of money. The product is amazing. Love the timer and can use for my fingers or toes.</li>
    <li> I can do my nails at home now!</li>
    <li> I am writing this review because I had read mixed reviews on this lamp.  This lamp works perfectly to cure opi axxium gels.  I am currently using it on the axxium sculpture gels not the soak off.  It cures in the specified time.  I am not sure why other reviewers had said that it did not work.  I will say if you move the light around a lot a bulb may get bumped loose.  All you have to do is pop it back into place.  I love the lamp and do not see the need to spend more money on a different brand.</li>
    <li> I needed a UV dryer for my Gelish nail polish, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on one.  This one was a great price and also works great!  The bulbs are very easy to put in and take out.  I use this all the time and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Good UV lmap for the money.  This product is above average, it works great for $30!  The only thing i don&#x27;t like about this lamp is that you have to do your nails one hand at a time so it takes a while.  Other than that, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> The bulbs were a bit awkward to get in the fixture and there aren&#x27;t really any instructions to help you out, just push them in until you feel them lock in place. I can&#x27;t even imagine what it is going to be like when I have to replace the bulbs. Works perfect for drying a shellac manicure to a durable shine!</li>
    <li> I bought 10 uv light for my nails salon  cheap but they don&#x27;t last ,not even 2month the light bull not on at all or 2 bull on 2 bull off so I have to find better uv light even more money, and don&#x27;t buy stuff make in china they all bad and use less</li>
    <li> I would have rated it with 5 stars but one of the bulbs were defective. I used it with just 3 and it worked fine.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  It is light, easily transports to my mom&#x27;s house and gets the job done.  Very reasonably priced.  It would be extra awesome if it included a built-in fan!!!</li>
    <li> This little lamp is excellent for the Gelish system.  It works wonderfully for both manicures and pedicures.  I love that the bottom tray slides out so that you can guide your hand or your foot inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lamp arrived with 4 individually packaged UV bulbs that needed to be inserted.  To insert the bulbs you just need to carefully line up each bulb in the allotted slot, then push it gently into the slot until it clicks into place.  Once you hear the \\&quot;click\\&quot; then it&#x27;s in. The lamp also came with an instruction manual and a bonus nail file which I thought was a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two minute timer on this lamp was perfect for curing each coat of my Gelish polish.  I highly recommend this lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/28/13:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my polish was chipping quicker than it does when I get my nails done at the salon.  I thought that was weird since the salon and I are both using the Gelish system.  What I discovered was that the wattage on this lamp does not allow the polish to get as hard as the light that the salon uses.  Although it does get hard, the polish only lasts a week and a half tops.  Your nails can also still chip.  Next time, I will save up and get a better model.  You definitely get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I had seen this dryer on Amazon and first decided to buy the more expensive Epica Double Wide UV Curing Nail Dryer for Acrylic Gel/Shellac Manicures 54 Watt, because I was worried a nail lamp for under $30 wouldn&#x27;t do the job.  The Epica Double Wide UV Curing Nail Dryer for Acrylic Gel/Shellac Manicures 54 Watt arrived broken and I sent it back and ordered this one.  It arrived in about a week, was packaged well and is just as described.  I&#x27;m not sure why other buyers complained that there isn&#x27;t a fan, the description doesn&#x27;t list a fan.  This lamp is not for standard nail polish drying it is for gelcolor and shellac polish (no fan needed).  Some buyers complained that the bulbs are hard to install but the bottom of the unit slides out giving plenty of room for installation and the bulbs snap in very easily. I recently decided to try doing my gelcolor nails at home to save money.  I purchased this nail lamp and OPI gelcolor, top and base coats and other supplies all from Amazon.  The nail lamp works perfectly and my nails came out beautiful.  The timer is very handy and I cured each coat the full 120 seconds.  I am glad I purchased this lamp and am looking forward to many more beautiful gelcolor manicures at home.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I can do my own gel nails. Getting them done every two weeks is way too expensive for me. After reading the reviews I chose this one. The light bulbs need to be installed when you get it. I had a really hard time trying to get them in and then only one would work. I was so dissappointed and was going to send it back but I had my husband look at it. He is stronger than I and he just push the lights in harder. They actually make a POP sound when they go in. I hadn&#x27;t push them in far enough. Then they all worked! The timer works great. You can put the light on continuous or put it to timer and then just push that button when you want it on for two minutes. I would definitly recommend this to anyone who wants to do their own nails.&lt;br /&gt;  By the way, I did e-mail the seller when I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work and before my husband looked at it and they got back with me right away. NICE!!</li>
    <li> I use the timer with the &amp;#34;gelish&amp;#34; brand and OPI brand gel polishes and it cures in the correct amount of time. The lamp arrived with one of the bulbs broken, I emailed the seller and asked for another bulb to be sent and they sent one for free right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the money, and good customer service to boot.</li>
    <li> took the product out of the box, set it up and plugged it in only to have to unplug it immediately because sparks shot out the back. Took some time to final reach the seller for a return label where I&#x27;m being charged to send it back. Still waiting for the out come of this whole mess but my credit card company is on stand by to dispute all charges.</li>
    <li> I bought a gel nail kit online so I ordered this lamp to go with it. I received the lamp very quickly after I ordered it, and was so excited to try it out only to find that it didn&#x27;t work. I had my husband try to install the bulbs in case I was maybe doing it wrong, but it still didn&#x27;t work. Now I have to order a different one from another company to be able to use my gel nail kit, AND I have to pay for shipping to return it which costs about a much as the lamp. I really wish I ever even bothered with this company. It may be cheap, but in turn you get a cheap POS product. Spend the extra money and get something that actually works!</li>
    <li> This item took over a week to arrive and when it did the item box was beat up.  Item had a plug that is not applicable to any U.S. outlet.  Very disappointed after waiting so long that this item was not as described and not able to be used.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to recieve this so quickly but very disappointed when I tried it and it did not heat up at all, the hottest it got was luke warm.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, works great. Makes the gel polish hard.thanks</li>
    <li> The timer on the light didnt work at all.  It does have a fuse that can be replcaed.</li>
    <li> Works nice although I don&#x27;t know if this is the reason why some of my polishes don&#x27;t stay on well.</li>
    <li> Lights do not stay on. You have to keep putting them back in the socket</li>
    <li> Takes forever to dry my gel. Half the time the bulbs don&#x27;t stay lit. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Yes the dyer is exactly what i expected. It was easy to set up and use.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend is nail tech/nail salon artist and she completely lost her mind when I showed this gift to her.  She told all of her friends and co workers about it and even used it on her friends nails.  She said this is best model she has ever used and even loves the 2min feature, keeps her from guessing the time.  If she loves it then I love it too!  5stars</li>
    <li> This works great. Definitely worth the money if you love to change up your nails a lot like I do. There&#x27;s no way I could afford to go to the salon every week so this has saved me so much money doing my nails myself. The lights are a little hard to get in. You have to use a little bit of force and I thought I was going to break them but nope, they all snapped in place. Sometimes the timer doesn&#x27;t work but I just have to turn it off and back on, no big deal. It definitely lasts also, now I can go almost two weeks before my nails start looking bad.</li>
    <li> The nail drier works and dries the gel nail polish, but the timer switch doesn&#x27;t work properly.  The people at the Salon Supply Store went out of their way to try and make it right and that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars.  They listened to and understood  the problem.  I would not hesitate to purchase anything from them.  They really stand behind their products and customer service is the Best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lamp once and so far I think it&#x27;s great. The bulbs come in a separate package so you have to put them in but that&#x27;s very simple. Although it takes 2 minutes for for the timer to go off, still a good purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased I received this within 4 days after ordering it.  I like this lamp, I really really do.  I only used it once, for the first time today in fact.  But I have to admit upon opening it a couple weeks ago I was very upset.  One of my lights was slightly damaged, but I managed to fix it.  The lights are really hard to push in.. so if you&#x27;re struggling with them and think they don&#x27;t fit....well they do.  You just need to push them in harder. The price of this lamp is great i&#x27;m really glad though I wasn&#x27;t stuck with an expensive lamp being my only option.  Its pretty flimsy though, so I recommend you be careful with it. And I&#x27;ve read about some people looking pulling the blue film off.... well i left mine on and my nails came out fine.  You don&#x27;t need to take it off.</li>
    <li> Works very nicely - just like at the nail salon!  Now I can save myself some $$ and do my own pedicures at home!</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  Paid for itself the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> Lights are a little glitchy in that they pop out a couple times, but my nails are &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; in seconds and solid for weeks!</li>
    <li> The timer doesn&#x27;t work and but its working ok with my shellac!Great product  And great price and great product. So yes I recommend it</li>
    <li> Works good, wish it had a fan.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, love the blue light. It isn&#x27;t too hot heats and dry quickly as it suppose too. Fits  perfectly on my desk</li>
    <li> I love this lamp. I did not have problems with my bulbs like other people claim. They were hard to push in, but that keeps them from falling out when I put the lamp away (I don&#x27;t have enough space to keep it on the counter all the time, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to anyways).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the timer feature, and the sliding tray. Although I don&#x27;t really need to slide the tray in and out to get my hands in and out of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can fit both of my hands in the unit at the same time, to reduce the amount of time I spend on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for at home manicures with gel polish (and for the price of one salon manicure!),  can do my nails every week with a different color.</li>
    <li> Product description clearly states that it has a dryer fan. I was fully assured that although its advertised with this feature, it is not available on this model. Very unhappy about being clearly mislead!</li>
    <li> Works exactly the way I expected.the pull out feature for toes works really well. Bulbs are easier to install if u pull out the bottom completely first. Timer is a good feature. Works well with builder gel too</li>
    <li> its a good light for a person who whishes to do nails at home on their own, its made of very cheap material but it works good! however for a salon i would recommend somethig better i dont think it would last multiple uses in one day.</li>
    <li> The drawer is good for those new to Gel Nails, because it is handy when trying to get your fingers placed just right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 2 of these &amp; neither worked. Save your time &amp; your money! I wish that it did work. It was great for the price, but a disappointment!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend so she could use it to apply Gelish nail polish.  IT DID NOT DRY HER NAILS.  She tried using this with other nail polishes and it does not work for those brands either.  I wish I would have listened to these review and NOT purchase this item. Do not make the same mistake.  Happy Shopping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much easier and cheaper to give myself shellac manicures at home with CND top and bottom coats and this UV nail lamp. The bulbs have lasted me more than half the year now.</li>
    <li> For those who live outside of US and wish to buy this lamp (actually as well as any other appliance designed and made in the US), please carefully read below note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Since the lamps are designed and made in the US. The power voltage used by these lamps is 110V. If you are purchasing the lamp from a different country e.g. Australia, you are required to use a step down transformer which will reduce the power supply to the lamp from 220-240V to 110V. Different countries have a different Voltage and if the country you are in has a power voltage of more than 110V, you will need to use a step down transformer to connect the lamp. Connecting the lamp directly to the power supply will result in a power surge burning the wiring and the lamp. This is something which cannot be rectified neither can the product be exchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot about power voltage and burnt mine.......&lt;br /&gt;And here I would like to note that there is no sign or note neither on the lamp itself nor on its package about its voltage, which I believe is not correct...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big &amp;#34;nail freak&amp;#34;, but like mine to look nice &amp; always battled with the drying issue.  I would spend so much time (hours) waiting between coats, and then after all of my hard work, I would smudge them on something anyway.....frustrating!  This curing light works fantastic!  I would definitely recommend it....cuts your wait time down to a fraction!</li>
    <li> This saves you having to go to a salon and getting your nails done and spending this amount on doing your nails every time! I just love it!</li>
    <li> This product works great and I love it.  I use it all the time and thought it to be cheap in price compared to others I looked at.  I am very happy with this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like how it is very open and you can doe your toes with it as well. The timer is also a plus.</li>
    <li> couple of the bulbs didn&#x27;t work and then had a hard time finding them, didn&#x27;t come with any paperwork so was at a loss on how to get them, thank god for the internet and Amazon or I&#x27;d never got to use it yet..as it was had it a month before I was able to try my new expensive nail work.hopefully now it&#x27;ll get cheaper. all you gel nail users, lacquer remover works better than scrapping.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant ordering a light that was so affordable, but I absolutely love it!  My previous light would only cure very light colors, this one works great and I have had no problem even with very dark colors on the second coat.  I also love that I can do my whole hand (including thumb) all at once.  Fast shipping as always.</li>
    <li> The lamp works perfectly fine, but one of the bulbs was broken, and its much more expensive to get a new one than to return the whole package and get it again and no one guarantees it won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
    <li> Yes it gets hot! Yes its got a timer! Yes you can turn it off and on without the timer! Yes you can put it together myself! Yes you can do this and afford to have great nails all the time! If I can do it(I work on and around cars 50 hours as week) you can too!! This lamp was perfect, it cured my nails just like it says its going to, and my nails even though I did them, still look great!</li>
    <li> I bought this only 6 mos ago and have used it lightly.  The timer broke two months ago and now two of the bulbs work intermittently. This should have lasted much longer with light usage. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This works great.  The only downfall is it only large enough to dry nails on one hand at a time.</li>
    <li> Good Quality a year later. Use both hands in at the same time. Comforting even.</li>
    <li> I got this product probably  about 7 months ago and don&#x27;t use it  a lot so I went today to use it on a client  and the whole  light bulb split into and is  stuck in the  machine ... so I don&#x27;t know what to do ????</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, this product does not have a fan.  I was a bit disappointed to see that.  The dryer, however, is a nice size (plenty big for an entire hand or 5 toes) and much higher wattage than other dryers in this price range.  The one that I received was brand new in the box from the manufacturer, with instructions, original bubble wrap and everything. The bulbs arrived in individual little boxes inside the dryer.  If you are having trouble getting the bulbs in, remove the \\&quot;bottom\\&quot; of the dryer (the tray that you rest your hand on).  It slides right out and then you have clear access to the sockets that the bulbs go in. You can then just slide that piece back in when you&#x27;re done.  For the price, I can&#x27;t complain.  Other companies charge the same amount for dryers with a fraction of the wattage this one has.  This was the best deal I could find after searching pretty extensively. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase (though I&#x27;d be much happier if it had a fan)!</li>
    <li> This lamp works great.  I did have some difficulty getting the bulbs to go in their sockets but with a little patience I managed to get them.  I would recommend this lamp to get started doing your own nails at home.  It is very cost effective and does a good job for the money.</li>
    <li> works great and for a good price</li>
    <li> It is hard to set the timer, otherwise the unit does a good job.</li>
    <li> Hard to install the bulbs but it works fine</li>
    <li> No complaints....it does what it is supposed to do. The bulbs are strong and i like that it has a 120 second timer. though i don&#x27;t use it its a nice feature.I&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could do my gel nails at home and it works great!  Only have to put cure nails for two minutes.  I don&#x27;t know how the 120 second timer thingy works, but I just turn it on and leave my nails in it for 2 minutes.  It does get hot so I recommend a sunscreen/sunblock on your hands every time you use the machine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this nail light to use with CND Shellac products &amp; it works fine for that. I am a licensed Cosmetologist &amp; even with the wholesale prices I get this lamp was a great price! When I first received it I inserted all of the lightbulbs, but could not get it to work. I was about to give up, but then after a second look at the light bulbs I realized I hadn&#x27;t pushed them far enough in. So be sure the light bulbs are fully inserted before giving up on this product (I have a feeling that this is the reason some of the reviews say that the product wouldn&#x27;t turn on for them).</li>
    <li> This is the second one [same] uv lamp I have purchased. The first one as a gift for my nail tech. I have it made. she comes here and does my nails using this lamp, she loves to use it.</li>
    <li> I must have received a defective unit.  Two lights never worked, so I returned it and received a credit right away. I ended up purchasing a different Curing device.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this Gel Curing Light for anyone wanting to cure their nails in 2-3 minutes, no longer.&lt;br /&gt;Salon Edge 36W UV Lamp was so reasonable for what it accomplishes.</li>
    <li> This item came exactly how it was described and it was shipped really fast. I haven&#x27;t painted my nails yet as I just haven&#x27;t had time, but I am excited and can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful! I love that I can do my own gel nails at home now and save a ton of money!</li>
    <li> Light is the perfect size to fit all five fingers and I have used it several times now and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a $69 light with the same specs as this one that she purchased from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. It works perfectly. This one doesn&#x27;t cure the gell. Although it was only $29, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> works ok just wish i wouuld have gotten an LED one instead.</li>
    <li> This lamp does not work for gelish and is a piece of crap. DO NOT waste your money. I will be returning the one I bought.. VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> Well, I have only used it once, but all the bulbs work.  There were no instructions in the box as to how to use it, and I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to use the timer.  It certainly does not shut off in two minutes, or beep or anything.  The light just stays on.  But, I guess I can use a clock???  Seems to dry the Gelish polish though and that is the reason for the purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this uv lamp to go with the gelish polish kit that I also purchased from the same seller. The first lamp came with a part that fell out of the box. When I put the bulbs in one of the bulbs didn&#x27;t work. All I had to do was email the seller and they replaced the lamp with no extra charge for shipping. Great product, great price and excellent service.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what light to purchase to cure my gel polish, but the salon edge 36 watt UV lamp worked great!! My gelish manicure turned out awesome!</li>
    <li> I am puchasing this lamp and I was wondering is a fan inside of this lamp like stated in the ad?</li>
    <li> The Salon lamp works perfectly fine, once I figured out a few things.  I initially did not think the lamp was working and decided to look into the CND lamp. After reading the CND reviews, I discovered that you have to remove the green plastic that lines the base…the instructions do not include this little tidbit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I read that you have to remove the tacky residue only after you cure the top coat…I initially thought I had to remove the residue after all coats (base and color), but that is not the case.  I did 2 layers of base coat and one top coat, curing between each layer, then took off the residue with an alcohol swab (70%).  I am astounded how good my nails look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The test now is to see if the CND Shellac stays on my nails, I have never been able to keep polish on.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my wife. She used it one time and the next time she got it out to use it would not work. Does not seem to be worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> The lamp is really good for the money you pay for it. It works perfect. Of course you can see that it&#x27;s the cheap one but it works perfect. I think it&#x27;s perfect for home use.</li>
    <li> This item did not work as well as I&#x27;d hoped. After several cycles my polish wasn&#x27;t cured properly. I shoved it under my bed after 1 use &amp; haven&#x27;t used it since. Spend a little more to get a better product.</li>
    <li> It did not work when it arrived no matter what I tried.  I sent it back and ordered a different unit.</li>
    <li> came on time in perfect working order. everything was brand new and all the lights worked, still working today a couple  months later!</li>
    <li> It cut down on the time, but still took quite a long time to dry the&lt;br /&gt;Shellac.  This is my second brand and I think I will change back&lt;br /&gt;to regular polish cause it takes too long to cure shellac.</li>
    <li> Everything is alright but the light bulbs burned on my 2 use. Not good ..I ordered new light bulbs.</li>
    <li> Great one hand unit.  I have several of these and for the price, you cannot beat it</li>
    <li> Disappointed! First use it caught on fire seconds after I turned it on.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product at first because of the price. I am glad to say that I know think differently. It is just what I wanted and does the job beautiful. It&#x27;s definitely a reminder that you don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to get a great product.</li>
    <li> So I returned a previous UV lamp because I saw this one which is way cheaper and thought id give it a try.  Works just as good. No complaints. Based on the price and quality I would recommend this.  I truly have had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lamp to do my own Shellac nails at home.  Lamp works fine... does not appear durable, but functionally its ok.  It dries my nails and the timer work.</li>
    <li> Love the product .  It is everything plus more .  Ihave been using it for myself and my friends. It gets my nails dry very fast .  Thanks again for the product.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been thinking about opening up a nail business at my school since I, like many other college students, am BROKE and needing extra money. I decide to follow through and buy this particular nail dryer for the fact that it is affordable with good reviews. First of all, it took the dryer 2 weeks to get to me. I waited impatiently until the day came and when it actually got to me, the dryer was BROKEN. The lights do not come on and the machine does not get hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaliah</li>
    <li> From reading other reviews I knew this lamp didn&#x27;t have a fan, but a fan isn&#x27;t needed for Shellac UV polish and that&#x27;s what I was using it for.  I did my fist ever Shellac manicure at home today and this lamp worked awesome!  All the bulbs work, the timer is super handy, has an on/off switch for timing other than 2 minute increments, and costs less than $30.  I think this is a perfect Shellac curing lamp for the perfect price.  If you need a lamp with a fan or with a timer that does increments other than 2 minutes then you&#x27;ll have to buy a different lamp.  But this one works perfect for what I need it for and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone using it for DIY Shellac manicures/pedicures.</li>
    <li> I got my light super fast and could not wait to use it. Very pleased with it. Love how the lights go down the sides to make sure the thumbs get cured.</li>
    <li> This was an affordable item that I bought to save money on the gel nail process. It works great and is easy to operate. It has a timer button on the back that allows it to stay on for 2 minutes. It did not come with directions and I tried recommendations others had shared....paint a based coat - then dry for one session - paint the color - dry for one session - paint a 2nd color coat - dry for one session - and finally, paint a top coat and dry for two sessions. If there is still some stickyness - either try drying it one more time or gently run some cotton with polish remover over the top. Also - be careful to not get polish too thick on the edge of your nail - or you will end up picking it off.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and it works great.  It is big enough for the whole hand which is a big plus. But, it isn&#x27;t so large that it is bulky or heavy.  I hope it lasts because I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Also, the slide out bottom makes the installation of the bulbs incredibly easy.</li>
    <li> This was new when I purchased it but two of the bulbs where bad that came with it so I have to buy two new bulbs , so beware you may have to do the same or ship it back .</li>
    <li> This is my third uv lamp. I now know that I have to change the bulbs every 4 to 5 months which I wasn&#x27;t doing before which burned out the machine. Hopefully that will stop happening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lamp with the CND shellac polish and it works perfectly, you do not need to spend more on a UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much set up out of the box, I think I had to plug in the 4 bulbs, and it has a 2 minute timer in the back, which saves you having to guess or time your coat drying. It also has an on position where it will not go off after 2 minutes, if that is what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with a anti UV glove, just in case the light is potentially damaging to the skin</li>
    <li> I purchases this NEW Lamp from Salon Edge (I even verified with Amazon before contacting the seller), but received OLD, scratched, dirty, dented one.  I was taken back when I took it out of the box and didn&#x27;t even want to continue unpacking.  So I put it back and right away processed the Refund on this unit.  Well it took about a week for them to contact me back, then they wanted pictures of it, when it took more email tags (they only reply once a day), so each email took a day of waiting.  Finally I got my shipping label.  Shipped it back.  3 weeks later I checked my account, no credit.  Checked to see if they got the package-yes they did.  So i had to file a claim with amazon.  Also emailed the seller AGAIN asking where is my refund???  I did finally get it, BUT the total took about 3 weeks of email tags and waiting, and a reminder that they need to refund the money on the product that they have in their possession.</li>
    <li> I see these UV lamps in professional beauty suppliers all the time for $150 and up and always rolled my eyes at the possiblity of having an at home kit until I saw this! Its the same wattage as the $150 models for a fraction of the price!! I have used this lamp with Gelish polish with flawless results. The timer is a MUST have! I even raved about it so much that a friend of mine bought one too! It comes with 4 lights and a heavy grit nail file as a bonus.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews, I was hesitant. Mine arrived perfect, I use it all the time to cure my gel nails. I have even done some friends!! THIS is THEE greatest price ever, over 60$ at Sallys!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to do my own Gel nails at home because I was tired of paying an arm and a leg at the salon (my nails grow really quickly and I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost ever 2 weeks or so). This light has worked perfectly for me. I like that it has a timer, so I can just watch TV while my nails dry and I know exactly when they&#x27;re done. NOTE: After you take your gel nails out of the light, they&#x27;ll still be sticky!! You NEED to wipe them down with alcohol to make them shiney and smooth--this is not a defect, it&#x27;s how the gel is designed so that multiple layers of gel can be applied and still stick to the nail.</li>
    <li> seriously, i had no idea this item was as big as it is.....i did my first shellac manicure and they came out great. perfect for the money. and the timer light button makes it that much easier....</li>
    <li> when i took it out of the box i seen that it had some corrosion on the front...but it was supposed to b new! i decided to try it anyway cuz i really wanted to use my new shellac polishes BUT OF COURSE it didnt turn on. i tried adjusting the bulbs and the fuse. nope broke its gotta go back</li>
    <li> I bought this as an investment to do my own shellac nails at home. This product came as discribed. IT was very easy to put the lamps on and it was ready for imediate use. The timer works great! My nails look professional and I get compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work, had to return it.</li>
    <li> so far it&#x27;s awesome! had a little trouble at first putting in the bulbs...it&#x27;s hard to push them all the way in place &amp; I was afraid of breaking them! other than that it works perfect!</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase. One minor issue: There&#x27;s always one of the lights that become disconnected easily if the unit has been moved during operation and need to be pushed back in or slightly tapped. Maybe I just need to push the lights in the sockets a little harder before usage, but it seems as if they&#x27;d break in my hands if I tried ((ouch)). Gelish and Gelaze products are what I use with this unit. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how professional my nails look plus they cure beautifully and last about 2 weeks!!</li>
    <li> The light bulb is not stable on these.. The light goes off sometimes during curing, and you have to maneuver to put it back on. It does the job but slowly. Ok for the price.</li>
    <li> works as expected! very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Is very lightweight - works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Once you learn to use it, it&#x27;s great.  Remove the blue shields, silly people.  Make sure the light bulbs are seated properly.  I save so much money.</li>
    <li> It only has a 120 min setting and infinity. But overall its great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and it was shipped promptly.  I was quite surprised to find that the plug is European - and won&#x27;t fit US standard outlets without an adapter!  This is extremely disappointing.  Also - as with all other review...there is no fan.  Item seems cheap but essentially worthless without the appropriate adapter.</li>
    <li> Using this UV lamp with my CND Shellac line.  Love it and have no complaints!  Would recommend as a cheaper alternative than the CND recommended lamp.</li>
    <li> Works great. Wouldn&#x27;t get anything less than 36W. Only problem for me is that I&#x27;m having a hard time finding replacement bulbs for the machine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, the timer is perfect- don&#x27;t have to remember how long I&#x27;ve been drying. And large enough that someone with small hands can fit both hands into it at the same time to save time.</li>
    <li> Works great and the price is awesome!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected for the price. Small and easy to move around. Definitely helps with nail work and drying.</li>
    <li> Good UV Lamp with an auto 2 minute light timer. Easy to install the bulbs, and seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> It works, but I guess it depends on the polish whether or not it&#x27;ll stay on your nails,</li>
    <li> This lamp works great.  I used it only once but it worked exactly as I expected. Excellent product for the price!</li>
    <li> Love it! Great Price! Perfect for my girls &amp; I.</li>
    <li> May be it is too soon to rate, Ive had this for only a month. So far it has been great for its price.</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting a fan but did not come with one so they should take that out of the title because that&#x27;s false advertising. Basically I got what I paid for. It&#x27;s cheap but it works.</li>
    <li> I just received and used for the first time last night. My nails look great and look like they were professionally done and feel like it as well. Something I didn&#x27;t realize is that you have to have a Gel polish kit, I would suggest buying online, and I bought from a store and spent close to twice what I would have if I would have bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read other places that you can use regular nail polish (but you have to let dry for hours, 8-24) then you can put the top gel coat on to seal it. I obviously have not tired this yet but I hope it works as I don&#x27;t want to have to buy colored Gel Nail polish. Entire processes take a while as you have to cure for 2 min a few different times. Would maybe consider getting a LED nail light instead of the UV seems like some of the curing time is shorter (this is according to my gel polish starter kit so not a reflection on the lamp.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no fan and I also got some UV protecting gloves, maybe not necessary but I try to limit all UV exposure as I have fair skin. I am still glad I bought everything; I don’t like having to pay someone to do my nails as it is not a necessity but it is nice when they are done. So this way I get my nails done and after a few uses will be “saving money”.</li>
    <li> I received it yesterday and could hardly wait to try it out. Unfortunately after 30-45 seconds of use the lamp started sarkling, it simply blew up and smoke came out from the top. I was very scared and jumped up from the chair immediately. The lamp still has a strong burnt smell.&lt;br /&gt;I will not return it from Hungary because the return costs more money than the value of the lamp. I am very disappointed that this ended so badly. I read mainly good reviews about this product and I do not  understand why this happened. If I remember well, I chose 220V lamp which fits to the European voltage standards, so this should not be the origin of the problem.</li>
    <li> Bulbs clicked right in without any problems. Everything worked right out of the box. Have used for 6 polish changes so far and still going strong. I do like that the tray slides in and out. I think next time I might go with a LED lamp only for time saving ability. Under UV light the gel needs to cure for 2 minutes, but only 30 seconds for a LED. Either that or buy a UV lamp that will fit 2 hands in at the same time. For the price, this was an excellent deal to get started with doing your own gel nails. It works like a charm! Would recommend to somebody looking for a lamp in this price range.</li>
    <li> greay price and gets the jpb done.  be careful when installing bulbs, it feels like you have tp really push hard to snap them it, be careful not to break them</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a quick lamp and compact, however it seemed to make my gel run and streak.</li>
    <li> This is a full size light. Your entire hand can fit in it. It comes with the bulbs so you are ready to set your gel polish. Awesome customer service. If you have to contact seller, they are very nice and prompt to react.</li>
    <li> Just tried this out and it works perfectly and at the price I am really happy I chose it! The timer works. There just wasn&#x27;t any info on how to buy replacement light bulbs, but I&#x27;ll cross that bridge when I get there.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a Valentines day present.  She loves and says it works perfectly.  The light bulbs were not the easiest things to install (small hands come in handy).</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this UV lamp. It does the job it needs to do for nails, and it comes with a great price. I also was surprised I recieved this lamp in the mail a few days after I ordered it.- I love it.</li>
    <li> This lamp measures a big bigger than in the picture, but it&#x27;s a good lamp that matches the specs on the CND lamp that costs like $100. You can do all five fingers at once with this lamp too.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, Great service, Great packaging, and at the $25 I paid for it, it was a Great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this UV Lamp multiple times and have not had a problem with it. If you are looking for a UV Lamp that is a good deal, quality, and quick to ship this is the lamp for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a finger only lamp, or one finger at a time lamp, it is a full hand lamp and I have big hands. It can do only one hand at a time but if you are enjoying a girls spa day this is the right choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product last week and received it within a week!  It was packaged nicely and the lights were easy to snap in.  I can do a whole hand at one time, and can easily get my toes in for a pedicure! I&#x27;ve already done a pedi and a manicure, and they both turned out awesome!  Thanks for such great service!</li>
    <li> I bought this UV lamp for my wife for Mother&#x27;s Day. She loved it. It&#x27;s a very basic machine. Plastic housing, a timer on the back, and 4 universal U/V lights. It does what it is supposed to do. It dries the polish in 2 minutes. I saw some models out there for almost two hundred bucks. Why spend that much for the exact same thing when this does the same thing at a fraction of the price? I didn&#x27;t notice any inherent design flaws, and after a few uses, so far so good. I am rating this so high because of it&#x27;s value, not for any bells or whistles. Bang for your buck, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to try shellac polish on my own at home! I&#x27;m a Grandma and it works great. Very inexpensive and I have no problems whatsoever. I have had it almost a year and its working like a charm. I know the lights eventually will need to be replaced and I chose this light as it has replacement lights available.</li>
    <li> I used it maybe 4-5 times. Now the lights won&#x27;t come on. Just flickers and make a funny noise. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This is what the professionals use.  I love it, it works so well!  I can now save tons of money by doing my nails myself and they look beautiful!  Awesome product!  I love the self timer...it takes the guesswork out of how long to have your hand in there!</li>
    <li> Great product!! I was a little confused because I didn&#x27;t know you had to wipe off the shellac with alcohol wipes after putting your hands in the uv lamp for 2 minutes, but one I figured it out it&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> This item was alright for the money.  The quality was not there, but it was only $25. So can&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
    <li> great UV lamp. love doing my gel at home!</li>
    <li> Only one of the 4 bulbs work that come with the product</li>
    <li> Plenty big for one full hand and my polish stayed several days longer than when I used my old lamp.</li>
    <li> This is a very good and affordable UV-lamp. I&#x27;ve had no problem so far, but I haven&#x27;t had it for too long either. But so far so good!</li>
    <li> Awesome light for such a great price. It did come with one broken bulb but the seller got me a replacement free of charge and free shipping super fast. I love that it has a timer for the light so you don&#x27;t have to worry about watching the clock.</li>
    <li> Im happy with the lamp. The built in timer is very hpful.</li>
    <li> When I first received the lamp, two of the bulb plugs did not work.  They immediately sent out a new one and didn&#x27;t ask me to ship back the old one. It works great, but the timer button that is supposed to be two minutes, is actually a bit less.  It still cures my gelish perfectly, even with just under two minutes.  I do, however, with that I had spent a bit more and got one that would fit both of my hands side by side, rather than just one at a time.</li>
    <li> I order this UV lamp on Sept 6 and received it Sept 10 ( not including Sunday)  that&#x27;s 3 days! !!!!!! I have not used it yet but I did plug it up and it worked good.  I&#x27;m satisfied. THANKS !</li>
    <li> I was expecting a salon quality UV Lamp and it just doesnt seem to work well when it cures my Shellac. I have to cure it several times rather then the 2 mins the bottle of Shellac says it takes to cure.</li>
    <li> This UV lamp claims to have a fan, but it DOES NOT. I was hoping for it to have one to speed up the drying time when doing my nails with regular polish (as opposed to gel polish). It doesn&#x27;t do much for regular polish, but I git it a 100% if you&#x27;re using it to do gel nails. The light has the option of being on, off, or on a set timer. The timer is for 2 minutes and is perfect for curing gel nails. The bulbs are kind of hard to get in and you have to make sure you really push them hard to get them to catch. I didn&#x27;t have two of them in all the way so they kept flickering on and off. I figured out what was wrong and now everything works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Works great and came really fast</li>
    <li> I love this light.. noce that it has a timer on it, and it drys the gel paint quickly and evenly</li>
    <li> Works great and I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t super expensive like my last one that broke after 4 uses! I use this weekly and I love it!</li>
    <li> After using this unit a few times, the timer switch no longer functions.</li>
    <li> This dryer works perfectly. The bulbs snapped into place easily. I use it with regular polish. I have not experienced the tackiness on my nails others have, maybe it&#x27;s the polish. I use the timer on it after every coat.</li>
    <li> I love it! It works great!</li>
    <li> Definately worth the price! It&#x27;s already paid for itself :) I would definately reccomend this product if you want to do an at home gel manicure!</li>
    <li> So I previously ordered a 36 watt lamp from idonails.com and when I received it IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK &amp; I sat on the phone with a representative and she was trying to say it worked and all this so I decided to order this one. When I opened the package it was packaged securely, everything works just fine &amp; y&#x27;all even threw in a nail file. THANK YOU SO MUCH! I love it</li>
    <li> Product is DAMAGED.  side bulbs  don&#x27;t light up unless the bulbs are being held (poor makemenship on the sockets to hold the bulbs ) and there the cord meets the machine is cracked. the box or package was not damaged but the product was.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading some of the available reviews.  I used a shellac top coat with my regular nail polishes and cure my nails under this dryer.  Its super fast.  After 2minutes my nails are dry and I am ready to be on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am now able to change my nail polish very often although so far I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  The first time it was effortless, but the second time my polish kept messing up after i put it under the dryer even after a minute.  I kept having to soak off the polish and doing it again about 3 times.  That didn&#x27;t happen the first time so I&#x27;m thinking that it was something with the polish I used. But i do not regret this purchase at all because even with having to redo a couple of nails its still faster than drying the old fashion way. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Just got the salon edge 36w uv lamp, used it a couple of times &amp; so far haven&#x27;t had any complaint. Am hoping it stays that way!</li>
    <li> Thank for the equipment it worked out just perfect. I use it everyday and recommend it  to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to repair my nails in between visits to the salon.  Wow, much nicer than I would have thought, and works wonderfully.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Works just as good as salon lights at a way better cost! Make sure you read how to do a shellac manicure before you use it. If you do it right, it will last 2 weeks or more!</li>
    <li> one of the bulbs dont work</li>
    <li> I love to have great looking nail but I do not want to keep paying for something that I have to keep getting fixed. I can do my own nail so this is while I added this product as an additional to my nail collection and I am so happy for this product.</li>
    <li> This works great. I decided to try doing my nails myself and I am so glad. It is easy to do and this lamp is perfect. It is just like the ones they use in the salon. I like the fact that it will do my entire hand including the thumb. It makes life so much easier to be able to do my nails when ever I want to.</li>
    <li> Great little light! The hand rest pulls out for you to install the lights - have already done my nails and worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> it is ok for the money</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product and I bought all the supplies I needed to do my own nails. I was SO dissapointed when it arrived because much to my surprise it had a european 220v plug on it.  it was totally useless to me unless I want to spend additional money to buy some kind of adaptor, which I know nothing about. From the reviews I read it seems like a great product but I will never know because I had to return it. Amazon was amazing at processing a refund very quickly but now I have to try to find a new one to buy before I can do my nails. I am hesitant to purchase from a company who is clearly dishonest in their product description. So all in all it was a waste of time and a big dissapointment.</li>
    <li> Love it super fast and good for gelish nail polish</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it turned out fantastic.  Easy to use and having the timer was an added plus.  Only drawback was the cord was short, so I was limited as to where I could use it.</li>
    <li> This works even to help cute regular polish</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far because my nails stay put for weeks! Obsessed with shellac/gel nails! This lamp gets the job done for a fraction of the cost of others. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is ok  It does not have a fan as advertised.  All the bulbs work, some have stated theres did not. My timer works sometimes or should I say when it feels like it!</li>
    <li> Is was what I wanted  absolutely love this item may order one for a gift for some one for christmas</li>
    <li> recieved the light and excited to use it, But the timer didnt work when I recieved it. So I had to return the brand new light.</li>
    <li> It was inexpensive and exactly what I wanted.  I have used it several times already.  It quickens dry time which is what I needed.</li>
    <li> This right works really good and love how it has the pull out tray for your hand so you dont have to worry about touching the lights or the sides.</li>
    <li> this thing is awsome. i love it. mine came with a standard american plug, so i did not have any issues. works great on all the polishes i have tried so far, and i polish alot.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this UV lamp.  Works very well and is a really good product.  I am not disappointed at all.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It sure saves me a lot from salon manicures.  Good results with this curing light.</li>
    <li> It works great!!!! I was skeptical because of some of the rivews I read but mine seems to be working fine. I would of gave it five stars but when I received it, it has a scratch on the back wall of the inside. Besides that it works great.</li>
    <li> I am a nail student and needed a UV light for Gel Nails and I love this professional unit with the slide tray makes it easier not to get polish on the Lisht.. Very happy and arrived exactly on time. awesome</li>
    <li> Rally disappointed in this product. The side lights don&#x27;t cure thumbnails well and the side lights kept going off. This was a very poor choice if you need something reliable for business.</li>
    <li> The price was the enticing factor. I wanted to do my own gel &amp; shellac nails at home as most salons aren&#x27;t open at 11pm! This received a lot of varying reviews, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. Good price, service, delivery. Bulbs were individually wrapped in bubble wrap and in their own boxes inside big box. The plate pulls out easily so bulb installation is a breeze. I had a little trouble with the fuse. The fuse cap wasn&#x27;t screwed in all the way. I took it out, put the fuse back in, screwed the cap on tight and then it worked like a champ! The directions are poorly written, but playing around with the light I figured everything out. The timer&lt;br /&gt;makes simple work of it. Does a good job. I have UV gloves to keep my hands from overexposure to the bulbs. Takes the worry out of it too.</li>
    <li> If you decide to return it , just like I did...think again! I thought that did not cure my nail, just clean them with high proof alcohol and that would do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed to realize that my nails are still tacky and couldn&#x27;t wait a second to print the return label.... it really bugged me why isn&#x27;t working on my nails , so I thought i&#x27;d research a bit. That&#x27;s when I found out that its normal to have them all tacky , until you clean them with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I kept my UV light and so far happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> The device did not work.  No matter how many minutes I use, my nails were still wet, and my hands ended up getting really dark (probably from the UV).  And the device is really bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another starter set from my local pharmacy store, and it worked much better!</li>
    <li> This product was a gift for my daughter.  It appeared to be as advertised, and arrived in a timely manner.  I was satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I received this product and after installing the bulbs, it did not turn on. The timer switch was also broken. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with my Red Carpet Gel nsil polish!  It is wonderful i particularly love that it is big enough for your entire hand, some light just fit 4 fingers and you have to do the thumb separately!</li>
    <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it-but I will be giving this as a gift to a family member.</li>
    <li> great home UV lamp, works well, used with regular nail polish for several weeks, it worked good, then for the first time, I used this with my Gelish polish, wow, so very, very pleased!! It works GREAT on GELS!! all the lamps turn on, yes, the bulbs can slide out of the slot and &amp;#34;not work&amp;#34;, it only has happened once, I use this item every week, then put it back in the bubble wrap and in the box after each use so the moving it around probably jarred it loose, but I slid it back in and voila, the bulb worked again! I LOVE, LOVE the timer function!! turn the switch on the back to timer mode, it stays on for the alloted time, then turns off automatically, perfect! I don&#x27;t need to set any timers or watch a clock...the size it good too, I can fit my whole hand in, and when doing gelish, I stick all 8 fingers in (weaved on top of eachother), then my thumbs seperate to keep the gels level.</li>
    <li> This is great, no more going to the nail salon for gel manicures and get to select all of my own polsh</li>
    <li> Got this for doing Gel or Shellac nail polish. It works well! Not too big either which I think is nice for storage and general use. I use it for my toes too! It does get a little warm on the hand while waiting for the 2 mins.</li>
    <li> I returned this lamp back as lamps don.t fit the holes and can&#x27;t be fixed inside. Very poor design .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for a simple shellac but it looks cheap and it feels like it needs more than two minutes to cure the gel.&lt;br /&gt;It still does the work though.&lt;br /&gt;It could be better.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is a great product all bulbs worked and im satisfied ordering a 2nd one today as im having a pampering party for the girls next weekend and 2 would be great to have.</li>
    <li> I just recently decided to do shellac nails at home, and having no experience or beauty license, was a bit nervous about dropping $100+ on the CND UV lamp. I purchased this one instead and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It did exactly what it was supposed to do (I dried for 4 minutes per layer just to be on the safe side, and because it was my first time, but I don&#x27;t think it was necessary) and my nails turned out beautifully. Five stars for this lamp, which I think is a great value compared to others available, and two thumbs up for shellac nails in general. I did a french manicure and they look great, it was quite easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is your polish layers will still be tacky even if you leave your nails in the lamp for a long time. I don&#x27;t know why this is, you just keep applying and curing in the lamp up until the top coat, after which your nails will still be tacky, but when you wipe the nails with high-percentage alcohol the tacky layer magically disappears and the polish underneath is hard and super-shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Unit did not have a fan, though .</li>
    <li> When I ordered the Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp Acrylic Gel Shellac Curing Light I simply wanted this final aid to do my nails at home.  When the product arrived, I quickly went through the assembling steps.  This simply meant inserting the bulbs.  When I plugged in the lamp, one bulb did not work--no matter how it was inserted. However,even with the one dark bulb, the lamp worked! The $29 spent, was a little less than what I&#x27;d pay for the gel nails in the salon.  Now I do my nails every 10 days in the comfort of my home.  This is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with how easy it was to purchase and how quickly the lamp came.  It works great and I am happy with my product.</li>
    <li> I received the dryer a few days ago and waited until my midterms were over to try it out. I just put it together&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s not even working. Ive been at this over an hour,truly thinking I did something wrong. Also, I never received&lt;br /&gt;An invoice,nor did this come with any instructions on how to put it together. I feel cheated. I knew something was up when the light bulbs looked as if they had some corrosion around the base. My advice is don&#x27;t let the price full you. I guess ill be heading to Sephora instead.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this item from Liquidation Trading Solutions (Fulfilled by Amazon). The box was genaric and the item had no manufacture markings. It was esentially a knock of generic product. That was unfortunately not the worst of my problems, as my wife opened it she informed me that it had a european 220V plug. I have never been so disgruntled over a purchse made on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandaughter and she loves it.Only used it a few times so far.  Works great just like a professional one, but much cheaper!!</li>
    <li> Lamps are a real pain to install. Gifted to my wife does she use it?</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to, which is cure gel polish. An ideal option for home use, if you want to avoid paying in the hundreds of dollars for the professional options. Lights are not secure, so make sure they are fully plugged in before each use or some polish won&#x27;t cure entirely. Not unhappy one bit for the price.</li>
    <li> she&#x27;s really into learning acrylic nail art and she just loves this nail dryer system.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for such an awesome product.</li>
    <li> The quality of the plastic is a little cheap, but the function of the device is great, it works as well at setting polish as a salon machine. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I looked at the reviews for the top dollar 36W Gel Curing UV Light&#x27;s and realized that this product had just a good if not better reviews so I thought for the price why not buy it. Worst mistake. The lights flicker and I had to constantly mess with them in order for them all to turn on at the same time without turning off. By the time I had finish putting gel on one hand I didn&#x27;t have the patience to finish the other hand. I thought that I could easily return the product since I have only had it a couple weeks, but as it seems you can&#x27;t even return the broken product. I am currently in the process of working with Amazon to sort this out so we will see how it goes. Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product came with a UK power supply.  It is useless in the US.  No where in the description does it say that it requires a 220 UK power supply.</li>
    <li> It was worth the money</li>
    <li> I have been going to a salon to have my nails done for years.  I bought this light with the Gelish Basix Kit not really expecting it to be something worth using more than once or twice.  I LOVE IT!!  It is so easy to use and works great! I spend more time getting the stuff out and set up than it took to actually do my nails.  This is a great light for the price.</li>
    <li> Still on process of using it but is affordable and I can tell the it works.  I set it up already</li>
    <li> Came with no instructions, so my first time using it was a bust. However, after reading the reviews here (complete with tips!) I tried again, and it works great.</li>
    <li> This lamp is a decent size. Light weight and i believe its portable if you keep the box it comes in. Pretty simple to run and comes with the lamp light as well. Just a friendly note when putting the bulbs in, make sure they are snuggly in there or they wont turn on. I struggled with that the 1st time putting them in and noticed they all didn&#x27;t turn on when i was going to use it. Would buy again if this one breaks. Oh on another note, put a little sunscreen on ur hands if your gunna be doing a lot of gel nail polish to protect against skin ageing and skin cancer. Your also tanning your hand in that lamp light.</li>
    <li> The lamp is a very nice addition to my nail supply. I however don&#x27;t like the timer on it it only has a 2 minute setting.</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve used cures gel in minutes</li>
    <li> works really well and well worth the money spent.  Just make sure to follow direction on how to apply product and time.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy to use, timer very handy as it saves you having to watch the clock all the time. The slide is also good, prevents nails touching the end of the lamp when inserting hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my nails done at the Salon for over 15 years and decided to try it myself to try to save money. I was going every 2 weeks and paid $40 each time. Yes she was expensive but she is the best....my nails looked so natural and I loved having them done.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my nails grow fast and are fairly strong. I went through Chemo 10 years ago and that made my nails brittle. That&#x27;s why I had my nails done, so they wouldn&#x27;t break as they grew.&lt;br /&gt;This Lamp is great. I had no problems with the bulbs - they were in separate boxes and were simple to plug in. The unit itself is big, but not so big that I can&#x27;t store it easily. I like that you can use the 2 minute timer, or just stick your hand in there and go longer or shorter then the 2 minutes. I have been using OPI GelColor Gel Top Coat and it is completely dry after the 2  minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get any easier then this lamp. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work like the ones in the nail salons but it works great! Now I don&#x27;t have to spend $25 every week.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got this UV lamp!  I had been paying for gel manicures at salons and really didn&#x27;t feel like it was worth the cost.  I went to several places and got results ranging from looking like a child painted my nails to the polish looking great, but crooked nails!  I knew I could do this myself at least that good and save so much money!  This lamp is a steal at less than $30!  JUST BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I use this for gel manicures.  It has a two minute timer and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Although the description above indicates that this unit has a fan, it does not. It does, however, cure the CND gel in the recommended times, and has a 120 second timed option. Very easy to install the bulbs. The wall plug fits a standard (American) outlet. I love doing gel manicures at home!</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy assembly. Works just like the ones they use at the salon. I love it. It saves me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this light! It works great and I am glad I got this bigger one so I can do my whole hand at one time. Worth the money I spent. The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have a fan but so far I have not had any trouble with it overheating so that doesn&#x27;t seem to be too much of an issue. I would recommend this to anyone :)</li>
    <li> I would give it a 0 if I could. It started sparking and sizzling (shorted out while I was using it) after only a few uses. I&#x27;ve only had it 4 months...how much use could it have had in 4 months? Absolutely ridiculous. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I really thought this thing was going to catch fire. It smelled like burning and smoke and sparks were coming out.</li>
    <li> I Love this Lamp !!! I am trying to learn how to do my own nails and this is so easy to use. It&#x27;s works great and it saves me money because I&#x27;m able to do it at the house I don&#x27;t have to pay 30 or 40 dollars I just do it myself now. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for date night!</li>
    <li> This lamp works great. Don&#x27;t spend a lot of $$ on another lamp.</li>
    <li> The unit I received would not turn on. When I submitted for a return, I was not even given an option for exchange. Very disappointed but also glad that I was able to receive a full refund for the product.</li>
    <li> 2 out of 4 bulbs were not working after just the first use. I had to buy a replacement. No problems  after that. I like that there is a tray that slides in and out of the lamp, and a timer. Overall, the product is good, no need to pay $60: does the job.</li>
    <li> I always read reviews on an item before I buy it. This one seemed to have more good than bad so I gave it a shot. I should&#x27;ve just paid more attention to the bad ones. I am so very disappointed with this light. It wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all. They don&#x27;t offer to send a working one. I had to ship it back to them and it cost me $15 to do so and they only returned $6 of that. Now I&#x27;m out money on this and still don&#x27;t have a light that works. I shouldn&#x27;t have to pay ANYTHING to return an item that doesn&#x27;t work. DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is suppose to do. All the bulbs work and It has been going for a couple months now. I do my own nails and have changed things up a lot... the lamp never fails me and I am very happy!!</li>
    <li> Very cheap the lights fall out all the time. Wanted to return in but they don&#x27;t do returns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lamps and this one beats them all. It&#x27;s truly salon quality, made of quality material (definitely not cheap plastic). The bottom part slides out for easy cleaning, as it tends to get sticky from doing UV Gel work. Cures like a dream, and I like that it has a separate timer feature so you don&#x27;t have to keep track.</li>
    <li> This lamp is worth the money.  Just have to remember to make sure the bulbs are in all the way.  The bulbs are a little hard to push in all the way, I thought I was going to break the bulbs.  But once the first bulb was in, it was easy to push the rest in.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, but it does what is suppose to do....no complaints on this end.  My nails looked great.  The bulbs didn&#x27;t give me a problem at all.  I wish the actual unit was bigger on the inside because my finger slightly tapped the bulb...but no damage to my nails...just be very still for 2 minutes</li>
    <li> This lamp did not work.  I plugged it in, nothing.  The bulbs do not seem secure.  I returned the lamp and got a refund, purchased another brand lamp by another seller and it works perfectly.  Not very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp for home use to cure shellac nail polish. One of the socket for the uv bulb is faulty so if i put any of the 4 bulbs in that one, it does not light up. In the other sockets, same bulb works fine. Also timer does not work. It worked for the first 2 uses, then thats it. Apart from this, even with only the 3 bulbs working, i could cure shellac nail polish with no problems and i used my iphone for timing.. So i decided to keep the lamp, i dont have time sending it back etc. At the end of the day, it does the work, but i would probably buy a not so cheap product instead cause i dont have big hopes in this one that it will work for long term. Shipping was fast and packaging was good. This is what you get for 30 bucks..</li>
    <li> Bulbs are easy to become loose.</li>
    <li> I loved this light for gelish nails.  It is inexpensive but still high quality.  I have not had it too long but I hope it lasts up to a year!</li>
    <li> works great!!! good price and does what it needs to do just perfectly.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift.  I was told it was great so I figure a 4 star rating is about right.  Still to new to make any other review.</li>
    <li> I love it ! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome nail dryer!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and has saved me LOTS of $$ doing my own manicures at home!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My process is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1) Clean my natural nails of all previous gel*, push back cuticles, then buff to smooth the nail.&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply one coat of Shellac base, cure with lamp for 120 secs.&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply one thin coat of colored Gel (I use Gellish, Shellac and OPI), cure with lamp for 120 secs.&lt;br /&gt;4) Apply a second thin coat of colored Gel, cure with lamp for 120 secs.&lt;br /&gt;5) OPTIONAL - Apply a thin coat of sparkly Gel if desired (personally I LOVE sparkles!!), cure with lamp for 120 secs.&lt;br /&gt;6) Apply the final coat of Shallac top, then cure with lamp for TWO ROUNDS of 120 secs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done I have a gorgeous manicure that lasts at least 2 weeks.  At that point, I&#x27;ll usually change the color out because the growth from the cuticle is so obvious, but not because the gel has chipped or lifted.  I&#x27;ve successfully done my own pedicures too and those last at least a month before the growth shows (still no chipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire process from start to finish takes about 20-30 mins if starting with clean nails, 45-60 mins if I&#x27;m removing old gel; but most of that is getting the nails ready to put the gel on. If I&#x27;m doing my own I&#x27;ll catch up on my DVR while doing my nails (multitasking ;-p) or if I&#x27;m doing my friend&#x27;s or my mom&#x27;s it&#x27;s great time to just catch up on stuff.  &amp;lt;3  It&#x27;s turned into a great way not only to save money on my own mani/pedis, but also on gift giving... my friends LOVE free manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* One thing that I have learned for the health of your natural nail, is that soaking with acetone to loosen the gel up is WAY, WAY better than just peeling the gel off.  Just soak a cotton ball with acetone, place over the old gel, cover the finger tip with foil and wait 15 minutes. Scrape off what you can and if there&#x27;s any left, allow to soak again in 5 min intervals, until it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
    <li> light works good lights are not hard to put in...does the job good buy hurry and grab one why pay more!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas, and have tried to use it several times. I watched tutorials, read multiple reviews, and can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s wrong. It appears to be completely broken. The lights don&#x27;t light up, heat, or cure anything. I&#x27;ve tried rearranging the lights, and they still do nothing. I tried to cure polish anyways, thinking that maybe the light bulbs just don&#x27;t light up. It did absolutely nothing, and I felt no heat at all coming from the bulbs. I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed that this was broken before I even got a chance to use it.</li>
    <li> 36W did not work for me!  I threw it away</li>
    <li> It worked literally once and when I went to turn it on the second time nothing happened! I opened it up to see if the wiring was messed up and there was one brown wire that wasn&#x27;t connected to anything, when I tried connecting it to where it looked like it was supposed to go it sparked and almost electrocuted me. Save yourself the time and money and don&#x27;t buy this!!</li>
    <li> My customers like the full coverage!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to gel polishes and manicures but decided to start doing my own at home.  This is a great buy!  Cures quickly and reliably.  Peel the blue off the tray before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints!</li>
    <li> This is the worst uv lamp ever works the first time I get it the second time my gel foundation on my nails guest what the uv lamp doesnt works for the second time . I will not recommend it to anyone sorry. i give 0 star.</li>
    <li> This lamp works and cures my nails but every time I move it the light bulbs move just a little and lose their connection. So I have to constantly take off the base and jiggle the bulbs to get them to work.</li>
    <li> I bought this product so I could shellac my own nails to save money.  So far it has paid for itself.</li>
    <li> I used this lamp with Gelish shellac polishes and used the timer feature to take the guesswork out of the drying time. It did the job perfectly and I am very pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;The lamp does require you to install (plug in) the bulbs yourself, but was not hard to do.  Also, it does not have a fan, but shellac polishes really only need the UV light to cure the polish.</li>
    <li> I bought this for gel nails and it works great! I like the timer feature a lot although I always do more time than is recommended. It helps me keep track better. I like that the bottom pulls out to do my toes too. No, it doesn&#x27;t have a fan which would probably help keep it *cooler* but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it shorting out. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Came defective. had to return it immediately. its pretty much just a plastic box with 4 small uv bulbs. save your money. it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk. Does not work. I will be returning it today.</li>
    <li> Works great with my gelish polish.</li>
    <li> Great uv light..everything worked when received.</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t get enough of this.  She is constantly doing hers and our daughters nails. She said it was the best gift I ever gave her.</li>
    <li> Bought this product but can&#x27;t use it. It doesn&#x27;t say anywhere that it only runs on 110 volts and I live in a place where the voltage is 220V. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I received it in a timely manner. However I used it thinking everything was good to go except my nails did not set right we&#x27;ll come to find out 3 out of 4 lights did not work. Very irritated. If it worked properly I think it would be a nice at home product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the cheapest lamps I could find (and it shows!), but it does the job! I do think the timer is about six seconds off, but no big deal. Overall, I am happy with the purchase. Just make sure you check the bulbs each time and push in if they&#x27;re not lit.</li>
    <li> This product is not being used for its intended purpose.  My husband makes his own fly fishing lures requiring a UV light to set the glue.  This particular product offered plenty of room to dry multiple flies, has a timer feature (if needed), and has a slide out tray so it&#x27;s easy to get the lures in and out of the drying chamber.  Competitive price and good reviews also helped with his decision to purchase.</li>
    <li> Just got my lamp, put in the bulbs, turned it on and nothing. Did I do something wrong or is mine just defective?</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and does a great at-home gel manicure! The bulbs installed easily and I like the 2-minute timer.</li>
    <li> It works well just burns you from time to time</li>
    <li> This lamp NEVER worked!</li>
    <li> Works as described. Polish is cured completely.</li>
    <li> Works just perfectly for me. No issues so far.</li>
    <li> I found this light through another review, so I can&#x27;t really say if it really good or bad. I have only had it for about a month and used it twice. It does cure the polish like its suppose to. The only thing I did have a problem with was installing the lights. You need to use your thumb and finger to push then Into the holes where they fit so they are tight, otherwise the lights are very loose.</li>
    <li> Works like it says it does.  Just don&#x27;t forget the alcohol swab at the end otherwise nails will be tacky.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp to cure my gel polish and it does the job. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the timer isn&#x27;t a full 2 minutes. It shuts off at 1 min and 50 sec so I have to push the button in the back to get the full 2 minutes. I don&#x27;t know if 10 seconds makes a difference in the curing process but would rather not try to find out and have to redo my nails.  Still a good deal if you don&#x27;t mind having to push it again EVERY time.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Remember that the polish stays tacky until final curing  you then wipe with alcohol.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Gelish Nail products and it works great for my in home use!!! I have recommended this to others as well.</li>
    <li> As soon as we received the unit we notice that is had been opened. After taking it out of the box there where finger prints all over it.. needless to say we sent it back! Never tried the product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry the polish</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of this light and I was skeptical at first with all the problems that people had.  I have had none of the problems that others reported.  This is great for the money that I spent!  No need to get a more pricey one.</li>
    <li> I avoided buying my own UV light because I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work as well as ones in the salon. Well, I was wrong! This may be the exact model I&#x27;ve seen in nail salons, and it works beautifully. I used it to cure Sally Hansen gel polish...worked like a charm! Be sure to wipe a cotton ball soaked in alcohol over your completed nails. This will get rid of the gummy, tacky residue.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about buying this product because it had a lot of negative reviews. But I must say, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived within 3 days of ordering and was packed well and didn&#x27;t move around at all in the amazon box. However, when I lifted the lamp out of the manufacturer&#x27;s box, it fell apart. The lamp itself is brand new, clean and doesn&#x27;t appear to have every been used. The UV bulbs were individually boxed, rubber banded together and placed inside the lamp for maximum protection. One of the bulbs was defective and didn&#x27;t work. I contacted customer service and they corrected the issue promptly and I am completely satisfied with the corrective action offered.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the lamp is advertised as having a \\&quot;fan dryer\\&quot; it does not. But when using the UV light for curing gel nail polish, you don&#x27;t need a fan. Also, I knew it didn&#x27;t have a fan by the other reviews, so I wasn&#x27;t put off by that.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and have always been satisfied by the customer service given by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I am having so much fun doing my own gel polish at home and saving money too! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I think this UV lamp works great. It cured my gel nail polish quickly and my manicure lasted a couple of weeks! Very fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> Perfect gadget for hands and feet! Has a timer which makes the curing process so much more effective and efficient. This item was not the color I ordered, and the quality of the item well lets just say it wont last FOREVER; but the light itself got the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not amazed by its performance, it&#x27;s just like the ones at a salon, but it works real well; does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Had no issues with it whatsoever and the installation of the bulbs was easy.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my college-aged daugher, along with a shellac polish kit and she loves it!  Everything works just exactly how it should and her nails turned out great!  :)</li>
    <li> I love pretty nails but regular polish just chips right off my weak/bendy nails.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about this light because reviews said it came with a European plug half of the time. Mine was fine.&lt;br /&gt;So far the gellish polish has worked perfectly in it and so has an inexpensive polish from ebay. One kind I ordered from china just slid right off, It wouldn&#x27;t dry in the light or on its own. It said it was uv polish but just wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it and am glad I didn&#x27;t spent the extra $40 for the other one I was looking at.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised!  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> After researching 10+ machines, and countless articles on gel manicures, I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve had it for all of 45 minutes. My two first major complaints are within seconds of opening the box. It&#x27;s not white. It&#x27;s a light pink/liliac colored machine. It&#x27;s not even close to white. Second, there are absolutely zero directions in the box. So, I had to fend for myself and wing it as far as putting the bulbs in. Previous reviews helped, you really need to put force for the bulbs to lock in place. The blue bottom tray slides out completely and detaches so you can get the bulbs in easier.  My machine must have been previously returned because it has little dings, dents, scratches and scuffs. That&#x27;s pretty much it for the cons. I&#x27;m not sure why so many people received ones where the plug doesn&#x27;t work USA style, mine looked and worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to still give it a try before I made up my mind to return and consider  reordering the same item. I just got a regular acrylic manicure earlier today, with Essie nail polish. I read online you could just use regular polish and put a gel coat on top to cure and be done, so I did just that. HOWEVER, regular polish needs a few hours to dry out completely to bond to your nail, unlike gel manicures that are dried out immediately(hence no need to sit and dry). Most websites said 24 hours. I waited ~7 hours. All I did was apply a thin top coat to one hand, set in the machine for the 120 seconds(timer is a great feature) and then the other hand, then I repeated. ***IMPORTANT*** most people that get gel manicures don&#x27;t realize right before they send you on your way they take a cotton ball or clothe and put alcohol on it and wipe the excess top gel coat off your nails. Most people just think they&#x27;re wiping lotion off or oil to make the nails shine but it&#x27;s actually alcohol. (hard to believe because alcohol takes off regular nail polish) So, most of the 1 reviews on here are that the nails are &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; after. That&#x27;s how they are in the salon too. I used 70% rubbing alcohol (most sites say to use 99% but this worked perfectly fine for me, and I would recommend 70% because using a higher strength may eat through and wipe a fresh manicure off too) and you just have to wipe off the excess gel. I feel like this is a HUGE part in why people return the machine. The nails aren&#x27;t supposed to dry out completely, you can actually see the curing process if you look into the machine at your hand(I don&#x27;t recommend- its pretty bright!) You can see the change of color in the light, but the polish remains the same color outside of the machine- this was a good indicator to me that the polish was curing because I remember seeing it when I&#x27;d stick my hands in the machine at the salon and only the ones with the top gel coat looked a crazy color in the machine but normal when I took them out) On a side note, I can tell how much stronger/thicker my nails feel using the gel top coat over my manicure(I have very brittle nails so this is super exciting!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the fact mine looked used, no directions, and weird tint of pink to my machine- it does the job fine. I&#x27;d otherwise so far give it a 5 star rating. I&#x27;m excited to use it with actual gel polish. I use &amp;#34;LeChat Perfect Match High Gloss Top Gel Sealer&amp;#34;. I also have their ultra-think base varnish(got both for $23 on ebay). I&#x27;ve always gotten gel manicures with their products at salons. I&#x27;d highly recommend to try their brand. They also sell them in Dou&#x27;s- the gel polish and regular acrylic polish sets for about $12 on ebay, so you can use regular polish on toes if you don&#x27;t feel like going through the gel- curing process. I also bought their primer bond(LeChat Nobility Primer Bond-ebay $6.50) which is what most salons put on your nails before the base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as doing actual gel manicures, you have to replicate how salons do it- I recommend to use the primer bond, then do a base coaton one hand, cure for 120 seconds, do the same to the other hand, then I did two nails on one hand, cured, then did two nails on the other hand and cured and repeated til I got through a second coat on each nail. I&#x27;m not sure the chemistry behind it but thats how my nail salon does it, and it worked well for me at salons so I would assume the same for at home. my only concern is the amount of UV light penetrating my hands(I worried about this at salons too but the salon i&#x27;ve been at for the last year uses UV protection gloves- another wise investment!) Then you top the manicure off with gel top coat, two nails at a time and cure between. It does take a lot longer as opposed to someone else doing your nails so you can constantly just switch out hands but it seems to give the exact same result. Again, you need to wipe the excess gel top coat off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll revamp my review when I get my gel polish in the mail and try again- I&#x27;ll actually experiment since I bought the duo set and do one hand regular polish with a bottom and top gel coat and the other in gel polish since they&#x27;re the same color/brand and update how long they last/hold up :)</li>
    <li> I received this product veru quickly. It is just like the ones used in the salon. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I had considered getting this for some time. Others have complained about the quality of the unit and the bulbs not working. I have not had any problems with my light. I put the bulbs in, you had to put them in firmly, and plugged in it. When I plugged it in, the light instantly came on. I was a little worried but It turned off after 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone that is just starting out doing their own gel manicures. For the price of ONE manicure, you can get a light. I like the fact that the bottom slides out so I can do a pedicure easily if I wanted to.</li>
    <li> So happy with the product, just opening the box. It is proffesional size and easy to put in lights. I will come back after I use it and let you know how it works. But amazing for the price. I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> I bought the lamp back on Christmas after getting a shellac manicure done by a professional. I was like: I can do that at home. I read a lot of reviews about different UV lamps. This one works just fine like the $150 lamp from the salon. Just plug the UV bulbs (carefully). Cation! When applying CND shellac, use very thin layers and cure each for 4 mins (2 mins timer, twice). I assure you, you will have a professional looking manicure. So far, I am in love with my UV lamp! There is no way I will pay for a shellac ever again. Cant wait to buy more colors!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly....when it decides to work. Bulbs won&#x27;t stay in and keeping coming loose in the middle of using it. It&#x27;s a struggle to get the bunks positioned correctly for them to turn on.</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own gel manicures. This works perfectly for my needs, however when others comment that it not the most stable I would agree. The lights are barely in there, so keep it in a fixed location...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, no complaints, my nails come out just fine!</li>
    <li> I bought this for personal use and have used it about 4 times and so far no issues. I think it&#x27;s a great lamp And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Lamp came with a bulb broke. Poor packaging. Three out of four sockets are loose. Always having to push bulb up or in or wiggle to relight.</li>
    <li> Cheap I ordered 3 and all do not work to this day. Lights have shorts, tops break, total defective product. Customer service sucks from this company. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</li>
    <li> This light does exactly what I bought it for. It cures my shellac manicures perfectly, just as good as the 150$ one would! At first I thought it was broken when I got it, but you have to really push the lights in until you hear a click.  I read that some people thought the lights were flimsy and the unit was defective, but I&#x27;m guessing they didn&#x27;t push the lights in hard enough.</li>
    <li> EXCELENT ALL I M HAPPY&lt;br /&gt; VERY  THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;br /&gt; I HOPE WILL BE YOU CUSTOMER AGAIN SOON</li>
    <li> The lamps works and automatically turns off once the timer is done. It would be nice if it had options other than just 2 minutes. I noticed that the gel layers were still a bit tacky after being cured for 2 minutes, but I think this might have more to do with my inexperience than the lamp.</li>
    <li> item works well i use it when i do my own nails weekly</li>
    <li> Received it, packaged great, installed bulbs everything worked put a base coat of Gel  layed both hands on top of other nails side by side put my hands in set the timer..then put the top coat on same thing as above applied alcohol to a cotton ball swiped over the nails within 6 min had beautifully manicured nails ... looks great!!!</li>
    <li> feels like I am in the salon. Would recommend wearing fingerless gloves though, can give you an unwanted tan though</li>
    <li> it works great so far...only used it twice but it heated up lite up dried everything perfect&lt;br /&gt;have not used the pull out try yet but it is a much needed addition</li>
    <li> Very good looking lamp. Also dries up the gel super quickly. Amazing fast shipping. Expected by Friday and got it in by Tuesday. :)</li>
    <li> I love having my own lamp works very well bulbs are very easy to change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the lamp two times already and have had no problems using it. Works very well. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> A product you can really use at home and have professional looking nails.  I wanted my cracked, split nails to look lovely, every day, Using the light with Shellac gives me just what I wanted.  I don&#x27;t want the salon look of Acrylics, just a perfect everyday look...Salon Edge is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than going to salon!  Works great</li>
    <li> Seems to work great...just like those in a salon. Feels a little cheap, but gets the job done!</li>
    <li> terrible quality. wouldnt even turn on when i received it. not worth the hassle! I wouldnt recommend anyone get this.</li>
    <li> This lamp does work with gel nail polishes to cure them. I had to do it a couple of extra times to be safe. The light bulbs are not very secure when you put them in, I had to switch them around just to get them all to stay in and work, but once I got them to stay the light worked efficiently. It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d expect from a $30 uv lamp, but it does work!</li>
    <li> It does not work! I spent over 5 minutes on one hand for the shellac base coat to dry and it didn&#x27;t dry at all. All the lights were on properly and it still did not work. Don&#x27;t waste your mone!</li>
    <li> I purchased this light, but the machine didn&#x27;t work when I received it. I plugged it in, inserted the lights, tried everything-- doesn&#x27;t help there isn&#x27;t an instruction manual. I would steer clear of this product.</li>
    <li> I have only had the lamp for a couple of months and it does not cure the product fully.  I am not happy at all.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> What a savings doing nails yourself.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift, and I assume she loves it!  It was on her list, and she says it works fine.</li>
    <li> this lamp is the perfect size and cures nails in two minutes, has a timer for 120 seconds which is even better! haven&#x27;t used it for my toes yet, but don&#x27;t see a problem with using it for that, the bottom tray comes out. Only thing is that you have to put the bulbs in when you get it, just be careful and listen for a small snap for them to go into place. didn&#x27;t take long at all. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the second Salon Edge 36 Watt UV light that has been non-functional for me.  The first one died after 3 months.  I thought it was a fluke so purchased a replacement, from a different vendor.  For this one the timer didn&#x27;t work at all.  It&#x27;s a cheap lamp and performs that way.  If you are in the market for one, I&#x27;d go with another brand and spend a little more money.</li>
    <li> Great product awesome deal.. and my nails are awesome</li>
    <li> My friend used this and I&#x27;m always impressed with her nails I got and now I&#x27;m impressed with my own!</li>
    <li> Great product that works great in the convenience of your own home instead of scheduling with salons. Also a money saver being able to do my own nails.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and has been everything I hoped it would be. It works perfectly and cures my gel nails like a charm.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to be abole to do my manicure at home, It was easy to put together, and so far is still working after 3 manicures.</li>
    <li> This product did not work to cure gel nail polish, even after 10 minutes under the light. Would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My UV light just stopped working. Not a bulb issue, the whole machine is just dead. I would get a different brand if I were you.</li>
    <li> I love how my nails look with the Gelish polish and if I can do them, anyone can. This one is big and takes 2 minutes to cure the polish.  My daughter in law got the small one (not UV, but I cannot remember the name) and she only needs to cure for 30 seconds with hers.  I wish I had investigated it more thoroughly for the speed, but it works great, just slower.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I got it - worked great... not 2 days later, 2 of the 4 UV connections didn&#x27;t work!! Not the bulbs, the connections,,, really?? I would not recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> I would recommend the salon edge nail uv lamp acrylic gel shellac curing light timer 36 watt.just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Love it.  Now more 70 manicures.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time .. It is what is described. Thank you</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, since the packaging looks cheap. It came with no instructions which also bummed me out. Attaching the bulbs was quite nerve wrecking. You really got to push them in.. I was afraid they were going to shatter. Once I had it set up, I used gelish polishes and my nails came out great!! Great investment, It&#x27;s already paid for 2 salon visits. Although my hands may not be as steady as the manicurist... I&#x27;ll practice. Not to mention, it arrived on schedule.</li>
    <li> lamp works terrific. light weight and efficient.  bulbs are cheap as well.</li>
    <li> wonderful!! Not a problem so far and cures everything from Shellac to Brisa gels!</li>
    <li> This lamp works just great with Gel polish. That is what I bought it for. You do not need to remove the blue film as other reviews have said. However, you do have to read instuctions on how to effectively use gel polish. I went to the nail salon and had my nails done before deciding to perform the gel polish myself. I also read the manual on the harmony gelish polish website before hand. This works just great and for the price you cannot beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, it does take about 120 seconds in the lamp after each gelish coating. So, the time is a bit longer than at the traditional nail salon. I figure that for the price of this lamp it is well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> The lamp does not cure/harden the shellac nail polish.</li>
    <li> My shellac polish will not set all the way with this light. I even tried doubling the time under the light after each step.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I have not used with Gel shellac yet, I did purchase this for my foot psoriasis and seems to be working. I notice less patches and my skin on my foot appears to be getting better.</li>
    <li> I just got this UV light to use for gel/shellac nails.  It came with 4 light bulbs that you have to insert inside yourself.  I plugged it in and the UV light worked.  I only give it four stars because I haven&#x27;t had this for very long and I plan to give an updated review after a month or two of use.  I also don&#x27;t under stand why the description says it has a drying fan dryer when it clearly does not have one.&lt;br /&gt;(something maybe amazon or the company selling this needs to fix).  I didn&#x27;t need one with a drying fan so I&#x27;m not bothered by this.  So far it does what it says and it works.</li>
    <li> works great, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t have a fun, does come with a 3 minutes timer option&lt;br /&gt;great deal  :)</li>
    <li> Received item with  NO Instruction manual, NO Power requirements. Finally clarified that it works on 110. Plugged in 110 and blew off. Luckily we tried without fingers in. Totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> Product arrived within 3 days of placing order. Easy assembly and worked just as advertised. Great for quick easy at home use when doing nails. Would definitely use this company again, already thinking of getting a second lamp because it works great for doing my toes too. Definitely a great and affordable nail lamp if you are looking to get one.</li>
    <li> As the one at the Nail shop. Very strong</li>
    <li> I love the price and the awesomeness of this product!!!! Now i will save moneyand do my own nails at home!!!!</li>
    <li> wife loves it, works great... :)</li>
    <li> This works great, as advertised. The bulbs are a little hard to fit into the slot initially, but with a slight bit of pressure, they snapped right in. Listen for the &amp;#34;click&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Arrived early.  Love the timer.  Works great with the Axxium gel top coat. ;-)</li>
    <li> OK, but not great. Especially, internal reflection material is a very cheap looking thin film. Overall, not so good design, not so good material, cheap parts, and I won&#x27;t recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this since it&#x27;s so inexpensive but it works perfectly well!  I love being able to do my own manicure at home</li>
    <li> This came so fast, it is already in its own box, the bulbs come in there own boxes, it comes with a free nail file, I don&#x27;t know what grit though, the fan those work, make sure you press your bulbs in good in order for them to work, can&#x27;t wait to use on myself.</li>
    <li> Good lamp for home use. 36W is a a plus.</li>
    <li> If you want quality from a good seller, this would be the one to buy from. I&#x27;m a little obsessed with good looking nails. I had over 70 sets of fake nails in my house when I decided it was just getting to be too much work. I heard about the gel for nails, bought the light and tried it. The light worked beautifully, not so much the gel, I switched to shellac and OMGoodness! It&#x27;s still on with out any chipping after 4 weeks. Still shinny. Thanks!</li>
    <li> the first one came DOA, then i gave it a second chance... i bought this for my girl, she like doing her nails and her friends, and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars!</li>
    <li> I am having a wonderful experience with this lamp.  My nails are beautiful and I am very happy.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The packaged arrived sooner than I expected which is always a plus for me.. I did my nails that day I was so excited.. I just wished is had a fan so that I can use all of my regular nail polishes with it.. I would suggest that you use gloves with this product due to the fact my left hand may have gotten over expose to the UV light. So every time I use this product I will be using my gloves..</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have paid for. First off, the spelling on the box is wrong and has errors. Secondly, it did not dry my nails after the time it should have been done by and then I used it for 5 minutes and it did absolutely nothing to my nail. This is the worst product and do not buy it. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Best bang for the bucks. My wife was thrilled to receive this unit. There are bigger units but do you really need both your hand in at the same time if you&#x27;re painting your own nails?</li>
    <li> My girl likes it a lot, she uses it with this french manicure kit i bought her she loves it.</li>
    <li> I received my light for Mother&#x27;s Day and was so excited to use it. I turned it on and after a few seconds one of the lights went out. So i thought I&#x27;d change the light out with a new bulb. Nope.....it was the outlet. So I took the whole think apart to try and mix the electrical connection. It was a failed attempt. So my husband called the company and they sent us a new one. Once again so excited to get it. Opened it to try it and it worked...yay!!! For one time:( then the same thing happened to the new light. Sooooooo bummed!!! Took it apart and once again.....fail! They are now in the trash and I&#x27;m looking for a new brand! Lame</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> I love this and have mastered the gel nail technique. Practice makes perfect.</li>
    <li> It works for me perfectly. When I used it for the first time, I was just a beginner and I didn&#x27;t know that I had to whipe my nails with alcohol after curing. It might be sticky even after the light goes off. Just get a cotten ball and soak it with alcohol and then remove the stickiness. It&#x27;s a good product with that price.</li>
    <li> We loved this dryer so much, this is the second one I buy for a friend! Cannot live without it anymore!</li>
    <li> Love this! Works really well. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the bulbs were really hard to push in and I honestly felt like I was going to break them. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t, and got them all in and working properly but do keep in mind that you really have to shove them in there for them to work. Two of them went in easy, but the remaining two took some effort to light up.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I have been using the SensatioNail brand and it works well. I only have to leave my hands in there for 45 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;For those who have been confused on how it all works - search around online for step by step tips on how to get the best manicure. I did lots of reading - and it is a rather time consuming process, you really can&#x27;t leave out any steps, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Once I was able to get all the lightbulbs to stay on it worked very well. It seemed like any bump at all they would go out as if they had a bad connection.</li>
    <li> Really cool tool and at a great price. It is easy to use and has a neat timer button that lets you know when it is done!  I am extremely pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I received the UV lamp on time and am happy with it. As others have said, the lamp does not come with any instructions. I would rely on the comments posted on here for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I always use the timed dryer 2 times for each coat/step (base coat, polish, top coat etc). This ensures that the process is totally completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that you use very thin layers of each of the polish as if you use too much, it messes the whole process up.</li>
    <li> This lamp works just as expected.  Had no problems with it drying my nails.  The timer is right on also.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they would provide extra lamps, or an address to purchase more.</li>
    <li> So far i have no problem with my purchase, it&#x27;s going great and it&#x27;s getting the job done. Thumbs up I say.</li>
    <li> Love my uv lamp. Use it to do shellac mani&#x27;s at home for myself and friends. It does the job well and is easy to use. That&#x27;s why it gets 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I would have had to return the whole unit in order to get bulbs replaced. No phone # to call  for help. Just wanted them to replace the bulbs that didn&#x27;t work. Too much trouble, ended up ordering 2 new bulbs.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister in law &amp; she says it works great. She uses it regularly and it has been effective.</li>
    <li> Looked used to me, the foil was already undone and the box was torne</li>
    <li> I wanted a fan on my dryer, this one doesn&#x27;t have one, and the product description clearly states the product has a fan. Otherwise its a good lamp.</li>
    <li> The only thing I could ask from this product is that it be a bit less bulky for travel purposes. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks but it seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> This light arrived and one of the four bulbs wasn&#x27;t working.  However,  the light still cured my various gel layers in two minutes.  Nice light to have.</li>
    <li> This nail lamp worked perfect from the first day I got it !!  The bulbs cames with it, they were easy to install, and everything was packaged so nice !! I am very happy that I purchased this lamp and my gel nails look great !</li>
    <li> I was anxious to recieve this UV lamp, however it broke after only one time using it. I had turned it on, and it worked perfectly fine, but when I turned it off, the switch made a strange noise (not a good noise) and to me it sounded as if a fuse broke or something. Now it won&#x27;t turn on, and the on/off switch is noticably loose. I was very dissatisfied by this purchase - save your money and put it towards another product that won&#x27;t break the first time you use it.</li>
    <li> this product is great but it didn&#x27;t come with a manual , not even a leaflet. no instructions at all which was in very poor taste. so right now in still confused as to how to use it properly.</li>
    <li> I have used this item 4 times on shellac nails.  It appears to me to be doing the same job that other brand did at salon.  It&#x27;s the same wattage as the more known brand so I don&#x27;t see what the difference is.  The timer works well.  I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Came with a broken bulb.</li>
    <li> Bulbs don&#x27;t stay in place</li>
</ol>
