      <li>and I really started to break out.  </li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>Did not do much for my acne.</li>
      <li>Yes, I really like it.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend it to all.</li>
      <li>This is a great one for troubled skin that gets pimples.</li>
      <li>In my extensive routine I have been using this before my moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve learned via Eminence&#x27;s website and videos that you can add 2 to 3 drops of this right into your moisturizer to combine steps.</li>
      <li>Also seems to help clear blemishes I highly recommend if you have these issues.</li>
      <li>No harsh chemicals and it works!</li>
      <li>and I have found that it helps minimize the look of my new and old acne scars.</li>
      <li>I add a couple drops of this to the Clear Skin Moisturizer 2x/day and apply an additional time over any break out areas mid-day.  </li>
      <li>Helps clear, hydrate and condition my acne prone skin.  </li>
      <li>I went from being embarrassed about a flair up of adult acne to being complemented on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it work fast</li>

      <li>I am on my 2nd bottle of this serum, my acne has completely cleared up!  </li>
      <li>The next morning when I woke the pimple was completely gone.</li>
      <li>Sadly there are not a lot of effective all-natural beauty products, but Eminence ranks tops for it.</li>
      <li>It literally saved me thousands of dollars in unnecessary treatments by a top rated dermatologist.</li>
      <li>Living in New England, I find the Clear Skin line doesn&#x27;t quite have enough moisture, which is why I also supplement with other Eminence products.  </li>
      <li>I put it on right after I wash my face, let it dry a little, and then apply my spf face lotion.  </li>

<li> It is terribly tacky and caused my skin to break out even further.</li>
<li> It doesnt have bad reaction.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not as bad as it was</li>
<li> I had a terrible allergic reaction to it!  </li>
<li> My face has never look so horrible after using this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recently purchased this product and you of course you have to give it time to work. It works really well, when I mix it with the probiotic moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of eminence products and use many of them. This is a great one for troubled skin that gets pimples. I like this serum of theirs for pimples better than the herbal spot treatment. I had a couple of pimples and this helped them go away within a couple of days, with each day showing better improvement than if I had not used a serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am home a lot so I take advantage of that to keep makeup off my skin and apply this serum a few times a day, morning, afternoon, afternoon again, night. In my extensive routine I have been using this before my moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve learned via Eminence&#x27;s website and videos that you can add 2 to 3 drops of this right into your moisturizer to combine steps. I prefer putting it on separately because I don&#x27;t use the serum all over my face since I only want to utilize it on problem areas therefore it makes sense for me to apply it before using moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eminence has great ingredients that are natural and non-toxic which is of paramount importance to me. Sadly there are not a lot of effective all-natural beauty products, but Eminence ranks tops for it. And, they&#x27;re organic. It doesn&#x27;t get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you interested, the strawberry dermafoliant is amazing as well as the bamboo firming fluid and I also love the Kale C+E serum. I use many more products but those are a couple to note.</li>
    <li> Eminence is such a great products and this Willow Bark Serum will last a while. Great price.</li>
    <li> I think its expired, not as potent/effective as what I Purchased at the spa.</li>
    <li> Item was described perfectly! Absolutely amazing product. Works great for acne!</li>
    <li> 3 stars and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;Eminence is an amazing skin care line. And this may be more beneficial to someone with occasional breakouts but unfortunately this did not help my oily skin or breakouts what so ever. I&#x27;d rather get the bright skin booster which seemed to help more than this willow bark booster. Won&#x27;t purchase this serum again!</li>
    <li> This is the right product for me. It isn&#x27;t heavy nor oily on the skin.</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd bottle of this serum, my acne has completely cleared up!  I will order again.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Yes, I really like it. I see a difference, my skin is looking smoother. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have redness and this has helped in reducing it .  Also seems to help clear blemishes I highly recommend if you have these issues.</li>
    <li> This product did not help my acne at all. I have been using it, along with the other clear skin product line items, and my acne is worse than before I started using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for just a month and my acne is gone the only thing thats left right now are the acne marks. The time that i started the eminence skincare i am not scared under the sun. It doesnt have bad reaction.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum with the face wash and used them both for 3 weeks together before giving up on the serum. It is terribly tacky and caused my skin to break out even further. My face has never look so horrible after using this product. I wish it worked as it did for others but I will not be buying this again (WAY too expensive) nor would I recommend it to anyone. Very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> Did not do much for my acne. Try neem saop or oil instead, it worked for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product, really helped my breakouts subside.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and this stuff works miracles.  I went from being embarrassed about a flair up of adult acne to being complemented on my skin.  I add a couple drops of this to the Clear Skin Moisturizer 2x/day and apply an additional time over any break out areas mid-day.  Love love love this stuff.  Best product of the Eminence line.  It literally saved me thousands of dollars in unnecessary treatments by a top rated dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Love this product! No harsh chemicals and it works! Apply on clean, dry skin at least twice a day morning &amp; evening for at least a week - I really saw a difference in the quality of my skin.</li>
    <li> I usually use this product once a day in the evening and I have found that it helps minimize the look of my new and old acne scars. So wonderful! It isn&#x27;t drastic, but I certainly notice and it is wonderful to finally have clear skin again.</li>
    <li> Did work. Make sure to close lid tightly will dry up in a day if let off. Make work for other but did not help my breakouts. Smelled really good and felt good when you applied it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very problem prone breakout skin so she says this is the bom it helps it to heal !!</li>
    <li> I had a terrible allergic reaction to it!  My nose and eyes dried up and my nose has still not recovered (6 weeks post discontinued use).  Probably a fine product if your mucus membranes can stand it.</li>
    <li> Love this serum!! Started using it at the recommendation of my aesthetician and haven&#x27;t looked back! It&#x27;s perfect for people with sensitive / combination skin.</li>
    <li> I actually have drier skin on my face in colder weather.  Even facial scrubs fail to bring moisture back into my skin. This product works!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it has provided a benefit for me in reducing breakouts but I will try a bit longer.  I&#x27;ve bee  using this product daily for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I noticed a difference in my skin right away. My skin is very prone to acne and this has defiantly helped keep the acne under control. I still get acne but it&#x27;s not as bad as it was and it goes away within a day or two. I never leave home without it! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! I got this with the Eminence Probiotic kit. First off let me give you a clean cut example of how well it works. I have occasional break outs and one night I had a red pimple in its beginning stages, now my occasional pimples typically do not come to a head, they are painful and usually deep under the skin. Needless to say I had one on it way so I simply washed my face and applied a small amount of this product to the affected area and went to bed. The next morning when I woke the pimple was completely gone. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family and I will certainly buy it again. Not only does it work fast but I can also see great results in my complexion, pores and overall health of my skin. I must have.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff for my skin.  I apply this during my morning routine.  I put it on right after I wash my face, let it dry a little, and then apply my spf face lotion.  The one downside is the price but it&#x27;s worth it for me.  I stopped using if for about 6 months and I really started to break out.  When I bought another bottle my skin calmed back down.</li>
    <li> Great product, it keeps your skin clear without the harsh treatment to your skin.  Love this product!  Highly recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Helps clear, hydrate and condition my acne prone skin.  In addition to using this after cleansing, I also use this after my I apply my Eminence moisturizer as a spot gel.  Just a tiny bit over any areas showing signs of a breakout.  I use the Eminence Clear Skin line at bedtime and a combination of the Stone Crop line with the Bright Skin SPF 30 moisturizer in the morning.  Living in New England, I find the Clear Skin line doesn&#x27;t quite have enough moisture, which is why I also supplement with other Eminence products.  I think it&#x27;s finding the right combination of products for your skin care needs.</li>
    <li> Awesome product -the best out there -it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> My only uses this product and helps a great deal with her skin</li>
