      <li>Not the best.</li>
      <li>lol!</li>
      <li>This item it is will works perfect!!!</li>
      <li>it love it!!!</li>
      <li>Good seller,highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>Works great,</li>
      <li>This product is as defined and works great for me.</li>
      <li>Spray works good, but it does not stick</li>
      <li>well that&#x27;s a good question</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard of Nair for years and just kinda laughed at it..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve lost count of how many cans of this stuff I&#x27;ve gone through over the years, and every time, it works great.  </li>
      <li>I will buy more!</li>
      <li>Great coverage &amp; removes easily with moist paper towels.  </li>
      <li>this Nair for men is Amazing</li>
      <li>Extremely effective hair removal for men.  </li>
      <li>after 5 min it did get really warm</li>
      <li>It is kind of like putting acid on your skin.  </li>
      <li>It drips, and is kind of concerning if it drips off you onto another part of your body.</li>
      <li>Use a razor, warm water to remove any hair you don&#x27;t want.</li>
      <li>not I thought it was very easy to apply and didn&#x27;t have any problem with the smell, so</li>
      <li>Works surprisingly well although I had to keep in on for more than ten minutes for best results.</li>
      <li>Not the best, by far.</li>
      <li>But otherwise its a great product I liked not having to get the stuff on my hands till I was through with it but for the Price I can live with the pump style.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased with my results I immediately ordered another one</li>
      <li>I did, this time 8 minutes, making sure to fully cover everything.</li>
      <li>Love the spray over its cousin, the cream version.</li>
      <li>At the end of that, it took of a bit more.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better to just get the pump lotion type.</li>
      <li>Love it love</li>
      <li>except you are better off with a safety razor.</li>
      <li>ok let me state this</li>
      <li>My lady friend will be most pleased for valentine&#x27;s day.</li>
      <li>More that 4 min.</li>
      <li>This spray is perfect for one&#x27;s back</li>
      <li>this was supremely better on all accounts.</li>
      <li>got this product recently and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>The price on this is also very reasonable, good thing is I can use this just by myself</li>
      <li>then .This was a pretty good way to get rid of the hair.</li>
      <li>works better and pain free :)</li>
      <li>Works just as good as the cream, but it&#x27;s so much easier to use</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure sensitivity to this product varies from person to person, but I was a lucky one in that</li>
      <li>Also made my butt super smooth!</li>
      <li>The irritation only lasted a couple of hours, besides, that it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I like the product it does the job, it does remove the hair and it leaves skin smooth.</li>
      <li>I have used this product many times, and it works very well.  </li>
      <li>When doing a full body hair removal, I used about 3/4 a bottle</li>
      <li>so i bumped it up to 7 min for the full application and it took all the hair on my arms off.</li>
      <li>I used this product of my stomach and chest and after about 4-5 minutes I gently wiped and most of the hair came off</li>
      <li>It did great on the fine to medium thickness hairs, but I had trouble with the this ones.</li>
      <li>this stuff is super slippery.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Quick Delivery, but the results were not as good as expected.</li>
      <li>I was able to use an old credit card to scrape all the hair off with ease.</li>
      <li>(that&#x27;s right not one hair was removed), I also now have a rash in the area where I applied it.</li>
      <li>and it comes right off.</li>
      <li>Water works just as good as this stuff not worth the time to even look at it</li>
      <li>i would not recommend if you have sensitive skin, otherwise this is the way to go as it lasts much longer then shaving and works better after the first application.  </li>
      <li>My skin was left looking clean and feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>Just used this product for the first time today.</li>
      <li>First I used the shower system which work wonders.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly as they were written on the bottle, and saw no results.</li>
      <li>When I used this product I followed the directions exactly.</li>
      <li>at best, i felt uncomfortably tingly for a while and the hair felt weaker.</li>
      <li>At first, I feel nothing.</li>
      <li>Even if shaved first.</li>
      <li>i did just like instructions said and most of the hair was gone but there was spots left with hair on</li>
      <li>or so although I&#x27;m sure I could use less over time if I were more experienced with knowing how to apply it (I haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to get it down to a science).  </li>
      <li>Works great but needs to sit much much longer then directions say for thick hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 35 year old man now and had some kind of unsightly back hair..</li>
      <li>An average sized guy would prbably need two or more full cans.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would be like spray sunscreen, but it&#x27;s not nearly as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because if you can get someone else to put it on you, it works OK.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, totally beat my expectations, however it did seem to give me a slight skin irritation on one spot on my chest.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even really take too much note of the smell.  </li>
      <li>but it is much lighter in some areas.</li>
      <li>closes my back has ever gotten you smooth</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
      <li>BUT sometimes it works very well</li>
      <li>It worked really well as described.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>it works very well at removing hair and doesn&#x27;t sting at all even after 15 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t remove much if any hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks again Amazon</li>
      <li>I am a very hairy guy</li>
      <li>This product is much easier to use than any gel or cream.  </li>
      <li>I wont say this totally did the job right, but considering I hadn&#x27;t shaved in months I think it did a great job of getting rid of some thick spots.</li>
      <li>Though I used the product before, I would recommend the new user to test it on the skin first and then apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done anything from just chest hair removal to full body hair removals (including genitals), and it didn&#x27;t burn even after leaving it on my ENTIRE body (including you know where) for 15 minutes.  </li>
      <li>For the next day or 2 I had really soft, hair free skin.</li>
      <li>and I think its worth a shot if you are experimenting with different methods of hair</li>
      <li>Its still messy but so much better than the creams they have .</li>
      <li>While it too a few more applications</li>
      <li>May have been discontinued in favor of Nair&#x27;s new hair removal gel for men.</li>
      <li>I applied to the top of my legs, chest/abdomen, and groin area (being extra careful).</li>
      <li>The smell is kind of weird but worth it.</li>
      <li>do as the directions say, also be very gentle, do not overspray, moderately spray over the hair.  </li>
      <li>I can easily see this working wonders the next time I need it as long as I don&#x27;t let my body hair get out of comtrol</li>
      <li>Was a bit skeptical but worked amazingly!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not the best. Barely any hair came off with using this</li>
    <li> It did not do well on my chest hair maybe next time I&#x27;ll leave it on longer.</li>
    <li> Not the best, by far. I won&#x27;t lie, I bought this to cleanup my public area, even though it directs not to. I was tired of shaving. I had looked at other things like this, and I was going to buy ballsBALM, but I had insufficient funds on my Amazon gift card. This is the only product within the price. I got it, and used it immediately. 4 minutes, was definitely not enough for me. I applied to the top of my legs, chest/abdomen, and groin area (being extra careful). After the 4 minutes, I wiped some with my finger, no results. So, I waited 6. That took off some hair, no where near getting it at the root. But, I thought maybe I did something wrong. I applied Gold Bond lotion to avoid chemical burn the next day. As soon as the next day rolled around, I was eager to go again. I did, this time 8 minutes, making sure to fully cover everything. At the end of that, it took of a bit more. Repeating the process of before. I am now on my third day of use, and it still hasn&#x27;t gotten completely everything. Only a small area. Maybe 1cm by 1cm. I am not really satisfied, and it doesn&#x27;t meet the claims. For me at least. It drips, and is kind of concerning if it drips off you onto another part of your body. I would recommend for someone who has really thin hair on their body, and a person who is NOT looking for a clean hair removal.</li>
    <li> Who wears short shorts?  This guy!</li>
    <li> Why does Nair even make the gel for men? This spray is perfect for one&#x27;s back and I use it on my abdomen as well. A+ from a long time customer!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, even on short hair</li>
    <li> I had a lot of hair over my arms, legs, chest, butt, armpits......I put this thing on for about 10 minutes and went in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed how the hair just came off....worked like a charm. The first week no hair grew back...the 2nd week some of it grew back...it&#x27;s been about 4 weeks now it grew back but it is much lighter in some areas.</li>
    <li> Just used this product for the first time today. First I used the shower system which work wonders. Then once I was done there I used this to touch up on the spot that the shower system didn&#x27;t get too well. I wont say this totally did the job right, but considering I hadn&#x27;t shaved in months I think it did a great job of getting rid of some thick spots. I can easily see this working wonders the next time I need it as long as I don&#x27;t let my body hair get out of comtrol</li>
    <li> Burns too bad to keep on long enough.</li>
    <li> It worked really well as described. After leaving it on my chest/stomach for 5 to 10 min I was able to use an old credit card to scrape all the hair off with ease. For the next day or 2 I had really soft, hair free skin. However once the hair started growing back in it resulted in multiple ingrown hairs and pimples on my chest and stomach. I think my skin is to sensitive for the product, but it worked quite well as advertised and I think its worth a shot if you are experimenting with different methods of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side not I thought it was very easy to apply and didn&#x27;t have any problem with the smell, so I don&#x27;t see what other reviews were talking about in that regard.</li>
    <li> While I suppose this product does actually work, it&#x27;s not worth the effort, the mess, or the smell.  First and foremost, this product smells awful.  After smelling it, I regretted putting it on my skin immediately.  While it too a few more applications that just one...(and I&#x27;m not that hairy to begin with) you end up with a big mess of foam, a horrible stench, and a nice burning sensation.  I used this product on my back, and had the bumps for almost a week.  Normally these go away after a day or two after other hair removal methods, but I think the harsh chemicals in this product irritated my skin to boot.  While this is by far the cheapest way to go, do yourself a favor and pay a bit extra for a proper waxing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times, and it works very well.  I&#x27;ve done anything from just chest hair removal to full body hair removals (including genitals), and it didn&#x27;t burn even after leaving it on my ENTIRE body (including you know where) for 15 minutes.  I&#x27;m sure sensitivity to this product varies from person to person, but I was a lucky one in that it works very well at removing hair and doesn&#x27;t sting at all even after 15 minutes.  I didn&#x27;t even really take too much note of the smell.  Some people just need to grow up.  The only negative thing I can say about the product is that I needed a decent amount in order to get the hair off.  When doing a full body hair removal, I used about 3/4 a bottle or so although I&#x27;m sure I could use less over time if I were more experienced with knowing how to apply it (I haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to get it down to a science).  It&#x27;s been a while, so I can&#x27;t remember how long the hair took to grow back, but it was definitely longer than if I had shaved.</li>
    <li> got this product recently and it works perfectly. i had tried the cream previously and it was horribly messy, hard to apply evenly to large areas, and smelled of heavy chemicals. this was supremely better on all accounts. the smell is the same just muted, far easier to apply, and only slightly messy (it starts dripping a bit if you have to have it on longer than 5 min). i tested it out on my hand for the minimum of 4 min and it didn&#x27;t do anything but there was no skin reaction so i bumped it up to 7 min for the full application and it took all the hair on my arms off. after 5 min it did get really warm but i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s anything out of the ordinary. i would not recommend if you have sensitive skin, otherwise this is the way to go as it lasts much longer then shaving and works better after the first application.  fyi: this stuff is super slippery. i stepped in some that had dripped on the floor and nearly killed myself in the shower and my shower is not slippery at all. so just be careful.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly well although I had to keep in on for more than ten minutes for best results. use with caution to avoid rash but still, works well.</li>
    <li> Even following the directions had a bit of chemical burn.  Don&#x27;t keep on quite as long as they say.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because i was tired of shaving my chest all the time. I would say I have average thickness of hair. When I used this product I followed the directions exactly. I have done this twice now. I waited for the maximum time (because nothing happened before that) and wiped away the spray as directed but nothing happened. I only saw a little hair removed when I rubbed very hard and even then it was blotchy and patchy and I would not recommend this product. I may try the cream and see how that works.</li>
    <li> no consistency and it makes your bathtub slippery.</li>
    <li> Works great, Only thing you, the can empties fast,</li>
    <li> ok let me state this Im not very hairy so this worked wonders. I use it on my chest when Im cutting so my abs are reveled. cover your nipples because it will burn them if you leave it on to long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, totally beat my expectations, however it did seem to give me a slight skin irritation on one spot on my chest.  The irritation only lasted a couple of hours, besides, that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know why BUT sometimes it works very well other time well it sucks and doesn&#x27;t why this happens don&#x27;t know if anyone does let us know</li>
    <li> it did the job but struggled a bit to remove all hair</li>
    <li> Purchased to remove back hair . Wanted to surprise my wife for a planned romatic trip .&lt;br /&gt;I am not super hairy and this worked for me , but is hard to spray on your own back  .&lt;br /&gt; It is easier to apply than lotion , though .</li>
    <li> Did not work. Burned skin. Would not recommend to anyone. Use a razor, warm water to remove any hair you don&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> It works but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it theres not enough to justify the price it&#x27;s better to just get the pump lotion type. But otherwise its a great product I liked not having to get the stuff on my hands till I was through with it but for the Price I can live with the pump style.</li>
    <li> Love the spray over its cousin, the cream version. Great coverage &amp; removes easily with moist paper towels.  Works well on this Italian&#x27;s back hair.</li>
    <li> too messy, and i have long hairs, runs out quick, best to go with cream, and it has awful smell.</li>
    <li> This also did not work as described, left on for maximum time and hair was still there...Would not recommend this item..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost count of how many cans of this stuff I&#x27;ve gone through over the years, and every time, it works great.  Personally, I need to leave it on about 2x as long as the instructions suggest, and I still have patches to manually trim with a razor, but it gets the job done a lot faster!</li>
    <li> It is easy to use. Spray works good, but it does not stick it becomes like liquid and slowly rolls down the skin. More that 4 min. on the skin it does have a burning sensation. Though I used the product before, I would recommend the new user to test it on the skin first and then apply.</li>
    <li> The product worked as well as expected. It did great on the fine to medium thickness hairs, but I had trouble with the this ones.</li>
    <li> didnt remove all the hair after being left on for 10mins.tried again for 15 min. still didnt.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t want to tell that the product does not work, but it didn&#x27;t work with me. Not one single hair.!</li>
    <li> Works but you need to rub off hair with wash cloth . Hair grows back in as much time as shaving.</li>
    <li> Quick Delivery, but the results were not as good as expected.</li>
    <li> Water works just as good as this stuff not worth the time to even look at it</li>
    <li> Took me two go-rounds with the spray to complete my man-scaping but it works wonders. Got most of the hair off my legs, arms, and chest, and what little areas were left I shaved off with a sensitive skin Shtick razor. My skin was left looking clean and feeling smooth. I was so pleased with my results I immediately ordered another one and I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> worked as expected. used on chest and stomach, waited about 5 minutes, checked a spot, hair came off so i took all the rest off. started burning at 3 minutes, so i imagine past the 5 minutes i kept it on it would have just gotten worse... i would recommend  Nair Shower Power Hair Remover (one that comes with a lil sponge) over this though. works better and pain free :)</li>
    <li> Crap - didn&#x27;t work for me.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Stick with the regular stuff and save yourself the headache.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all I tried everything and listen to all the directions and still nothing waste of money</li>
    <li> Took three tries to get it all. Stubble back in two days.</li>
    <li> I have used the cream for a couple of years, but I thought spray sounded quicker and easier. I followed the directions, left it on for five minutes on a already groomed area, and it did nothing, still stubble. Because of the heat it generated, I waited two weeks to try it again, and left it on for 10 minutes, what the label says is the max, and the stubble remained, but that time it torched my skin. It took me two months over the summer to fully heal. Stick with the cream.</li>
    <li> Works great but needs to sit much much longer then directions say for thick hair. Even if shaved first. I def would recomend this product though for hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Terrible not only did it ship to me a month after I ordered it the product burns my skin to much to even apply it for the 4 min. I&#x27;ve used a cream instead and never had this reaction</li>
    <li> I like the product it does the job, it does remove the hair and it leaves skin smooth. Yes as other people say it does smell bad but just man up because is really not that bad. You do end up making a big mess though. I will not be buying this product again do to the fact that I used it on my chest and legs and the can was empty and is not worth paying $9 to get 2/3 of the job done and only use it once.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells WAY worse than the Gel does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it difficult to apply myself because it doesn&#x27;t spray all that well, it SMELLS, and it isn&#x27;t something that coats well. I was hoping it would be like spray sunscreen, but it&#x27;s not nearly as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because if you can get someone else to put it on you, it works OK. Not worthy of three and not bad enough for one star.</li>
    <li> This product is much easier to use than any gel or cream.  Instructions say 4 minutes but no longer than 10 minutes.  I have had to leave it on 12 minutes for my coarse hair to come right off with a wet wash cloth in the shower.  No skin irritation if you immediately follow up with soap to get off any residue.  This product is difficult to find in stores recently.  May have been discontinued in favor of Nair&#x27;s new hair removal gel for men.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this as I stand naked in my shower, staring out the window at the frozen tundra laid out in front of my eyes. I remove the cap to the spray can, clench my teeth and depress the nozzle. I spray the cream like substance all over my nether-regions. At first, I feel nothing. Then I slowly start to feel the cold burn encompassing my naughty parts as if I had just violently sodomized the Clarkson boys snowman they had erected in my yard. I scream in agony but there is no help for me. It feels as if an army of ice wraith from the sea of ghosts have latched on to my kibble and bits. I reach to turn on the water but slip and break off the handle. GOD&#x27;S BE DAMNED!!!! I&#x27;m forced to retreat to the sink where I violently splash water to remove the burning horror. After mere minutes of grueling pain, I manage to send the vile sludge back to the depths of hell from whence it came. But It did do the trick. My lady friend will be most pleased for valentine&#x27;s day. Maybe I&#x27;ll get anal.</li>
    <li> Its really terrible especially the odor.... I sprayed all of my legs and waited for 6 min... it did work but really messy and still have hair roots in my legs... VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> There is not much in this bottle, it doesn&#x27;t do an even coat and it was really hard on your skin and I do not have sensitive skin whatsoever. I would go with another product thats my call.</li>
    <li> none of the hair came off. at best, i felt uncomfortably tingly for a while and the hair felt weaker. nothing actually came off. i even tried to pull it, nada.</li>
    <li> This product is as defined and works great for me. The price on this is also very reasonable, good thing is I can use this just by myself</li>
    <li> It worked.  The smell was bad.  It removed the hair.  It exceeded my expectations because of other reviews  were negative.  I will buy more!</li>
    <li> I got this product in hopes for a longer lasting alternative to shaving. I followed the instructions exactly as they were written on the bottle, and saw no results. I tried 5 times over the course of 3 days each time increasing the time I left it on by a few minutes. Not only did I not see any results (that&#x27;s right not one hair was removed), I also now have a rash in the area where I applied it. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone as it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This item it is will works perfect!!!</li>
    <li> my order got refused!!! why you ask? well that&#x27;s a good question I still don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;my guess is that because i live in Alaska, which would be kind of a dumb reason not to send it if you ask my opinion.</li>
    <li> do as the directions say, also be very gentle, do not overspray, moderately spray over the hair.  It pretty much loosens the skin, and if you leave it on long enough, your skin will break apart.  It is kind of like putting acid on your skin.  Obviously the hair is going to be deader than dead after this spray!  edit: except you are better off with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Extremely effective hair removal for men.  Foam ensures even distribution of product.</li>
    <li> Was a bit skeptical but worked amazingly! I&#x27;ve heard of Nair for years and just kinda laughed at it.. I&#x27;m a 35 year old man now and had some kind of unsightly back hair.. Gone! I use it about once a week. Also made my butt super smooth! lol! Probably doesn&#x27;t work as well if you have really thick black coarse hair. Good luck! Highly recommend this! The smell is kind of weird but worth it.</li>
    <li> Got the job done a little messy but good results</li>
    <li> I am a very hairy guy so Man-Scaping is essential every now and then .This was a pretty good way to get rid of the hair. Its still messy but so much better than the creams they have . I usually scrape it off and flush the hair in the toilet since i don&#x27;t wanna clog my tub .</li>
    <li> this Nair for men is Amazing , I use it when I take a shower and  spray the areas that I want to remove the hair from, and all I have to do is leave it on those areas for 10 minutes and then run my body under the shower water and it comes right off. Love it love it love it!!! Thanks again Amazon</li>
    <li> this product is so bad. i did just like instructions said and most of the hair was gone but there was spots left with hair on</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> closes my back has ever gotten you smooth lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a small guy. 5&#x27;4&amp;#34;, 155lbs. And I ran out of this before covering everything. An average sized guy would prbably need two or more full cans. Not very cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the metal container becomes extremely slippery the moment you get some of the Nair on your hands, which happens almost immediately. It quickly became very difficult to grip it tight enough to also apply enough pressure to get it to squire out.  Was basically a slippery cursing nightmare by the end.</li>
    <li> there was not much in the can but the conveinance of the spray container must be why</li>
    <li> i left spray on for 15 minutes and used a micro fiber towel to remove hair. it did come off. after a shower, little hair remnants were present and i just plucked them out.</li>
    <li> Good seller,highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy and this is my manscape secret.  Works just as good as the cream, but it&#x27;s so much easier to use and you can get the spots your hands don&#x27;t reach. Not many stores carry the spray anymore, so stop looking and just buy it from amazong.</li>
    <li> You have to apply like 4-5 times just to remove hair. So a little disappointed</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t remove much if any hair. Skin started getting red and itchy and I followed the instructions. If you&#x27;re a guy and you have moderate to a lot of body hair, look for another product because this one is terrible.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrendous for starters but I sucked it up after a while. I used this product of my stomach and chest and after about 4-5 minutes I gently wiped and most of the hair came off but my god it burned so so bad. Felt like the worst sun burn you could ever get. Although the product works, I unfortunately am one of those who obviously have sensitive skin and if you do, take extreme caution. After the shower, my chest hurt all day, like I said, feels like a bad sunburn and from the way it looks ill either stop using it or wait weeks for the redness to go away and apply a little more sparingly next time.</li>
    <li> I have no issue with the shipper, but as far as the product goes, I couldn&#x27;t even finish spraying a selected area before it ran out. It was not worth it.</li>
