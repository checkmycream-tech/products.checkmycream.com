    <li> So glad I found this large size! I was perplexed about dispensing until it dawned on me to reuse the rmpty 8 oz. bottle.</li>
    <li> This soap is for sensitive skin - often used in skilled care homes for seniors.  Highly recommended.  The big size is economical, transfer it to a pump bottle dispencer and keep it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I got this in hospital and my son was visiting and used it. he said mom you have to get me some! Found this big jug on Amazon! He is a happy man!</li>
    <li> ENJOY THE PRODUCTS ABILITY TO SOOTHE THE SKIN, AND THE SCENT.  I HAVE BOUGHT THE PRODUCT IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.</li>
    <li> This. Is a great product and a repeat purchase for us .  We use it for head to toe mild cleaning.  We buy a years supply at a time and love it</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my Mom.  I can use it to wash her hair because it is a no rinse shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is great body wash. I have very sensitive skin. It is soothing and smells great. One problem is that it does not come with A pump to fit the bottle for distribution of the liquid. I have been unable to find a pump to put on this container and have been transferring to smaller containers to fit in my bathroom which can be very messy</li>
    <li> I bought this for our niece.  She has very sensitive skin &amp; even with some of the anti-allergy soaps she gets a reaction.  I had brought a small bottle with me from the hospital &amp; when she tried it &amp; didn&#x27;t get a reaction, she wanted it.  So glad I found it thru you.  She&#x27;s thrilled &amp; has been using it  with very pleasant results.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> My sister says the soap is great!!</li>
    <li> Perhaps the best choice for diabetics.  Wish I could find the wall mounted dispenser!</li>
    <li> Washes great. Is very easy on the skin. I also use it as shampoo and my hair is tangle free after towel drying.</li>
    <li> Wow! Lightening fast shipping. Excellent communication with company concerning my delivery address. I&#x27;ve used this product for years, mostly in my nursing career. In the past few years however, my own husband has fought diabetic ulcers on his foot. The Veteran&#x27;s Hospital clinician prescribed  this Aloe Vesta wash to cleanse his foot wounds. And over the past few years I&#x27;ve begun using it for my own personal use as my (old) skin now needs different(gentler) attention. This large container will be great to mix &amp; fill my individual &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; dispensing bottles for each bath, both showers &amp; lavs. Great product. Hoping I will always be able to get it this way thru Amazon. Love Convatec!  AND Amazon. What did we do before??&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd 4 l bottle we have ordered--love it for bath, shower or hair. gentle onm the skin and leaves a wonderfu; soft light fragrence. Will order lots over the next few years</li>
    <li> Husbands caregiver likes it.</li>
    <li> Best liquid soap we&#x27;ve ever used.  The no-rinse light solution [ 2 oz/half gallon H2O] is so handy - we keep bottles in the vehicles and several home locations; quick clean-up for any situation...quick doggie clean-up, too.  Get a wall bracket OR a transfer pump from the auto store for the 4 Litre size.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My husband was given a bottle at the hospital and he liked it so much, he wanted to continue using it at home. His problems with dry skin have been greatly helped.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, quickly shipped. Easy.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that I would recommend for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap! It made well packaged! A little hard to dispense out into other bottles but we solved that by using a funnel</li>
    <li> I love this soap but the dispenser is very difficult to use. I refill my smaller bottles and it is very hard to hold and do this. They should go back to jugs with handles.</li>
    <li> This 2-N-1 product really works. Gentle on your skin and scalp. Easy to rinse. It has a light fragrance that goes away when rinsed and it is a little runny compared to expensive shampoos which are not easy to rinse and leave fragrant residue on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;So far we like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this when my wife brought home a small bottle from the hospital after surgery.  She gave it to me and it is really a great body wash that suds up and gets you clean.  It smells fresh also.  I now buy it by the gallon which lasts me about a year and I just fill my small bottle from the big jug.  I use it to shower with after I finish swimming each day at an indoor pool and it gets the chlorine out.</li>
    <li> As a caregiver I have used this product for several years now and just love it.  It keeps the skin soft and no rinsing is required.  I would highly recommend this for caregivers and those having difficulty with a bath or shower.</li>
    <li> I got hooked on this on my many hospital stays last year.  It smells good to me, is multipurpose, and does not leave my skin as dry as other products.  The only thing I could recommend to improve this would be to add a pump so that it could be used as is, or easily transferred to smaller containers.</li>
    <li> I can only use certain types of body washes.  Aloe Vesta is an excellent product and I purchased it at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine went to the hospital and brought a small bottle of this home and did not want it so I took it and love it... I have eczema really bad all over most of my body and most things sting but this not only does not sting but it takes the redness away for at least the day&lt;br /&gt;and that is why I am getting such a large amount of it... I will update if anything is diff with this or things change. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.. I just got this it the mail 1 day before it said it would arrive so the dilevery on this is AMAZING! thank you</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time. I was introduced to it in the hospital and could not find it in the stores. I purchased the smaller bottles on Amazon and then I found the large 4 liter bottle. I have hair like kitten fur and this makes more volume, body and shine. I have none of the usual dry, itchy skin and best of all  - one small bottle does the job of body wash, shampoo, and conditioner for just a small amount of money. I will use it forever! Thank you, Amazon, for making it available for me.</li>
    <li> Was used by my hospital when I was a patient. I liked it enough to order it for home use. Pleasant smell though not perfumed. Effective for bathing.</li>
