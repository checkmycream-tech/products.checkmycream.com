<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very pleased to receive this order so quickly and well packaged. The product met and exceeded my expectations, I was very pleased with the price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> THIS WAS LIKE SPRAYING MYSELF WITH WATER!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. She used to wear it but no stores around us carry it anymore. Thank-you Amazon for having it for us.</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for several years and I love it.  I love that I can get it for a good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother. The aroma was correct. But the spray button broke within 4 days. Never happen before. Kind of odd.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product from Amazon for years, however this most recent delivery smelled like rubbing alcohol and had flakes in the bottle. Extremely disappointed and want my money back.</li>
    <li> I have had people (men &amp; women)  stop me and ask me what I am wearing.  I gladly reply &amp;#34;O So Oscar&amp;#34;.  I have worn this for 15 years now.  Started having trouble finding it in stores.  So I went to amazon and I buy 2 to 3 bottles at a time.  Great scent and great price.</li>
    <li> Good product fast shipping thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent price. Fast shipping on Holidays. Thanks</li>
    <li> MY WIFE SAID IS EXCELENT.</li>
    <li> Old favorite that is difficult to find. Would have loved to have the body lotion of the same scent, though.</li>
    <li> This product was correct and I worked perfectly</li>
    <li> I am VERY familiar with this perfume and for some reason it wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m used to. The smell lasted all of two minutes! I was very upset and complained about it. I was sent a replacement bottle and it was the same thing. I am not buying my perfumes from Amazon anymore. Both bottles are sitting on my dining room table because it makes no sense to wear them. What happened?????????????</li>
    <li> Very good fragance, but evaporate quickly, like alcohol. not recommended</li>
    <li> it is a good product for this price</li>
    <li> This is perhaps the ultimate in feminine scents.  Musk based with white flower florals.  It is awesome too for a woman with oily skin as it is rich enough to stay with you for hours.  Yummy!  Men always compliment me on my scent too when I wear this!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love !!! Has always been my favorite since 97&#x27; !! ♡</li>
    <li> love this perfume i used to have it now i found it again, i love it, the men love it too, and the price excellent.</li>
    <li> good product! recommended</li>
    <li> Very floral and the scent does not seem to last too long.  This is not a perfume that makes say &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; I love this scent. I will finish the bottle, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Glad I found it.  Hard to get my hands on.</li>
    <li> excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> I purely purchased this perfume due to the reviews and perfume notes. I received the product well packaged. From here on is down hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The perfume had white flecks floating.....&lt;br /&gt;2. Longevity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodness gracious, I had cheaper perfume last 3 hours. This EDT lasts 10 minutes tops. I swear it&#x27;s that short. I thought I was loosing my mind. I shook the bottle, sprayed it on my sleeve. Next day, the smell was so faint.....you get the idea. No longevity whatsoever! !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;**save your $20***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what some you are thinking &amp;#34; It&#x27;s cheap, you get what you pay for&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;It&#x27;s EDT not EDP what were you thinking, a miracle that it would last&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;Hey its freaking Oscar De La Renta!!!! I don&#x27;t care what price is the product, it&#x27;s the reputation behind it. I do not think for a moment  ODLR puts out crap with his name attached to it....with the exception of this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE ON POINT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;YOU ARE SPRAYING WATER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 0 stars, but I was forced to rate 1* so this review could be published.</li>
    <li> This perfume came as expected and smells wonderful thank you!</li>
    <li> i wore this all the time, but then it was no longer available in the stores. now that ive found it here ill be buying more. its a floral scent. i like all florals paris, lancomes poem, and oscars original scent.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Smells cheap!</li>
    <li> OSCAR DE LA RENTA IS THE ONLY COLOGNE MY MOTHER WILL USE.  HAVE TRIED GIVING HER A DIFFERENT COLOGNE, (ONE THAT I LIKE THAT MY WIFE USES,) HOWEVER, SHE ONLY LIKES OSCAR (WON&#x27;T DO THAT AGAIN.) WAS GREAT TO FIND IT ON AMAZON FOR SUCH A GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! Put it back on my wish list for future orders.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. There&#x27;s not much I can say about this product, but for the fact it smells so good!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and have used it for 20 years. I really smells good on me and other people that come into the room also comment on it.</li>
    <li> Was surprise by the bottle size, larger than I expected...love this perfume. It is hard to find...</li>
    <li> The product was not as pictured, but was So and smells fine. Just beware if you are looking for the Oscar product of the picture, this is not it.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell. Got it as a gist, my friend loved it and had me smell it as well. It was lovely. Very light, yet rich and feminine.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this perfume; the scent is really marvellous!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know their were so many favors by Oscar, smells great!!!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite scent.  It is very gentle.  Sometimes I forget I am wearing it and find myself looking around for the lovely flower in bloom.  And this is the best price I have found for it.</li>
    <li> I am not a perfume wearer usually but wanted a scent I could use and not use my daughters on special occasions. I searched on Amazon and went by the reviews of the So De La Renta By Oscar De La Renta for women. Glad I did! Love the scent, very soft. It possesses a blend of fruits and exotic woods, and enhanced with tones of gardenia and vanilla.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for my mom. I told her if she didn&#x27;t like it she could give it to me. Smells great!</li>
    <li> Always fresh&lt;br /&gt;A light and unique scent making you an original &amp;#34;So&amp;#34; is really a favorite.  A well kept secret  since it not available in department stores</li>
    <li> Smells nice, my hubby bought this for me. I like it! Large bottle too so it will last a while.</li>
    <li> wOw!!! Way to Go. Very soft and lasting.</li>
    <li> so sorry about this bottle of Oscar de la renta-- it  has been my #1 perfume for many years, but there was&lt;br /&gt;absolutely no scent whatsoever  from this bottle--none in the bottle and none on my skin.  I feel I just threw&lt;br /&gt;my money away.</li>
    <li> Perfume my watch seems focused, not as experienced as few can even speak of what I see its packaging could be more sophisticated, more beautiful, the dsigners might as well treat the best product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and it smells good. Just not great for the youngers (early twenties) but is was good quality for the price (bought from amazon of course)</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this many years and love the soft floral scent. I work in a very tiny office and people go in and out all the time. I spray it on my neck and writsts and it&#x27;s the perfect amount and I get compliments all the time because it is not over powering. I&#x27;m not a big fan of &amp;#34;Toilette Sprays&amp;#34;, but this one is very nice.</li>
    <li> I looked at all the reviews before purchasing this (because I love Oscar De La Renta fragrance - the classic one).  When I got it, I sprayed it on - immediately, it was too strong for me.  It reminded me of my old teacher in high school... a very strong scent that smells...well...dated and yuck.  That&#x27;s the only way I can think to describe it. Disappointed, but fortunately, I found someone that liked it.  Maybe it just didn&#x27;t go with my body chemistry, but truthfully, I didn&#x27;t like it in the bottle or on my skin.</li>
    <li> Live the smell of this perfume, I always get lots of complements when I where it. It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores and this is a great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume and it smells amazing. Not only does she love the smell, it also lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the lasting of the fragrance.after an hour no one even commented on it.</li>
    <li> I have had this perfume in my life for over 10 years and I am glad it is still around! I purchased for my sister in Florida because she always liked it when I wore it! So thanks for having it in stock!!!!</li>
    <li> I have worn Oscar by Oscar for 30 yrs.  It is still my favorite!  So De La Renta has a very citrus fragrance that does not appeal to me.  It is also made in New York, NY.  I purchased So De La Renta, Rosamor, Volupt, and Oscar by Oscar.  the So De La Renta and the Oscar were made in New York.  They both had a &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; fragrance, not the smooth soft fragrance as the products made in France.  I would suggest spending the extra money and purchasing the product made in France.</li>
    <li> I love this. It makes me smell fresh and lady like.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is not into smelling fruity tooty.</li>
    <li> This is a strong,chemical,suffocating,nausiating smell that gave me an instant headache.For this price I expected it to be at least somewhat wearable,but how anyone could wear this is an absolute mystery to me.The favorable reviews are  also shocking.This stinks to high heaven,I am using it as air freshener for my basement now-but to be honest,it is not even pleasant enough to be an air refreshener.Just nasty.</li>
    <li> Very Niceee!!!! Thank Youuuuu!!!!!</li>
    <li> Oscar De La Renta, speaks for itself. Yes, my 4th time having this parfum. Love the Oscar. 😀</li>
    <li> A bit too sweet for me. I ended up giving it to my 17 yr old son so he could give it to his girlfriend as a gift. She loves it. I think it is more appropriate for a younger person. But for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> i am a perfume fanatic and keep up with all perfumes. i came across this about ten years ago and it has been a signature scent of mine since then. feminine and bright, its floral but not overkill. it will last all day on skin and clothing. i get compliments from strangers everytime i wear it. this is a hidden gem of a perfume and you are missing out if you dont try it at least once.</li>
    <li> Great perfume for all seasons. Especially for spring and summer.</li>
    <li> Classy,delicate fragrance.</li>
    <li> Excellent product marketed is identical to the store, excellent material, very durable and meets my expectations, the quality of the article is very good and excellent brand</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> a gift to my mom she love it nice perfume</li>
    <li> My wife has been a fan of SO for 10 years and 30 minutes after she put it on it started wearing off. I was really hoping it was ligit because the only place I can find the real stuff is an hour from my house at a perfume kiosk in a mall! I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> excellent product and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> As other purchaser stated, this product had flakes floating in bottle.  To make matters worse, the pump does not spray.</li>
    <li> Perfume is such an individual preference, that it  really isn&#x27;t fair, to rate them. But to be honest, this is just not my favorite. But my favorite perfume Clinique, went up to $60 for 3.4 OZ., and I refuse to pay that. So I am trying alot of other perfumes. So far my favorite from my new purchases is, Design, by Paul Sebastian.</li>
    <li> Old perfume but I love it you cannot go wrong with this</li>
    <li> tanhk yoy, congratulation</li>
    <li> Although this So De La Renta by Oscar De La Renta has been around for some time, I never get tired of the scent. I think it is the absolute best smelling womens perfume on the market. When I found this on Amazon selling for this great price, I had to buy it for my wife. I love the way this stuff smells!!</li>
    <li> This is the true scent of a Man&#x27;s Lady.  Everyman who smells this on me raves about it.  I&#x27;m always asked about this scent and after working extremely long hours it stays fresh.  I feel so daint, beautiful and powerful wearing this scent.  I&#x27;m a business woman so I have to be able to smell great without choking those around me.  Like I said, everyone needs this scent in their collection.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, long lasting scent. My go to everyday fragrance. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Oscar!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the good review, but it was like water. It has no smell at all. I wonder if all this reviews are for this same perfume or the original they purchased ed in store. BUYERS BE WARNED.</li>
    <li> Loved it, I was planning to give it away when I ordered it but ended up loving it and kept it :)</li>
    <li> the product is excellent everything was described in advertising and I was fully satisfied with site thanks</li>
    <li> good price, good quality, arrived well packed, compliance date of delivery.</li>
    <li> Smells ok, but it&#x27;s a little classic to the point of smelling old fashioned. I am 32 and I would never pick this if i smelt it at a store. i bought it purely based on the description and price, but it&#x27;s not my fav fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, I just received it a couple of days ago and the product seems to be either a copy (not original), from a very old production batch or a deffective dispatch. The color of the box is very faded (seems like the box is old), the color of the perfume is almost transparent and WORSE of all inside the bottle there are small particles (like little pieces of paper). The scent is very weak and doesn&#x27;t last even for half an hour. This is the worst product I have received from AMAZON so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude but love this shizzle on the lady parts.  It smells so effin flowery and what not.  Lady&#x27;s be squirtin&#x27; on their lady bits making it smell nice and stupid up in there.  It be stink pretty - that&#x27;s for sho.  Also one time, I was having a BBQ with some homeboys and couldn&#x27;t get the BBQ goin&#x27;, so I said, \\&quot;Hey!  Hey!  LaQueesha...  Bring dat nasty weave over here fo a quick minute.  You got some a dat parfum you always tryin to cover up your stank self up wit?\\&quot;.  So her fool-self brought it over from the bafroom and I spritzed some of dat juice on the briquets.  So then, my brother Lil&#x27; Skootz and his pregnant fianc&amp;eacute;e came over to see what was going on.  Skootz threw his Swisher Sweet on the BBQ and BAM! We got flames yo!  Our chicken was off the hook even though it did taste a little bit like a meadow.  In short,  you should buy this multipurpose liquid.  BAM!  We got flames yo!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is a light fragrance.  I rated this product a 5 because it has a great smell and it was very cheap.  If you buy this product out of Macy, you will spend more.</li>
    <li> I really impress and last lot longer than the OEM battery.  I&#x27;m very happy with my choice  and the is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommend to a friends.</li>
    <li> The best perfume ever....get compliments from men and women, very light and airy...i have very sensetive frangrance issues, can only wear a couple of frangrances and this is my main one, does not give me a headache...great price and delivery time.</li>
    <li> Great price, wife likes a lot.</li>
    <li> I suppose if you really like floral scents, then you might like this.  It&#x27;s very strong, however, and gave me headache each time I wore it.  I prefer vanilla scents, so this didn&#x27;t really smell good to me.  Whenever I smelled it, I thought of a very old, very rich southern woman.</li>
    <li> This is the first perfume that I have purchased that after 10 minutes, the smell is gone. I wear alot of different perfumes and I know that this is a 3 dollar item.</li>
    <li> it was a gift it arrived after the fact. still good quality but a little slower on the shipping for the right price I will order again just not close to any important event</li>
    <li> perfect subtle fragrance,</li>
    <li> Thanks. Love this scent.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t opened plan to keep as collectible of something by Oscar something I can afford! packaging is very nice</li>
    <li> It makes me feel young again !!!</li>
    <li> Great will buy again...</li>
    <li> Delightful hella warm and well rounded.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase I was buying this perfume at TJMax for years and loved it,  unfortunately they do not have them anymore&lt;br /&gt;people will always asked me what perfume I was wearing,  I decided to buy it from Amazon,  does no smell like the original,  does not stay for more than 5 minutes and the spray nozzle keeps falling,  I was comparing the label with my old one it says made in France...and the one from Amazon says made in USA,  I used to pay $19.00 at the store and the quality was better....need my refund..</li>
    <li> One of my Old time favorites</li>
    <li> Have used Oscar D La Renta for 8years. First time for So De La Renta and very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am apacionate with this aroma. Oscar de la Renta is my favorite one and the clasic fragance is always one of my regular choices.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother in law for Christmas and it turns out that this is her favorite!!  Yay!</li>
    <li> Lovely, i just can&#x27;t get enough</li>
    <li> buen perfume aroma agradable duradero elegante .... ... .. ... .. .. . . . ... . . . .</li>
    <li> I really love this scent... I always used this everyday wherever I go. Great scent and it is mild too.</li>
    <li> Not the real thing, this is a fake.</li>
    <li> The bottle I received was much taller than expected and it smells very good. I rated it a four star because for some reason the scent did not last as long as I would have wanted it to, otherwise great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I received a sample of it with another order. I had never heard of it but found that I kept going back to the sample day after day. It is soft and feminine, does not smell \\&quot;old\\&quot; or powdery as some floral perfumes can. A really lovely scent. I&#x27;ve had perfumes that cost four times as much that I had to remember to use or had to be in the mood for, this one is light enough to use every day no matter what the season. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite.</li>
    <li> Well first I must say that this product is rubbish, should respect the brand owner passed away, because nothing is all that perfume compared to the original, apart from not respecting the customer, alcohol is bought at the pharmacy, I will make a complaint where you have to put on my not a single positive review, I suggest to everyone to be careful with your bids</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful... just doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
    <li> Little disappointed in the fragrance</li>
    <li> It is my favorite perfume.  So happy to be able to buy it from Amazon now.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is great, but only lasts until it dries.  I know it is only EDT, but I don&#x27;t have this problem with other fragrances.</li>
    <li> The photos are totally the wrong for both the Oscar and the So by Oscar de la Renta as they are reversed. Needless to say I received the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I was ordering the Oscar and received the So product. Now Amazon says you can&#x27;t return it and get right item. Such a deal.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, no lasting power, I believe I got what I paid for...cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance not knowing it was not the original &amp;#34;Oscar&amp;#34; however, I ended up loving it! I wear it everyday. It is more of an updated version of the original and has floral notes that are not too sweet. It just seems to have more dimensions than the original. I found it to be bright &amp; breezy perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Read so many good reviews about this item, bought it as a gift for my wife. The perfume smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s the one sent to me that&#x27;s a fake one. Other reviewers says theirs last for long.</li>
    <li> As above - my all time favorite fragrance at a great price. It lasts for a long time, is subtle, and I receive many compliments about it.</li>
    <li> a very nice scent.  I am enjoying it.  I hope it does not go bad with time.  We shall see.</li>
