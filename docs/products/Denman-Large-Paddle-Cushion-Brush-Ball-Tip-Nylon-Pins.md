      <li>I fell in love with my stylists hairbrush and had to have one!</li>
      <li>Aactually I bought many good brand brush this year, this one, tangle teezer, and some on in the Europe airport made from Italy.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t pinpoint why, but it just feels superior and appears to do a better job than the competition in its price range.  </li>

      <li>Lightweight and very comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a nice brush, well made and easy to hold with a very smooth handle.  </li>

      <li>We call it \\&quot;the magic</li>
      <li>Maybe when the Ball tips wear off it will be better.</li>
      <li>I love this Denman paddle brush.</li>
      <li>This is the most dumbest comb ever.</li>
      <li>Not much to say about it, it&#x27;s just a great brush and of great quality.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love how the brush feels on my hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>so I bought two more in case it happens again.</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>This is why I bought two more Denmans.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>but i thought it would be better quality plastic...</li>
      <li>and I love this brush.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hairbrush.</li>
      <li>but i can&#x27;t imagine one being particularly better than this one.</li>
      <li>We both love this brush over any others we have.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. :)</li>
      <li>I love it..</li>
      <li>Save your money and look elsewhere for a better quality brush.</li>
      <li>my dollar store brush is better than this brush.</li>
      <li>oh, eight or more years ago at a specialty store.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are a good distance apart and penetrate between hair to the scalp nicely making for a decent scalp massage when brushing.</li>
      <li>I also love that&#x27;s so light and easy to manage!</li>
      <li>I love this brush, it is lightweight but so easy to use.</li>
      <li>what a nice surprise to find this for such a great price.</li>
      <li>I have more than a few Denman brushes and, like all the rest, this one is great!  </li>
      <li>I like how easily it goes through my hair.</li>
      <li>So glad I found one that is made right!</li>
      <li>Super happy to have found a new one 😀</li>
      <li>Meh, a 3$ brush will do just fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are higher quality brushes out there that are comparable or better</li>
      <li>All I know is that it emitted a strong plastic odor after it was removed from its wrapping and it feels really cheap.</li>
      <li>The dogs like the softness of the Nylon, it&#x27;s easy to remove the hair after brushing and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It is larger than I thought, but very very comfortable!!</li>
      <li>I have owned this brush since 2000 and am still going strong with my original purchase.  </li>
      <li>I also appreciate that it is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I HAVE HAD CHEAP CHINA COUNTERPARTS THAT FALL</li>
      <li>it back to Amazon and thank goodness for their great return policy.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I received a defective brush, but the balls on the ball-tip kept getting caught on my daughter&#x27;s hair, instead of smoothly moving through her locks.  </li>
      <li>We just bought this assuming it was Denman quality, but it seemed identical to my daughter&#x27;s cheap novelty-pattern China-made equivalent paddle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it feels cheap and flimsy.</li>
      <li>The brush is also really light.</li>
      <li>Glides through hair smoothly.</li>
      <li>and it will smooth out your hair and rid you of shed hairs and tangles.</li>
      <li>but it does come handy when I have to detangle my wigs rather than my real hair.</li>
      <li>Once I opened the package I knew it was cheaply made, as it was lighter weight</li>
      <li>The ball tipped pins are comfortable, dont tangle in my hair, and dont come off either.</li>
      <li>This brush is great, I got it after seeing it on multiple hair blogs but in all honesty I think the hype is unjustified.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>This is a good brush for detangling and blowdrying natural 4a/b hair.</li>
      <li>Great for Blowing out curly hair before flat ironing.</li>
      <li>This is a great paddle brush and I prefer to use it when my hair is flat ironed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a good brush for detangling and blowdrying natural 4a/b hair. It takes some getting used to, but my D31 broke and I needed something to blowout my hair with.  This does the job, make sure you start with small sections and from the ends of your hair. Work your way up, little by little and it will smooth out your hair and rid you of shed hairs and tangles.</li>
    <li> I really need to toss this brush because after using it for a little over a year, I am seeing more split ends in my hair than the norm.</li>
    <li> My daughters love this paddle brush!!!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with my stylists hairbrush and had to have one! When i opened the box and held it in my hand I remembered my mother having one when I was a girl (almost 40 years ago). This brush is so gentle, and keeps my fine hair from breakage. My 8 year old daughter has fallen in love with it since it doesn&#x27;t pull so hard on her locks;I will buying another one soon.</li>
    <li> Absolutely geat experience.</li>
    <li> I have owned this brush for years.  It&#x27;s the only brush that doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive scalp.  When I had 2 daughters, they inherited my tangly hair and sensitive scalp.  It&#x27;s the only brush they can tolerate.  We call it \\&quot;the magic brush.\\&quot;  Every time a friend borrows it from us, they ask me where I got it and then buy it later.</li>
    <li> This is a really good brush.  It is great for detangling and smoothing.  It does not pull at the hair or split the ends.  My only complaint is the handle is a bit awkward, but that is an easy workaround.  Highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairbrush. Lightweight and very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent brush; light, inexpensive at around $10, and passes the gentle test (drag the bristles along your forearm; if it leaves scratches it&#x27;s too rough for your hair). However I can&#x27;t speak to its overall quality or longevity as I just received it. Someone said they had theirs 9 years but I don&#x27;t know if the quality has stayed the same &amp; if the brush you get now is the same brush they made a decade ago. All I know is that it emitted a strong plastic odor after it was removed from its wrapping and it feels really cheap. I wonder how it shall hold up against heat styling. My Conair brush feels much better in terms of materials quality though it isn&#x27;t this gentle. It&#x27;s surprising how hard it can be to find a really good paddle brush.</li>
    <li> I have more than a few Denman brushes and, like all the rest, this one is great!  They are a bit on the pricy side, but well worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks I over the Paul Mitchell paddle brush I was replacing, but this is probably a good case of you get what you pay for. This one is light plastic and the little balls on the bristle tips are much smaller and make the brush far less comfortable than the PM equivalent. It&#x27;s not so bad that I&#x27;ll return the product, but I&#x27;ll be using it years from now cursing my decision to chintz out on a daily use item.</li>
    <li> THIS BRUSH WORKS VERY WELL AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE.  I HAVE HAD CHEAP CHINA COUNTERPARTS THAT FALL APART RIGHT AWAY.</li>
    <li> I love this paddle brush!!  I first saw it while I was getting my hair done and my hairdresser used it to blowdry my hair. It gave me such a straight and sleek finish. I also love that&#x27;s so light and easy to manage! Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Get this, you will not regret it. my hair feels so silky after using this brush. I use this brush  to blowdry my hair and it is very good! A bit big but since I have thick long hair I do not mind. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I volunteer with a dog rescue and currently have 3 Golden Retrievers.  It seemed like I was buying dog brushes every month.  This may seem an unorthodox use of this particular product, but after reading the &amp;#34;humans&amp;#34; reviews I decided to try it on the Goldens and it works very well indeed! All three dogs are brushed several times a week and the Denman is standing up to the punishment. It&#x27;s a sturdy brush and I expect it will far outlast any other brush I have had. The dogs like the softness of the Nylon, it&#x27;s easy to remove the hair after brushing and it&#x27;s easy to clean. I suspect it&#x27;s great for people too!</li>
    <li> I have owned this brush since 2000 and am still going strong with my original purchase.  It may be slightly more expensive than your average drugstore variety but it is completely worth it as it extremely durable and gentle but effective for even very thick hair.  Even after 10 years of utter abuse, not a single bristle pin is missing... AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Actually, I ordered two brushes thinking that they were different because they had different names &amp; descriptions, and one was supposed to be a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; version.  When they came, I found that they are the exact same model, same UPC code &amp; everything.  To help prevent anyone else from making the same mistake, I am putting a link to the other brush.&lt;br /&gt;amazon.com/gp/product/B000GX57JK?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice brush, well made and easy to hold with a very smooth handle.  The handle and the base are all one piece with a flexible insert that has all of the bristles.  I like this because it has no seam or joint to catch a strand or two of hair like many other brushes do. The tips are topped with tiny balls and do not scratch my scalp plus there is a slight cushion where the bristles attach allowing some for some give as the bristles glide along your scalp.  I am happy with the brush and thankful for the quality build coming from the UK.</li>
    <li> This is the most dumbest comb ever. It was way too expensive for what I bought it for. It&#x27;s completely false advertising and I would never, buy from them again. Excuse me for any messed up vocab or punctuations. and takes too much effort to return it</li>
    <li> Denman paddle brush arrived in timely manner, good price, exactly as expected, real Denman quality, I&#x27;m already looking over what I want to purchase here next.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this brush in 1999 and just now decided to replace it - with the same exact one.  I&#x27;ve tried replacing it with others, but just couldn&#x27;t find one that could compare.  It&#x27;s very light weight and durable.  Can&#x27;t explain why it&#x27;s so great, but it creates a pin-straight, shiny look every time.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I bought my brush last month and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat. It does feel a little flimsy, but my hair stylist assured me she has had hers for over a year and it&#x27;s still perfect. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> my stylist uses a paddle brush to blow dry volume into my hair, so i bought this.   latches onto my hair, untangles it, so it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
    <li> Ive had this brush for over ten years! I love it.. it is the best brush Ive used for blow drying.. I have thick African American hair and it does the trick. Very lightweight too.</li>
    <li> I am African American with natural hair. It is horribly hard for me to find a single brush to go through my hair. This brush worked for what I needed. I use it to blow dry my hair and it works, but I do have to brush my hair slowly at first then after a couple of tries, it goes right through smoothly.</li>
    <li> excellent !!! I purchased twice from Amazon</li>
    <li> After doing a lot of research on paddle brushes I finally decided to go with this one.  I love it!  My hair is super long, way past my waist and this is great on it.  Plus my husband loves to brush my hair at night.  Gotta like that!</li>
    <li> just got this today and although I am going natural this is the best brush I have ever had. I like how easily it goes through my hair. Highly recommend this to for any of you natural ladies!  really runs through my hair nicely without any kinks, my next true test will be on my wet hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is great, I got it after seeing it on multiple hair blogs but in all honesty I think the hype is unjustified.&lt;br /&gt;This brush doesn&#x27;t pull or rip hair nearly as much as the average brush. The bristles are a good distance apart and penetrate between hair to the scalp nicely making for a decent scalp massage when brushing. The air in the brush pushes out every time you brush so it makes a whistle/wheezy sound which can be slightly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy I have it but would I recommend it? Meh, a 3$ brush will do just fine.</li>
    <li> i expected it to be made of plastic but i thought it would be better quality plastic... it feels cheap and flimsy. also it definitely is not for my hair texture (kinky-curly type 4 hair), it snags and catches my strands because of the balls on the ends of the pins so i just don&#x27;t use it because i do not want to damage my strands. this brush may work for others who want to save some money but not for me. i prefer my denman d3 over this one.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!! This is beat brush I&#x27;ve ever had!! It is larger than I thought, but very very comfortable!! It fits any hair types. Miao ~</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not amazing when it comes to detangling, the tangle teezer does a better job, I just like the fact that it has a handle unlike the tangle teezer but it does come handy when I have to detangle my wigs rather than my real hair.</li>
    <li> Love it. Perfect for using during the blow drying process. I also just love to use this brush in general. My scalp loves it and it just makes dealing with my super curl and thick tresses so much easier.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this brush to dry my hair before straightening.  I bought one for home.  Great detangler without ripping. I don&#x27;t use it dry but it speeds up my drying time quite a bit without giving me a full blow-out look.</li>
    <li> I have short, wavy hair, shampoo every day and then brush/comb my hair with a nylon bristled paddle brush and let it dry on its own. I have been using a Jerome Alexander brush for years that has short, firm nylon bristles with the ball tips worn off and is perfect for my hair.  I am always looking for a new one and have yet to find a replacement.  My hairdresser thought I would like a Denman paddle brush, so I will give it a try.  It is very nice quality, but not exactly like my other one.  Maybe when the Ball tips wear off it will be better.</li>
    <li> This is a quality hairbrush that is holding up well for me.  It is gentle on my hair and scalp.  I also appreciate that it is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, my wife thick and long. We both love this brush over any others we have. I just ordered another one as well. Can&#x27;t live without them everywhere.</li>
    <li> Aactually I bought many good brand brush this year, this one, tangle teezer, and some on in the Europe airport made from Italy. This one is the best! Tangle teezer is not comfortable to handle. So I gave up all other brush and this one wins!</li>
    <li> This paddle brush works great for detangling hair.  I am a black woman with &amp;#34;natural hair&amp;#34; (as in no relaxer or other chemicals) and it doesn&#x27;t break my hair.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for about 7 years and the cushion comes out sometimes and also it squeezes together which can damage your hair since the bristles come too close together when that happens. A lot of the bristles also popped out. I would not purchase this again. But I have to say it is better than all the other paddle brushes I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly well on thick natural hair. Also doesn&#x27;t cause pain.</li>
    <li> A basic brush, nothing special.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my daughter&#x27;s Aveda paddle brush that had pretty much disintegrated over the past 6 years. I have had Denman brushes my whole life. I also have a Denman paddle brush for myself that I&#x27;ve owned for at least 5 or 6 years. I fully expect this one to last many years. They are simply great brushes. They used to cost a whole lot more money. what a nice surprise to find this for such a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this brush works.  When I received it there was a hole where one of the nylon pins is missing.  So I will return this brush for an exchange.</li>
    <li> Great for medium length to long hair.  Glides through hair smoothly. I have bought several brushes since my kids keep on taking my brush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products, and we order a ton of stuff from Amazon, but this brush works so well I had to leave a review.  I have coarse, curly hair which I straighten every day and over the years I&#x27;ve tried too many brushes to count.  This brush is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.  It straightens all of my curls and leaves my coarse hair very smooth and soft looking.  I&#x27;m sure there are higher quality brushes out there that are comparable or better but for someone not willing to cough up $100 + this brush works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush on my first trip to England in 2001 and have been using it ever since.  The rubber attached to the bristles is just now beginning to rip. I&#x27;ve never had a brush last this long before...I mean, 9 years!   I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush last year.  I only used it once, and never plan on using it again.  Perhaps I received a defective brush, but the balls on the ball-tip kept getting caught on my daughter&#x27;s hair, instead of smoothly moving through her locks.  SO, after one use, I put this brush away and chalked it up as a loss.  I own other Denman brushes and can&#x27;t say enough accolades for them, but this one, I could do without.</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly what I needed for my 4b/4c natural hair. I thought there was no way to detangle without losing hair. Ha boy was I wrong. Yes initially i did lose some strands at first use, that was because my hair was already tangled though. I use this brush every other day when I moisturize my hair and i have not lost anymore strands. Love this brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it is lightweight but so easy to use. It untangles my hair really nicely and without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;It really easy to clean up and the ball-tip are made of the same material as the bristles so you know they won&#x27;t come off!</li>
    <li> I love this Denman paddle brush. I use it to brush my hair after a blow out. It does not break my hair and gives my hair body.</li>
    <li> Gives me a lot of static but feels so good in my Scalp! Gentle enough that it massages my Scalp and still detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased for husband. He likes this kind of brush. Holding up well.</li>
    <li> This brush removes knots in my little girl&#x27;s hair with ease. Before running this brush through her hair it appeared that the knots would require scissors.I have a Denman brush that I still use after 25+ years!</li>
    <li> Works very well on my extensions.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for the wife she had been looking for this brush for a while to replace the one she had previous.  That guys</li>
    <li> they&#x27;ve done it again and I love this brush. It helps to detangle and blow dry my very thick natural hair with little pulling.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush oh, eight or more years ago at a specialty store.  I have used it exclusively since then, and stopped by the store a few times looking for the same brush, so that I could have one at home and one for travel.  It finally occurred to me that I might look on Amazon, so when I found \\&quot;my\\&quot; brush, I immediately ordered two of them.  The brushes I received seem to be of the same great quality as my old favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large paddle brush, great for thick or curly hair.  My hair is very thick and long, and this brush always smooths it out nicely.  I love how the brush feels on my hair and scalp.  It can be used to give volume to hair when blow-drying, too, although I don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush lasts forever -- my original brush is still in use, and has not lost any bristles or had any pieces come apart.  It always cleans up nicely, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes the brush great is that the ends of the bristles are nicely rounded, and that rounding seems to be an integral part of the bristles.  On other brushes, the little round ends of the bristles seemed to have been stuck on in a separate step.  The little end blobs fall off, or separate from the bristle, and either catch my hair and tear it, or leave a sharp bristle end, or both.  I&#x27;ve thrown away many brushes because of this failure.  So glad I found one that is made right!</li>
    <li> Never used a brush that took so long and was so difficult to get normal post-washing tangles out of my hair with.  Gave it to my mother who has shorter and coarser hair, straight.</li>
    <li> I have really fine, straight hair.  It tangles easily and can be a nightmare to comb through after showering in our very hard water.  I read some rave reviews about this paddle brush, and thought I would give it a shot.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it has drastically reduced my after shower combing/brushing time.  It&#x27;s the only brush I will use now.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Worst brush ever..my dollar store brush is better than this brush. Dont waste ur money.  Think I&#x27;m going to use it to kill flies, at least I&#x27;ll get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I went to a hairdresser who used this brush on my over-processed dry hair.  It de-tangles like a DREAM!!!!  When I asked what brush and how much it cost I was expecting a $100 price tag.  He told me that they used to sell it at Sally Beauty Supplies but they stopped.  Recently, I thought I lost the original one I bought on amazon (grr) so I bought two more in case it happens again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before and I loved it, but something must have changed in the construction because after using it for only two months pins are starting to pop out when I brush my hair. The description says it&#x27;s for all hair types, but they must mean only if your hair is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly my hair is long, but I brush the ends first and work up, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m starting at my scalp and yanking it through a bunch of knots. After having such a wonderful experience with my previous Denman paddle brush seeing this one begin to fall apart so soon after purchase is all the more disappointing, especially when I thought I&#x27;d bought a hairbrush with the quality that meant it would last.</li>
    <li> Denman&#x27;s are the best brushes . The Black Paddle brush works well with my fine hair, the heavy brushes work well with my mother and sister&#x27;s thicker and coarser hair. I have paid $40 for a Denman and a beauty supply store.. small price to pay for a brush that lasted me 16+ years - and I still have it as a back up. lol</li>
    <li> I have very long, very thick brown hair and when I find a good brush I use it for a good 5 or more years.  The one I bought last (about a year ago) is just so painful on my head.  I used this brush for the first time today and it felt sooooo wonderful after having used the other for a year.  I can&#x27;t speak on how well it&#x27;s gonna hold up but I love it so far!  It goes so smoothly through my thick, long hair!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great paddle brush and I prefer to use it when my hair is flat ironed. The ball tipped pins are comfortable, dont tangle in my hair, and dont come off either. This is a great brush and yes I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush to sadly replace my 12 year old Denman paddle brush that finally wore out.  Based on the photos and description, it appeared to be the same large, Denman paddle brush that I had been using forever.  Once I opened the package I knew it was cheaply made, as it was lighter weight and the handle was not as heavy.  The plastic pins kept snagging my hair, again unlike my original Denman, leading me to believe it was just made differently.  The telltale sign was one use with a blow dryer and almost 1/3 of the pins warped and melted to the side.  I had never had this happen to my previous Denman brush or any other brush for that matter.  I am actually returning this to Amazon as the quality is so poor I&#x27;m going to try and find a new paddle brush.  Save your money and look elsewhere for a better quality brush.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse, curly hair. I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of product lately - mostly that mean for kinky/curly hair (I&#x27;m Caucasian), but my hair was still going a little &amp;#34;dready&amp;#34; if I didn&#x27;t comb it daily. This brush is awesome. I start at the ends and work my way up. Hardly any pulling or breaking. (I brush in the shower with conditioner.)</li>
    <li> I have had problems with sporadic &#x27;bird nest&#x27; knots in my hair for the longest time, but this brush really gets out all of the knots with little pain. Great brush!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this brush. I used it once and several of the plastic pins fell out. Very disappointing that I wasted money on this product.</li>
    <li> I have another Denman brush that I have had for years which is why I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to get a new one, however, the one I received seems to be faulty.&lt;br /&gt;There is an air pocket from the back of the bristles to the paddle that prevents me from getting good control over&lt;br /&gt;brushing my hair. It makes an air bubble noise too.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it once and would like to return it!</li>
    <li> We just bought this assuming it was Denman quality, but it seemed identical to my daughter&#x27;s cheap novelty-pattern China-made equivalent paddle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent it back to Amazon and thank goodness for their great return policy.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush because one of my good friends had it and I really wanted to steal it and she wouldn&#x27;t let me. But if your hair is not to nappy like mine this brush is perfect!</li>
    <li> denman is the best brush out there.</li>
    <li> Now I know why my hairdresser uses this brush.  it&#x27;s great and I am disappointed in myself that I waited so long to find online and purchase.  Hair looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Awesome,,,,I had my first one for 12 years,,,,,,,,,,,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this brush for ten years. My old one is still hanging tough, but is missing a bristle or two, and has a curling iron melt in the handle. Lol. Super happy to have found a new one 😀</li>
    <li> Love this Denman Paddle Brush.....After months of use it still looks Brand New... Great for Blowing out curly hair before flat ironing.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on paddle brushes and a majority of websites recommended this product over others. I didn&#x27;t think i&#x27;d notice much difference between this and any other paddle brush I&#x27;ve used (regular amount throughout my life - I&#x27;m 25), but this one actually felt different. I can&#x27;t pinpoint why, but it just feels superior and appears to do a better job than the competition in its price range.  I&#x27;ve never tried a more expensive paddle brush but i can&#x27;t imagine one being particularly better than this one.</li>
    <li> I have medium-thick, medium-wavy, mid-back length hair. Due to the gentleness of this brush, I have never felt the need to start at the bottom and work my way up when brushing. (I like to drive with my hair down and my windows open!) I bought it on a whim over 10 years ago and haven&#x27;t found a brush I liked as well before or since. This brush has just the right amount of cushion and scalp massaging. Even after my hair is thoroughly untangled I take a few more swipes just because it feels so nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this brush both my boyfriend and mother decided they had to have one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s plastic and has a cheap look. Years ago I tried looking for something that looks a little nicer but has a similar feel to the cushion and bristles. I couldn&#x27;t find a brush that compared and I&#x27;m not willing to trade the great comfort of this brush for something that just looks nicer.</li>
    <li> The brush has soft bristles that do not snag my fragile hair.  The handle is strong and the base was to clean. It shoud last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush ever its great for wet hair and sesitive heads I will never go back to using any other brush.</li>
    <li> I have been using this bran brush for as long as I can remember. This was the second time I have bought this exact brush. Wanted one for my gym bag as well as home. Lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now, and I must say I am extremely contented with my purchase. This brush works really well with my afro-kinky hair. The brush is also really light. I shall be sticking with Denman!</li>
    <li> This  brush is good for my relative because of the length of her hair and it&#x27;s volume,She would give as a gift</li>
    <li> Like it&lt;br /&gt;A must have for any girl&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t get dirty, no matter how much dirt in your hair&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> The name says it all. love it.</li>
    <li> My whole family now has one of these, we love them.</li>
    <li> Good for medium to thick hair. If only I know where this one is. This is why I bought two more Denmans.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about it, it&#x27;s just a great brush and of great quality. I have long hair and it works well for me.</li>
