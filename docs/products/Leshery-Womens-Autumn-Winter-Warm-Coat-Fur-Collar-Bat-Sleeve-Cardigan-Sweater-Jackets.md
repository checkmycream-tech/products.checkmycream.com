    <li> I was really disappointed!! The fur is stiched on so badly that you can see the edge and it looks VERY VERY CHEAP!!&lt;br /&gt;I guess you really do get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Looks great in picture but when I received it and tried it on the sleeves are way short more like 3/4 length and the fur not as full as the picture and it comes off when touched.</li>
    <li> Good design and quality but doesn&#x27;t have tickets</li>
    <li> Want to say that the item shown is nowhere near the item revived. The sweater is only waist long and the sleeves are way short. It&#x27;s more like a small t-shirt. The fur is glued on very badly. The pattern seen is not the pattern shown. I emplore people to skip this. It&#x27;s just a piece of crap. I tried uploading a picture but it won&#x27;t let me. Go figure. If I could if give it zero stars.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  Looks like it has been washed and shank to fit a 6 year old.  Definetly not what the description and picture defines.  The fur on the collar also coming out when I opened the package.  It also had a dime size hole in the left back shoulder.  Seller refused to give me a refund and would not take it back.  Amazon is working on the claim.</li>
    <li> SHORTER THAN THE POTO , HAVE BAD SMELL FROM THE FACTORY</li>
    <li> Did not like this product, was not as long as shown in the picture. Also the faux fur came off in patches. I would not recommend this to anyone. The fit was much smaller than it said.</li>
    <li> NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE VERY SHORT AND UGLY FUR. ALSO NOT BROWN MORE LIKE A WHITE COLOR. DONT MAKE THE PURCHASE IF UR LOOKING FOR THIS EXACT SWEATER</li>
    <li> Nice design but too small for the size could have bigger size to fit</li>
    <li> Sleeves are not long enough. And its not long enough in the back. Other then that nice color.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t worn yet, however, very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is Not a woman&#x27;s sweater. It was a small girls and cheaply made. Total waste of my money. Picture is very devious.</li>
    <li> Beautiful winter coat</li>
    <li> The sweater that I received looks and fits nothing like it is pictured.  It barely reaches my waist.  The &amp;#34;fur&amp;#34; sheds.  The sleeves are to short.  There should be a rule against false advertising on this site.  It would cost to much to return.  This is a total loss for me.  DO NOT PURCHASE IS ITEM.  IT IS A BIG RIP OFF!!!</li>
    <li> cheap material...  never buy this. It&#x27;s an ugly version what they mail you.</li>
    <li> Thought I was receiving the exact same product as pictured......but instead I received a Shrug. It barely came to my waist. Overall I still like the styling of it.....but I will never order anything again coming from China.</li>
    <li> Way smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than the pic shows.  Fur is falling out.  Cheaply made</li>
    <li> This thing is awful. Short, poorly made, not at all the same shape.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the picture! Actually it looks chopped in half . It&#x27;s more like a half sweater it&#x27;s not long and looks extremely small. I don&#x27;t like this seller</li>
    <li> This sweater did not fit as expected. Its cut very small</li>
    <li> It is nice but not as expected !</li>
    <li> Hate this stupid child size sweater if you are a size zero yeah m/l , do not order</li>
    <li> This sweater had a very bad smell on it. It also felt wet ,like of the sweater sat on water.. Nice sweater but I had to get rid of it...</li>
    <li> In the picture it showes a longer sweater its waist short and adorable, shipping was ridiculous high and after paying high shipping it took forever getting here</li>
    <li> It is much smaller than it shows in the picture.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was pictured and a lovely fit.</li>
    <li> Unless this model is 4 foot 2, this sweater fits NOTHING like the photo.  IT hits at waist level or a bit lower.  On this model, it&#x27;s at her mid thigh.  if you buy it, realize it is a cropped sweater.</li>
    <li> Poor quality-cheap looking- disappointed, but now have learned lesson;( would never recommend!</li>
    <li> IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT I ORDERED, HOWEVER IT WOULD ONLY FIT A SMALL CHILD.&lt;br /&gt;TGHE MINI VERSION IS NICE, BUT I WILL BE SENDING IT BACK !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> runs very small and the fur is out on poorly</li>
    <li> This was a waste of my money, time, and thought.  Good it&#x27;s not available anymore.  Keeps the next person from being made a fool of.  This won&#x27;t happen to me again.  It could have been used to wrap a baby in but it&#x27;s too hard.  Someone else said it&#x27;s a piece of crap and I agree.</li>
    <li> I finally received it and it is nt sized correctly and it smelled terrible. I sent it to be cleaned and the faux fur came off!  My cleaner reattached it for me. I don&#x27;t recommend this item at all!!!</li>
    <li> It´s horrible, too short, Cheaply made, It´s not same to the picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Very short, not. Long like the pic. The fur lining came off pretty easy and it stunk from the packaging. Also not sure how to wash it... haven&#x27;t worn it once. Hope this saves you some money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disaponted.it&#x27;s small than it&#x27;s discribed and fur comes on clothes</li>
    <li> Took almost a month to get here! Sheds pretty bad but very attractive end received multiple compliments.  Perfect to wear as an outfit and yet keeps you warm in the fall or spring.  Wore for my sisters bachelorette party around NYC where we did a lot of walking in brisk temperatures</li>
    <li> It looks pretty much like the picture. The &amp;#34;fur&amp;#34; collar sheds on everything you wear it with. Also, it took about a month to get this product. I will not be ordering from this company in the future.</li>
    <li> I should have read the customer reviews section .... this is the worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made online!!!!</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail and it is not at all as what the picture shows.  It is super super short, the fur looks like road kill that was left for months.  I would not recommend this to anyone, the picture shows it coming down below the hips and this fits like a bolero jacket.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all bought a large size and it really really small can&#x27;t west it</li>
