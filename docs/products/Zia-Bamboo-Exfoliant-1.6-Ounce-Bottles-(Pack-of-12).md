      <li>results are very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>It smells great.  </li>
      <li>While the scent of this exfoiliant smells great, the feeling on my face after I&#x27;ve used it does not.</li>

      <li>As I was applying, it felt great.  </li>

      <li>It has a fine texture like Creme de la Mer exfoliant at a fraction of the cost.</li>

      <li>I have pretty good skin, next to no zits, no lines, good color, etc.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great size and travels easily, snaps shut properly (you&#x27;d be amazed at the amount of beauty products that don&#x27;t!)</li>
      <li>, I have to say I really enjoy using the Zia Skin Basics Bamboo Exfoliant.  </li>
      <li>so it is important that it be convenient to use</li>
      <li>It is a natural product and cleans fairly well, though I didn&#x27;t find it to be anything ultra-special.</li>
      <li>There was no \\&quot;sting\\&quot; to it, which was surprising, and nothing to irritate sensitive skin or cause a break out.</li>

      <li>I absolutely love skin care products, and this was my first intro to the Zia line.</li>
      <li>The product rinses off cleanly</li>
      <li>It has a fresh, clean smell and you don&#x27;t need to apply much, added with warm water.  </li>
      <li>My only caveat is that I think this would be great for teenagers/younger skins,  but a bit too strong for more mature skins -</li>
      <li>On a wet face, the pleasant, tickling grittiness in the product gently scrubs away surface grime leaving a nice, refreshed feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not a bad product.  </li>
      <li>The face feels stimulated yet clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>The smell is fresh, clean and citrusy, not perfumed and overpowering.</li>
      <li>It felt like mild sandpaper moving across my face.</li>
      <li>One thing I really like is finding good products with natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I have stopped using such products, and was very excited to be able to try this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I liked this product for a facial wash.  </li>
      <li>While the product was effective at exfoliating, I would not use this as a daily scrub.  </li>
      <li>While she liked the smell of the product, she told me it was too gritty and that it burned her skin.</li>
      <li>For women with normal, hearty skin, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product - all others, proceed at your own risk!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as rough as an apricot style scrub, however, so if you&#x27;re looking for something gentler than that, this may be a good option for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I found the exfoliating beads to provide just to right amount of abrasion as well.</li>
      <li>This just isn&#x27;t the right exfoiliant for my face.</li>
      <li>fragrance is very light- barely noticeable.  </li>
      <li>should you be meticulously careful not to get this in the eyes, but make sure that you thoroughly clean off your hands and fingers before you rub your eyes, or the granules in the cleanser could cause irritation and damage if you are not careful.areful not to get this in the eyes, but make sure that you thoroughly clean off your hands and fingers before you rub your eyes, or the granules in the cleanser could cause irritation and damage if you are not careful.</li>

      <li>It is rather manly, because of the gritty substance which produces the exfoliating effect (and it smells much better than Lava soap.  </li>

      <li>everywhere else-I was interested to see if this product could help the flakiness while NOT inflaming the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used facial scrubs from time to time, and enjoyed softer skin because of it, however this is the first time that I&#x27;ve noticed getting a smoother face \\&quot;after\\&quot; shaving.  </li>
      <li>I have used a lot of similar products and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>The 1.6 ounce size also makes it convenient to carry with you when you want more than the standard cleaning that soap provides.</li>

      <li>I have used a medium fine grind of rice flour before which behaves and feels similar to the granules in this product-</li>
      <li>they are quite fine- similar in feel to sand as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It left my face feeling smooth, a bit dry, and very clean.  </li>
      <li>It also has a light floral/herb fragrance mixed in, but again, it is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The cleanser in it is really  gentle and leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product has a very pleasant smell and does a good job exfoliating dry skin.  However, the particle size of the exfoliating grains was too large leading to a uncomfortable feeling while rubbing the product on the face for the suggested period of time.  The product also required more rinsing than I have needed to do with other comparable products.  While the product was effective at exfoliating, I would not use this as a daily scrub.  Nor would I be very likely to choose it over a product containing a gentler exfoliating element.</li>
    <li> I found myself reaching for this scrub over and over. It has a good amount of \\&quot;grit\\&quot; in it and gives your skin a nice polish without any sharp sharp bits at all. The cleanser in it is really  gentle and leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh. There was no \\&quot;sting\\&quot; to it, which was surprising, and nothing to irritate sensitive skin or cause a break out. Of the scrubs on the market - and I&#x27;ve tried most of them - this is one of my favorites. I&#x27;ll be keeping this one on hand for regular use. A natural product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it very well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> One wonders what an exfoliant would have to do to earn five stars?&lt;br /&gt;I must confess that I gave this a four-star review because I am so loathe to giving five.  I mean, one never knows, the next one might give a massage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that lame opening (for which I beg your pardon), I have to say I really enjoy using the Zia Skin Basics Bamboo Exfoliant.  It is simple to use, and a little dab will do.  On a wet face, the pleasant, tickling grittiness in the product gently scrubs away surface grime leaving a nice, refreshed feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the few weeks I&#x27;ve used the product, I&#x27;ve noticed much smoother skin.  It does a great job without harshness and the slight scent of &#x60;green&#x27; is great too!  Unconditional recommendation.</li>
    <li> Zia Skin Basics Bamboo Exfoliant is not a bad little product. It&#x27;s quite refreshing to scrub the sandy mixture into your pores and feel them becoming unclogged, not only from dirt and other atmosperic threats, but from the residue that many soaps seem to leave behind. The 1.6 ounce size also makes it convenient to carry with you when you want more than the standard cleaning that soap provides. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> In a field full of oft over-hyped products, it&#x27;s refreshing to find a product that is both natural AND works well.  As advertised, my skin felt soft and fresh afterwards even before moisturizing, and the product was quick to apply and rub into my face.  It smells good during use, too (lemony).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:  It&#x27;s pretty \\&quot;grainy\\&quot; for a face-scrub, those of you with sensitive or dry skin probably want to go more for the 2 times a week rather than 4 (the directions say 2-4 times a week).</li>
    <li> I was impressed at how well this exfoliant left my skin looking smooth and clear.  I think it would be nice if the grit on the largest chunks of bamboo were a bit smaller as I think that would reduce the initial irritation after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also rinses away very easily which is something not all exfoliants do.  They recommend use 3-4 times a week so it is important that it be convenient to use and it is.  However, each bottle is very small and you may go through a bottle a week if you do, for example, your face and arms 3-4 times a week.  if you just do your face then it will obviously last longer.</li>
    <li> A lot of men might ignore a product like this (for any number of reasons), however they should consider that they too can benefit from regular use of something like the Zia Skin Basics Bamboo Exfoliant.  Why?  Because it works... and it will give you healthier skin that supports a much better shave.  Yep, that right a better, closer shave.    I&#x27;ve used facial scrubs from time to time, and enjoyed softer skin because of it, however this is the first time that I&#x27;ve noticed getting a smoother face \\&quot;after\\&quot; shaving.  Perhaps the Zia Skin Basics just does a better job of removing dead surface cells without damaging the underlying skin. I do know that it does (at least in my case) a far better job of hydrating my skin than other exfolients, and that previous list has included all sorts of pumice, peach pit, and other organic ingredient collections that come straight from the new-age metrosexual recipe book.    Maybe it&#x27;s the bamboo fibers that do the exfoliation.  But I do know that the soybean Oil, rice bran and yucca extract combination definitely leaves my face and cheeks feeling much smoother and refreshed.  I&#x27;m still using the same razor I&#x27;ve had for a few months now, the [[ASIN:B0014N0MFK PHILIPS NORELCO razor arcitec 1090XD]] (and I&#x27;m still very happy with that product by the way)... but with cleaner softer skin to work with, I&#x27;m even happier with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve explained my credentials in the following review [[ASIN:B000TH5PLI Almay Smart Shade Blush, Pink 010, 0.5-Ounces (Pack of 2)]], but to summarize I actually listened to former wives as they explained health and beauty issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to unclog pores, refresh my face, and to let my skin breathe again.  I became caught up in collegiate life, and neglected my routines for a while.  Women know that you cannot neglect routines....but when routines are set aside, due to jobs or stress, products such as this can get us back on track!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, and used this product on my face and shoulders.  A dab of the product \\&quot;goes a long way,\\&quot; and a little more water extends the dab used.  Obviously, you must be careful, because the product is gritty.  However, Zia Skin Basics Bamboo Exfoliant cleanses the skin, unclogs pores, and generally makes the skin feel fresh and refreshed.  I have used various exfoliants in the past, but none had the fragrant scent and feeling created by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men are accustomed to using [[ASIN:B000JECC5S Lava Hand Soap - Bar]] and [[ASIN:B00009RA22 Lava Heavy-Duty Hand Cleaner with Moisturizers 5.75 oz (163 g)]], yet they would probably not be caught with this product.  So....hide it, or tell people that your wife made you use it.  It is rather manly, because of the gritty substance which produces the exfoliating effect (and it smells much better than Lava soap.  ;-)  However, women will love the delicate aspects, fragrance, and soothing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teenagers definitely need this product; too many soft drinks cause skin blemishes.  Drink water, and use this exfoliant to avoid the pimples, blackheads, and other skin related issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used many other products, including smelly cleansing pads, I prefer this exfoliant to prior products that I have experimented with. I will certainly be purchasing more Zia Skin Basics Bamboo Exfoliant in the future.</li>
    <li> If you travel a lot for work as I do, this Zia product comes in very handy for packing, and exfoliating to get rid of that airplane feeling. Feels cleansing without stripping.</li>
    <li> Winter is always tricky in new york and a good exfoliator is neccessary.  I liked this one,  in that it does everything it says it will, and a small amount goes a long way.  My only caveat is that I think this would be great for teenagers/younger skins,  but a bit too strong for more mature skins - I wouldn&#x27;t give this to my mother.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great size and travels easily, snaps shut properly (you&#x27;d be amazed at the amount of beauty products that don&#x27;t!)</li>
    <li> This is a fairly nice facial scrub that cleans well without any harsh odor. It is a natural product and cleans fairly well, though I didn&#x27;t find it to be anything ultra-special. Unfortunately, this product is no longer available on Amazon, but perhaps you could still find it in a store or elsewhere online.</li>
    <li> Zia Bamboo Exfoliant is a superb product for your skin, and will bring it back to life after the dryness of heated buildings during the cold weather. I am also a good test subject, as I have ridiculously sensitive skin, and usually find exfoliants irritating; Zia on the other hand left my skin radiant (yes, even my old 63 year old skin!), soft, and after applying a light moisturizer, there wasn&#x27;t even a hint of tightness or dryness, as there would be with many other products. Zia&#x27;s secret must be the combination of oils used with its Bamboo Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma alone deserves 5 stars, with it&#x27;s lemon zesty overtones as one massages the grainy cream on to one&#x27;s skin. Using Zia&#x27;s Bamboo Exfoliant is a treat, and just what this gal needed to get ready for the warmer weather. My face feels renewed, and I look younger...and not half bad just with moisturizer and lipstick on. Handy easy-to-use 1.6 oz plastic container with press-top dispenser is also a nice travel size. Give your skin a break, with Zia&#x27;s Bamboo Exfoliant. Your face will thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got super sensitive skin to the point where almost anything I use will break my face out.  I was a little worried about trying this product for just that reason.  I&#x27;m happy to say that I had no problems with the Zia Exfoliant.  It&#x27;s quick &amp; easy to use &amp; it rinses off nicely leaving your face &amp; skin feeling refreshed.  Another thing that&#x27;s nice is that a little bit goes along while, so even just getting a little bottle should last you for quite some time.  You&#x27;re supposed to leave it on for between 30 &amp; 60 seconds &amp; after around 45 seconds I could feel a slight (by no means excrutiating, so don&#x27;t get freaked out) burning/tingling sensation, so be mindful of that when you apply it.  I look at that as it actually working though, it&#x27;s nice to actually notice something when trying something new.  In the end I would highly recommend this for anyone in the market for this kind of product especially those with sesitive skin such as myself, enjoy:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not foamy and the &#x27;grit&#x27; is much smaller than most exfoliants which use stuff like crushed nutshells and whatnot.  At about $3.50 per (little) container, it&#x27;s actually a pretty fair price.  My one bottle has lasted over two weeks, and my fresh feels fresh and clean after using - not soapy or dried out.  I can&#x27;t imagine wanting to buy a pack of twelve, but that&#x27;s me.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product feels, and using it in the shower it gives me that real deep clean feel.  I don&#x27;t think that I have used it often enough, yet, to see any real results.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to see that the ZIA BAMBOO EXFOLIANT cleanser does not have Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in it.  I have stopped using such products, and was very excited to be able to try this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looks very small and is deceiving.  A tiny little bit is needed for good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very light- barely noticeable.  I can smell the lovely ylang ylang oil lightly in this cleanser.  It also has a light floral/herb fragrance mixed in, but again, it is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for two weeks now- only twice a week.  I do not like to exfoliate often- I just don&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser does not foam up, rather it is like a very lightweight cream with little beads of ground up rice in it.  I am not sure if that is what the granules actually ARE, but they act like it on the face.  I have used a medium fine grind of rice flour before which behaves and feels similar to the granules in this product- they are quite fine- similar in feel to sand as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is not to rub this heavily into the skin, or it will cause irritation.  I wet my face, and gently rubbed the ZIA exfoliant into the skin in little round motions around my face for about 1-2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are very pleasant.  The face feels stimulated yet clean and fresh.  Once I rinsed it off, my skin had a nice glow- probably from the stimulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I finished, I let my skin sit for 5 minutes and then applied a natural toner from Aubrey Organics (rosa masqueta) and then applied my natural based night cream from Lamas Beauty Vitamin C line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this ZIA Skin Basics Bamboo Exfoliant very much and would consider a future purchase once this is gone.  My skin looks very nice and feels great too.  I highly recommend this cleanser due to its natural contents which gives very good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION- AVOID EYES- not only should you be meticulously careful not to get this in the eyes, but make sure that you thoroughly clean off your hands and fingers before you rub your eyes, or the granules in the cleanser could cause irritation and damage if you are not careful.areful not to get this in the eyes, but make sure that you thoroughly clean off your hands and fingers before you rub your eyes, or the granules in the cleanser could cause irritation and damage if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter to use. She is a competitive swimmer, and has to be careful about what she uses. While she liked the smell of the product, she told me it was too gritty and that it burned her skin. She used it three times, and had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, all faces are different and no one product will work well for all. She ended up giving the remainder of the bottle to another girl on the swim team that loves it. It really comes down to a matter of choice and your skin. Some may like, others may not but the only way to tell is to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have to be careful when using products such as this because I have roseacea and exfoliants can sometimes irritate my skin. This one turned out to be a pleasant surprise. It leaves your face feeling clean and smooth without an oily or dry feeling. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of exfoliants over the years, and this is by far the best I have ever used.  A little bit goes a long way.  It is effective yet gentle and rinses cleanly and quickly.  You can really feel the difference, and it does not leave a residue on your skin.  It is a clean, ultra fine texutred, effective exfoliant.</li>
    <li> One thing I really like is finding good products with natural ingredients. This exfoliant doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals and the ingredients are natural and gentle. I have combination skin and I definitely felt like my skin was much smoother with less dry, rough spot in the areas that are dry and less dull oiliness in the oily areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did feel like the grits were a little rougher than I would have liked which is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five. I tend to like very gentle exfoliating grits, as opposed to larger ones. It&#x27;s not as rough as an apricot style scrub, however, so if you&#x27;re looking for something gentler than that, this may be a good option for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really liked the mild scent and the small travel size bottle.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product.  The first few times I used it, this exfoliant burned a little bit, but it left my skin looking pretty good for someone my age.</li>
    <li> While the scent of this exfoiliant smells great, the feeling on my face after I&#x27;ve used it does not. I&#x27;ve tried this a few times before handing the remainder over to my sister. It feels great when I wash my face with it but it leaves my face feeling like a [[ASIN:B000KI1Z60 Trojan Condom]]. My face felt latexy (if that is even a word). This just isn&#x27;t the right exfoiliant for my face.</li>
    <li> I liked this product for a facial wash.  It only takes a small amount and you can really feel it working.  It is like sandpaper on your face but then I am not used to real true exfoliants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my face feeling smooth, a bit dry, and very clean.  I applied my usual facisal cream afterwards and was good to go.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to use exfoliants.  It has a fresh, clean smell and you don&#x27;t need to apply much, added with warm water.  I agree with another who thought applying while in the shower would be good because of the steam.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best exfoliant that I have used.  It left my skin feeling fresh and clean.  It really removed dead skin and dryness.  It smells great.  It was very invigorating.  I highly recommend this product.  I have used a lot of similar products and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> ----Just a note - this review was actually done by my wife----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly what it says it is.  I have used this product now twice at night.  I applied it with the palm of my hands to my face and rubbed in a circular motion for about 30 seconds.  As I was applying, it felt great.  As I rubbed gently I felt a subtle stinging that assured me that is was doing its job.  The fragrance is very mild and pleasant.  It smells natural.  Once I washed my face with warm water, my face felt refreshed.  My face was not overly dry, but I do recommend applying a night cream or moisturizer after application.  Just a quick side note, although this is a facial exfoliate I also used this on my legs before shaving.  Afterwards my legs felt even smoother and I was able to get a better shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once thing that I would like to point out, which is not on the website, is that with every purchase Zia plants trees with American Forests Global ReLeaf Project.  So as spoil yourself you are doing good for the environment</li>
    <li> I give this product four stars for the instant softness it gave my skin. And also for revealing a fresh, new lively looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has a dull looking complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly found this to be an excellent skin exfoliant and will highly recommend its use to anyone needing this.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both tried out this product and loved it.  It has a fine texture like Creme de la Mer exfoliant at a fraction of the cost. Very simply put, those looking for a very gentle product at a reasonable price will like this one.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love skin care products, and this was my first intro to the Zia line. I have pretty good skin, next to no zits, no lines, good color, etc. My skin is also pretty hearty, so I can probably take \\&quot;tougher\\&quot; skin care methods than anyone with any kind of skin sensitivity.    In other words, if a product makes me break out, it would probably do the same or worse to 99 percent of users.    Having said that, I often find myself disappointed at a lot of skin care lines, simply because they try so hard to be so many things to so many women that they have little to no visible results.    That is NOT the case with the Zia Bamboo Exfoliant. If you have just been washing your face and not doing anything special to it for a few weeks, and then use this product for a minute or so, I guarantee you WILL have nicely pink, exfoliated skin when you&#x27;re done.    They send you a dozen of the 1.6 ounce bottles; I can tell you it will last you a GOOD long time! I use a very small amount, maybe the size of a dime, and it was way more than enough.    Wet your face, put a small dollop on your fingers, and start scrubbing. The exfoliant has a nice earthy smell; the exfoliant scrubbies aren&#x27;t miniscule. They&#x27;re a good size, and with very little effort, you can do some serious exfoliating quickly.    The product rinses off cleanly (I used a wet washcloth to speed things up, then splashed with cool water.) Very nice, toned, and pink skin in less than two minutes!    I would definitely consider more items from this skin care line, and I&#x27;d definitely like a few more of the exfoliant! This is probably the fastest exfoliant I&#x27;ve used with the most pleasantly visible results!    One warning, though: if your skin is at all sensitive, I&#x27;d definitely go slow with this product. You will get results, but if you&#x27;re too dedicated in the scrubbing, you may get more pink skin than you bargained for! As I said, my skin&#x27;s pretty tough, so it&#x27;s unusual for me to get a bad reaction from a skin care product. If that doesn&#x27;t characterize your skin, do NOT be aggressive with this product!     For women with normal, hearty skin, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product - all others, proceed at your own risk!</li>
    <li> As someone with Roseacea -a sensitive skin condition characterized by red, inflamed skin on nose, cheeks and chin, but dry, flaky skin everywhere else-I was interested to see if this product could help the flakiness while NOT inflaming the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying for a week, using the 4 times that week as suggested on the product-I DID see a noticeable improvement with my dryness and flakiness, and it didn&#x27;t aggravate the reddened area either.  The price-at around $3.50 a bottle is very reasonable-though I don&#x27;t see where the average consumer would want 12 bottles at once-perhaps several people can share an order?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The smell is light and inoffensive-nondescript enough for even use on a man or teenage boy. I did like that the granules were tiny, as I&#x27;ve tried others with larger bits that has hurt:( While it did seem a little difficult to wash off, I&#x27;ll admit I was using a wet cloth as I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;splash water in my face\\&quot; kinda chick-and that method may yield better results..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So all in all, this sensitive skin reviewer would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars.</li>
    <li> I found this to be quite a nice and effective exfoliant. The refreshing lemon scent and the fact that it left my skin slightly dry might make it a better choice for summer, at least for my skin, but it worked quite well to buff off that dead surface skin of winter. A small amount of this product (nickel sized) seems to be adequate, so a small bottle should seemingly last quite a while. I found the exfoliating beads to provide just to right amount of abrasion as well. Beyond the drying factor, which is not too extreme, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive \\&quot;combination\\&quot; skin that is prone to eczema outbreaks, so I have to be very careful about the products I use on it, especially my face.  The first time I used this exfoliant, my skin was left feeling softer than I remember any other product making it feel. The added bonus was that there was no redness or irritation and no outbreak of eczema that often happens when I use facial cleansing/exfoliating products.  I was very pleased to find a product I could use that would make my skin softer without irritating it.</li>
    <li> This has a very pleasant scent and it does what it is supposed to- exfoliate your skin. But some may find it a bit harsh if their skin is sensitive. The texture is rather course. I didn&#x27;t have any problem but if you have sensitive skin you may not want to use this on your face.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that this product has some good qualities. The smell is fresh, clean and citrusy, not perfumed and overpowering. Second, it is easy to use and inexpensive. You need very little of the product for a treatment.  On the other side, this is not a good product for sensitive skin. Most exfoliants rely on acid peel or grainy texture to remove dead surface cells. Some products I&#x27;ve tried use the grain texture, but it is so fine in texture that you don&#x27;t notice it.  That is not the case with this one. It felt like mild sandpaper moving across my face. I found it uncomfortable to use it for the full one minute.  After the treatment, my face was quite red and blotchy for more than a half hour, so I would never use it right before leaving the house in the morning.  As far as change in a appearance,  my pores were slightly cleaner, but the results I got using the Neutrogena clean pore treatment were far superior without the harshness or discomfort.  If you like rough and grainy, go for it.  If you have sensitive skin, try Neutrogena.</li>
