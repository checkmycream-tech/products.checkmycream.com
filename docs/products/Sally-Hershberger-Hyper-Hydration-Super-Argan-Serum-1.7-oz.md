<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is great!  I have relaxed African American hair and I use it on my hair and weave hair.  Not only does it protect from heat, but does not leave a greasy or sticky residue!  I am on my second bottle!</li>
    <li> I love all of Sally Hershberger hair products; would buy again and again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and I&#x27;ve had to wash my hair sooner after every application. Giving it one more try and if this continues it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> This product is THE BOMB!  Holy crap ladies. It&#x27;s long, but read up!  I have very fine natural blonde hair that goes past the middle of my back in length.  this means, for those who don&#x27;t know what natural blonde hair is like, that I have horribly split ends.  I do not EVERY blow dry, straighten or curl my hair.  I wait at least two days between washes and leave in cream rinse.  Yet, I still have split ends.  NOW - with this incredible product, i squeeze a few pumping into my hands and crunch it onto the ends of my hair, then another few pumps from shoulder down on top of my hair to give it shine.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months, and am only a third of the way through the bottle.  Other products left a residue and made me hair crunchy, greasy, or sticky after a day or two (told ya, i don&#x27;t wash it :P).  Not this!  My hair seriously just gets SOFTER and more manageable over days with the product in.  Not a bad smell either!!!  Also, after its only my hands, i rub it into my knuckles and it softens my hands :)</li>
    <li> I got this and it works - but I don&#x27;t see where it was anything special.  IT works,  But it didn&#x27;t feel like it worked any better or worse than any of the other oil based serum&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s not as heavy as say the Organix version, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Hmm I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this product. The smell is okay but I don&#x27;t feel is does anything amazing with my hair. I&#x27;ve put it on my dry, curly hair a couple of times and don&#x27;t really see a difference. When I plan on straightening my hair, I want to use it then. I will come back and update my review when I do it.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING. Cheaper than in stores. Keeps my frizz to a bare minimum. A little goes a long way with this serum. DON&#x27;T WAIT, BUY IT!! YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT!!</li>
    <li> Nice and soft for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Works great. It helps allot with frizz and make hair nice and soft. Very light&lt;br /&gt;It works great on frizzy hair</li>
    <li> I swim and this serum keeps my hair moisturized.  I was surprised how well it work. I significant change in three days.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Softens your hair just as oil should, without leaving it greasy! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It smells great and works great to manage dry and frizzy hair. It is beneficial for dry frizzy hair for sure.</li>
    <li> I like that this product works so well, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about adverse effects on my color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> This product adds so much shine with no build up. It is not greasy, and works well for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I give this serum 5 stars, but if I could I would give it more stars.  It is just amazing!  I got it in the mail several days ago, but I didn&#x27;t get to use it until today and I am just so glad I ordered it.  My hair is really damaged from coloring it and from flat ironing it so much and I have purchased so many different products and I thought why not try this one.  I applied it right after flat ironing my hair and my hair felt so smooth instantly and frizz-free.  I love the smell too!  It smells great!  I truly recommend this serum!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month. I can say it does keep the frizz down,  adds moisture to dry hair ,it is not heavy and smells nice.</li>
    <li> My daughter has gotten my husband&#x27;s course hair.  In certain places it actually looks like straw.  I tried a few different products to see if I could get her hair a little softer and easier to manage and this product did wonders.  I&#x27;m sure if I used it more than once a week it might help even more.  The straw pieces are still there, but not as noticeable, and the overall smoothness and silkiness of her hair it really helped with.  It even smells really good.</li>
    <li> Love the way it leaves my hair, soft, and my curls are more controlled without the frizz. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I have thick course hair and have tried everything this really works for me I  have told severla co-workers of mine ant they have purchased it also. Thank you for this great product</li>
    <li> Bought this product not really thinking it would do what they said.  Well Boy was I wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to use, you only need a little bit but you get Huge Results.  My hair has never been this shiny, soft, the ends don&#x27;t look frizzy because they aren&#x27;t!!</li>
    <li> This was a great product &amp; highly recommended. I love Sally Hershberger hair products. I watched her on Nate Berkus show &amp; that&#x27;s where I found out about her products.</li>
