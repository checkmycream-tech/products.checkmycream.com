      <li>The product soaked in my skin and felt soft and smooth.</li>

      <li>large bottle.</li>
      <li>I had been using Josie Maran&#x27;s cuticle oil, which says it is pure argan oil, and my nails and cuticles</li>
      <li>Save yourself 75% of the money and buy 100% pure argan from a brand that doesn&#x27;t obnoxiously inflate their prices just because a models name is on the bottle.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t always stick with a whole line of products-</li>
      <li>After much fluctuation, I just received it on December 28, 2013.&lt;br</li>

      <li>My husband uses it as a moisturizer since it absorbs very well.</li>
      <li>I then put my other products on top.</li>

      <li>highly recommend this all-purpose oil.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Too much money to think it&#x27;s old, when it is a cosmetic.</li>

      <li>I found Glonaturals organic argan oil, $15 for the same size bottle and the exact same 100% organic argan oil.  </li>
      <li>Originally I bought the small dropper bottle for traveling.  </li>
      <li>When I wake up in the morning, my face feels fresh and moisturized, not dry and tight or greasy.  </li>
      <li>After trying two small trial size bottles, I&#x27;ve just bought a super size four oz.</li>

<li> I see a aesthetician every month and have seen a few dermatologists in my time.  </li>
<li> if weather is very dry, I use it a very small amount to take the frizz out, and it works wonders.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After trying two small trial size bottles, I&#x27;ve just bought a super size four oz. large bottle. Elbows are softer in one use. Eyes feel fresher after one use and believe it or not a issue with a blemish on my chest seems to be healing. I would recommend however use it very sparingly. Its amazing stuff. Try it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is my secret beauty weapon.  After my boyfriend noticed the improvements in my skin ( especially around the eyes), he started using it.  Don&#x27;t let the fact that it is an oil scare you- it is lightweight and won&#x27;t clog your pores.  Totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> I received this from a friend at Christmas. I am 49yrs old and always willing to try new products to help my aging skin. I love this oil. I have been using it on my face as a base moisturizer. It absorbs very quickly and has my skin feeling so soft and smooth. I then put my other products on top. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight from dryness but so subtle.  I also have put a couple drops in my hands, rub together and massage into my wet hair after washing. My hair which is a bit frizzy as it is aging, is smooth and silkier. I highly recommend this product. There are so many great uses for this product and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite Argan Oil I&#x27;ve tried to date.  My face soaks it up.  When I wake up in the morning, my face feels fresh and moisturized, not dry and tight or greasy.  I only use it on my face, to me it is too expensive to use on my hair or body.  Love the way it makes my skin feel and I do not notice any scent at all.</li>
    <li> This product was a Christmas Present from my husband. The packaging was terrible, it was not in a Josie Maran box just bubble wrap. That was my first clue. The Josie Maran site says that the product should soak in the skin BUT this product stays oily ALL DAY LONG. I started to break out. So, I went to Sephora and tried a sample and I could IMMEDIATELY tell a difference. The product soaked in my skin and felt soft and smooth. I am very upset since I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve been putting on my face! I read a comment warning people to not buy from this seller but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. NEVER AGAIN! I&#x27;ve learned my lesson, I will only buy from Sephora or the Josie Maran site. Please, be careful. Good luck to all</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t seem to live without this argon oil.... I am retired now, and will find it harder to afford but I will continue to use it.  It makes my skin pretty darn wrinkly free, even at 67 years old.  I hope to be able to get it forever...</li>
    <li> It arrived in a bag like package. When I opened the package the product was out of the box it was supposed to be in. There was oil all around the inside. It sucks that I spent all this money, and a quart of the product was smeared in the packaging. The product itself is amazing, but the packaging makes me want to order it from someone else.</li>
    <li> I have been using Josie Maran Argan oil for a few years.  I definitely noticed a difference in my face and continue to be shocked by how great this item is.  You cannot go wrong.  Great seller with quick shipment.</li>
    <li> Ok-- I cannot explain it, but all argan oils are not created equal.  Several years ago, a friend who had visited the Middle East returned with a large bottle of pure argan oil which she claimed was a miracle oil. She gave us a small bottle to try.  My husband began using it as an after shave moisturizer, and liked it.  I had been using Josie Maran&#x27;s cuticle oil, which says it is pure argan oil, and my nails and cuticles were the best they had ever been.  I then tried the other Argan oil, and my nails began to peel and split within two weeks. I immediately stopped using the substitute, and returned to this product. It took about four weeks to reverse the damage.  Both say they are 100% Argan oil, but something is different.  This Josie Maran oil is FABULOUS for nails and cuticles.</li>
    <li> This item arrived and was leaking in the box.  The box looks like it has been setting around&lt;br /&gt;for a while and has a mark through the bottom that leads me to believe it is some sort of second.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will be returning it.  Too much money to think it&#x27;s old, when it is a cosmetic.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, not too oily and enough of a moisturizer for the low humidy we have in Arizona. Able to use on my sensitive skin. Most products irritate my skin. Not this. Worth the money for pure argon oil.</li>
    <li> My dad uses this and loves it.  I use the Josie maran light and love it. We usually purchase it from Sephora but I wanted the bigger bottle for my dad.  The consistency of this product was sticky, unlike the smaller bottles.  We returned it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, saves my skin in hot Nevada</li>
    <li> The bottle is semi open and a small amout was spiled on the box.</li>
    <li> This was a Secret Santa gift for someone else. Personally, I think it&#x27;s waaaayyy overpriced. I just had no choice in what I bought.</li>
    <li> I used to be a longtime user of Josie&#x27;s argan oil, but at $48 for 2 oz it was expensive for everyone in my family to use.  We were going through 2 bottles a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found Glonaturals organic argan oil, $15 for the same size bottle and the exact same 100% organic argan oil.  Plus it has a seal on the bottle so I know it&#x27;s not someone else&#x27;s return and it&#x27;s fresh.  (The 4 oz Josie bottle with dropper or pump both leak horribly and neither one is sealed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Glonaturals for 4 months now and love it.  Would never go back to Josie&#x27;s again.  They sell Glonaturals on Amazon and at Vitacost.</li>
    <li> Received item in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> Really lovely, no scent, absorbs so well...understand the term &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product. And my face looks so much better. I mix with cerve cream ony face every night. Love it. Great for every part of the body.</li>
    <li> This product is unbelievable! Just 2 drops after washing and drying your hair protects it from the heat of curling ironing and flat ironing. Leaves hair looking very youthful  but not oily.</li>
    <li> I use this as a leave in conditioner and style agent. My husband uses it as a moisturizer since it absorbs very well. it make my hair silky, shiny, and healthy looking. I use a very small amount of it (one pump) in my wet hair and massage. Then blow dry and occasionally iron. if weather is very dry, I use it a very small amount to take the frizz out, and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Bought this two years ago! I use it to help my hair, and also my daughters cradle cap! Great quality</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Originally I bought the small dropper bottle for traveling.  Now I order the large pump bottle and simply refill the small bottle.  I ordered another, much less expensive, Argan Oil from Amazon but it had a smell that I was repulsed by.  Certainly not what I want my hair and face to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this all-purpose oil.  \\&quot;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It is very moisturizing but light weight and does not clog pores.  I use 3 drops in the morning and 5 drops at night(extra for eyes).  I just rub my hands together and then press into my face and neck.  This winter I also used 1-2 drops rubbed into my palms and the onto my hair to take care of static/dryness and give a lot of shine.  This argan oil has no scent which is great.</li>
    <li> I order my product for on December 2, 2013 and I did not receive it on time. I had to call Amazon three times to investigate the whereabouts of my oil. After much fluctuation, I just received it on December 28, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;The product is great and will continue using it; I might not order it from this company again if I can help it.</li>
    <li> Sure, 100% argan oil is great stuff. But guess what? Argan oil is argan oil, no matter who makes it, as long as its 100%. Save yourself 75% of the money and buy 100% pure argan from a brand that doesn&#x27;t obnoxiously inflate their prices just because a models name is on the bottle.</li>
    <li> A must have beauty product. Great value for what it does. It hydrates and helped my hair to look healthy. It&#x27;s no miracle product but it is a stepping stone for healthy hair when used in conjunction with other care products and other routine changes. (Using better shampoo and conditioner, reducing heating tool, ect). Also can be used for face, I use sometimes though a bit oily for my likings.</li>
    <li> The person that shipped this product to me claimed that it was new, but when I received it the product box was open and the bottle was half empty.  I wish I would have just ordered it from the Josie Maran website because the price difference was not worth it.  This was supposed to be a Christmas gift and by the time is came it was too late to order another one unless I wanted a late gift. I won&#x27;t ever buy this product again unless it&#x27;s from the Josie Maran website.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have combination skin and have struggled for years trying to take care of my skin.  I see a aesthetician every month and have seen a few dermatologists in my time.  I have tried everything from cetephil, dermatologica, clinique, neutorgena and everything else in between (price was no object).  This product has been the most effective in NOT clogging my pores and ultimately balancing my skin.  I also wrote a review about the cleansing oil.  I don&#x27;t always stick with a whole line of products- I am not afraid to mix and match if needed, but this product line is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is free of things like parabans, dyes, chemicals, fragrance and so on.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My skin has never been better.  I wear this every night, and have had fewer breakouts as a result</li>
    <li> The bottle is this products flaw</li>
    <li> Given that I have an oily face and always have, the last thing I thought about was putting oil on my face...I was wrong.  I use this at night around my eyes and wherever I see fit.  I put it on my extremely dry legs to help them not look so nasty and if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive I would bathe in it.  It&#x27;s great stuff and surprisingly not greasy! Idk how they do that, but I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is clean, pure and soaks easy into the skin providing moisture.  Smell is light.  Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I never had any real problems with acne as a teenager, but something happened in my late twenties where I started to breakout regularly.  Replacing my moisturizer with an oil seemed like the worst possible idea, but I received a sample of this and gave it a shot.  I used it at night on clean skin and woke up with lovely soft skin.  I kept using Josie&#x27;s Argon oil and have since bought it in the deluxe size twice now.  My breakouts have all but disappeared and I&#x27;m still waiting to see those crows feet wrinkles that my girlfriends all have by now.  In my early 30&#x27;s and my skin looks better than it did a decade ago.  Love this stuff!</li>
