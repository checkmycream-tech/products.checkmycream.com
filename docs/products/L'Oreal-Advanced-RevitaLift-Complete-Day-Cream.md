<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product, &amp;#34;L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Revitalift...&amp;#34; burned a sensitive area under my eyes and turned my skin a bright red, hurt too. My wife uses this with no negative effect so I suspect I am somehow allergic to some ingredient in this product. I had no adverse reactions to Garner&#x27;s Ultra Lift or Olay Total Effects. So I have deleted any further purchase of this bad (for me) face cream.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years because it has sun screen and moisturizer and, more importantly, I dint break out when I use it.</li>
    <li> grat product works well in combination with other Olay products</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year . I like the consistency;. It is not greasy and wears well under makeup. I also appreciate the inclusion of sublock in its formula.I think it is an excellent product for women of all ages.</li>
    <li> This cream is probably perfect for people with normal to dry skin. I have oily, acne prone skin. This hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all, which is amazing. Almost anything with SPF in it, will make my face break out. So I love this product for the fact that I can protect my skin from the sun with no additional zits. However, I have very oily skin naturally and this product doesn&#x27;t absorb well on my skin. Even hours after applying, my skin will feel sticky and tacky. Dang it.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that does not make my sensitive skin break out. Plus it has SPF. I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Use it once a day at least! My neck is softer and my face feels great. Was using something similar for $75, I liked the $75 better (it was lighter on the face) however for the price of the LOreal its much better.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Fast and correct.</li>
    <li> The product left my skin feeling dried out. Don&#x27;t believe the product measured up to all the hype.</li>
    <li> I make a mistake.I thought it is eye cream.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I do like it but I haven&#x27;t seen results yet because it&#x27;s just my 2nd day using it.. Hopefully i will see results but I do think there will be results that I will love. I will recommend this to family and friends</li>
    <li> A repeat purchase of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Skin Care for my grandmother.  She is 89 years old and has soft hydrated skin which she attributes partially to using this skin care product. She uses it in the am and at night, and it smells fresh. Great product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s just the placebo effect that makes me think it works to minimize my fine lines. At first I thought it did, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to much anymore and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough. Looking at the listed function on the label it says it&#x27;s sunscreen so I don&#x27;t know if that means it really doesn&#x27;t have any anti-aging effects or what... Glad I only spent ten dollars on it and don&#x27;t plan to repeat.</li>
    <li> Its soo nice,, just used niw in 2days but my face feels smooth and i work garden a lot so i have this lots of age spot from exposed the son,my agespot is fade already,, and smell great,,</li>
    <li> I wish this cream was thicker/&amp;#34;creamier&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s good for the price. Interestingly, I did not notice a strong perfume scent with this cream. The night cream&#x27;s new scent is overpowering.</li>
    <li> For the price I would expect more noticeable improvement in my skin after using for 1 month. I do like that it&#x27;s not greasy, however because of the price I will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Very good product which I will continue to use - Overall L&#x27;Oreal products are good.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service.&lt;br /&gt;Both are keepers.&lt;br /&gt;Not too much else could add to the above.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the less said is better than too much.</li>
    <li> I hope to update this in a few months.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I can&#x27;t really talk about my skin as far as firmness or texture since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way it moisturizes though.  I use a tretinoin product at night as well (similar to Retin-A) and it dries my skin out a lot.  I was hoping this would help with moisturizing during the day and it does.  I noticed with other moisturizers, I have to reapply them throughout the day but the moisturizing effects of this last for pretty much 9-10hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put it on, it&#x27;s looks shimmery/greasy but it does get absorbed into the skin and leaves a nice sheen, not shiny or greasy looking.  It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pill\\&quot;, like my Oil Of Olay product use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent and didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all as far as breakouts and rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will hopefully be updating this in a few months to see if it has any affect on firmness/texture, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this moisturizer.  Even in the winter, it leaves my face greasy looking.  But then again, my skin is not really that dry.  I would think it&#x27;ll be a greasy slick mess in the summer.  I like that it comes in a jar and not a pump bottle.  Pump bottles are good only in the beginning when you first start using a product.  As you use up the product, it becomes difficult to extract the remainder, and you end up throwing out at least 1/4 of the bottle.  I won&#x27;t be buying moisturizers that come in pump bottles anymore.  As for the effectiveness of this moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.  It seems to maybe brighten up your skin a little, so I would say it&#x27;s a little better than a cheap moisturizer.  It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  It is a rich cream, so it would be good for dry skin. I will probably buy it again for lack of a better product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream on my face for several weeks now and have noticed nothing....it has not done anything.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It has more sunblock ingredients than moisturizing. I just stopped using it and went back to my usual product even though it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> Good cream and convenient to have delivered....not sure this is the best price however.  Need to check for sales locally.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a while now with no changes..I guess my wrinkles are too far gone for it to help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time now.  I have a problem with very dry skin in the fall and winter months.  I also swim every morning so my skin really needs a moisturizer.  This product has worked very well for me.  It goes on well and seems to absorb rapidly.  It&#x27;s not necessary to use very much at a time.  It does have a slight \\&quot;make-up\\&quot; odor to it but that seems to dissipate quickly.</li>
    <li> This face cream - and the L&#x27;oreal Advanced revitalift line seems to actually lift my 65 year old skin slightly and tone it as well.  The problem I like the least on my aging face is the bags under my eyes and I tihnk the bags are getting smaller .</li>
    <li> The cream has made my skin feel great and I can wear it without foundation during the day,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was on time and it was much cheaper through Amazon than anyone else.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this cream but after using my reading glasses for a couple of days I notice that the frames are now etched where they come into contact with my skin to which I applied this product...  why???  Like I said, I love the product, but now I&#x27;m a little scared of it, seeing that it can melt plastic and all.</li>
    <li> I was using Patricia Wexler as my daily cream but it was getting pricey, and so I decided to try Revitalift. The texture is definitely less &#x27;firm&#x27; and feels much more like cheap body cream than facial cream. Still, for the price it isn&#x27;t that bad, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, clog pores, and provides moisture. The scent is subtle and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I apply a thin layer of L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Ant-Wrinkle day cream during the day and sometimes even at night. Thats how much I like the formula and smoothness of my skin after using. Plus it has an SPF. Not crazy about the scent though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the triple power revitalift and would say it s no better than 1x tho still a good moisturizer. This also has the firming day cream and most important of all &#x3D;s SPF 18.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m really liking it.  The consistency is not too thick and sinks into my skin fairly quickly so I can apply my makeup.  My skin looks more refreshed and smoother after using it.  I&#x27;ll be 39 soon and I&#x27;ve noticed that my neck is not as firm as it used to be.  This cream is perfect for it and while it has not totally changed, I have noticed an improvement.  I will definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> We really like this face lotion.  It has a nice consistency and smells great.  We can feel it bond in our skin, and my husband loves it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to agree with the other guy here. This product works for men as well! Been using it for almost a year now and i&#x27;m noticing less lines!</li>
    <li> The only facial care product I use.  18 spf really works.  I use this produce day and night.  Save your face.  Not greasy, massage in thoroughly to your skin.  I also use it on the back of my hands to slow down the brown spots.  I am very fair and I need to avoid sunburn.  I even use it while snorkeling,  but always remember to wash the inner edge of mask with dawn dish soap to maintain a good fit the next day.</li>
    <li> My favorite day cream (age 60). Very moisturizing but light with a pleasant smell. I like the fact that it protects and feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 10 years. This does exactly what it claims. I have tried some very expensive department store  products any none of them  performed any better.  People  routinely think I am 10-15 years younger than I am. I added Estee Lauder Night Repair about five years ago and that is a great combiation for me.</li>
    <li> At my age (74) I need a cream that lasts all day. This one is perfect.</li>
    <li> While I like this product and feel that it does help my skin, I would rather have something that is unscented. Unlike some of the reviewers, I find the scent to be strong and not pleasant, and I&#x27;m told it is noticeable. That makes me less willing to use it during the day, unless I am staying in. At night, it&#x27;s a waste of the sunscreen as well as noticeable to my bf, who would prefer I did not use it. Maybe if it had a citrus scent instead of floral...? I do think it is a good product, but only if you (and your significant other) like the scent.</li>
    <li> love the smell, nice texture, am a big fan of all L;oreal Products, face and hair&lt;br /&gt;BUT I do not know if this product or any other cremes will help with wrinkles, and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that I do use argan oil and Ferulic Acid or Hyaluric Acid product. You can mix all those products in the creme for your daily use.</li>
    <li> I like this face cream a lot! So much that I have given it to my daughter as a birthday gift. And she likes it a lot too..&lt;br /&gt;We needed something that would keep  skin soft, smooth and moisturized, as it  protects some, from the sun!..</li>
    <li> It is too oily, making my face shining. It does not feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> feel disappoint of the cream. I bought for my aunt and she review this was not the real L&#x27;oreal .</li>
    <li> Although the Amazon page promoted this product as protecting against both UVA and UVB, it only protects against sunburn but NOT against aging effects of the sun or skin cancer.  I had to look up the active ingredients to figure it out, then I realized that the label on the jar also warns of this (even though Amazon&#x27;s page said the opposite).  Who wants wrinkles or skin cancer?  Forget this product and shop around, Amazon offers dozens of broad spectrum products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for several years. When I saw this was on clearance from Amazon, I liked the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I put it on every morning and every night.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but I do notice an improvement in my sagging cheeks and throat.  Adds a bit more elasticity to your your skin.</li>
    <li> Very firming &amp; moisturizing.  Easy to apply &amp; refreshes my face immediately.  Not greasy or heavy.  I am noticing an improved look to my skin within weeks of use.  There is a glow &amp; the tired look around my eyes has subsided.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this cream.  I keep straying trying different products and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; creams but I keep coming back to L&#x27;Oreal because it works and doesn&#x27;t break me out or hurt my skin.  It is a bit more pricey but hey I deserve it right? lol  Oh yeah and hubby always notices when I switch, I don&#x27;t know how but he does.  Guess the proof is in the &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34;.  lol</li>
    <li> its ok , does a ok job. not to crazy about it.. I will try another cream from another company.</li>
    <li> Very nice, light, and goes on easily.  Seems to be working well and feels nice on my skin.  Absorbs quickly and if I put on liquid makeup, it goes on more easily.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Best cream and affordable -- just keep hoping for them to go cruelty free.</li>
    <li> I have not found a better day cream it is light, refreshing and does not make you feel greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and the night cream since 2008 when I was deployed to Afghanistan and I am still useing both products. I actually have less lines now. I am mistaken for being in my 30&#x27;s and I am actually 52.</li>
    <li> Guess I have fewer wrinkles - but how do you know for sure!!  Subscriptions are an easy way to shop.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My skin looks 20 years younger than my age. Maybe good genes, but skin cream can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Used for years.  Hard to find moisture, anti-wrinkle, and firming together with a good sunscreen.  This one works.</li>
    <li> Have been using cream for about a month, and it&#x27;s just okay, nothing special.  Not very rich feeling on skin; does not moisturize any differently than other low price creams.  Will not buy it, again.</li>
    <li> Has done nothing in lessening anti-wrinkles and fine lines.  I am so disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several lotions and potions for my aging skin.  I&#x27;ve found this one to be the best.  Over time it lessens wrinkles (as long as they aren&#x27;t deep) and smooths skin.  Does it lift? No, if it does, it&#x27;s not enough to really notice. However, overall, my skin looks better.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it, so do I!&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris must take care and maintain the quality of this product in order to keep customer&#x27;s loyalty.</li>
    <li> Works well at night or daytime.  Doesn&#x27;t matter.  It just works.</li>
    <li> Love this daytime face cream.  It moisturizes, yet is light to the touch, blending well into the skin while providing a good base for foundation,  and contains a sunscreen which is crucial for playing sports here in our Florida climate.  It never streaks under makeup and never feels greasy.</li>
    <li> I am fifty and I have been using this product since my thirtys. People always comment how young my skin looks. Is it genetics or this product? Don&#x27;t know but won&#x27;t stop using. Keeps my skin soft less wrinkles and has fantastic Sun protection. I spend a lot of time in the sun. Great price on line too.</li>
    <li> For years I was looking for a face cream that would not make me breakout,  not allergic to, and  not too greasy.  Finally about 8 years ago a friend suggested Revitalift complete day cream.  It works for me all year around and it even has sun protection.  I&#x27;m 53 years old and this cream gives me a fresh and young feeling and look.  I can ware it under my face powder  in  the morning to go to work, without it making my face feel or look greasy.  I buy 4 at a time from Amazon at a great price and with the usual quick delivery.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> Came without the box and without a seal over the cream.  I threw it out for safety reasons.  Now of this was outlined in the product explanation.</li>
    <li> This feels so nice on my skin.  It&#x27;s the 3rd jar I&#x27;ve purchased, and will buy it again. Works well.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years. Love it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if any cream does what it claims, but it does feel good on my skin.  I bought it again.</li>
    <li> A very nice cream -smooth. I have used it for a while also inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Great for sensetive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden since 1970 and wanted to try a less priced product. However, I did not see the same results, so I will stay with my EA products.</li>
    <li> I use this every day, it&#x27;s light and absorbs in quickly.  Don&#x27;t let the white cream fool you, it goes into your skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. Plus you only need a little, it has SPF and goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Package looks old, like a used or returned product. I am afraid to use it, very disappointed it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream off and on for a long time but have made up my mind to use it as my favorite.  I can really depend on it.</li>
    <li> We like this product and regularly buy and use it. It sort of suits our kind of skin. Each person should figure out which is  best for their skin anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She didn&#x27;t break out at all or anything like that. She said it makes her skin feel better and after a few weeks it does look better than before. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother and she loves it. She is 74 and said it works the best for keeping her skin soft and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it said it was a anti wrinkle and firming cream when in fact when I read the fine print on the back of the jar it nothing more than a moisturizing cream with spf.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a one star because, I am not happy with this product as I feel it is misleading with the words anti wrinkle and firming. I will not buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revitalift does not revi nor lift.</li>
    <li> A light product, feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream for everyday use for the mature woman. Good SPF rating &amp; for my skin type I don&#x27;t need any other sun screen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s but ever since I was a teen, I&#x27;VE ALWAYS HAD BAD UNDER EYE DARK CIRCLES!!!! It was so bad that even concealer wouldn&#x27;t cover it up. I eventually gave up and thought I&#x27;d be stuck with them for the rest of my life until I came across this product! It took about a week to actually see results but OH MY GOD, IT WORKS!!!! My dark circles have diminished greatly!!!! I use it once in the morning after I wash my face and again before bed. Try this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Loreal revitalift anti wrinle cream for a few years and I love it .  It makes my skin moist but not oily. It also does not break me out as some other creams that I have used. I really love it.</li>
    <li> When I can&#x27;t afford Lancome&#x27;, Loreal is my less expensive option. I have been using this product for many years.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday as my moisturizer under my foundation.  Maybe it&#x27;s good genes or something but no one can guess my true age (I hear anything from early to mid 30&#x27;s ... I&#x27;m actually 48).  I love how this cream feel on my face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month. It moisturizes well, makes my skin smooth. I like what I got. It works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> I thought this product will be good for my face, but I was wrong.I have acne on my face now because of this.</li>
    <li> I use all of L&#x27;Oreal face products and am very satisfied with results.</li>
    <li> This is a very satisfactory product.  Does not have an overwhelming fragrance that some creams have.  My skin absorbs this very nicely.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it is going to make me more beautiful.  :-)</li>
    <li> Price right and does a great job under makeup, dries fast into the skin. Good product for the money and smells nice too</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have used this product for years with no problems...or blemishes caused by oil.  It leaves my skin soft and works well under make-up.</li>
    <li> I loved and I have been working on my face every day and night and the results are amazing, it is funny but after I wash my face is like my face needs  my revitalift  back on it! Another very important thing is I can use my revitalift and put makeup on it looks amazing and my face doesn t look tired!</li>
    <li> My mom likes them. The package was fast, and protected them well.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m happy about my purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;Nice :)</li>
    <li> Great price, free shipping &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have a moisturizer that also includes a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> A wonderfully smooth day cream with SPF 18 that stings my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I recently found it on Amazon for 1/2 the price.  I am happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this product without doing much research. It&#x27;s not made for people with sensitive skin. I take very good care of my skin, and after only a couple weeks of using this, my skin broke out very badly with blind pimples (the deep ones under the skin). It clogged my pores so badly, and it was really painful. I stopped using it right away. Once I did, my skin got better. Do not use this if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 years and it works really well. My face looks healthier and I noticed less wrinkles. I gave it 4 stars because I believe the price should be more reasonable.</li>
    <li> Very thick cream, I would recommend it.  Really good price as well.  So nice to shop from home.  This is a good deal.</li>
