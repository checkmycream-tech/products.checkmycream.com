<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried multiple products that say they are great at helping with stretch marks. However, most were way too greasy to use and they didn&#x27;t show improvement. I took a chance with the Stretch Mark Cream by Haubauer and I do have to say it didn&#x27;t leave my stomach feeling greasy. My stomach wasn&#x27;t left dry either. I had no issues using it. Applies easily and leaves your skin feeling refreshed. Now I know nothing is going to remove my horrendous looking stretch marks. But I have noticed they are getting lighter and they don&#x27;t itch throughout the day. This is one cream that I will continue using.</li>
    <li> This cream has visibly reduced my stretch marks. I appreciate the high quality safe ingredients and love the citrusy scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got three sons (youngest is about 6 months old) and the stretchmarks to prove it! I haven&#x27;t been using this cream long enough to be able to remark on its effectiveness, but it does smell nice, smooths on well, and makes my skin feel soft and supple after applying.</li>
    <li> This product has helped really well. I put it on every morning before I start my day. I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell nasty or leave an icky residue on me. It has made it to where it keeps my skin soft and with me gaining weight, my stretch marks are not that noticeable anymore and I am not getting new ones.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just look at this size of this!! This is a great size for this type of product because let&#x27;s face it- I&#x27;m a plus size girl so we go through lots of lotions because our bodies are bigger. This smells nice and I Iike the way it feels on my body. It isn&#x27;t oily and doesn&#x27;t get all over my clothes</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have only used it for a week and I already have great results. Of course I have a few stretch marks from having a baby, and well let&#x27;s face it getting older. Within a week of applying this product I have already seen results. My stretch marks  is fading. This product is a miracle in a bottle. Everyone should try this just if nothing else to boost your self confidence at Bikini season. It&#x27;s moisturizing and smooth and you can almost feel it working right away. Definitely an amazing find.This is a great product, I will easily use this again and recommend it. My marks aren&#x27;t completely gone but I am still hopeful with continued use</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any change.</li>
    <li> just started using this so I will have update it later. Smells good and is hydrating at the very least.</li>
    <li> Excellent stretch mark cream! My wife uses it twice a day, she is very satisfied with the fading of the marks that were  left from being pregnant with our children.  Highly recommend purchasing during pregnancy and after for best results.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about two and a half weeks ago. I love it because it has helped with taking away my stretch  marks that all the other creams wouldn&#x27;t. I have used it everywhere and I have seen a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I actually really liked this. There&#x27;s no strong odor or sticky residue left on your skin.  It&#x27;s a nice clean feeling. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far but I find it promising.  The other lotions I&#x27;ve tried hag a weird burning sensation but this one I haven&#x27;t had a problem.</li>
    <li> This has a nice smell, which is always good when it comes to lotions and creams!  I&#x27;m looking forward to great results!</li>
    <li> I have some pretty deep streach marks left from having my two kids. I just started using this cream about two weeks ago but I like it so far.. It looks like the streach marks are already looking a little bit lighter. Also I really like the scent, it&#x27;s really light and smells of citrus. I&#x27;m excited to see the results after a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to review if it works or not, I will update my post once I&#x27;ve used it for a month or so. But the item arrived packaged nicely and on time. I was surprised at how big the bottle of product was, I was expecting a little bottle but what I received is very nice sized bottle. The product smells good, no funky chemical smell or anything which is nice. So far so good! Again I will update once I&#x27;ve used it for a while.  ****** Updating my review***** I have used the entire bottle of this product and noticed a slight change in the redness of my stretch marks but not enough to warrant praise. I was really hoping this was going to make a bigger difference than it has. It might work well for some people but didn&#x27;t work for me. This is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Have only been using for a couple weeks but very moisturizing and has a nice smell. I was surprised how big the bottle is, and a little bit goes a long way so it will last!  I will update after a couple months with results!</li>
    <li> Great product! Super fast shipping!Cream goes on smooth and doesnt feel oily ! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> The product came pretty fast and has nice size. Its tall and sleek, having pump on the top for easy dispensing. I am 33 weeks pregnant and I was using Palmer lotion and oil to avoid stretch marks but still got many marks on my lower and side belly. As far this product is concerned I have used this only 4-5 times and got no marks after that. I hope that it will reduce my existing marks too after consistent long use. It has very nice texture and easily get absorbed. Most of its ingredient is natural like jojoba oil, Cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> I got this for my niece. She is growing very fast and is getting stretch marks on her hips. Only time will tell if it really works, but with the good reviews it looks like it will. It is a good sized bottle so I think it will last her for quite awhile. The packing is very nice and sturdy, not cheap. She was very happy when I brought it to her because she is at an age where she is self conscious of the few stretch marks she currently has. This will help prevent more and hopefully lighten the ones she already has.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and feels like the skin is tightening. We will see down the road of it shows result.</li>
    <li> This cream is nicely scented, and does a good job of moisturizing the tender parts of my pregnant belly.  I like how it rubs in quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy/slick either. I had started to experience some dry and itching skin as well as stretch marks around 23 weeks.  When I began using this product, however, the look of the beginning marks already faded, my skin is no longer itchy, and I haven&#x27;t seen any new marks forming.  I would definitely reccommend giving it a shot!</li>
    <li> I have used this creamy for over a week now. I notice that my stretch marks appear to be smoothing out. I will update my review as I see results but as of now I would recommend this product. I also received this product at a promotional price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing cream. I bought this for my sister who is pregrant now and she told me that it is the best cream she used during 6 months, because she bought 3 diffrent creams of famous brands but after applying them one after another for 2-3 months didn&#x27;t see any results and her doctor advised her to search for another stretch cream.This cream works perfectly, she already has 2 stretch marks which can be visible and after using this cream for 1 month she noticed some really good changes. So what is the point to buy some expensive stretch mark creams which don&#x27;t work and doen&#x27;t get any results.I will definitely will buy one jar for me also when I will be pregnant and will use it right from the start. My tip is to apply it from the first month of pregnancy, so that not to worry about stretches after delivery.My sister is happy about this cream</li>
    <li> Does not work! Just get Mederma stretch mark cream, it actually works!</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly to moisturize &amp; fade stretch marks . I will be purchasing this again. I&#x27;ve had two children and have horrible stretch marks and this seems to be the only thing to fade them.</li>
    <li> Left skin feeling smooth and moisturizer. Too soon to see noticeable results. Will update.</li>
    <li> I have not tried the product yet, but this came in a lager bottle then I expected which is great! I will come back to update once I have tried the product.</li>
    <li> This product works GREAT!!! I have been using it for a couple weeks and have already noticed a difference!! I was very sceptical but after using it, I love it!!! I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I received this a day early! I love it. It smells so great. It has not shown me anything yet, but I can feel the moisture in it. I have only been using it 2 days. I will definitely purchase again! I am actually going to order some for my sister who is expecting!</li>
    <li> I have a little bit of stretch marks on my thighs and butt and I had gotten this product I hope it could help remove them! From what I can tell - the product is doing an amazing job. It helps smooth my thighs and helps make me feel&lt;br /&gt;Confident in embracing my thighs even more now in shorts.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend who just had her second child. She is using it as she works out to shed baby weight and says it is really producing results. She had very large fluid volumes in both of her pregnancies and is a very petite person so stretch marks can be a real issue but she is very appreciative and I am so happy that she can not only see the fitness results of her work to shed baby weight but also get rid of the lines that she doesn&#x27;t want to deal with.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good. Maybe in time it will make them less prominent. It has lightened my stretch marks up About 30% but I haven&#x27;t been using it long.</li>
    <li> I saw results with this really fast. I apply it every night before going to bed. I had stretch marks on my sides and some small ones on my boobs. The ones on my boobs cleared up right away and the others have faded a lot.</li>
    <li> This was a pretty interesting product. Shipping was quick and easy and there was no hassle whatsoever. Item arrived in good clean condition, perfectly brand new. Used it today and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about trying a stretch mark cream. But after having 2 kids, my stretch marks are in full swing. I got this at a generously discounted price, so I ordered it &amp; I love it! This cream is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for just a few days &amp; I already see my stretch marks fading! I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> My friend is having twins this made her month!</li>
    <li> I got a beauty confession. I use stretch mark cream. Yes, I do. But here is why I rarely use it and absolutely hate it. Is it just me or do they sometimes have a weird smell? It is supposed to be my secret and not the world&#x27;s. Needless to say I have a fear of using it. And why doesn&#x27;t it absorb quickly? And why doesn&#x27;t it work? I mean why can&#x27;t they get the formula right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am letting it out of the bag because I think I found the one that works and I think my beauty friends should have this secret weapon too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hautbauer Stretch Mark Cream is my secret weapon. It is a gentle formula that can be used daily. Enriched with great ingredients like Shea Butter, Olive Oil, Cocoa Butter, Jojoba Oil, Mango Butter, Rose Hip Seed Oil, Grapefruit Seed Extract, Orange Oil, and other key ingredients that create the perfect balance for all skin types. Even dry skin. Plus it contains no parabens, artificial fragrances or artificial color. Yes, I know. They got the right formula. Awesome huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember Summer is only four week away. It&#x27;s time to prepare your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hautbauer Stretch Mark Cream has been perfectly formulated to nourish, moisturize, heal and firm your skin. Perfect for existing stretch marks, pregnancy stretch marks, and even weight lost stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare for Summer. Hautbauer Stretch Mark Cream is truly a Summer Beauty Must.</li>
    <li> This stretch mark cream actually smells great and does not feel greasy like some others. We are very satisfied with the quality and the packaging. Goes on easy and seems to be enough to last quite awhile. We will definitely purchase again and recommend to others. Thanks Hautbauer</li>
    <li> I really love this product, not only did it help to get rid of stretch marks but it also made my skin softer and more luminous. I could readily see the difference almost immediately, I highly recommend this product.It has worked well on a scar I have also</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my expectant daughter. She was worried about stretch marks and wanted to try to prevent them. She has been applying this cream daily for several weeks and although she still has a while until delivery, she is thrilled with this cream..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying is easy and it feels light. It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent and is non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this based on our use and results. We will be ordering more to get through the rest of the pregnancy and recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was purchased by me through a discount coupon or gift card.</li>
    <li> This stretch mark cream is nice and thick and has shown noticeable improvements on my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Does it help with old stretch marks????</li>
    <li> The scent of this is a very lemony cake or something.lol I like the smell. The cream is thick so less is more. I have been using once a day After showering for about an week and a half and see a slight difference in my old arm stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and it&#x27;s working for her! She&#x27;s been using it for about 2 weeks now and can already see a difference!  It has a nice light scent and it&#x27;s a good sized bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom for mother&#x27;s day. She&#x27;s self conscious about stretch marks. She says this already seems to be working. She said she would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently 30 weeks pregnant with my second baby. I was left with a only a few tiny stretch marks after my first pregnancy, and have been using this to prevent any new marks from developing. So far, so good! I have no new stretch marks at this point, despite having a much larger belly. The cream isn&#x27;t greasy at all and absorbs nicely. Great product, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have had three kids and as you csnnimagine quite a bit of stretch marks. This product seems to help them fade and is leaves skin smooth. I cannot wait to see final results.</li>
    <li> Pretty good formula that does show effectiveness just minutes after applying. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> Just started using this, love the way it makes my skin feel.  Not greasy like most stretch mark creams or oils. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a big difference in the stretch marks, but I&#x27;ll definitely update.. May even post progress pictures.</li>
    <li> i love this one i tried a few other ones didnt work this is amazing and at this price wow</li>
    <li> I have seen this product in Magazines for a while and always wanted some! I&#x27;m a mom of 3 with some weight to lose. I know a handful of people who have tried this product and it worked for them. Their stretch marks are practically invisible! I&#x27;ve only put it on once and I already LOVE it! I am so excited to finally have some and the shipping was so fast! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am really glad I gave this a try. I have stretch marks on my abdomen and chest from 2 pregnancies and my son has some from weight loss and this is the best cream we have found yet. It has quite a few butters, vitamins and oils in it to heal and recover skin. Definitely keeping up a treatment of this cream on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and non greasy!  Great!</li>
    <li> This cream feels great on my skin really silky. A great suze bottle. Seems to be working on my stretch marks. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughter in Law is pregnant and feels that this will help prevent stretch marks</li>
    <li> This cream has made all the difference!  I apply it in the morning and night.  It has made a noticeable difference in the look and feel of my skin.  I am due with my second baby in June and still no stretch marks!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Since I had my baby girls 9 months ago, I have not had time to work out and tone my body. Although I have purchased many lotions to make my stretch marks dissappear. This is the first one that has worked the fastest. I love it. I feel like I am gaining back my body!</li>
    <li> i HAVE BEEN USING IT FROM PAST MORE THAN A MONTH AND I FIND NO RESULTS, MY STRETCH MARKS ARE STILL THE SAME AND I WASTE HELL LOT OF MONEY ON IT BELIEVING THE COMMENTS, MORE OVER SINCE I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO SEE IF THE RESULTS WOULD BE SHOWING UP ATLEAST AFTER A MONTH I COULD NOT EVEN RETURN TO AMAZON.IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE. i WOULD HAVE GIVEN 0 STAR</li>
    <li> This product was definitely something I needed after 3 children.  I am not a fan of products that are heavily scented.  I was pleasantly surprised by the light orangey scent.  The lotion absorbs well and does not leave a greasy or sticky feel after following the directions for use.  The packaging is very nice as well.  It is definitely a product I will continue to use in hopes of minimizing stretch marks!</li>
    <li> This has ingredients in it, such as Jojoba that are known for deep nourishment of the skin which is proven to be helpful in reducing the chance of developing stretch marks. It comes in a pretty cool bottle, it&#x27;s tall and sleek and I really liked the smell and it has a great consistency and texture. So far, so good. :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this enough to see major improvements yet but I like how it makes my skin feel. My skin does feel firmer and I haven&#x27;t noticed any new stretch marks however my old ones are still quite visible. I am using this product for stretch marks on my thighs and not my stomach so it may work differently on different parts of the body. It has a pleasant smell and the container is much bigger than I was expected. The pump also makes it really easy to apply. I&#x27;m hoping that my stretch marks will start fading as I use it more often</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s a bad product, we just haven&#x27;t seen any great results yet. My wife has been using it for a little per a week, and it hasn&#x27;t really done a whole lot. We both enjoy the smell, and she says it makes her tummy feel really mousterized. Maybe if she had used it before her first pregnancy we could have seen better results, and it hasn&#x27;t been a really long time so I am planning on doing an updated review, but at this point it just seems to be an expensive lotion</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve had the product for a few weeks and I really like the size of the bottle. I&#x27;m pregnant and have previous stretch marks from a previous pregnancy. It seems to be diminishing the stretch marks from the under side of my breast but I&#x27;m not sure if its the cream or the fact that they are getting bigger again. The cream itself comes from a nice little pump you will find on most nice creams or lotion containers. I find if I pump two or three times it is enough to cover the area that needs to be covered. There is a slight odor to the lotion that I am not crazy about but not too noticable. Over all gong well and will add more after the baby is born.</li>
    <li> I used this product during my pregnancy and enjoyed it until I started getting stretch marks. If you want a hydrating lotion with good ingredients this is still a good buy, but the claims for avoiding stretch marks don&#x27;t hold up. By week 34 of my pregnancy I started getting multiple stretch marks on my lower abdomen. I thought I was going to get away with no stretch marks, given that my mom did not get any from her three pregnancies. Also, I kept my weight gain within the recommended 25-35 lb. mark; however, I still ended up with stretch marks. The lotion has a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t dirty or soil my clothing. Overall, for what it did and how one bottle only lasted 1.5 months, a less expensive lotion would be a better purchase. I&#x27;ll probably try the many other lotions on the market for hydration that are less expensive next pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and smooth creamy feel! This stretch mark cream feels fantastic!!! I haven&#x27;t seen any results on the stretch marks yet- but I think that takes days, the moisturizing qualities is enough to make me want to buy it again. I could see this being a great one for elbows and feet that are dry and rough too!! The bottle is a great size!</li>
    <li> it is working a lot better than other stuff i use loving the results so far</li>
    <li> After having my son, I have struggled with my stretch marks. I tried this cream and it has lightened my stretch marks and some of them you cant even really see anymore. I am so glad I tried this. I hope it works just as good on my bigger stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how big the bottle was when it came. I like the 3 butters, Shea, Cocoa and Mango. They make the skin feel so good. The scent is light, slightly citrusy.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It has a wonderful smell a little pepper minty maybe...It absorbs well also.</li>
    <li> Large bottle. Great value. I love the texture of this lotion. Seems to really work too. I can see improvement.</li>
    <li> I love how this stretch mark cream feels on my skin. Also my stretch marks seem to be fading away.</li>
