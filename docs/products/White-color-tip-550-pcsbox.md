      <li>The case they come in is pretty durable and has the tip sizes labeled on the lid.</li>

      <li>Where I live I can only get 150 tips for 13 dollars.</li>
      <li>, I would say it&#x27;s NORMAL use, and I don&#x27;t wear my nails long</li>
      <li>that even after several coats of hard shellac they bend and break easily.</li>

    <li> The product arrived before the estimated delivery date which is great considering the delivery date was almost a month out. Everything arrived in good condition. The nails were in individual little zip lock bags that were numbered by size. I didn&#x27;t count them but it look like 550 pieces. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I didnt use the nails as I could see them through the box, tried to return them and was told I couldnt because they are disposable tips. The box is unopened and I have wasted 10.00, will not use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> NAILS ARE WEAK,NOT CUT, RIGHT AND JUST CHEAP!..I HATE THEM. I ADVICE YOU TO LOOK AROUND THIS ONE...SO NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife who started doing her nails at home.  She said these are comparable to the hot pink tips. They are well-less and a bit thin but seem to last under all the pressure she puts on her hands. The case they come in is pretty durable and has the tip sizes labeled on the lid. For the price its not a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> Theses are a little flimsy and thin but they work and i love them and they feel like there made of like the type of plastic made for I.D&#x27;s</li>
    <li> These items r great except there are problems of running out of some sizes and not using some of the others and then never use them... need more of sizes 4 and 5,, 5hese are most common..</li>

    <li> The seller deliver fats and the nail are just like the one from the salon i lovee it</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a great set of tips that suit me! I found them! Majority of the tips that come with the acrylic set are very rounded (from the left to the right of the nail). I do not like the rounded tips! These tips are not as rounded and fit my nail a lot better. What was interesting to note, however, is that the tip does not have a deep nail well to place glue in. Its not a problem for me because I never really gauge the amount of glue and fitting of the nail on this factor. I would recommend these tips to anyone.</li>
    <li> Cheaper then the store or salon and it works good been trying to save money by doing my own nails</li>
    <li> Great item! I would definitely recommend, it comes very quickly and the sizes match great. I have tried many other tips however I find that these are the closest match to my actual nail</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Just like the ones in the salon. Gives you beautiful french tips. &#x3D;) I would definitely recommend this product. It looked great with my Axxium OPI Gel polish!</li>
    <li> My wife used them and really enjoyed them they were very nice, and would recommend them to anyone that does nails.</li>
    <li> A little flimsy.. They don&#x27;t fit my nails as well as I would like..</li>
    <li> I am a self taught nail artist. These tips are perfect for price and quantity. Where I live I can only get 150 tips for 13 dollars. These are a MUCH better deal and I like them better then the ones sold at the beauty shop!</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking that they are the same from the salon but they are NOT they are to thin and flimsy, the box is small and doesn&#x27;t fit much,I don&#x27;t recommend it the only plus on this is that the seller did a great job in shipping I received it almost a week and a half early.</li>
    <li> I got a box with no tips?</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t tips at all ... When I received it they were full coverage nails not tips :-( not what I ordered at al</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> The material is so Bad, the designer is so Bad.. I am really desapoited with the product..I Spend my money and I did Not Like..</li>
    <li> I love the price, love the quickness of the shipping, i have used the tips a couple of times now and they last for quite a while ....at least 2 weeks....the price is way more affordable than what you find in the beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> Happy with product, will be ordering from in the future. These nail tips are nice and strong and will be used for work.</li>
    <li> Love the sturdy box great size range for all nail sizes very sturdy but not too thick easy to apply we all use these in our nail salon I will order more when I get ow thank you so much</li>
    <li> I love these nails. They are easy to cut and file to the shape that you desire. Also, they are easy to fit to your fingers. Only one thing they have issues sticking to your finger. Only info I can give is that you have to scatch the area that the glue goes a little before putting them on.</li>
    <li> They are cheap for a reason, that is because they will not stay on your nails, do not buy this crap product.</li>
    <li> good quality, even of the box, i definately reccomend this store and product, fast shipping, good price, this nail tips are a very strong white, and very sturdy! i love this nail tips and will be ordering from them again</li>
    <li> Item as described in online documentation.  Product shipped quickly and was correct item ordered.  Would purchase again, price is fair.</li>
    <li> They are really Great nails I really enjoyed them ! And they only took 3 days to get here :) I use them to do nail art and they work great&lt;br /&gt;Seller I bought from was&lt;br /&gt;-payless nail supply</li>
    <li> purchased this product along with the clear, both durable and fun to play with!! i also just use them for nail art designs along with the acrylic set up!! so i have plenty to spare with all 550 pcs i received</li>
    <li> I got these after christmas .It was packaged well but has not been given to the person it was bought for</li>
    <li> I like them. you can cut, shape, color easily and light weight on my fingers. Appropriate price for the amount of 550 pcs. So yesss I think I hit the ( Good Deal )</li>
    <li> ,I don&#x27;t know why I keep forgetting that fact, but I bought these tips because of their price, which was great, but now all I have is a case of expensive practice nails.... these tips are so thin that even after several coats of hard shellac they bend and break easily. In the last two weeks, I&#x27;ve had to repair three broke nails. I am a stay at home mom, so I would say I&#x27;m not overly hard on my hands, I would say it&#x27;s NORMAL use, and I don&#x27;t wear my nails long (I still have diapers to change), so unless you have great acrylic, or never use your hands, I would seriously consider stronger tips. But hey, at least I have new practice nails for art!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this set of nails. Plenty of sizes to choose from and and a good quality. Can is sturdy as well.</li>
    <li> Make sure you have Fresh nail glue, or these WILL NOT Stick.Plenty of nails to choose from, I have been doing my own nails for about 9 years and i would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I just started doing my own nails and this was exactly what I needed. The quality is great and the nail tips work out perfect.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this tips since they comes with a box as well, but I got the tips and saw that they were full moon I was very disappointed....trying to return them but can&#x27;t find the way....</li>
