      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>However, the Love Thighself cream smells wonderful.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is mildly pleasant (somewhat vanilla-ish) and in no way overpowering.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent, and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use.</li>
      <li>and I loved the coconut citrus scent that smelled like a tropical drink.</li>
      <li>It was not as good as I was expecting</li>
      <li>good</li>
      <li>I personally loved the smell</li>
      <li>It is a good moisturizer though,</li>
      <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s the good news.</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant smell and I find it goes on smooth and moisturizes well.</li>
      <li>OK, the good: this is a superior body moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely tropical scent!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love Thighself Toning Cellulite Cream!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so amazing,</li>
      <li>this lotion on another as an honest to goodness science experiment.</li>
      <li>but this product mixed the best parts of all of them for a really great result.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the cream, it smells good, and make the skin softer and smoother.</li>
      <li>nice thing about this product is that it has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>However, I will use up the rest of the bottle since it does feel and smell so nice.</li>
      <li>Well, I was a skeptic about this, but since it was a trial bottle I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt - maybe it would be just some nice cream for my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My guy friend, goes on about the nice scent.  </li>
      <li>not greasy feeling at all, and smells really nice.  </li>
      <li>and I felt sexy and loved wearing shorts more often.  </li>
      <li>I liked the smell better.  </li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;m older and about 20 pounds over my ideal weight, so to me this is even move</li>
      <li>Ok, the smell is very strong.</li>
      <li>This is a win all-around!</li>
      <li>Since I focused on those areas more</li>
      <li>Just remember that this doesn&#x27;t remove cellulite (nor does any cream/lotion), but the massage can lessen the appearance of it, and exercise can do the most to make it vanish.</li>
      <li>Apply twice daily for best results.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you can ignore the moniker, this is actually a worthwhile product.</li>
      <li>I wish I would have taken a picture to have a better idea of the effect this product had on my legs.</li>
      <li>Thigh Love You, blow yourself a kiss and take on the day.  </li>
      <li>Thigh Love You, blow yourself a kiss and take on the day, sexy.  </li>
      <li>I will feel a ton better in a bathing suit now that the dimples are smoothed over.  </li>
      <li>I love the name Booty Parlor</li>
      <li>First of all, the smell is amazing!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Even if it worked better</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t order this one any more</li>
      <li>but it is ok</li>
      <li>I like the sexy packaging and the pump style container</li>
      <li>Creams tend not to be magic, but squats?</li>
      <li>Squats are definitely magical.</li>
      <li>I think that the people who got favorable results may have just needed a better exercise regime.  </li>
      <li>and I do not like the feeling of it laying on top of my skin, like  a layer of residue.</li>
      <li>I recommend tanning while using this cream, it&#x27;ll make your legs look so sexy :)</li>
      <li>At most, everyone seems to collectively think that you could get a bit of toning doing squats and plies (as suggested on the box) while rubbing any lotion into your skin for 30 seconds at a time.</li>
      <li>I also love that the ingredients are safe and there is nothing objectionable there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You may need to use this more than two weeks to see results.</li>
      <li>I love anything coconut</li>
      <li>Even doing the cute added instructions &amp;#34;10 squats&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Cream has a lovely citrus/coconut smell.</li>
      <li>Well, I love the texture.</li>
      <li>All in all, this worked better than Nivia&#x27;s lotion - plus</li>
      <li>(love handles).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will continue to use the product until the bottle runs out, and then I will update my review to reflect changes, if any, that result from more continual use.</li>
      <li>thought it was especially funny</li>
      <li>Oh, you are also supposed to say, “Thigh love you, blow yourself a kiss, and take on the day, sexy.”  </li>
      <li>- hope may work  :)</li>
      <li>This item is a two lane highway going towards very different destinations: one a wonderful place and</li>
      <li>Been using this for more than three weeks.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I’m all for the love thighself philosophy.</li>
      <li>As a mother of 3 I was very excited to try this.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It does smell pretty nice, though, but I would NOT pay $40 for a do-nothing cream that just smells nice.  </li>
      <li>It feels good to massage cream onto your skin, to groom and care for yourself, and to pay attention to yourself (in this case your body) in a positive way.</li>
      <li>But since Amazon Vine offered it to me for free, I have cellulite, and all the reviews promised magic, I decided I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using the lotion, hoping to erase some years of the legs, but will be happy with even the improvement that I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
      <li>is easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is however a bit strong and might clash with your perfume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of strong coconut or vanilla -</li>
      <li>In general, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The FatGirlSlim version is a thinner formula, with more of a medicinal smell - it&#x27;s not a bad smell, but nothing as luscious as the Sleep version.</li>
      <li>Smell is fine, there is nothing offensive with the scent although I cannot recognize the coconut citrus smell on the label.  </li>
      <li>It dispenses a dime sized amount and the lid snaps securely shut for easy transporting in my bag.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It IS nice thick skin cream, the scent is light and pleasant and - it works!  </li>
      <li>It did nothing to smooth out the skin or lessen the dimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s more effective if your skin is more dimpled.</li>
      <li>And as nice of a moisturizer as it is, it&#x27;s VERY expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried several cellulite or slimming lotions/creams over the years. The thing to know is that NONE of them can remove cellulite or slim you. NONE. It is just not possible. The only way to remove cellulite is liposuction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some creams that work to lessen the APPEARANCE of cellulite  by temporarily smoothing the skin a little bit. This effect can last hours but it is NOT a permanent solution and it does not get rid of cellulite or fat. It is typically caffeine that tightens up the skin and smooths it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular cream smells good - like suntan lotion - but performs badly. It is thick and lays on top of the skin like silicone. If you get wet at all, it runs off your skin like goo. Hours after applying it, if you wash your hands, it still runs off of your hands in a white slimy mess. It did nothing to smooth out the skin or lessen the dimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product that actually does work, is made by Bliss and is called FatGirlSleep or FatGirlSlim. I prefer FatGirlSleep because of the amazingly wonderful lavender scent. It is a very thick and rich lotion that comes in a tub. It absorbs into the skin and makes it super soft and smooth and actually hydrates. It is pricy, but oh so worth it. It is divine and it actually works like it says it will. You can tell a difference when you use it, even the first time. The FatGirlSlim version is a thinner formula, with more of a medicinal smell - it&#x27;s not a bad smell, but nothing as luscious as the Sleep version. A lot of times you can buy a bonus set at Sephora that has full size tubs of both versions in it. The set is cheaper than buying them both separately, if you&#x27;d like to try both. You can buy them separately of course, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend Booty Parlor. It is fairly gross, as far as I am concerned. I do not like the silicone, slopped on feel and I do not like the feeling of it laying on top of my skin, like  a layer of residue. Of course the real deciding factor is that it just doesn&#x27;t work.  If you&#x27;re looking for a cellulite cream, do yourself a favor and try FatGirlSleep because it is definitely worth it. It is so indulgent and has results you can see. I use it all over my body actually. It is heavenly.at it just doesn&#x27;t work.

    <li> I saw no improvements after using this product.  My thighs are the worst part of my body, so I had high hopes for a product that would make any positive change to them.  Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t.  The packaging wasn&#x27;t hard to open, but the small plug cap for the opening tip was a bit unusual.  It wouldn&#x27;t have been a bad idea for them to mention that and how to open it.  That was a tiny oversight.  The first real problem that I found was within the instructions.  It says to massage over the thigh area for thirty seconds, then to do 10 squats and 10 plies in the mirror.  Say Thigh Love You, blow yourself a kiss and take on the day.  Apply twice a day for best results.  First of all, I don&#x27;t understand why any instructions would have you look in the mirror and talk to yourself.  Mind control?!  Also to say do ten squats and ten plies, but not explain what they are and how to do them?!  Fortunately I took ballet and gymnastics when I was little, but the average person may now know how to do either one.  In the end are you supposed to notice the difference from the exercises?  I think that the people who got favorable results may have just needed a better exercise regime.  On a positive note, it smells good and does moisturize your skin, but I would try the exercises with regular lotion before you buy this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been about 3 weeks since I started using the toning cream. I think there&#x27;s some improvement, but still a long ways to go. I&#x27;m 61, and maybe not the best person to get good results, due to being older, less elasticity in my skin. It is a good moisturizer though, not greasy feeling at all, and smells really nice.  My guy friend, goes on about the nice scent.  He thinks it smells like coconut, or marshmallows. I&#x27;ll keep using the lotion, hoping to erase some years of the legs, but will be happy with even the improvement that I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
    <li> This cream has a very pleasant scent. It is however a bit strong and might clash with your perfume. So I&#x27;d say this is best to use at night. It has a caffeine complex in it and a Japanese parsley extract plus seaweed ivy and rosemary. I like the sexy packaging and the pump style container is easy to use. This is best used along with an exercise routine. You may need to use this more than two weeks to see results. I&#x27;m still trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Coconut citrus?  I love anything coconut so I didn’t really care about the cellulite part of this.  (In any case, the research does not support this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was especially funny that you are supposed to do ten squats and 10 pli&amp;eacute;s after putting the lotion on.  You don’t actually need the lotion if you are going to do 10 squats and 10 pli&amp;eacute;s every time you put the lotion on.  Oh, you are also supposed to say, “Thigh love you, blow yourself a kiss, and take on the day, sexy.”  That makes it worth the price, right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m all for the love thighself philosophy.</li>
    <li> Ok, the smell is very strong. I can still smell it on my legs at least for 15-20 mins after applying it. If I did not like the smell this would be a problem. I am not sure it is making my legs look better, but there is a chance that they do so I am going to keep using this product. I wish I would have taken a picture to have a better idea of the effect this product had on my legs.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth.  Seems to have a little effect on the dreaded C effect.  My test area is the upper arm area (seems to show improvement quickest) and I feel like I see improvement in the firmness of the skin. I like it well enough I pumped some into a two ounce bottle to carry on a flight:)  I like to use a product like this when I have on a sleeveless or cap sleeve shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is mildly pleasant (somewhat vanilla-ish) and in no way overpowering.  I enjoy that the can doesn&#x27;t squish and it&#x27;s a simple push pump.  I don&#x27;t know how it will do when it&#x27;s near empty and will update when I get near the bottom.</li>
    <li> It is hard to accurately measure results with products like these. We&#x27;re not scientists afterall, and the placebo effect is a very real thing. The packaging is funny and entertaining so it makes me want to like it. It has things like caffeine which makes me think it works. I think though, largely, in the directions is tells you to do 10 squats every morning, that probably has more to do with any results than the cream. Creams tend not to be magic, but squats? Squats are definitely magical.</li>
    <li> Please ladies do yourself a favor and buy this incredible product! It&#x27;s so amazing, I used to have a lot of cellulite on my thighs and butt, but now after using this for 2-3 weeks my legs looks so much slimmer, firm and toned. I recommend tanning while using this cream, it&#x27;ll make your legs look so sexy :)</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is really doing anything for cellulite. I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks and don&#x27;t notice a change in that regard, however it&#x27;s a deep conditioning moisturizer with the most amazing smell on the planet... People remark all the time about how &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; I smell. If you don&#x27;t have any cellulite and are looking for a cheaper option try Heavenly Earth Hemp Seed Body Lotion, Skinny Dip. I&#x27;m wondering if the same company makes these two products because the smell is almost exact. I use the two together. Great quality and the smell is the best of any lotion on the market.</li>
    <li> I have used this faithfully everyday for the past four weeks, and don&#x27;t see any difference in my legs where cellulite is a problem. To be perfectly honest, I was skeptical that it would work because I have read that cellulite is an issue below the surface that can&#x27;t be solved by creams. Nonetheless, I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why three stars if it didn&#x27;t work? Well, I love the texture. It is not at all greasy, and I don&#x27;t have to wait for twenty minutes for it to soak into my skin before I can get dressed. Additionally, it smells wonderful. The scent is light and fresh, but not overpowering. My husband even complimented me on it the first day I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it? It is a little expensive to buy for its texture and scent, but I would consider it.</li>
    <li> This product directs you to engage in a series of leg exercises after every application and its my impression that any improvement the user sees is due to those exercises, and not the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the cream is fine, it doesn&#x27;t stink, or burn, or anything like that. But it seems totally ineffective. Save your money and just exercise instead.</li>
    <li> With a name like that how can you go wrong! Lol I showed my wife this and she was very interested in trying this neither of us have ever heard of this before. After using it for a few weeks she said she did not notice a big change but she said her thighs did feel a lot softer and smoother. I personally loved the smell so I used it on my dry hands and it surprisingly did a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great bottle too!</li>
    <li> Not so.  Been using this for more than three weeks.  I thought it was promising when I notice parts that turns a little bit red; must be the cream working its thing.  Anyway, not much difference after three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not greasy but takes some time to absorb.  Smell is fine, there is nothing offensive with the scent although I cannot recognize the coconut citrus smell on the label.  Will continue to use until it is gone - hope may work  :)</li>
    <li> For this cellulite cream, they say it works best if you use it two times per day (massage it in the area for 30 seconds) and then do 10 squats and 10 plies. I started out with this routine, but simple as it seems, I could not keep up with it. I did end up using the product about once a day....and I must say, it smells really good!! I also like how it absorbs quickly. In general, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. The product says you should begin to notice a difference in cellulite in about 3 weeks, but I must say, I haven&#x27;t noticed much. Perhaps it would be different if I were able to keep up with the routine....not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the product until the bottle runs out, and then I will update my review to reflect changes, if any, that result from more continual use.</li>
    <li> Booty Parlor&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Booty Parlors other firming cream &amp;#34;Flirty Little Secret&amp;#34; which is intended for full body use the Love Thighself Toning Cream is a firming and toning cream specifically for you thighs, hips, behind and stomach (love handles).  It is intended to reduce the appearance of Cellulite and help prevent it from coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cream has a lovely citrus/coconut smell. It&#x27;s not too thick in texture and rubs in easily and after a few minutes the lotions feel disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a Caffeine infused cream which is one of  the main active ingredients and fighters of cellulite. The other two are IsoNari a Japanese parsley extract which inhibits fat production and improves the look of dimpled skin. And Polyplant Anti-Cellulite which is a mixture of vegetable extracts containing Seaweed, Ivy, Bitter Orange and Rosemary. The cream also contains no Sulfates, Petrochemicals, Parabens  or phthalates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the big ??? does it work? As a mother of 3 I was very excited to try this.  I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 2 1/2 weeks now. Even doing the cute added instructions &amp;#34;10 squats&amp;#34;. I will say that I have noticed my larger dimples slim down considerably. Since I focused on those areas more I&#x27;m not sure how effective it was on the smaller ones but it definitely showed some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth a try, it&#x27;s not a weight loss produce just a skin firming/cellulite reduction cream.  I will definitely be getting some more and would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I like this cream despite the fact that I&#x27;ve noticed no reduction in the appearance of cellulite on my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the ingredients in the cream have been shown to reduce the appearance of cellulite temporarily but it&#x27;s important to realize that these effects won&#x27;t be permanent. I didn&#x27;t notice any effects temporary or otherwise. I even followed the instructions to apply and then do 10 squats and 10 pliés (these exercises would likely do more to help with cellulite than any cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even though it hasn&#x27;t helped the cellulite I still use it. It has a very pleasant smell and I find it goes on smooth and moisturizes well. It&#x27;s a new part of my morning routine. I also love that the ingredients are safe and there is nothing objectionable there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a cheap product so I would hesitate to buy if you are only doing so for the cellulite claim.</li>
    <li> To tell the truth, the name of this product ensures that I&#x27;d never buy it in a real store. How embarrassing. I&#x27;m actually embarrassed to review it. But since Amazon Vine offered it to me for free, I have cellulite, and all the reviews promised magic, I decided I&#x27;d give it a try. The reviews promised some results after 2 weeks with real results after 4 weeks. 3 weeks into the experiment, I looked back at the reviews. And the funny thing was that the Amazon Viners who had given this a try seemed to nearly all be experiencing the same thing as me: nothing. At most, everyone seems to collectively think that you could get a bit of toning doing squats and plies (as suggested on the box) while rubbing any lotion into your skin for 30 seconds at a time. One person even went as far as to put regular lotion on one leg and this lotion on another as an honest to goodness science experiment. The results were the same for both legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nice thing about this product is that it has a nice smell. It smells almost exactly like [[ASIN:B000TBZCF8 Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Tummy Butter - 4.4 oz]].  So if you&#x27;d like to use it as a nice-smelling, expensive leg moisturizer, then it&#x27;s a great product. If you&#x27;d like the same smell for less, try Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter.  If you&#x27;re expecting cellulite removal, keep on looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ... onto the ingredients which range from possibly causing allergies or cancer to possibly being immune-system toxic. Yay! I&#x27;ve listed the source of the ingredients, purposes, and possible side-effects below. Interestingly, it&#x27;s the fragrance additives that seem to be the worst offenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), C12-15 Alkyl Bensoat (a mixture of benzoic acid esters) , Glycerin, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride (a mixed triester of glycerin and caprylic and capric acids used for fragrance and skin-conditioning), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (skin-conditioning agent, occlusive, emollient), Propanediol (used as a building block for polymers, may cause skin irritation), Ethylhexyl Palmitate (a branched saturated fatty ester, may cause skin irritation), PEG-100 Stearate (ma polyethylene glycol ester of stearic acid, non-reproductive organ system toxic), Glyceryl Stearate (lipid used as a surfactanc and emulsifying agent), Cetyl Alcohol (an organic alcohol found in spermaceti from sperm whales or dolphins, non-reproductive organ system toxic), Caffeine (masking, skin-conditioning), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer (gelling agent), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (skin conditioning), Silica (bulking and suspending agent), Dimethicone (silicon-based polymer used for conditioning, non-reproductive organ system toxicity), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter (fruit-derived fatty acids for conditioning and viscosity control), Isohexadecane (petroleum component used as a skin conditioner and emollient, non-reproductive organ system toxic), Fragrance (Parfum), Gloconolactone (fragrance), Coffee Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract (fragrance and skin conditioning), Synthetic Fluorphlogopite (synthetic mineral based on fluorine, bulking agent, viscosity-controlling), Sorbitan Isostearate (synthetic surfactant composed of sorbitol and fatty acid, surfactant, emulsifying agent), Sodium Benzoate (preservative, fragrance, non-reproductive organ system toxic), Polysorbate 60 (emulsifier and surfactant, contamination concerns), Lecithin (naturally occuring lipids found in both plants and animals;

    <li> After nearly 4 weeks, my wife and I agree that the primary effects of this product are cosmetic and psychological. It feels good to massage cream onto your skin, to groom and care for yourself, and to pay attention to yourself (in this case your body) in a positive way. My wife&#x27;s daily use of this cream certainly seems to have made a visual difference (though I saw no need for a difference to begin with), which she is pleased with. I would say this product is for the most part an expensive (I would say overpriced) leg moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! The company I work with sells it and it is amazing!!</li>
    <li> The packaging copy for this product cracks me up! Because if you can&#x27;t have a sense of humor about cellulite cream, then you&#x27;re not fully living your life! I love this stuff. I can tell it&#x27;s working already in just a few weeks. First of all, the smell is amazing! I tried another cream a while back that almost made me throw up because it smelled so bad. This is a lovely tropical scent! Next, I like how thick it is, but still easy to rub in. And last....it&#x27;s working! I see my thighs getting smoother! I&#x27;m using it on the back side of thighs, not the front or sides. This is a win all-around!</li>
    <li> SO is it the exercise or the cream?  As per the instructions you should exercise before with the use of this product for best results.  My other half tried this out for 3 weeks .  And I have to say it was a noticeable difference.  She followed the instructions and exercised with each application to maximize results.  SO why only 4 stars...the smell...its not off putting but its not a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; smell either..basicly it smells like talcum powder...which fine for a baby but off when you&#x27;re 40.</li>
    <li> No effect on thigh cellulite; dry brushing works better!</li>
    <li> First, the name and logo of this product is a little corny, but it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;worst named&amp;#34; product on the market.  I believe that goes to the &amp;#34;Master Baiter&amp;#34; tackle box/fishing lure kit, but I digress.  As a &amp;#34;plus sized&amp;#34; woman, I do have the need to tone my thighs, and while I don&#x27;t really think any product applied to the skin can break up fat underneath, I decided to give this lotion a try, to see if it could improve the texture of my skin.  The lotion itself is thick and a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but not to an off putting degree.  The smell, a coconut/citrus combo, smells wonderful.  After applying the cream nightly for a week my sheets have a distinctive coconut citrus smell, but not unpleasantly so.  According to the package, after applying the cream, the user should follow with 10 squats and 10 pli&amp;eacute;s.  This should be done twice a day.  The package also says results may take a minimum of 2 weeks to be noticeable.  Now, I&#x27;m no personal trainer, but I think think that 10 squats and 10 pli&amp;eacute;s twice a day should produce some sort of results in two weeks - which begs the question, is the lotion &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; or are the squats finally making a difference? I think we all know the answer to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do like the smell of this cream, and it has made the skin on my thighs very soft and smooth.  I have noticed a slight difference in the texture of the cellulite on my legs, but I honestly don&#x27;t know if that difference is from the squats that I have been religiously performing, or from the magic of this cream.  In the spirit of &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; I may try the lotion without doing any squats, and see if the conditions of my thighs continue to improve.</li>
    <li> Calling it a cellulite cream is the major factor in my only giving two stars. I does nothing to tame, minimize, reduce cellulite.  The name is tacky and the outer packaging is  obnoxious. It is a thick, heavy cream and is slow to absorb so I was not able to use it in the morning when I need to get out the door to work.  It works well enough as a moisturizing cream overnight.  I really did not expect cellulite impact with this one so I wasn&#x27;t really disappointed BUT it is important to keep in mind that it does not live up to its claims.  Even if it worked better I would not buy it because of the packaging.  It looks like something that would be found in the a tiny ad in the back of some porn mag.  Kind of insulting.</li>
    <li> I started using this about four weeks ago to get ready for a beach vacation (who hasn&#x27;t had enough of winter this year?).  After two weeks, even my husband noticed the results.  Four weeks later there is a significant reduction in the dimpling on my thighs.  I&#x27;m not a skinny girl, and this product didn&#x27;t help me lose weight - but it did make my skin look smoother and more firm.  I will feel a ton better in a bathing suit now that the dimples are smoothed over.  The box suggests you do some squats and plies each day.. I&#x27;ll admit I didn&#x27;t do that part consistently at all and I still saw results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a unique scent - it isn&#x27;t heavy coconut (which is good).  There is a citrus-y note to the scent that is light - and perhaps just a touch of vanilla.  I couldn&#x27;t totally place the scent, but it was &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m not a fan of strong coconut or vanilla - but this product mixed the best parts of all of them for a really great result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is creamy, blends in smooth and soaks into my skin.  As a lotion, the hydration lasts all day and then some and my skin feels super soft.  All in all, this worked better than Nivia&#x27;s lotion - plus I liked the smell better.  Nivia felt good going on, but my skin would be dry and itchy later in the day. This lotion was worth the extra money and I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle.</li>
    <li> Well, I was a skeptic about this, but since it was a trial bottle I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt - maybe it would be just some nice cream for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It IS nice thick skin cream, the scent is light and pleasant and - it works!  I decided to just apply it to one thigh for 10 days in a row, and the difference is remarkable!  My thigh looks smoother and much less cottage-cheesy.  I would never have thought it possible with a cream.  Now, I&#x27;m older and about 20 pounds over my ideal weight, so to me this is even move amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I also have a soft spot in my heart for a product that reminds you to tell yourself that you love you.  This is such an important thing for us women to remember - that we are worthy of love, especially from ourselves, no matter what the physical body looks like.</li>
    <li> While no cream can totally banish cellulite this cream boosted my confidence and I loved the coconut citrus scent that smelled like a tropical drink. I used it for nearly four weeks and slathered it on my thighs and tummy area and it reduced the areas of cellulite and I felt sexy and loved wearing shorts more often.  I liked the easy dispensing pump bottle that was easy to spot in my vast array of products on my counter top. It dispenses a dime sized amount and the lid snaps securely shut for easy transporting in my bag.  I put the cream on straight out of the shower on slightly damp skin.</li>
    <li> I love the cream, it smells good, and make the skin softer and smoother. I like that they encourage you to do some squats and and such, this will sure improve one&#x27;s health and appearance. The name of the cream makes me smile. It is not a magic &amp;#34;drop 20 pounds and look 20 years younger&amp;#34; cream, of course, but who would truly expect that?&lt;br /&gt;I like how my skin feels after using it for a few weeks. I like that I exercise more simply because when I look at the bottle, it makes me smile and it serves as a reminder to move more. Of course, you do not need to buy the cream to get the same results, but the cream feels like something to indulge yourself with, unnecessary, but fun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if my cellulite is any more toned due to the cream or because I&#x27;ve followed the directions on the bottle, which recommend that I &amp;#34;massage into skin for thirty seconds, do ten squats and ten plies in the mirror.&amp;#34;  I have a hunch that any results I&#x27;ve seen have more to do with the squats and plies than the cream.  However, the Love Thighself cream smells wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now, and my legs have never felt softer.</li>
    <li> OK, the good: this is a superior body moisturizer. It has a pleasant scent, and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use. It does a great job of softening the skin, it absorbs well, and it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the good news. The bad, well....it doesn&#x27;t get rid of cellulite. I did as instructed (even the plies) for two weeks. Cellulite&#x27;s still there. And as nice of a moisturizer as it is, it&#x27;s VERY expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you like the scent or the softening effect on your skin and price isn&#x27;t an issue, have at it. Otherwise, unless you love being told expensive fairy tales, there are other moisturizers that can do the job at a much better price.</li>
    <li> It was not as good as I was expecting but it is ok I won&#x27;t order this one any more</li>
    <li> I love the name Booty Parlor Love Thighself Toning Cellulite Cream! It puts a smile on my face each morning and I am not a morning person so already this product is doing something positive! The smell is wonderful! I want to eat the stuff. It has a similar texture and smell to Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; Milk and Honey Lotion and their coconut lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find it odd that I had to rub lotion into my thighs for 30 seconds. However, the lotion was non greasy and was absorbed quickly. I never thought to moisturize my thighs before but it did make them feel smoother and softer. Who knew I had dry thighs? On the box, it states to do 10 squats and 10 plies but that is probably the true secret as to why the product works. Adding moisture to skin helps to smooth it out and can take away some dimpling because it helps to plump the skin out. However, the exercise tightens it giving it the appearance that the lotion removed cellulite. Does it hurt to give your thighs a little massage, exercise, and moisturizer? Absolutely not! Nevertheless, you do not have to buy this product to get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, when cellulite removal creams were all the rage, I had purchased a couple of them. None of them worked. It was stated by doctors back then that cellulite could not be removed by a cream. I still believe that fact. However, I will use up the rest of the bottle since it does feel and smell so nice. You can use it as a body cream as well. In the end, there is no magic formula to remove cellulite. Doing exercise, massaging the area with lotion daily, drinking lots of water, and eating right are the true answers to making the thighs look better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this lotion. Smells great. Firms. Even has a tiny bit of sparkle to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for three weeks and haven&#x27;t thus far noticed any effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite, so it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s more effective if your skin is more dimpled. But I strongly suspect that what&#x27;s really happening is that after 2-4 weeks of daily squats/lunges, most women just have more muscle in their thighs and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s causing the skin tightening/reduction in dimpling, not this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the packaging incredibly twee. The scent was pleasant and light, but it was not enough moisture to keep my skin from drying out in between applications (so it&#x27;s not a good replacement for my usual moisturizer). But I live in the desert, so your mileage may vary on that front.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s early to really tell, my wife believes this cellulite cream is actually working. With so many miracle cures out there, it&#x27;s hard to really believe all the wild claims products make these days. The truth about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t remove or reduce cellulite. That would not be possible in the physical realm in which we currently live. What it actually does do is smooth the rippled skin over the cellulite it doesn&#x27;t remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a purpose, and a place in the market. It is useful and does what it claims to do. If you&#x27;re looking for that miracle product that melts fat away overnight with no effort on your part, this ain&#x27;t it. If you want a product that moisturizes and smooths your legs and butt, this could be what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
    <li> When I accepted this item for review, I must admit I was skeptical, and I&#x27;m equally so now.  I did a controlled experiment where each time I used regular, store brand lotion on one side (same side each time) and used this cream on the other side.  The results were both sides had some improvement in equal amounts.  It&#x27;s not the specific cream or lotion that does the trick, it&#x27;s the massage and exercise.  Save your money and use your favorite lotion or cream for the exact same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Besides the fact that the cream does nothing special, it has extremely grating text (such as the name of the product) on the packaging that make me want to throw it across the room.  Here&#x27;s a sample from the directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Massage over thigh area for 30 seconds.  Do 10 squats and 10 plies in the mirror.  Say Thigh Love You, blow yourself a kiss and take on the day, sexy.  Apply twice daily for best results.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell pretty nice, though, but I would NOT pay $40 for a do-nothing cream that just smells nice.  Just remember that this doesn&#x27;t remove cellulite (nor does any cream/lotion), but the massage can lessen the appearance of it, and exercise can do the most to make it vanish.</li>
    <li> This item is a two lane highway going towards very different destinations: one a wonderful place and the other is a place you don&#x27;t want to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: it has a wonderful scent, goes on without feeling sticky, absorbs well, and works like a charm. Improvements are noticeable after ten days, at least with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: the marketing is just god awful! The name of the company, the demeaning &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; on how to use the product. Are we marketing to immature people? Are we really supposed to take this seriously? I don&#x27;t meant to sound like a stiff collared girl, but come on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can ignore the moniker, this is actually a worthwhile product. 5 stars for the product, 2 stars for the advertising.</li>
