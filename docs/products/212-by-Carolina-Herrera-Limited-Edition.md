      <li>smells like money on top of fame on top of seductive leather on top of a grand piano on top of an ocean breeze on top of honor on top of an eagle on top of a rich conquistador named Edwardo Monticello.</li>
      <li>Pure quality with welcoming aroma making everyone feels good around you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the scent is perfect but less longer that Macy&#x27;s one.</li>
    <li> El perfume es falso. This is fake</li>
    <li> I love all Caroline Herrera perfumes for men and women.  This was a present for my son and I just knew he would love it- he did.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
    <li> I use to change colognes often, since the stores offer so many to choose from.  But when you find the right one, you stick with it.  I found 212 Men about 10 years ago and still use it faithfully.  Such a pleasant smell without being over powering.  And it stays with you all day.  I recieve many compliments when I wear 212 Men. Give it a try...</li>
    <li> I brought this for my husband and he ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!! Has a very fresh; clean smell and a small amount goes a very long way... the price is also a plus; $30 cheaper than the mall. Definitely an AWESOME buy!!!</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> i will change this review when i receive it i try to contact them but got no reply just saying be careful if your getting this</li>
    <li> This is an oldie but goodie, got this for my husband in the 1.5 version and he ended up loving it so i got it the full size. Is fresh yet elegant cannot stop sniffing my husband when he wears it. Works as a great gift as well, since been so fresh, citrus-y  is easy to wear, but I only recommended for young people.</li>
    <li> First of all, it&#x27;s the first time i buy a perfume from amazon and i&#x27;m impressed, i got my order within 2 days, super fast, so thats why i&#x27;m buying all my perfumes here from now on. This perfume smells good, it&#x27;s not too strong. I reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto yo lo uso m&amp;aacute;s d 10 a&amp;ntilde;os y comprarlo esta ve z en amzaon me lleg&amp;oacute; a tiempo muchas gracias se los recomiendo</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best smelling cologne ever. I love it and would recommend it to anyone! I will always be a huge fan of 212. The greatest part is that you don&#x27;t need much to smell good all day.</li>
    <li> Authentic and one spray lasts you the whole day, this cologne is one of my favorite and will continue buying this once I am out of it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn all the main stream cologne, expen$ive to affordable and by far this scent gets noticed, and complimented by more woman (even a lot of men) Than anything I&#x27;ve ever worn. It&#x27;s almost impulsive for woman to compliment on it. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. Great scent, nothing can be confused with it. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought already 2 212 Carolina Herrera parfumes and got exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments for this cologne, and unlike Fahrenheit (which also drew lots of positive responses) it&#x27;s not a cologne that every third guy is wearing.  Very unique, intriguing scent---unlike any other cologne I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that on me, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last all that long.  The lady at the department store where I bought this was shocked to hear that, but said that colognes react differently to each person&#x27;s skin chemistry, and suggested that I try \\&quot;layering\\&quot; it with the matching deodorant and soap.  That seemed like an overly expensive proposition so I just moved on to a different cologne when my bottle was finally finished.  Kind of miss it though.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this smell. I don&#x27;t really get the grass smell, that I keep reading about. I smell, I guess, would be the start of fresh cut grass, but it quickly changes to something else. Wish I would of found this years ago. Its a unique smell. Someone else said it on here, &amp;#34;genuine man smell&amp;#34;. About spot on. Its like all the great smells, together, and you get to rush by them ,in the perfect order.  I have this in front of my Lacoste. The smell lasts at least 6-8 hours. You don&#x27;t need a shower with it. One spray will do.  Thanks so much!! Fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the parfum one month ago and since then it had been a complete success with my girlfriend. She loves it and also my friends have very good opinions about it. Long-lasting effect guarantee.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product for my boyfriend. I received it in good condition and new. As I wanted. I recommend it, great brand and flavor.</li>
    <li> for years i use this perfect fragance , is very fresh for your body and clothes, i really love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received the product, nice service! The package arrived in perfect conditions, and the parfum itself is pretty good! Tks</li>
    <li> Overall Rating: 4.5/5 - seasonal, rotation worthy, potential signature scent depending on climate, an &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; essential&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deal or no deal description: fresh, clean, mass appealing, business casual green -open and inviting but not a &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; scent, won&#x27;t drive the ladies wild but it won&#x27;t drive them away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;Detailed Description&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backstory&lt;br /&gt;I first sampled this scent in a Sephora last summer after spraying a bunch of scents and blind sniffing. This one stood out to me in a great way. I made a mental note and bought this earlier in the year and tried it out on my skin (a partial blind buy if you will). The first couple of times I wore it I didn&#x27;t like it. So I put it on the shelf and pondered my disappointment. Was it my skin? Was it missing something that I didn&#x27;t notice the year before? Then I tried it again a couple of weeks ago and... Boom! Magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to the conclusion that this is truly a warmer weather scent. It shines in the warmer parts of Spring and well into the Summer. Looking back, when I didn&#x27;t like it I wore it during cooler months and the scent doesn&#x27;t mesh well with cooler climates. Don&#x27;t ask me how or why but that&#x27;s how my nose perceives it. So I would not recommend it to those that live in cooler, dryer areas. You love it so much more when it&#x27;s warm outside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nose/Scent: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;This is a very green light citrusy musk that opens up nicely with the smell of fresh cut grass. If you enjoy the warm weather outdoors of suburbia, sitting on the porch with friends/family then this scent is right up your alley. As it dries down, I detect a pleasant muskiness to it and a bit of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to compare it to another scent I would say it&#x27;s a lot like Light Blue by D&amp;G with more green. A lot more green. Like if you switched out the citrus and replaced it with grass. I know that may be hard to picture but I assure you 212 is every bit as fresh and pleasant to the noseas Light Blue. But whereas LB in my opinion could be worn every season 212 is more limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versatility: 4.5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put this scent will work almost anywhere whether casual or business. Wear it to ballgames with friends, the office, or on a casual date during the day. It is also healthcare friendly in my opinion if you work in that environment. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this at night. That&#x27;s really the only time this is held back. If you prefer peppery, heavy musk, vanilla, leather or anything that opens up with that alcoholic scent- anything that&#x27;s going to knock you down or grab attention when walking in a room- this is probably not what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Siliage:4.5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my skin I get 8-10 hours depending on the occasion. And I can still smell it on my shirt the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;This is a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; scent and if you&#x27;re looking for a warm weather signature scent that not a lot of people during this time of year then I would suggest reaching for this one. It is more &amp;#34;fresh and fun&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;dark and mysterious&amp;#34;. Keep that in mind. Also if you don&#x27;t own what called a green scent then this may be a good starting point for you.</li>
    <li> Its about simplicity and class. The scent is neither too strong nor mild,its just perfect for all times,sunny days or nights.Pure quality with welcoming aroma making everyone feels good around you.I have tried lots of perfumes,but I can confidently say Nothing comes without a doubt like the 212. I Love it and I wish most men and women will try it,and also be ready for lots and lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> great product nice shipping and best quality hope buy next time ur product agayn and enjoy them like this one thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it. It smells really good and i got it for a great price knowing its a large bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the only fragrance that I use. I have been using it for 10 years. I would recommend it highly</li>
    <li> It was delivered in just 2 days (I&#x27;d selected the regular free shipping option), that&#x27;s good and unusual &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;CH 212 is just the perfect perfum, I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while now and I&#x27;ve been being complimented for it ever since the first time I used it... I really dont buy any other products anymore, this one is just rite for any ocassion, place and time...</li>
    <li> I purchased this Eau De Toilette for a friend, although it is not my favorite fragrance I think I like it. It smells very good.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragances</li>
    <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this Item. I recommended to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> Is The same olor to 212 men ?</li>
    <li> i like, I like the fragrance, it&#x27;s very great,100% is recommended the product,meets all expectations,meets all expectations,meets all expectations,meets all expectations,</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend and I never had a chance to smell it before I bought it. It&#x27;s light and fresh smelling. Nice cologne for the summer</li>
    <li> The fragrances was basically nonexistent. The bottle looked old and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I buy this cologne for my husband every year. Sometimes he says that he wants to try something new, but I never let him. Why? Because 212 Men is incredibly sexy. He&#x27;s been stopped by women and men alike to ask what scent he&#x27;s wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a unique scent to try, don&#x27;t hesitate to try 212 Men. Just be prepared to get some attention for it.</li>
    <li> The parfum is amazing,Carolina herrera truly is one of my favourite parfum, no doubt about it, I still wanna buy the other ones.</li>
    <li> Great service and product!!!</li>
    <li> Great smell, long lasting.... I love it.</li>
    <li> This EDT is very long lasting, and is quite distinctive.  Has good sillage also.  My only negative comment about 212 is that it has a strong metallic scent -- It reminds me of the best smelling metal shavings you could imagine.  The strong metallic notes die down however, and leave a very strong confident tone.  So, if you are looking for something fresh and unique, this is certainly worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have used 212 by Carolina Herrera for many years. The one I receive is not original. I am trying to return it but I am getting a weird message that i should dispose hazardous materials properly.?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is that about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS IS NOT ORIGINAL.</li>
    <li> Very good! thank you...</li>
    <li> It is NOT a fake, but it is OLD. Produced in 2010, so the box says. The scent is real, it just fades away too quickly. And there&#x60;s no returns.</li>
    <li> Once I found this after shave about 20 years ago, I realized I would never look for another. The scent is delicious but subtle. The ladies love it. Try it; you&#x27;ll love it. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Carolina Herrera&#x27;s 212 fragrance for men. I used&lt;br /&gt;to buy it on Maxis&#x27; stores. The smooth perfume used to last longer&lt;br /&gt;than any other perfume. Unfortunately, the 212 fragrance I recently&lt;br /&gt;bought via Amazon.com does not last as expected (by half&lt;br /&gt;day the perfume is gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sergio</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my friend. He liked it.</li>
    <li> ESTA CALIFICACION ES DEBIDO A QUE EL PAQUETE ESTA RETENIDO, ME INDICA QUE RECHAZAN CARGOS A LA TARJETA, VERIFICANDO MI ESTADO EL PRODUCTO ESTA DEBITADO DE LA MISMA.</li>
    <li> i always get compliments when i wear this.  it&#x27;s a nice day-time, casual scent that i use for work.  i&#x27;m not sure i would use this at night, though.</li>
    <li> liked it alot and was very happy that it was good cologne and smells great. was happy with the product</li>
    <li> AWESOME COLOGNE MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTIONS OF COLOGNE IT&#x27;S BEEN IN MY COLLECTIONS FOR YEARS THE SCENT LAST ALL DAY I GET ASK A LOT WHAT I AM WEARING GET A LOT OF COMPLEMENTS!!!</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure that I actually received a original product. To begin with, the box was kind of altered. The part where the bar code was supposed to be was cut  with a precision knife and had a label on it instead. The box seemed to be cut with scissors in certain parts and then put together. Maybe the box is the less important thing. Regarding the bottle as such, it has a little hole in the bottom part. This is the first time I buy a 212 CH, so I don&#x27;t know if that little hole is supposed to be there. Be careful when buying this product. It might be a fraud...</li>
    <li> not deserve any star but only give the minimum no me option to qualify me feel really cheated with this product it opened the day January 1st me and placed and the smell does not last 20 minutes dissolves completely probe at night and probe around the next day and so does not last even 20 minutes seems very wrong to be allowed to sell products that are due and which are not original as it is not possible that anything not hold the scent and worst of all, and purchased even two identical perfume I have one sealed and I am very disappointed and indignant, idk if anyone can help me to claim or to do in these cases.</li>
    <li> I had the Herrera before about 10 years ago and I really like it but, this one so far I have had several compliments, it really smells good.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase, mmm smell so good, according to the request, very good service, 100% satisfied customer, thank for your attention...</li>
    <li> MUY BUENA ORIGINAL EXCELENTE PRODUCTO</li>
    <li> I have a bottle that I use for special occasions because this scent is one of the most pleasant ones I&#x27;ve ever been around. It&#x27;s not fruity or&lt;br /&gt;feminine. It&#x27;s not overpowering, it&#x27;s subtle but it definitely stands out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s young and sophisticated not childish or too old. It&#x27;s for a young professional.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> Perfume exquisite, good fragrance, I have no complaints, it&#x27;s perfect for the night, I&#x27;ll buy it again. Thanks for everything</li>
    <li> Glorious! Magnificent! Superb! But on a serious note....ITS GLORIOUS! MAGNIFICENT! SUPERB!!!! Hands down best cologne money can buy. i have bought this one brand 4 times in a row. If not misused it will last a very long time. 1-2 sprays on a shirt last until you wash the shirt. no joke. smells like money on top of fame on top of seductive leather on top of a grand piano on top of an ocean breeze on top of honor on top of an eagle on top of a rich conquistador named Edwardo Monticello. Just made that up...how u might ask? Because this cologne inspired the words through my nostrils....you&#x27;re welcome for this spot on, hit the nail on the head, without a doubt right on the money review....good day to you. be inspired.</li>

    <li> I did dare to buy my husband this perfume knowing the consequences , he loved it n so did his colleagues at work , so it goes without saying this is a great perfume for men.</li>
    <li> excellent !! very good</li>
    <li> This smells so good! My coworker even thought it smelled so good she bought some for her hubby and her son.  It&#x27;s the best smelling cologne I have ever smelled.  I found it through a sample I got for my boyfriend and we both loved it so I bought him the cologne and deodorant for his birthday, good stuff!</li>
    <li> 100% recommended !!!!!!!, got it perfect in Chile, 3 weeks to get it at my home with no problems at all</li>
    <li> Original product, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is my dad&#x27;s favorite scent and he received it the next day after I ordered it and in time for Christmas. I&#x27;m so thrilled and grateful for the consideration to send it early!</li>
    <li> Excelente Envio rapido tal cual lo queria en el momento de la compra, recomendado para todos los que quieran esto</li>
    <li> New - arrived as promised. Great wrapping to protect the item. Thank you</li>
    <li> this is my favorite cologne and sometimes can be hard to find. Now i know i wont have that problem anymore.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m 21 &amp; huge cologne and shoe fanatic..I have about 20 bottles of different stuff in my collection. Bottom line-if you&#x27;re a young guy, buy this stuff. 212 can be worn anytime of the day, but I feel like it is definitely more of a club/bar/night time scent for me. If you can find a woman that says she doesn&#x27;t like this stuff...she might not be a woman. The longevity is a good 5-6 hours and it&#x27;s one of those colognes that you will still smell when you wake up and on the shirt you wore the night before. 212 &amp; my other favorite classic, Cool Water, always get me compliments. Just finished my 1.7 oz &amp; ordered  a 3.4 oz today.</li>
    <li> This is a fake product... don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This smells great. Long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> I ended up finding 212 about 6 years ago when I did a search for scents that were appropriate for an office setting.  I fell in love with it, everyone who smells it falls in love with it, and my-now husband loves it even though he doesn&#x27;t normally like colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a bad experience with it.</li>
    <li> This was one of the gifts I got my son for his birthday and it was an incredible value. One of my concerns was whether it would be a fake and it wasn&#x27;t.  Hear that?  It was NOT a fake and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Back in day when my husband and I had our first infamous drunken bar night this was the cologne he wore and I dubbed him sex on wheels. This cologne had/has a straight road to my lady bits, its that good. I just ordered more for my hubby.</li>
    <li> Site muito bom, conciso e direto no assunto e prazos, o produto foi entregue corretamente e no prazo estipulado, eu recomendo muito bom!</li>
    <li> exelente producto rocomendado 100%</li>
    <li> ME HA SALIDO BIEN EL PRODUCTO ADQUIRIDO ATRAVEZ DE ESTE MEDIO QUE TAMBIEN HA SIDO MUY CONFIABLE Y PRACTICO PARA MI. GRACIAS.</li>
    <li> This is the original....love the way my hubby smells when wearing this cologne! Clean fresh scent! Good for anytime wear. Not strong or musky...kinda fruity maybe?</li>
