      <li>This feels nice on the face, and seems to work.  </li>
      <li>I have oily skin and get very light hormonal acne along my forehead.</li>
      <li>When I run out, my face screams at me to buy more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just really potent stuff.</li>
      <li>I kept buying additional products thinking they&#x27;d work better in combination.</li>

      <li>is of much more importance than it&#x27;s smell.</li>
      <li>I love all of his acne products.</li>
      <li>I am not too sure of its effectiveness, either.  </li>
      <li>This product from Peter Thomas Roth works like magic.</li>
      <li>I love PTR products</li>
      <li>I love that it is fragrance free and that it doesn&#x27;t make my face peel or bleach my clothes like peroxide treatments.</li>
      <li>My order was delivered to me really fast, in good condition.</li>
      <li>It is a bit strong, however, and can irritate the eyes if used to close to the eyes.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so strong you walk around smelling like rotten eggs all day.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have strong odors, and don&#x27;t bleach my sheets.</li>
      <li>Best acne medicine for adults, hands down.</li>
      <li>unless you use it all over, you should be fine.</li>
      <li>Philosophy discontinued their sulfur-based products, so I switched to this, and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>It really is that amazing. ...</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome, it is really the only thing that can stop my skin from breaking out.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this is the only spot treatment that has given me effective and immediate results.</li>
      <li>It has kind of a strong earthy scent, but I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It has significantly improved my acne.  </li>
      <li>This product works well enough, but I honestly don&#x27;t think it works any better than drugstore treatments like Clearasil and Zapzyt.</li>
      <li>(Then again, it may be the PTR treatment helping to keep my skin nice and clear!)</li>
      <li>Love the whole peter thomas roth line.</li>
      <li>and I love the whole peter thomas roth system.</li>
      <li>It has a mild stink from the sulfur, but nothing that will get in your way.</li>
      <li>It is such an important staple in my regimen, I make sure I have 2 on hand.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>I received it right away in sealed packaging.</li>
      <li>Works exceptionally well, but can be drying, so use carefully.</li>
      <li>Its far more gentle than Benzyl peroxide or Salacytic acid treatments.</li>
      <li>the plus side, it seems to work pretty well on my existing acne.</li>
      <li>i have pretty oily skin.</li>
      <li>Will continue to use in moderation, but not my first choice.</li>
      <li>After I gave birth, I struggled to control my acne and tried many different products.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Does EXACTLY what it says it does.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m planning to try something different (aka more affordable)</li>
      <li>it really works!  </li>
      <li>Instead there&#x27;s now barely an inch of my face free of a pimple.</li>
      <li>but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO</li>
      <li>it is very drying.  </li>
      <li>It is very gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my tretinoin treatment.</li>
      <li>I use this product at night when I get new break outs and it works!</li>
      <li>I cant live without my peter thomas roth!</li>
      <li>Decent value</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this for problem areas~</li>
      <li>and I normally have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its good for trouble spots or just a single acne spot.</li>
      <li>I generally can tolerate most products, but this one was a little to much for my liking.</li>
      <li>This is a new product for me.  </li>
      <li>(my skin is sensitive)!</li>
      <li>If my significant other had been using something as stinky as this around me, I think our relationship would have suffered.  </li>
      <li>For spot application, it really shrinks and heals flare-ups, and if you use it as a light daily treatment (spread it *very* thin, as it&#x27;s strong), it seems to really clear out the pores over time and smooths the skin surface as a result.</li>
      <li>I used this twice a day on my problem areas and I&#x27;m all clear now.  </li>
      <li>I have adult acne</li>
      <li>I have adult acne which is aggravated by exercise.  </li>
      <li>Maybe not the huge pussy ones, but almost a RASH of them in various sizes, most of which are hard, red and rough.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t listen to their claims, and be aware ONLY this SPOT treatment and their sulfur masque actually HAVE SULFUR IN THEM!!!!</li>
      <li>One, the price is high for a product that doesn&#x27;t have the most quality ingredients - I expect that a high end brand like PTR would have gotten rid of all the scary chemicals like parabens (which are banned in Europe because they apparently give you cancer.)</li>
      <li>It works really well, however it does dry your skin.  </li>
      <li>This products seems to dry my skin out way too much</li>
      <li>I have battled with (hormonal cystic) acne my entire life (now a mature adult).</li>
      <li>But you must be careful too much too frequently</li>
      <li>Looks like the bottle I received is old and has obviously been opened</li>
      <li>Obviously, no spot treatment will stop new acne from starting.</li>
      <li>Basically, you inhale fresh air, put on this product, and then try not to breathe again for the next 5 minutes until the product settles a little.  </li>
      <li>Seems to dry out trouble acne spots quickly.  </li>
      <li>It did not clear my skin as fast and thoroughly as expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure its worth the price to just use as a tiny spot application.</li>
      <li>frequently i wake up the next morning and the blemish is significantly reduced or even gone, with just some dryness or flaky skin left behind.</li>
      <li>I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief.</li>
      <li>the consistency is nice and thick, though it&#x27;s a little hard to control how much comes out of the pump (pump slooowly).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works wonders!  But you must be careful too much too frequently can cause some drying of the skin.  All in all, great product!</li>
    <li> Very drying and a little goes a long way.  Does have an odor, but not over whelming unless you use it all over, you should be fine.</li>
    <li> I have a few issues with this product. One, the price is high for a product that doesn&#x27;t have the most quality ingredients - I expect that a high end brand like PTR would have gotten rid of all the scary chemicals like parabens (which are banned in Europe because they apparently give you cancer.) Two, it smells HORRIBLE. I mean the active ingredient is sulfur so I guess this can be expected, but it&#x27;s so strong you walk around smelling like rotten eggs all day. I was afraid people sitting next to me could smell it. I also had a bad headache after a few hours of wearing it full strength (is breathing in sulfur bad for you...?). Three, it dries out my skin like crazy and kind of burns when you put it on. My skin is still dry today from using the product yesterday morning and I normally have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it seems to work pretty well on my existing acne. I&#x27;ve started mixing a little with my moisturizer so it&#x27;s diluted a bit and I can put it on my entire face so hopefully it will work as a preventative treatment. It&#x27;s just really potent stuff. The side effects (burning, drying, smelly) are a little tough to handle so I don&#x27;t know if I will want to keep using it. Although I might stick it out because I can deal with having a smelly face if my skin is acne-free. Maybe my skin will adjust and it won&#x27;t seem as harsh later on? I guess I&#x27;ll find out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably about 2 weeks now and it works!  I dont know why but I could not get rid of the acne on my forehead and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING! I used this twice a day on my problem areas and I&#x27;m all clear now.  I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Philosophy discontinued their sulfur-based products, so I switched to this, and it&#x27;s fantastic. For spot application, it really shrinks and heals flare-ups, and if you use it as a light daily treatment (spread it *very* thin, as it&#x27;s strong), it seems to really clear out the pores over time and smooths the skin surface as a result.</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of treatments in the past and did not expected that this one works well, too. But I appeared a great means for treating acne spots.</li>
    <li> great spot treatment for acne. and it doesn&#x27;t cause drying that makes your face flaky.</li>
    <li> Great skin care line and acne spot treatment. This product was exactly what I wanted. I received it right away in sealed packaging.</li>
    <li> this is some heavy duty stuff. the consistency is nice and thick, though it&#x27;s a little hard to control how much comes out of the pump (pump slooowly). it sometimes itches a little after putting it on, but i don&#x27;t mind because to me that means it&#x27;s working. frequently i wake up the next morning and the blemish is significantly reduced or even gone, with just some dryness or flaky skin left behind.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, it is really the only thing that can stop my skin from breaking out. I have adult acne and I love the whole peter thomas roth system.</li>
    <li> This feels nice on the face, and seems to work.  But like with any acne product, time will tell.  Decent value</li>
    <li> This must be the stinkiest product out there.  I am not too sure of its effectiveness, either.  Basically, you inhale fresh air, put on this product, and then try not to breathe again for the next 5 minutes until the product settles a little.  If my significant other had been using something as stinky as this around me, I think our relationship would have suffered.  It smells like dead fish, mixed with rotten eggs, marinated in a sulfur bath, blended with all 109 elements in the periodic table (thus, double the sulfur infusion).  Mind you, I don&#x27;t mind a sulfur mask now and then, but this stuff is pungent, and long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I braved through the smell at first, because I was desperate for a clearer face, but I didn&#x27;t see any results, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a fail.  I like other Roth products, but not this one.</li>
    <li> It works really well, however it does dry your skin.  I have oily skin so it is a win win for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product! After I gave birth, I struggled to control my acne and tried many different products. As a teen I had used a product with sulfur in it and decided to give this a try. It works wonderfully! The product smells a little funky but it blends in so no one can tell it&#x27;s on your face and it dries most of my acne out over night. The only downside is that it makes my skin a little dry so I only use it as a spot treatment and in my t-zone.</li>
    <li> I swear by this product. When I run out, my face screams at me to buy more. It helps keep up and coming pimples at bay and soothes any redness/irritation. I usually put it on as a spot treatment to prevent or treat. I&#x27;m not sure how this works for moderate to severe acne as I only get the occasional pimple, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to give it a shot. (Then again, it may be the PTR treatment helping to keep my skin nice and clear!) It has a mild stink from the sulfur, but nothing that will get in your way. Rather than rubbing it into my skin, I find that it works best when I pat it in. You can use this day or night, as it blends into the skin. Just remember to use sunblock if you&#x27;re going out in the sun after application.</li>
    <li> This is a new product for me.  Seems to dry out trouble acne spots quickly.  It is a bit strong, however, and can irritate the eyes if used to close to the eyes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little drying - smells like sulfur. But, is one of the few things that work for my adult acne. Also helps reduce existing scars over time. A little goes a long way, and I really only use it every other day.</li>
    <li> amazing product! It works so well and got rid of my pimples and was shipped on time. Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> The product has nice packaging but the smell is awful and I always wonder if others can smell it when I periodically have to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work like it promised to.  For the money spent it was not worth it and I won&#x27;t reorder for sure!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this for problem areas~ it really works!  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey though!  Peter Thomas Roth products DO work!!</li>
    <li> It clears a small pimple up in about a day but the sulfur smell tends to wake me up in the middle of the night. It is very gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my tretinoin treatment. Its far more gentle than Benzyl peroxide or Salacytic acid treatments.</li>
    <li> Best acne medicine for adults, hands down.</li>
    <li> This is the lesser of all evils as far as Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s acne products, but that&#x27;s not saying much, because the longer I&#x27;ve used this line the worse my complexion has gotten. Like an IDEOT I kept buying additional products thinking they&#x27;d work better in combination. I am furious with myself for sticking it out and hoping these products would start helping. Instead there&#x27;s now barely an inch of my face free of a pimple. Maybe not the huge pussy ones, but almost a RASH of them in various sizes, most of which are hard, red and rough. AWFUL products, I wasted so much money. Don&#x27;t listen to their claims, and be aware ONLY this SPOT treatment and their sulfur masque actually HAVE SULFUR IN THEM!!!! I specifically wanted a line that has both salicylic acid AND sulfur in ALL of the products, and was FOOLED by the misleading claims of this one.</li>
    <li> Does EXACTLY what it says it does. Works exceptionally well, but can be drying, so use carefully.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the whole peter thomas roth line. Works great for my skin problems. Good quality. I cant live without my peter thomas roth!</li>
    <li> This product from Peter Thomas Roth works like magic. I love all of his acne products. My order was delivered to me really fast, in good condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skincare junky and use a lot of products in the Peter Thomas Roth line. I have oily skin and get very light hormonal acne along my forehead. It&#x27;s usually just a few spots that last for a couple of days. Nothing too traumatic that a little spot treatment can&#x27;t help. This product works well enough, but I honestly don&#x27;t think it works any better than drugstore treatments like Clearasil and Zapzyt. The sulfuric smell is also terrible. Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t notice excessive drying when using this a couple of days in a row. I use very little product at night so that likely helps. There is a lot of product in the tube and is lasting quite me a while. I&#x27;m planning to try something different (aka more affordable) once I finish this up.</li>
    <li> I have battled with (hormonal cystic) acne my entire life (now a mature adult). Honestly, this is the only spot treatment that has given me effective and immediate results. It is such an important staple in my regimen, I make sure I have 2 on hand. Obviously, no spot treatment will stop new acne from starting. However, at the first sign of even the slightest pain (even before I can actually see the bump or redness), I apply a very, very small amount to it. I do this 3 to 4 times a day and 8 times out of 10, the acne won&#x27;t fully form or break the skin. It really is that amazing. ...the downside is it smells weird. I didn&#x27;t deduct a star for that because it&#x27;s efficacy is of much more importance than it&#x27;s smell. It does burn a little if applied to an extracted, open pimple. Honestly, I like that feeling as it&#x27;s telling me it&#x27;s working. ...A little goes a long way, truly. Hope this review helped :)</li>
    <li> just didn&#x27;t work for me. i have pretty oily skin. the best product i&#x27;ve found is alpha cleanser by Revision. it&#x27;s for washing, but i use it also as a spot treatment.</li>
    <li> I am a person with severe acne problem... I use this product at night when I get new break outs and it works! This is the only product that helps overnight! In the morning acne does&#x27;t look as bad, no inflammation and no irritation (my skin is sensitive)! And the price here on Amazon is way better then Sephora!</li>
    <li> Item arrived with tamper sticker on bottled opened. Looks like the bottle I received is old and has obviously been opened</li>
    <li> So I dunno if it&#x27;s hormones or what the heck happened but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO my skin SUCKS. I have acne that would rival any teen boy. I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief. I like that the products have medicated and homeopathic aspects to support them. They don&#x27;t have strong odors, and don&#x27;t bleach my sheets. I will be a repeat customer - oh and a little goes a long way.....</li>
    <li> Works wonders for acne spots by drying them out.  Even works over my make up but I don&#x27;t wear anything heavy.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne which is aggravated by exercise.  I used this only on cysts twice a day after using the Peter Thomas Hydroxy Acid wash and acne clearing gel.  It has significantly improved my acne.  I love that it is fragrance free and that it doesn&#x27;t make my face peel or bleach my clothes like peroxide treatments.</li>
    <li> This products seems to dry my skin out way too much and I have oily skin.  Its good for trouble spots or just a single acne spot. I wouldn&#x27;t be putting this product all over b/c it is very drying.  I&#x27;m not sure its worth the price to just use as a tiny spot application. I love PTR products but I doubt I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonderfully for me. It has kind of a strong earthy scent, but I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product burned my skin. I generally can tolerate most products, but this one was a little to much for my liking. Initially bought as I thought it might be stronger than my traditional spot treatments and I had never used a spot treatment containing sulfur. It did not clear my skin as fast and thoroughly as expected. Will continue to use in moderation, but not my first choice.</li>
