      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>great hair treatment for damaged hair ...make it nice and soft when used with Silicon Mix...</li>
      <li>Love them all</li>
      <li>Made my hair silky smooth!</li>
      <li>I used this as a conditioner and used some more as a leave in</li>
      <li>The more you use the better</li>
      <li>But I see it becoming healthy again after using the Kanechom hair products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was too strong</li>
      <li>but it worked just fine by itself.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s cheap and works its for me.</li>
      <li>I condition only about 1-2 times per week with this product and have seen a great improvement.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair really soft and easy to comb during my relaxer stretches and it smells great and is reasonably priced</li>
      <li>I truly thought that I loved the way the Kanechom Mixed Fruit felt in my hair, but this one right here is even better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars only because it has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>The heat opens the cuticle of the hair and really makes sure the conditioner gets in.</li>
      <li>I use the Argan one and love the fresh scent, long lasting conditioner with a great rins-ablity!</li>
      <li>The product leaves your hair smelling amazing and super soft.</li>
      <li>This smells lovely and makes my hair feel so soft and strong.</li>
      <li>very well fast shipping would purchase again wish it had more directions for use but overall great product</li>
      <li>l loved the way the conditioner had so much slip, and my hair was really soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>This mixed along with Silicon Mix is the BEST deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>I should maybe add that I also sit under a hot dryer with this for about 20 min to make sure it is absorbed into my hair, maybe those who are not seeing results should put a shower cap on and warm the outside with a blow dryer (if you don&#x27;t have a hooded dryer).</li>
      <li>I do a deep condition about every two weeks, and I am still VERY pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed the first time, and that&#x27;s the only time I left it on for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>so I felt like I was getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>It came sealed which was definitely a plus, but once I took the lid off, it was filled to the top</li>
      <li>The next time I use it I will use it by itself to see what kind of results I get.</li>
      <li>Baby fresh powder smell</li>
      <li>I swear I am going to buy all their products because they really do work wonders!</li>
      <li>Shipped Fast!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m finally seeing healthy hair again.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using it, but if anything changes I will update this review.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing again &#x3D;)</li>

      <li>i love what this conditioner does for my hair it keeps my flat iron style longer.</li>
      <li>This plastic jar of magic left my hair feeling so soft!!!</li>
      <li>I use it on my Brazilian Silky Straight and it is superior especially combined with Silicon Mix Deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair is super duper soft after this treatment.</li>

      <li>Maybe the other lines of conditioners will wow me more.</li>

      <li>but this made it sooo easy to blow dry straight and flat iron.</li>
      <li>Hair less shedding, silky, easy to manage post treatment.  </li>
      <li>I have thick over processed hair, that I dye bright red every 3 weeks with 40vol peroxide .</li>
      <li>The first time I used this, I mixed it with silicon mix conditioner....</li>
      <li>Soft bouncy manageable curls!</li>
      <li>This stuff makes your hair sooooo soft!.  </li>
      <li>It also made my new growth incredibly soft and it smells</li>
      <li>This kanechom argan hair treatment really helped get my hair soft in only one use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m  not one to buy into the NATURAL STUFF &amp;#34;girl</li>
      <li>Still have my natural curls.  </li>
      <li>My hair is sooo soft, and shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft.</li>
      <li>btw I&#x27;m am a natural girl</li>
      <li>I have used this conditioner twice so far.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to notice a big difference in my hair because other products that work well for my hair smell a lot better.</li>
      <li>I have natural hair and it leaves my hair so silky, soft, and moisturized when mixed with silicon mix.</li>
      <li>The first time I mixed it with silicon mix conditioner (the regular one) and the second time with Collagen &amp; Placenta conditioner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased 3 different kinds so far.</li>
      <li>I researched this product on U-Tube and it has exceeded all my expectations - I currently have a sew in and it makes your hair so soft and manageable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Somebody hyped me up about this product but it made my hair feel weird like a film on it. I don&#x27;t know but I still have this product. Who want it?</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it made my hair silky and smooth and it smelled so good!  I even got complimented on how great it smells!!</li>
    <li> This smells lovely and makes my hair feel so soft and strong. I mix it with silicon.</li>
    <li> I love this one It&#x27;s a great condition It make my hair so soft, manage my frizz &amp; came very fast</li>
    <li> I have thick over processed hair, that I dye bright red every 3 weeks with 40vol peroxide . Its pretty fried lol. I mix this with another product called silicon mix, and my hair is literally silk!  Its like butter I cant even clip it up because  the clip wont hold. Its amazing! Definitely will purchase again</li>
    <li> i love what this conditioner does for my hair it keeps my flat iron style longer. and my bun ponytails looks soo much more healthier</li>
    <li> This plastic jar of magic left my hair feeling so soft!!! And it didn&#x27;t take long to get to me. I was actually surprised at how fast my order got here. The goats milk is taking a little longer to get here... I also got the chocolate kanechom. I swear I am going to buy all their products because they really do work wonders! My hair has been so damaged after dying it so many times! But I see it becoming healthy again after using the Kanechom hair products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Sia Jones</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really soft and easy to comb during my relaxer stretches and it smells great and is reasonably priced</li>
    <li> Amazing ! My hair feels so soft. I recommend and will be buying there other products!yayyy btw I&#x27;m am a natural girl with course hair try it ladies and gents!</li>
    <li> Was hoping it would really help revive my extensions from a little heat damage and coloring....but not really. I have used this on my daughters hair and its nice. Not great. Maybe the other lines of conditioners will wow me more.</li>
    <li> This container was not sealed and dripped everywhere in the box. Terrible. I expected it to be sealed since I bought if specifically from this buyer since it claimed it would be sealed. Buyer beware. Wouldn&#x27;t want to spend money on a product that may not even be the actual product described since it&#x27;s not sealed</li>
    <li> This mixed along with Silicon Mix is the BEST deep conditioner. My hair is sooo soft, and shiny. I have thick, kinky, curly hair, that i recently bleached for an \\&quot;Ombre\\&quot; look. My hair is usually very dry, and not manageable but this made it sooo easy to blow dry straight and flat iron. My hair feels like silk. I have never gotten these results without going to the salon. I highly recommend. This was my first time using it, but if anything changes I will update this review. Try it, its inexpensive, and for the price they give you A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/21/14:&lt;br /&gt;I am nearing the end of the bottles. I do a deep condition about every two weeks, and I am still VERY pleased with the results. I should maybe add that I also sit under a hot dryer with this for about 20 min to make sure it is absorbed into my hair, maybe those who are not seeing results should put a shower cap on and warm the outside with a blow dryer (if you don&#x27;t have a hooded dryer). The heat opens the cuticle of the hair and really makes sure the conditioner gets in. I will definitely be purchasing again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> great hair treatment for damaged hair ...make it nice and soft when used with Silicon Mix...it reconditions your split ends</li>
    <li> Hair less shedding, silky, easy to manage post treatment.  Still have my natural curls.  Follow directions and you will too, use a good clarifying shampoo once a month and begin again.</li>
    <li> seems really good especially if I leave it in for a long time, very very soft, bouncy, good deep conditioner</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  It was too strong</li>
    <li> I researched this product on U-Tube and it has exceeded all my expectations - I currently have a sew in and it makes your hair so soft and manageable. It smells great and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Made my hair silky smooth! I&#x27;ve purchased 3 different kinds so far. Love them all</li>
    <li> I am AA w/3c hair.  It made my hair feel like straw.  I threw it in the trash can. And I never do that.</li>
    <li> I truly thought that I loved the way the Kanechom Mixed Fruit felt in my hair, but this one right here is even better. It came sealed which was definitely a plus, but once I took the lid off, it was filled to the top so I felt like I was getting my money&#x27;s worth. It has great slip and the smell is just  amazzzzzzinnnnng. Let me tell you I used this as a conditioner and used some more as a leave in and my hair feels as good as it smells. I definitely will repurchase this Kanechom Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> I love this it !!! My hair was soft and silky !!!</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner twice so far. The first time I mixed it with silicon mix conditioner (the regular one) and the second time with Collagen &amp; Placenta conditioner. I must say that neither time did my African American hair come out silky as others have claimed. The next time I use it I will use it by itself to see what kind of results I get.</li>
    <li> This conditioner made my daughters kinky curly hair like butter! It was so soft after I rinsed it out and after it dried. I tried it mixed with the silicon mix conditioner but it worked just fine by itself.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this product. It gives you fullness, body, and your hair feels/looks stronger.</li>
    <li> I was amazed how this worked on my hair!! I totally recommend it to humans everywhere. I really really do ♡</li>
    <li> This hair shampoo/conditioner is amazing. I cant read what the Dominican writing says but have bought two times because it is for flawless hair, per the girl on YT. I use it on my Brazilian Silky Straight and it is superior especially combined with Silicon Mix Deep conditioner. Google: Kanechom and see the various array of scents they have to offer. I use the Argan one and love the fresh scent, long lasting conditioner with a great rins-ablity!</li>
    <li> I gives me no pleasure to give a negative review but this stuff has done absolutely nothing for my hair. I&#x27;m giving it two stars only because it has a pleasant smell. My hair is so damaged from chemical hair dye so after reading all of the great reviews I thought for sure this stuff would help. After one month of using it weekly, under a dryer with a plastic cap, there was no change at all. I&#x27;ve gone back to using kinky curly products and I&#x27;m finally seeing healthy hair again.</li>
    <li> It was not sealed. some of the product was inside the box it was shipped in. Product felt good to my hands and in my hair. But I prefer a seal for quality assurance and protection.</li>
    <li> My hair is super duper soft after this treatment. I have 4 b type hair. Total moisture as well. I love it. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your hair sooooo soft!.  The first time I used this, I mixed it with silicon mix conditioner....AH MA ZING!!! l loved the way the conditioner had so much slip, and my hair was really soft and manageable.  I have extremely thick relaxed african american hair, and this really helped deep condition my hair just the way I like.  Definitely a staple!!</li>
    <li> Awesome conditioner for my natural hair...will repurchase</li>
    <li> Really good on my hair and the girls. Would buy this product again. The more you use the better you hair becomes</li>
    <li> I used this with the silicon treatment the other posters recommended and love it. I condition only about 1-2 times per week with this product and have seen a great improvement. The smell is nice, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  not one to buy into the NATURAL STUFF &amp;#34;girl try this&amp;#34;! products . If it&#x27;s cheap and works its for me. But  for some odd reason i thought I&#x27;ll  try this once.this is a must have .love the silky , slippery feel it has. This does what it says . wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell but the product is a must have.going to try another  fragrance from this brand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I do not like the smell. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to notice a big difference in my hair because other products that work well for my hair smell a lot better. You do get a large potion for the money so I may start using it with my prepoo oil treatment.</li>
    <li> This product was not sealed like the description says I opened the container and the product went everywhere,not happy at all!!! worst of all there is no way to contact seller and ask questions, I just wanted to know if the product is supposed to have a seal over it after you open the lid.</li>
    <li> Love how fast I received it and it works magic!!!!</li>
    <li> I have yet to use it on my extensions but its awesome on my hair as well as my clients. I have natural hair and it leaves my hair so silky, soft, and moisturized when mixed with silicon mix. I haven&#x27;t tried it separate.... Baby fresh powder smell</li>
    <li> This kanechom argan hair treatment really helped get my hair soft in only one use. A little goes a long way. I used 2 tablespoons mixed with 2 tablespoons of the silicon mix hair treatment covered with a plastic cap under the hair dryer for about 20mins and voila! Soft bouncy manageable curls!</li>
    <li> Love it smells good packaged very well fast shipping would purchase again wish it had more directions for use but overall great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner mixed with the Silicon Mix three times now. I wasn&#x27;t impressed the first time, and that&#x27;s the only time I left it on for 30 minutes. The last 2 times I flat ironed my hair and saw the shine and \\&quot;salon-quality\\&quot; look. It also made my new growth incredibly soft and it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little thing, for some reason, I start to feel a slight burning sensation. It&#x27;s only on one part of my scalp. Idk if maybe it&#x27;s not working well with the shampoos I use, or what. But, I plan to use the conditioners at least until they&#x27;re gone, if not for life.</li>
    <li> My hair feels great!! I tried it without the silicon mix.. I just ordered the (siicone mix) lol I&#x27;ll see if its a difference! But, get this and you wont be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> Shipped Fast! The product leaves your hair smelling amazing and super soft. A must have in every woman&#x27;s personal hair products</li>
    <li> thank you!! great product!! will purchase again and again!!!</li>
    <li> Just received today luckly it was wash day and all i can say is OMG! A!!!Mazing. I knew i would love this when i opened it. Game changer for My colour treated seriously damaged hair.. Thank you!</li>
