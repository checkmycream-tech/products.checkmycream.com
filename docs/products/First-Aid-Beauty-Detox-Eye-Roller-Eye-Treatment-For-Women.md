      <li>:&gt;(</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s nothing more than witch hazel packaged in there</li>
      <li>Ok?  </li>
      <li>Suggest we all get a dietician, cook, personal trainer and have good genes like Jennifer!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day because I figure that anything that works is strong.  </li>
      <li>I read the fine print on the bottle</li>
      <li>I thought there must be something to the cooling effect when i felt how cool it made my eyes feel.  </li>
      <li>I put it on and realized how cool it made my eyes feel and thought about her video.  </li>
      <li>Cool and soothing to eyes and eyelids.  </li>

      <li>Found this based on online reviews and am pleased with results thus far.  </li>
      <li>It goes on cool ,which is nice,but it seems to do absolutely nothing for my puffy eyes ..</li>
      <li>every other day on top of my moisturizer.ng that works is strong.  </li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>EXACTLY LIKE IT CLAIMS TO...</li>
      <li>At first, I saw no change.  </li>
      <li>i wanted it for bags which are not age related - probably more lifestyle</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>Not sure why it works so good but trust me it works.</li>
      <li>Most of the time, he will jokingly say about a product, \\&quot;That&#x27;s the quickest [fill in the dollar amount I spent]</li>
      <li>I have to admit that I did not think this made much of a difference....until I finished the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
      <li>I really like this for helping with bags under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>every other day on top of my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>(ok I know shouldn&#x27;t try to find a quick fix for a late night and a glass or two of wine), but didn&#x27;t notice any difference whatsoever.</li>
      <li>She claimed her dark circles were much better since doing this.  </li>
      <li>I went to a dermatologist for the dark circles and this works better than what he gave me and is about 1/5 of the price.  </li>
      <li>I feel like the indentation is gone after a few days of using it about three times a day and the color is more even with the rest of my face.  </li>
      <li>I love this company but was slightly disapointed with this product because it bothered my eyes, made my under eyes sting, but then again i have sensitive skin, but I always thought this company was made for someone like me.</li>
      <li>Keep hoping for something new.</li>
      <li>: It is a 2-3 inch tall glass bottle with a ball on the top so that you can roll the product gently under the delicate skin under the eyes.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I love their other products and will always keep coming back.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fix them completely because as far as i know, you can&#x27;t!  </li>
      <li>With this roller ball they indent less and the cooling effect definitely makes my face feel more refreshed .  </li>
      <li>First aid detox eye roller was recommended on the Dr Oz show because it helps WRINKLES not dark circles because it has an ingredient in it on his \\&quot;SHORT</li>
      <li>The liquid is clear and watery in texture.  </li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and I have no problems with this &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I was sure that it was not real but rather in my head; I was just perceiving a lightening of the dark circles because I am suggestible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>right) said that you should put a makeup wipe (or something similar) in the freezer daily and rub it on your face daily to cool it to help your dark circles.  </li>
      <li>About a week later, my husband said, \\&quot;You look really good lately without the dark circles under your eyes.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>From the first time I used it my eyes looked much less puffy.  </li>
      <li>Now i have dark circles for real</li>
      <li>This is possibly to keep the product away from the light, but nonetheless it is annoying as you don&#x27;t know exactly how much of the product is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I bought this product as I am a sucker for any new marketing i see in magazines - well actually it was because it said that jennifer anniston used it.  </li>

<li> The product,First Aid Beauty Detox Eye, did not live up to its claim to reduce under eye puffiness at all!</li>
<li> It does depuff as I expected it to</li>

<li> I doubted her because I had really dark circles under my eyes (of French descent in my 40s with dark eyes and dark hair and genetically prone).  </li>

<li> DARK CIRCLES ARE GENETIC!  </li>
<li> waste of $$.  </li>
<li> The product was \GBP18 so not cheap for a pharmacy item.  </li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for them.</li>
<li> The glass and label make it impossible to see into the bottle to see the amount of liquid left in it.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m disappointed that such a small bottle was so expensive.</li>
<li> Not even the pufiness decreased.</li>
<li> If you have bad under eye dark circles, I recommend this product as it is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I had really bad dark circles under my eyes and was desperate for a solution.  </li>
<li> My husband and I mercilessly mocked her, saying \\&quot;see</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t notice any change. :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used it for almost a month with no sign of anything happening. Would tell anyone to buy at their own risk, just because it didn&#x27;t work for me,doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for them. :&gt;(</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Dr Oz and just had to try it because his guest claimed that it worked.It goes on cool ,which is nice,but it seems to do absolutely nothing for my puffy eyes ..</li>
    <li> First aid detox eye roller was recommended on the Dr Oz show because it helps WRINKLES not dark circles because it has an ingredient in it on his \\&quot;SHORT CUTS\\&quot; episode last week the ingredient numbs the muscles to help it.  Other things to use in also People Watch Magazine on the DR oz show were a total of the above, MST Miracle Skin Transformer for cover up and dark circles, skin spf protection, covers redness for a foundation and moisturizes, the ZENO HOTSPOT for pimples and blemishes, and Touchback Hair Color Marker can save you money on greys at the hair dresser and is a fast morning fix when needed.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT!  YOU CAN FEEL IT WORKING INSTANTLY!  TAKES AWAY THE PUFFINESS FROM AROUND THE EYES EXACTLY LIKE IT CLAIMS TO...AND WOULDN&#x27;T IT BE GREAT IF EVERYTHING WORKED LIKE THEY CLAIMED IT WOULD!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely takes care of my puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as I am a sucker for any new marketing i see in magazines - well actually it was because it said that jennifer anniston used it.  The product was \GBP18 so not cheap for a pharmacy item.  I cannot say that i have seen an iota of difference - just one more cosmetic mistake in my make up bag but i will persevere and see if it works.  i wanted it for bags which are not age related - probably more lifestyle (ok I know shouldn&#x27;t try to find a quick fix for a late night and a glass or two of wine), but didn&#x27;t notice any difference whatsoever. Suggest we all get a dietician, cook, personal trainer and have good genes like Jennifer!</li>
    <li> I got irritation around my eyes</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
    <li> The product,First Aid Beauty Detox Eye, did not live up to its claim to reduce under eye puffiness at all!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  From the first time I used it my eyes looked much less puffy.  It stings just a little bit when I first put it on but not very much.  People don&#x27;t realize what looks different.  They keep asking me if I lost weight.</li>
    <li> I used this product everyday - according to the directions - for three straight weeks. The dark circles underneath my eyes didn&#x27;t even fade, let alone go away. I saw no difference from day to day. Not even the pufiness decreased. NOTHING happened. I read the fine print on the bottle and it&#x27;s nothing more than witch hazel packaged in there bottle. I wonder if I would have better results just using witch hazel. I&#x27;m disappointed that such a small bottle was so expensive. It&#x27;s a rip off and should be taken off the market.</li>
    <li> not impressed, found pretty much zero results. waste of $$.  already moved onto a different line, which i&#x27;m loving. only product I like from this line is the oatmeal mask.</li>
    <li> I love this company but was slightly disapointed with this product because it bothered my eyes, made my under eyes sting, but then again i have sensitive skin, but I always thought this company was made for someone like me. Anyway, I love their other products and will always keep coming back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now and am not seeing any results. Probably works on some people but not me.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this!  Makes my eyes feel so refreshed!</li>
    <li> This product does not do what it claims to do. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months now and I cannot see any discernible changes. I still have puffiness and circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Its the best thing I have ever used for puffy bags under eyes, and I have tried alot of different creams and rollers. The smell is pretty strong but for the results I can deal with it. Love it and will order more.</li>
    <li> DARK CIRCLES ARE GENETIC!  Ok?  Now if you think realistically about it, you will like this stuff.  I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it helps but it doesn&#x27;t fix them completely because as far as i know, you can&#x27;t!  Now i have dark circles for real, i&#x27;m not just saying it because it seems to be a trend to say it nowadays.  I wouldn&#x27;t say they are black but they are noticeable and kind of do the indenting thing.  With this roller ball they indent less and the cooling effect definitely makes my face feel more refreshed .  Let me explain something.  I was watching youtube and a girl named bubzbeauty (i think i got her name on there right) said that you should put a makeup wipe (or something similar) in the freezer daily and rub it on your face daily to cool it to help your dark circles.  She claimed her dark circles were much better since doing this.  Well I had bought this a long time ago and pulled it out again and thought \\&quot;I think I&#x27;ll try this again\\&quot;.  I put it on and realized how cool it made my eyes feel and thought about her video.  I thought there must be something to the cooling effect when i felt how cool it made my eyes feel.  So I put it on my lids and above my eyes also.  I feel like the indentation is gone after a few days of using it about three times a day and the color is more even with the rest of my face.  Now the dark circles are not completely gone and NEVER will be but I don&#x27;t expect them to be.  I just want them to be easier to cover because I haven&#x27;t found a single concealer that works for me.  When you truly have problem circles under your eyes I doubt you can find a concealer that works for you.  So anyway my point is if you want to try this stuff, keep in mind it is not a miracle if you are looking for a miracle.  But it is a miracle if you are NOT looking for a miracle.</li>
    <li> Cool and soothing to eyes and eyelids.  This product is great for de-puffing eyes and eyelids.  I will use again.</li>
    <li> If you have bad under eye dark circles, I recommend this product as it is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me explain how I found out it works: My sister came to visit and brought some the little bottle with her, insisting that I try it.  I doubted her because I had really dark circles under my eyes (of French descent in my 40s with dark eyes and dark hair and genetically prone).  She kept insisting that I apply several layers of the product over the course of one morning.  At first, I saw no change.  My husband and I mercilessly mocked her, saying \\&quot;see, it doesn&#x27;t work!\\&quot;  She kept requesting that I apply another layer.  Suddenly, I noticed the change--the circles seemed lighter.  I was sure that it was not real but rather in my head; I was just perceiving a lightening of the dark circles because I am suggestible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I kept using it--again the next day and the next after of her visit.  When she left, I ordered a bottle.  About a week later, my husband said, \\&quot;You look really good lately without the dark circles under your eyes.\\&quot;  I was shocked that he had noticed and actually approved of a beauty product.  Most of the time, he will jokingly say about a product, \\&quot;That&#x27;s the quickest [fill in the dollar amount I spent] that company ever made!\\&quot; or \\&quot;Why don&#x27;t we just crumple up a [insert a bill of the appropriate amount] and throw it out the window!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: It is a 2-3 inch tall glass bottle with a ball on the top so that you can roll the product gently under the delicate skin under the eyes.  The liquid is clear and watery in texture.  The glass and label make it impossible to see into the bottle to see the amount of liquid left in it.  This is possibly to keep the product away from the light, but nonetheless it is annoying as you don&#x27;t know exactly how much of the product is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of my sister and husband&#x27;s verdicts and my own perception, I am now sure that it work.  I don&#x27;t use it every day because I figure that anything that works is strong.  I use it in the morning (it contains caffeine) every other day on top of my moisturizer.ng that works is strong.  I use it in the morning (it contains caffeine) every other day on top of my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I would not be without this product. I use it every morning as soon as I wake up just amazing. Not sure why it works so good but trust me it works. I always wake up with puffy eyes and this is definitely the medicine for that. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I did not think this made much of a difference....until I finished the bottle.  Then I realized it had helped with the puffiness quite a bit.  Will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Works well and quickly.  I had really bad dark circles under my eyes and was desperate for a solution.  Found this based on online reviews and am pleased with results thus far.  Dark circles and puffiness greatly reduced.  I went to a dermatologist for the dark circles and this works better than what he gave me and is about 1/5 of the price.  I definately recommend and wi continue using</li>
    <li> Really works! I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the best for under eye area.</li>
    <li> I have been using and it defintely reduces puffiness in the morning.  I know Dr. Oz recommended it wich is why I initially tried it. I would have given it 5 stars except it is pricey for the size.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see that it made any difference what so ever.  Had hopes but for this product.  Keep hoping for something new.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Got 3 and will get more!!</li>
    <li> No it did not meet my expectations.  It does depuff as I expected it to, I saw this item on Youtube and I decided to buy it and since I have I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone, and hope that by the end of the bottle I will see some results.  I have been using it for several weeks now and I don&#x27;t notice any change. :(</li>
    <li> I really like this for helping with bags under my eyes.  My skin is sensitive and I have no problems with this &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;.</li>
