      <li>SUPER Happy With The product.</li>
      <li>I decided to purchase this because of the good reviews I heard about it and how RIDICULOUSLY strong it was.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m found it very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Very strong smell that doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
      <li>It provides a very strong hold and lasts all day.</li>

      <li>Great wax, strong hold and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is off putting at first...but smells like chocolate by the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
      <li>Even vigorous hand rubbing did not get suitable results.</li>
      <li>If you want more bang for you buck, I would prefer Honest Amish products.</li>
      <li>The goons is the strong hold I was looking for, I am very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Good quality product, good customer service, and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This is my first time having a full on beard and mustache, so perhaps I need some schooling on how to do it best?</li>
      <li>Wax is very easy to work with once you soften it up and very clean and neat to work with .. no unwanted residue on your wiskers.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update,  The Honest Amish is almost gone and was ok, but does not do what the bearded Goon&#x27;s Ridiculously Strong beard wax does.  </li>
      <li>I find that CLUBMANS paste works much better than this stuff.</li>
      <li>I was very impressed by the quality of this product and will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind though that the wax will leave a more oily film on your beard than a balm.</li>
      <li>Love the all day hold.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this to use as mustache wax, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as competing brands.  It works nice as beard wax though.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! I bought this product for my boyfriend and he uses it daily. He&#x27;s had the product for 4 months now and he never leaves the house without putting some in his beard. It looks incredible when he wears it! It lasts forever too. He still has the same tin for over 4 months! Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a way to control their beard or mustache. He loves it and he is super picky about stuff this this. If he likes it, you will too!</li>
    <li> great just the job,quick delivery,decent price,dose what it says,thankyou ile be back.</li>
    <li> Its hold well and smells ok. My main complaint I had was the size and amount. Very little quantity for price. If you want more bang for you buck, I would prefer Honest Amish products.</li>
    <li> was not as strong as advertised. did not hold very well. 3/5</li>
    <li> This is basically pine tar. If you are alergic to trees do not buy this. Also it takes forever to get it fully out of your beard. I am still trying to get this stuff fully out of my beard weeks later after hot water washing it twice a day with Medicine Man Beard Wash. I am honestly contemplating using some gasoline or paint thinner or something to get this out and hope it doesn&#x27;t destroy my beard before I result to completely shaving it off and starting over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I have tried multiple waxes and balms with this being the best I have found. It holds the shape I desire and still looks very natural. Shipping was also very fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my beard for 3 1/2 months now and I just started using Bearded Goon&#x27;s wax.&lt;br /&gt;It melts easily in my fingers and applies well throughout the beard. No clumping or flakey residue.&lt;br /&gt;I like how long it lasts throughout the day and it if my beard has gotten a little poofy, I just dampen my hands and run them over my beard to tame the hairs down.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent of the wax and do think it could be a lot less organic smelling. It kind of has a honey type smell. I got used to it but was turned off at first. A mint or slight vanilla scent might be nice.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would order and use this product again. It does what it says and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. I&#x27;m not styling a fancy mustache or anything crazy like that,  just keeping wild beard hairs in place.</li>
    <li> I bought a tin of this ridiculous stuff......Well I must say I really like it! It&#x27;s nice to scrape, easy to work, and has very nice hold with no wax dandruff! I would advise trying it, not too expensive and the big seller is the ingredients show no ill products or petroleum products. Very smooth, nice product and will venture other products from them if any offered. Yes would buy again!</li>
    <li> Works better than other balms and waxes I have tried when it comes to taming my beard.  A little tricky to work with unless it is properly heated up, but then it is good to go.  Will gladly order again unless my wife shaves me in my sleep.  Cheers!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend who has been having trouble finding a mustache grooming product he likes.  He had this to say:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This was the first time I have used a product such as this and I&#x27;m found it very easy to use.  It did take a little practice but I got the hang of it very quickly.  It held the mustache in place beautifully.  Thank you for this fine and easy to use product.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The thing I like most about this product is the smell that stays with me all day.  The reviews of the product are correct, it does stay where you put it.  I would suggest NOT using too much at a time.  Just use barely enough to feel it on your fingers.  I have a thick mustache and just a dab will do ya.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I couldn&#x27;t wait to open it up as soon as it arrived. I will keep purchasing this wax in the near future</li>
    <li> I bought this even though some rankings were bad.  I too could not get the wax to melt to a decent consistency. Basically a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Products smell does stay with you all day. Wonderful product and very efficient. I would recommend it be used with dry beard. Do not apply if your beard is still wet from a shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black male with a wiry beard and this is the only wax out of a couple I&#x27;ve tried that has performed as advertised. I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of weeks now and am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> After receiving Goons mustache wax I wanted to write a review but after reading some of the reveiws I come to the conclusion that I can&#x27;t top what&#x27;s been said. Goon&#x27;s mustache wax works and it&#x27;s holding power is hard to beat and second to none my beard and mustache love it thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael H.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. SUPER Happy With The product. Wax is very easy to work with once you soften it up and very clean and neat to work with .. no unwanted residue on your wiskers. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using no other wax on my mustache . One satisfied customer .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Superstache92</li>
    <li> The goons is the strong hold I was looking for, I am very satisfied.  This is really beard wax not conditioner pretending to be beard wax.</li>
    <li> Product works great, a small amount goes a long way with a large mustache.</li>
    <li> I ordered The Bear Goon&#x27;s Wax a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: -Great smell&lt;br /&gt;  -Medium hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: - A little pricey&lt;br /&gt;  -The tin is a bit on the small side...How about making a bigger tin?&lt;br /&gt;  -The wax doesn&#x27;t provide a super strong hold, but it seems to do the job by adding two fingernails worth of wax</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this because of the good reviews I heard about it and how RIDICULOUSLY strong it was. I tried applying a little, and a lot. I tried heating it and then I tried cooling it with a fan while it was on my mustache. Im sorry to say but this product does NOT do what it says it will do. It remains waxy and soft and has very little hold. The smell is very subtle yet smells like burning petroleum jelly... I am NOT satisfied and will to purchase ever again. I find that CLUBMANS paste works much better than this stuff. If you are looking for a strong RIDICULOUSLY good hold, then do NOT buy this stuff...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally review my purchases on here but figured this one deserved it. So I normally use bread oil and beard conditioner in my beard. It works well most of the time. After applying The Bearded Goon wax I noticed my beard was finally fully manageable.  This is the product I needed from day one. Only downside is that the tin is smaller than you might think. A little does go a long way tho.Thank you to the guys at the Bearded goon!  You have a customer for life.....or as long as I keep beard.</li>
    <li> Writing the review on behalf of my bearded boyfriend, who says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better than other beard products I&#x27;ve used (and trust me, he&#x27;s used soooo many). Unlike the other, this goes on easy and does not get soft towards the end of the day. It keeps your beard in place even if you have to ride a motorcycle to work like I do!</li>
    <li> This product is great! It holds all day, shapes well, isn&#x27;t greasy, and is unscented!</li>
    <li> Great product.. Use a small amount and apply more if its need. Wax is hard until heated, in hands or pocket (as it should be). Subtle and pleasant smell.. Would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Not ridiculously strong, but it does work pretty well. Unfortunately, this stuff has a fairly pungent tar like smell that isn&#x27;t very pleasant. If they could manage to make it smell half as good my Fuzzworthy&#x27;s beard conditioner it would be a five star product.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and holds up the best of any that i have tried. Holds all day and i dont have to run to the mens room to see if one has drooped or uncurled in a funky direction. Love it...and i will definately purchase more of it in the future! Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve almost used an entire 1oz.  tin of Ridiculously Strong Moustache Wax, and I must say, it works pretty well. My &#x27;stache is ridiculously wavy per God&#x27;s design, yet the Bearded Goon&#x27;s blend keeps it in check. I rarely need to reapply mid-day. I wouldn&#x27;t mind a version with a natural, manly scent, but the raw wax smell is not bad. For those who have trouble applying such a stiff cookie-duster holder, just Google &amp;#34;how to apply moustache wax&amp;#34; and your problems will be solved.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used it a few times so far, and has worked just as expected, keeps everything in line.. when you need to style your beard, use the goon..</li>
    <li> The name of this product heightened my expectations, but it didn&#x27;t live up to its billing.  Strong?  Well, pretty strong.  Ridiculously strong?  No.  Oddly, it seems to dissipate or is absorbed easily. After a few hours it is like I didn&#x27;t wax my moustache at all.  My favorite is still the strong blend from Jesse Lanci at Loma Wax Company.  But I think it is available only locally here in western Colorado.</li>
    <li> Works o.k. for handlebars.</li>
    <li> Solid stuff. Used as directed, and it maintains a very good hold, despite being a touch on the oily side. A  small amount seems to provide long lasting hold, and minor touch ups are all that is needed to keep shape through out the day. Lacks stiffness that you&#x27;d find with Clubman Wax, but seems to last longer. Only complaint is the slightly excessive oily quality that seems to be a bit too much. Otherwise it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used, and with this I&#x27;m done trying other products. Will now be my go to.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product. Its not &amp;#34;ridiculously strong&amp;#34; as it suggests, however, it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is that my mustache wont stay curled. My beard however stays down for the most part. Im gonna use this product again when my mustache is alittle longer and see if it works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like this product, its fun and easy to use. 8/10, would recommend</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No funky odor (important being so close to your nose)&lt;br /&gt;Great hold (I don&#x27;t have to worry about my beard straying outwards with this in)&lt;br /&gt;Seems to help condition as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is a little hard to get out.  However, suggestions for warming it up are included and help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product overall.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp;#34;does exactly what it says on the tin&amp;#34; fast shipping , great seller , product helps tame the manliest of beards</li>
    <li> Product is very easy to use and it arrived very fast after it had been ordered</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited a couple weeks to review as I wanted to give the product and good test run. Simply put, It has worked great, with easy application and strong hold. I would definitely recommend, and will order again. Seller was great, shipment was fast.</li>
    <li> Great does what is supposed to but it smells weird</li>
    <li> Perfect for my handlebar mustache and beard, strong hold. Will definitely purchase more.good smell all natural ingredients amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve must of received something else because this stuff is weak. I honestly feel scammed. Not disappointed but ripped off. It&#x27;s either bs or my stache is just unmanageable. I will be posting YouTube video her in the near future</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this Wax. Not only is it great at controlling my moustache, but it does a wonderful job at taming some of the unruly rogue hairs in my beard. I was skeptical of using a beard wax, but the other reviews here are legit. Not too waxy if I happen to touch someone&#x27;s cheek with my beard. I&#x27;ve had issues with overpowering odors from other waxes, so it&#x27;s nice to finally have a wax that doesn&#x27;t present that issue.</li>
    <li> Has decent hold and does seem to make your beard softer.  Like any other wax a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve grown out my Moustache out and decided to use this product to tame the wayward hairs which were imperceptibly making their way up into my nostrils and down over my lip. It worked wonders and I was even able to curl the tips upward, eliciting awe and peals of laughter from my little kids. A little wax does go a long way and depending on the occasion or style I want, I vary the amounts of wax. It&#x27;s 75°F here in Southern California and the wax is holding up great. My Moustache curls proud! Lovely product made only with natural ingredients. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I like the product but you only get half of what competitors provide for the same price. Neutral smell and good hold throughout the day. I probably won&#x27;t order again though. It&#x27;s just too expensive per ounce compared to others that smell great and provide similar hold.</li>
    <li> I just used your product and I love it. I&#x27;ve tried a few different ones and none of them held my unruly hairs down. This stuff is strong.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent service.  Thanks</li>
    <li> One of the best wax I have used. Gives a all day hold that a beard needs. Would recommend it to anyone. Also work nice on dry hands making nice and soft. I&#x27;m definitely fan and will order again. Thanks for such a great product </li>
    <li> Great product! Much better than other beard balms. Keeps hold the whole day. Ships fast even over a holiday weekend.</li>
    <li> Love this wax! I&#x27;ve tried several and this is definitely my favorite. It&#x27;s one of the less expensive ones out there too. I love the smell so much and it works great on my beard!</li>
    <li> The Bearded Goon&#x27;s Beard and Mustache Wax has been a great product for me. I&#x27;m finally able to eat food without taking in a little mustache on the side. It has been nice also after washing my beard. I can tame the beard down instead of having a big fluffy mess on my face. This is a product I will continue using.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I love that it is all natural.  I use it for my hair not my beard.  Small tin but you don&#x27;t need much for it to work.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice balm and it keeps the hair soft and in place.  Has a very mild good smell.  Keep in mind that this is not going to make your beard stay in crazy complicated shapes or anything unless maybe you were to use the entire container at once or something.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps my beard under control and smells good. The shipping was very fast. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought for my son and he loves it, keeps his moustache in place.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Actually, what I like about it is that it ISN&#x27;T &#x27;RIDICULOUSLY strong&#x27; unless you want it to be.  Those with stiletto-sharp handlebars would probably use more than I do. I like to use beard wax mostly for taming, for keeping the ends of my mustache away from my mouth, and the soul patch part of my beard from curling up into my nose.  This works very, very well.  It&#x27;s strong and lasts all day without being gummy.  It has a great texture, goes on smoothly (when warmed enough in the fingers), and an honest scent.  And the folks at the Bearded Goon are not only fully committed to their product, but they have fantastic customer service.</li>
    <li> Not the wax for me. Very strong smell that doesn&#x27;t go away. I have a full beard That I need controlled but not styled so this is not what I needed. I&#x27;m going back to Honest Amish brand.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and this stuff is very strong!  Bought it for my husband and he uses it everyday throughout the day in his moustache and goat.  Will be ordering more in the future.  Fast shipping and great customer service!</li>
    <li> If u are a kid or a girl, this stuff is for you.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this one off of eBay...mainly because I forgot Amazon existed, but anyway I was really hoping this stuff would be good. The smell is awesome and I do like the texture of it, but the bad news is that it does&#x27;t hold. All it basically did was shine my stache and leave a pleasant smell for me. On top of that my hair would absorb it way quickly so I had to constantly reapply and it was just disappointing that it didn&#x27;t hold. I&#x27;m still in search of the perfect wax.</li>
    <li> This product will not disappoint. I&#x27;ve used many different waxes and balms in the past few months and the bearded goons is the only one strong enough to keep my unruly hairs under control and It lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;The tin is a bit smaller than most but don&#x27;t let that deter you, this stuff is freakishly strong. I little goes a long way. This little tin has the same holding power of 4 competitor tins.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely my go to wax from now on. Fast shipping too, got it in a couple days. Order now, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> If you want to put vasoline in your beard then order this because that&#x27;s exactly what it is.  It holds fairly well and has no fragrance but it would be cheaper to go to Wal-Mart and buy a big tub of vasoline.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for my partner!</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Great product dosent leave beard looking greasy. It&#x27;s does hold beard in place I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> Not the wax for me. Very strong smell that doesn&#x27;t go away. Also there claim of extreme hold is highly exaggerated.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my beard feel however my wife says it stinks....its got a unique odor for sure...man scent.....</li>
    <li> I just started styling my beard and this stuff is exactly as advertised. The hold is super strong. I hought it was gonna be tough to warm  up but just about a minute in my pocket was enough to warm it up. I will be using this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected.  I put the canister in a cup of warm water while a shower to soften the wax, which makes it easier to use.  Love the all day hold.  Will definitely order more</li>
    <li> This is indeed ridiculously strong.&lt;br /&gt;Over all it is a good mustache wax. You have to be careful with the application, if you don&#x27;t get it in smoothly it will leave clumps. The first time I applied it, I did not come it in well and it clumped at the end of my beard hairs and mustache. I also found it a little tough to work in the fingers. As per the companies recommendation, I did heat it up with a hair dryer and then let it settle. It is much easier to get out of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely lives up to its name: &amp;#34;ridiculously strong&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I had to be careful when I apply it, the temptation is to pull on the mustache and/or beard to work it in. Once or twice I pulled out some hair, which would not be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to the product, is it does have a little bit of a smell when you first apply it, I think it is the natural wax features.  However the smell did not linger.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to!  Excellent product, great control over my stubborn beard and moustache growth..&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks again guys!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. The wax does not hold AT ALL. If the temperature outside/inside get any higher than 70 forget it. The only place this wax would hold your handlebar in place would be Alaska.</li>
    <li> Great product and great hold! the shipping was right on time as mentioned! i would highly recommend this product. it holds my handle bar mustache all day and keeps my beard formed! the size of the tin case is perfect for carrying in the pocket!!</li>
    <li> Love the way this product keeps my stray hairs in check. This is the first product that I have found to do so, and I have tried a few. Will continue to use this product as long as I have my beard, which I plan on keeping for all time.</li>
    <li> I am new to mustache and beard waxes, but this is easy to use and works very well. Takes a little getting used to putting the right amount in but once you got it, you got it! I am baker, doesn&#x27;t hold up well to heat from a big oven but then again, none probably would. Didn&#x27;t really expect it to.</li>
    <li> Hard to use but works great!</li>
    <li> Doesnt calm at all beard, had to buy beard wax.</li>
    <li> Ok, to be honest it&#x27;s the first wax I&#x27;ve ever tried but I&#x27;m very happy so far. I&#x27;m growing my beard longer than I ever have and it was becoming a bushy nightmare. In the past I always got frustrated and clipped it into submission. With this product I&#x27;m able to take my beard to new levels of manliness! pleasant smell, easy to apply, a must for any beard owner.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.  Easier to control my beard and has a long lasting hold.</li>
    <li> Good quality product, good customer service, and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd tin of this great product. A little goes a long way and the hold is great</li>
    <li> I love how its strong, but doesn&#x27;t flake or turn brittle like artificial wax.  The smell is different, but not bad by any means.  I actually warmed up to it, sensing honey and such.  Definitly a good wax if you want to treat your beard with care.</li>
    <li> I have tried several beard products to help keep my beard in check. I noticed a difference immediately. Also, I received several compliments from co-workers who had no idea that I tried something new. The smell is fine and the hold is great!</li>
    <li> Great wax for my coarse, thick beard &amp; wiry stach ends! Beats the &amp;#34;beard balms&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used in the past, just started using my Goon wax &amp; already a noticeable difference in taming the wild bib!</li>
    <li> really great product my husband loves irt</li>
    <li> Pure and simple,  this stuff works: it is durable, will last all day,  and it really allows you to control and style your beard. Unfortunately it does not smell very well. It almost has a synthetic scent to it,  definitely waxy and sweet smelling, but with an almost &#x27;old man&#x27;  smell as opposed to something fresh,  lively, or vibrant. If you&#x27;re looking for brute strength, this product is for you and your beard!  But if you would like something more appealing in terms of smell and overall usability, I would recommend Brooklyn Grooming&#x27;s beard balms.</li>
    <li> Super fast processing but the real star is the product itself. Strong hold and all natural made in the USA. I love it</li>
    <li> Great wax, strong hold and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is off putting at first...but smells like chocolate by the end of the day.  So all in....not too bad.</li>
    <li> This product is really really hard to soften. Leaves residue but nonetheless, ridiculously strong</li>
    <li> Sorry Bearded Goons this stuff just ridicously disappears into my stache. Only a weak amount of hold no matter how I apply it.  Used as instructed to just tossing a pea sized wad in without rubbing between thumb and finger.  Must just turn to oil disappears in about 15 minutes no matter what I tried.  This is a really expensive tin of lip balm.</li>
    <li> Tried wax just before I went out on the Bike &amp;#34;great Stuff&amp;#34; Two day in a row!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the product and it arrived on time. I am new to mustache wax. So I probably don&#x27;t use it as well as I could.</li>
    <li> This wax works great! It holds well and smells nice. I would recommend this wax to any serious mustache enthusiast!</li>
    <li> I ordered this since some of the reviews made it sound, well, ridiculously strong. Unlike some other folks, I am able to get it out by scraping my nail in the wax without using a hair dryer or such (maybe they changed the recipe a bit?). To be honest I was looking forward to a wax so firm that it needed softening with a hair dryer as my mustache seems nearly impossible to tame. I&#x27;m not looking for anything too outlandish - I just want my mustache to follow the contours of my upper lip instead of always going into my mouth. So far, this wax has come the closest to actually making that happen. I still find that my mustache slowly creeps back to being in my mouth within a few hours, so I don&#x27;t know if there just isn&#x27;t a wax that can do what I want, or if I need to use more wax, or if I&#x27;m expecting too much from any product, or maybe I need to use a stapler? This is my first time having a full on beard and mustache, so perhaps I need some schooling on how to do it best? Regardless, this has been the best wax I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and works just as advertised. Will always keep this handy.</li>
    <li> Unless you have a blowtorch handy, this wax is more than difficult to warm into a moldable paste suitable to put on your face. I tried warming the wax several ways, including a very hot blow dryer and could not get the wax to melt enough to spread evenly in my hands or on my beard. Even vigorous hand rubbing did not get suitable results. Maybe this is better left for those in warmer climates but here in the Rockies, I&#x27;ve gone back to other waxes that are more pliable. Others seem to have better luck with it but I feel like I wasted my money on this purchase.</li>
    <li> Definitely has good hold..and yes it is hard to take from the container because it&#x27;s so stiff..but I just scoop as much as I need with a spoon and microwave it for a couple seconds to soften it up...works for me..I like it</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok expected more</li>
    <li> It is a great product, I have tried different products and all I can say is that this is by far the best, at first may seem to cost a bit to handle but once you get used to is easy and especially effective in controlling the beard ... a great buy</li>
    <li> Received my order on time and have been using it for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;The product works as advertised; great hold and it leaves my beard shiny and easy to style. The instructions included are important to follow in order to get the best results.  Believe it.  A little bit of this wax does, indeed, go a long way.</li>
    <li> Beard Goon&#x27;s wax is a great product. I was very impressed by the quality of this product and will definitely be purchasing it again. It provides a very strong hold and lasts all day. Very easy to use and made with natural ingredients. Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Bearded Goon&#x27;s Ridiculously Strong Beard and Moustache Wax on my beard and stache for a few days now.  The product is OK but i would not say it is ridiculously strong. It is no stronger than Clubman Pinaud Moustache Wax. The consistency is good though and it goes on well. There are a couple of negatives for me however.  1. The ingredients may be natural but the smell is unpleasant to me - kinda waxy industrial petroleum. I&#x27;m usually not a big fan of aftershaves but I have to put something on to mask this. 2. The size of the tin for the price is disappointing.</li>
    <li> This product does have tremendous holding ability. But I think it may also have ingredients that can illicit an allergic reaction. The smell is nice and repulsing at the same time. After having it on for a little while, breathing becomes a bit difficult. Not like an asthma attack, just not as easy at normal. It also seems to annoy my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or rashes that I&#x27;ve notices, but I can&#x27;t stand to use it any more (I tried it 3 times or so). It is also difficult to wash out, but that should be expected with any product that has this level of hold. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you need a lot of hold, but I&#x27;ve found sufficient taming of stray, scraggly hairs with other products, and now actually only need a balm to mostly tame my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you are new to beard products, do not start with this. First start with a beard balm. I really like the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm. Use the balm morning and night for several days (maybe even a week) before reanalyzing your beard situation. It may just be that your scraggliness is a result of improperly conditioned and too-dry beard hairs. If your hair still needs taming after this, then move on to a wax. For this, I again like the Honest Amish waxes (both Original and Extra Grit versions). Keep in mind though that the wax will leave a more oily film on your beard than a balm. The balm seems really oily at first, but gets much more adsorbed into your beard within 30-60 minutes so that your beard doesn&#x27;t really feel significantly oilier than your face. I initially started using the balm at night and a wax in the morning for more control, and found after a while that the balm eventually became sufficient for both tasks. I think this is because my beard  had never really been conditioned before and just became more manageable and softer over time with use of a balm.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have tried a lot of beard products and this definitely holds the best.  I work in a professional setting and need it to hold all day and it does.</li>
    <li> I purchase this last week and it arrived within 2 days. It holds my wiry hair down; however, I still need to find out the perfect amount, but so far so good. After I put it on my hands and through my beard, I use a brush to make sure it gets even, then a comb. It holds most of the day, an occasional brushing or combing makes the hair go down again. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent for beginners of waxing and grooming a new beard.  Have it working in tropical and desert environments.</li>
    <li> its batter than describe&lt;br /&gt;easy to use</li>
    <li> I am still using this - but I&#x27;m not a big fan. I have to use &amp;#34;Spike It&amp;#34; in  conjuction with BGRSB wax - in order to get the handlebars to stay in place. Therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is ridiculously strong...but moderately strong.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I have a full, thick, unruly beard but when I put this on, it becomes much easier to manage and the &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; is great. There&#x27;s no noticeable smell and no waxy build up and gives my beard a slight sheen. This exceeded my expectations. A Tip: Because the wax is initially hard, I drop the tin in a cup of warm water for a few minutes. This will make it easier to apply and work into your beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been searching for something to be able to tame my burly man patch for quite awhile after it started to really protrude from my face. I&#x27;d first tried a couple of beard balms. The beard lotions were great for giving my facial jungle a glorious luster and silky smooth sheen but not so much for stemming the violent uprising of various hairs from my face in all different directions. Shinier, silkier and slightly frustrated, I decided to try to  whip the beast into shape with a wax product. Knowing the fickle nature of the beard, I decided to go for something that advertised itself as a hair ####-kicker. Thus, I picked up a tin of &amp;#34;The Bearded Goon&#x27;s Ridiculously Strong Beard and Handlebar Mustache Wax&amp;#34;. What follows documents the subsequent battle with my beard to produce something that even the most babyface-inclined of women would swoon over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the container: The tin you get is fairly small, about 3/4 of an inch tall and an inch or two in diameter, but you won&#x27;t be using much of this product on each application. More on that later. The container is somewhat difficult to open. There is no screw threading, it just pops on or off and has a very snug fit on the container. There is also no serrated grip on the top to make it easier to twist or pop off. For a dude with big hands and no nails to work under, opening this bad boy in the morning can sometimes be a bit of a hassle, especially if a bit of the wax has gotten in between the container and the lid. I&#x27;ve found that if I leave the tin lid on quite loosely it becomes a lot easier to open it up later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the wax itself: Upon finally getting the tin open, you are greeted with what can only be described as a wall of wax. True to their word, The Bearded Goon&#x27;s Beard and Handlebar Mustache Wax is ridiculously strong... so strong that you will likely have difficulty trying to get it into a workable format to apply to your beard at first. The wax tends to clump quite a bitin your hands and rubbing it in between your palms only exacerbates the situation. The note included with the product advises to warm the tin up with a hair dryer or put it in your pocket for a few minutes. I first tried the hair dryer, then tried holding the wax a few inches above an open flame. Both resulted in liquidating the wax, but it would quickly dry back up and clump on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a cursory knowledge of chemistry, however, I understood that a product with such extra hold generally won&#x27;t magically come apart in your hands and then hold your hair together. So after a few attempts I was able to develop a methodology to apply this liquid steel evenly and smoothly to my beard:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Dig into the wax using your index nail and finger and scrape off a dime-sized clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Use your ring, index and thumb to evenly distribute the wax over these three fingers. When the wax is nearly invisible on your hands (but you can feel its presence), you are ready for beard/mustache application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply to beard/mustache. Repeat process if necessary to attain desired amount of control. Over-application does result in a sticky/gluelike feeling so be cautious your first few attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with a balm and a brush, this wax was able to complete the perfect cocktail for controlling my previously uncontrollable beard. For best results, I do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a beard balm thoroughly to damp/wet beard. Then run a paddle brush though to evenly distribute the balm and prepare for wax application. Finally, apply the wax to quell the hair uprising with an ease that would make Saddam or Assad jealous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I rate the product 4/5 stars. The packaging could use some improvement and application of the wax itself could use a better set of directions but the wax itself is great for taming of rogue hairs, general slickness and mustache curling.</li>
    <li> Good product. Worked exactly as I needed. Found its better for a natural look the an actual styling at least for my mustache. Bit hard to put on initially and definitely recommend warming 1st. Dry great and no after dandruff issues.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been looking for a good mustache wax and have FINALLY found it.  Holds strong throughout the whole day.  No matter the weather, it holds.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and works exactly as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> These guys absolutely knocked it out of the park with this product. I have been looking for a beard wax/balm that offered a moderate degree of hold, as my beard is long and I like to keep it shaped a certain way during the workday. This product was the perfect finishing touch to my head-fur care regiment. It keeps all of the fly-aways in in check, and holds form and shape for the entirety of the day. Also, the smell is not overpowering and overly &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; like some all-natural beard products are (looking at you Mountaineer Brand).&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint/hope is that you guys will offer this wicked stuff in a bigger tin. My Ardennes-forest-thick face jacket eats this stuff up quick!&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the great work guys and gals!</li>
    <li> This is only the second brand of wax I&#x27;ve tried so I&#x27;ll be comparing this to Badger&#x27;s Navigator Class wax. The Bearded Goon&#x27;s wax is definitely less aromatic which is good for me since the Badger&#x27;s was too fragrant for my taste. The Bearded Goon&#x27;s wax has an initial scent that is understated and is hardly noticed minutes later. This wax is smooth and warms up nicely for application -- no lumps. It IS strong wax but is very easy to apply and precisely what I needed to direct my mustache this way and that. I don&#x27;t shape points or curls for everyday wear but have (of course) played around with that and this will create very reliable hold. I can see that the amount of Bearded Good wax in this tin would last longer than the other brand I tried although I&#x27;ve been using it just a couple of days and couldn&#x27;t say what that ratio might be yet. I would recommend this wax to anyone.</li>
    <li> Solid, very durable and holds all day.... I highly recommend this product !!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do a whole lot for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few other waxes that just didn&#x27;t hold well throughout the day. This wax does a good job of holding without needing to reapply throughout the day. It&#x27;s a smaller tin, but I noticed I didn&#x27;t need as much of the wax to get the hold I needed so it still lasted awhile before needing a new tin.</li>
    <li> as good as any, and better than most. the only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is there is an odd unidentifiable odor when you first apply. It fades quickly which is nice (not a fan of the scented waxes you get stuck smelling all day,  but that&#x27;s just me). After trying half a dozen recommended waxes this one is my go to.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  I gave it away and was disappointed when I learned they were out of stock.  Better luck next time I guess</li>
    <li> Great product. Its strong and I didn&#x27;t have to use much. I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> Easy to use - scrape it out with the back of your nail, rub between hands and apply to your beard. Had to play with it a bit to figure out the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and good control. Washes out easily. Only wish it came in a larger size!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s review: Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold in place for very long, he can apply after shower and 5 minutes later it seems to be gone, maybe melted into his coffee.</li>
    <li> Needing to train an unruly beard or mustache?  Here&#x27;s the remedy!  And ordering it through Amazon will guarantee quick shipping and arrival.  Make sure that directions are followed---heat the wax, either with a quick blast from a hair drier or by using body heat by putting it in a pants pocket,  Gather up a small amount of the softened wax on a finger and work it into a small ball, then, spread it on the mustache or stubborn area of the beard and style with a fine toothed comb.  This stuff is great and holds beards and mustaches in place!  Try it!  You&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> Having a handlebar for about a year now my tin of wax is getting quite low, so I decided to try this on the name ridiculously strong. I am sorry to say that it is not. It left my stache looking frayed, I could not get the sharp curls that I wanted.</li>
    <li> This stuff is \\&quot;ridiculously strong\\&quot; and aptly named, not to mention exactly what I need to keep my long, unruly mustache in place... when I bother to do that. Easy to use, firm holding, pleasant aroma, and will last most of the day. Small quantity goes a long way, too. Small can is economical and east to carry should you need a &#x27;stache touch-up during the day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  A little goes a long way.  It has taken my beard to new heights of bad assery yet leaves it supple and smooth.  Goon&#x27;s has tamed the beastly hairs bursting forth from my masculine facial shield. Even my wife, who isn&#x27;t a big fan of my manly awesome man mane, has come around.  Big bearded thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Not as strong as i expected, but it is ridiculously creamy and easy to apply, and holds very well. I&#x27;ve tried many mustache waxes, and even tried to make my own, and nothing has pleased me as much as this. The scent took a bit of getting used to for me, but in the end I find it a pleasant thing.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to say that I love your product I just got in the mail today and instantly put it on.  I am extremely pleased with how strong of a hold it actually has.  It also has a great scent.  I have tried other strong hold waxes and this product is by far more superior.  I will be buying this product from now on.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great Stuff! Keeps strays in place all day!</li>
    <li> Having never used wax for my facial hair before, I wasn&#x27;t sure which brand to go with. I decided I&#x27;d go with one that claimed to really hold hair down, as my facial hair is simply all over the place. A big problem I had with my mustache was that it curled over my lips and into my mouth, which made eating a hassle, kissing unpleasant, and a myriad of other issues. Everything is where it should be now, and I no longer have to avoid pasta to keep my mustache clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, there seems to be much less chance of me inhaling a stray mustache hair and getting it stuck in the back of my throat. The feeling of hair in my mouth and throat is almost vomit inducing to me and I really needed a way to at least prevent MY OWN hair from causing the issue.</li>
    <li> I have use this every day since it arrived. It does exactly what I bought it for, and I actually love the smell. It might be a little expensive since it&#x27;s only a 1oz tin, but definitely does the job and I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing another tin when this one is finished. I think it would be cool a bigger tin with a not much higher price. Anyway this is a great purchase and Im definitely buying more of this.</li>
    <li> Great product, holds well.  Only thing I would do, is work on the smell it leaves when applyed.</li>
    <li> This stuff holds with one application, no smell and when I need to tighten up the looks this wax really works.  Look professional and very tidy, this tin is almost done and will buy more, I don&#x27;t think this was Amazon prime (wish it was) and will try Honest Amish Original Beard Wax which I have not opened yet and update on that when this is gone.  Would get again and excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update,  The Honest Amish is almost gone and was ok, but does not do what the bearded Goon&#x27;s Ridiculously Strong beard wax does.  Smaller tin is a plus in the pocket and the hold can not be beat.  Have a long Go-tee and this stuff keeps it looking groomed and together all day and into the night.  Best wax I have ever used and will no longer try others.  Shipping is very fast and free, on time and stuff just can&#x27;t be beat with a stick.  I am sold and will keep coming back, grave before shave guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Roach&lt;br /&gt;Spokane WA.</li>
