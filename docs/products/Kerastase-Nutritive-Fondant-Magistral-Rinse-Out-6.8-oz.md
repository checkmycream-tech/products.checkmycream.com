<li> For the price though.. it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
<li> It is too expensive and it does not bring much.</li>
<li> I use just a little bit after the shower when my hair is damp, it&#x27;s a miracle worker.</li>

<li> It took a lot of product to work into my thick hair.  </li>
<li> And I just thought it was so so for a product that is a bit expensive.</li>

    <li> Great product, hughly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product Fast Shipping!!</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time for my hair because it helps a lot with my sensitive scalp and my dry itch</li>
    <li> Most mosturizing conditioner, and I have tried 100s. If you just want a lightweight detangler, this isn&#x27;t for you. If you want something that packs away moisture, really brings out the healthy hair shine, and is best used when you hear style your hair, then this is perfect. After blow drying because this conditioner is heat activated, your hair is even more conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine hair, I would think that this conditioner would be too heavy but I don&#x27;t know. I have wavy, coarser, thick hair which I treat with keratin to eliminate frizz.</li>

    <li> I bought it to protect my hair from heat and I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this product does it....&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it but I don&#x27;t hate it even... I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again... there are better products for less money on the market!!!!!!!</li>
