<li> I absolutely love this sweet smelling body mist from Victoria&#x27;s secret!!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sad to say that this doesn&#x27;t have that cool oil effect anymore its just one the liquid part of the body spray.</li>
<li> itz not what I expected it to be</li>
<li> If, I had known when I bought my original bottle of this fragrance in the Victoria Secret store that they would no longer carry it, I would have stocked up with at least 10 bottles of it.  </li>
<li> You can layer it with other fragrances and use as a room spray too.</li>
<li> My daughter discovered the Sweet Tease line from Victoria Secret and loves the scent!!  </li>
<li> Wish Victoria Secret would bring it back when they have their Semi-Annual Sale each year.</li>
<li> So sad they took it off the shelves and never created a similar smell.</li>

    <li> What can I say, this fragrance is addicting.  If, I had known when I bought my original bottle of this fragrance in the Victoria Secret store that they would no longer carry it, I would have stocked up with at least 10 bottles of it.  I search high and low for this stuff.  Wish Victoria Secret would bring it back when they have their Semi-Annual Sale each year.</li>
    <li> i purchased this item for my friend who was panic stricken that she had heard that it was being disconitinued.  she was elated that i had found this and will end up buying the remainder from this seller. Thanks seller for providing us with a good experience and a great product</li>
