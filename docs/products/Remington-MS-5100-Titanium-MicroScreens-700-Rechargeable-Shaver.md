      <li>and i believe it is the best product for the money</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>This is the best one.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the best, and I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>and I was always very happy with them.  </li>
      <li>I am naturally very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>One review said they returned the 5200 and got a 5100 and was very happy.  </li>
      <li>Very good customer service</li>
      <li>Great shaver for the money.</li>
      <li>Great for Remingtons profit,</li>
      <li>The pop up Trimmer is conveniently located, and good for straightening sideburns.    </li>
      <li>Battery is good.  </li>
      <li>Good process, no surprises, timely and a good price.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this shaver.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t think of a good thing to say about this razor.</li>
      <li>hence my pruchase is effectively an upgrade.  </li>
      <li>and they were very good about the problem and said they are sending me a new razor immediately........</li>
      <li>Very comfortable shave  *</li>
      <li>The battery life is much better, too.  </li>
      <li>but I think that is the case with most shaver.</li>
      <li>It misses so many hairs that I spend more time going over the missed hair using the electric razor than if I were to just use a blade.  </li>
      <li>But this shaver is able to out root</li>
      <li>Love it all except for the fact that the shaver has to remain in the recharger bin when not in use.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I gave up on the Remington MS-5100.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fair first razor, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust it as anything more than that.</li>
      <li>easy to use .</li>
      <li>The razor is too easy to turn on.</li>
      <li>Good, high quality for the price.</li>
      <li>I thought I knew better, but this is true.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s working fine.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>I got this as my first razor about two years ago, and I do think it&#x27;s a good first razor.</li>
      <li>The shaver gives a good shave but after 2 weeks of use, the red charge light would come on after about 2-3 shaves and had to recharge it...</li>
      <li>I would say that this MS-5100 does as good of a job as my old shaver, and so far has been more durable.</li>
      <li>Received the razor and it gives an outstanding, comfortable and close shave, better than my prior Remington.    </li>
      <li>I got mine about 4 years ago, and for the first 3 it was fine.</li>
      <li>I rarely used this shaver, as it was given to me as a bDay gift.  </li>
      <li>I happen to have own one ofthe earlier versions</li>
      <li>The only thing I really would&#x27;ve liked is a charging stand.  </li>
      <li>I have an older remington shaver that I liked, and wanted to get another one for an upcoming international trip.  </li>
      <li>First two models sent to me would not hold a charge.</li>
      <li>The razor was delivered immediately and works exactly like it was envisioned.  </li>
      <li>I have used remington electic shavers for more yeas than i can remember, so when mine finally gave out I purchased this one</li>
      <li>razor is terrific, it shaves close, as good as the straight razor, is very comfortable and gets it tight spots.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>Loud, as in, if you live in an apartment, your neighbors will probably be able to hear when you are shaving.    </li>
      <li>had it for couple months and would certainly recommend it to everybody.</li>
      <li>I have to go over certain sections over and over .</li>
      <li>: This shaver is very loud right out of the box, much louder than my MS3-2700.</li>
      <li>If you miss a day and your hair grows fast will take you awhile because you will have to keep going over your face to get missed whiskers.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t really a way to prevent this from happening.    </li>
      <li>I purchased this shaver for my son and he absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>I got a real deal at Target for $49.99 that included a Remington 10+1 Body grooming kit.    </li>
      <li>However, this one was clearly much lower quality.  </li>
      <li>really well - Manual says you can&#x27;t overcharge the battery.  </li>
      <li>Shaving is now pleasurable and is now much faster.</li>
      <li>the whole housing leaked water from the cracks.  </li>
      <li>It seems remington wants 200</li>
      <li>I have a 5 year old Remington #845 micro flex that is still a better razor than any of their current models.</li>
      <li>Not real close, but good enough.</li>
      <li>The narrow 3rd head (which I couldn&#x27;t imagine what I would use if for) turned out to be very handy under my nose and between my nose and cheek.  </li>
      <li>I have found the same to be true.</li>
      <li>I was previously using a Wahl brand, but this is much easier to handle and seems to be more solidly built.</li>
      <li>Also, it is extremely loud!  </li>
      <li>anyway, the thing i always noticed when i used it is the loud noise</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and switched to this shaver overnight with no razor burn or bumps or the claw marks that often appeared with my Norelco Razor.  </li>
      <li>Extra nose &amp; ear hair trimmer works very well.  </li>
      <li>These razors were always loud and missed whiskers, but they gave a close shave and they were convenient.  </li>
      <li>Also, this particular one only works on the battery, not when plugged in with the cord.  </li>
      <li>The price was right - in fact favorable to other opportunities.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller and lighter than past razors and shaves very cleanly.  </li>
      <li>I recently purchased this razor after having sunk over $1000 dollars on the Norelco Cool Skin Shaver that required endless lotion packs.  </li>
      <li>This one is really loud, loud enough to wake up family members sleeping on another floor of the house.  </li>
      <li>Despite bad reviews I have heard on the 5200, others I know have the 5200, and happy with it</li>
      <li>The manual suggests changing them every 6 months, but, with proper care and frequent rotation, I push that to 12-28 months.    </li>
      <li>Remington replaced it with a 7130 which lasted about 4 months before it developed the same problem.  </li>
      <li>I took the Titanium 5100 with me on a trip, but apparently luggage had shifted around in the car and pushed the on button.</li>
      <li>And as far as charging internationally, you can use a voltage converter.    </li>
      <li>This is far better than my old $25 Braun set, but it is still not perfect.</li>
      <li>Also 8 months after purchasing the trimmer constantly pops up while shaving and will rarely stay down.</li>
      <li>Finally on the third replacement it worked although like mentioned else where very loudly.</li>
      <li>As long as you don&#x27;t need 220V and can live with having to keep it charged (it has no charge remaining indicator, unlike the 5200)</li>
      <li>It will not run while connected to the cord (it will only charge), and the manual clearly says that ONLY the 5200 is cord and cordless.    </li>
      <li>that began to fall apart and was much poorer quality than previous versions.  </li>
      <li>By the time I get done trying to get all of the hairs, my skin is pretty much raw as well.  </li>

<li> By the time I get done trying to get all of the hairs, my skin is pretty much raw as well.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s so loud and noisy when you use it, the shaved tidbits keep coming out and drop everywhere if you don&#x27;t hold vertically straight enough, and the cleaning is not easy and thorough but, it actually shaved faster and cleaner than the other Braun shaver i got.</li>
<li> It lays flat.    </li>
<li> The Remington is loud and heavy, and you often have to use the long hair extension to get the job done, although you do get the job done to perfection every time without any help from a traditional blade.</li>
<li> This one is a major step down.  </li>
<li> But it will not cut long hairs or hairs in creases of face .</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not clear if it&#x27;s done charging.</li>
<li> It still gives a close but much less comfortable shave, worse than a blade.  </li>
<li> If you shave everyday, then the \\&quot;result\\&quot; is probably acceptable, however, if you don&#x27;t then it is more difficult as it does not shave all the hairs, so it takes longer -</li>
<li> This shaver cut my neck over my adam&#x27;s apple every single time I shaved.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had this electric shaver for over 5 years, the longest I&#x27;ve had any single unit.  </li>
<li> This problem existed to some degrees when I first got it, but is even worse now that two years have passed.</li>
<li> One complaint would be that the little mini foil on the top is a little flimsy, afraid to put too much pressure on it and doesn&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
<li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
<li> Moreover, the foil cover broke after only a few uses.  </li>
<li> The only problem was that after the 30 days were over the battery didnt hold a charge past 3 uses.</li>
<li> Mini foil pretty much useless.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my son and he absolutely loves it. My husband also has one and he is crazy about it also. Great shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave well unless hair is very short. Very disappointed as this was a gift for my husband.</li>
    <li> First two models sent to me would not hold a charge. Finally on the third replacement it worked although like mentioned else where very loudly. It gives a close shave *only* if done every day. If you miss a day and your hair grows fast will take you awhile because you will have to keep going over your face to get missed whiskers. Mini foil pretty much useless. Also 8 months after purchasing the trimmer constantly pops up while shaving and will rarely stay down. Will not be replacing (expensive) foils, rather just look for a new shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver cut my neck over my adam&#x27;s apple every single time I shaved.  It  took a very long to time to shave (5 minutes) and the battery life was the worst of any shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  There was no quick-charge nor can it be used while it plugged in.  I got only 2-3 shaves per charge.  Also, the pop up trimmer broke and was stuck in the up position.  Moreover, the foil cover broke after only a few uses.  I bought this shaver because I used my previous Remington for over 10 years.  However, this one was clearly much lower quality.  I switched to a Panasonic and now my neck never bleeds! Shaving is now pleasurable and is now much faster. The battery life is much better, too.  I am so glad that I gave up on the Remington MS-5100.  I will never buy Remington again.</li>
    <li> The price was right - in fact favorable to other opportunities.  The razor was delivered immediately and works exactly like it was envisioned.  Good process, no surprises, timely and a good price.</li>
    <li> I have owned 5 Remington razors in the last 40 years.  This is the best one.  It&#x27;s smaller and lighter than past razors and shaves very cleanly.  The narrow 3rd head (which I couldn&#x27;t imagine what I would use if for) turned out to be very handy under my nose and between my nose and cheek.  I ended up getting the 5100 vs 5200 because of poor reviews on the 5200.  One review said they returned the 5200 and got a 5100 and was very happy.  I have found the same to be true.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric shaver for over 5 years, the longest I&#x27;ve had any single unit.  Some observations:    *Very comfortable shave  *Ample cutting devices included to get every detail  *Durable  *Battery has held up really well - Manual says you can&#x27;t overcharge the battery.  I thought I knew better, but this is true.  The battery has held up so well and I leave it charging all the time.    Although you can&#x27;t use it with the cord, it&#x27;s really not a big deal - especially because the battery is so reliable and durable.  And as far as charging internationally, you can use a voltage converter.    Extra nose &amp; ear hair trimmer works very well.  I use it weekly with rechargeable batteries.    The only thing I really would&#x27;ve liked is a charging stand.  It lays flat.    I would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> The shaver sucks doesnt cut anything. Dont use it anymore cause it just doesnt do the job period!</li>
    <li> I got mine about 4 years ago, and for the first 3 it was fine. Not real close, but good enough. I hate the fact that you cannot shave corded.  I learned that the hard way as I was on a business trip...anyway, after about 3 years, the sideburn cutter would not stay down! I have to keep my thumb on it so that I can shave. If you shave everyday, then the \\&quot;result\\&quot; is probably acceptable, however, if you don&#x27;t then it is more difficult as it does not shave all the hairs, so it takes longer - but I think that is the case with most shaver. I got this on clearance at Target for less than $50, so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 4 months and it&#x27;s working fine.  I can tell the razors are dulling a little but that&#x27;s to be expected.  Still getting a close shave.  One complaint would be that the little mini foil on the top is a little flimsy, afraid to put too much pressure on it and doesn&#x27;t work that well.  I think I paid $25 can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this razor after having sunk over $1000 dollars on the Norelco Cool Skin Shaver that required endless lotion packs.  I have extremely sensitive skin and switched to this shaver overnight with no razor burn or bumps or the claw marks that often appeared with my Norelco Razor.  The nicest thing about this shaver is not maintenance products.  You only have to replace the blades and screen as recommended.  I got a real deal at Target for $49.99 that included a Remington 10+1 Body grooming kit.    An additional note that I used baby powder on my skin prior to shaving.  This is opposed to the shave stick that is advertised.</li>
    <li> Love it all except for the fact that the shaver has to remain in the recharger bin when not in use.</li>
    <li> The shaver gives a good shave but after 2 weeks of use, the red charge light would come on after about 2-3 shaves and had to recharge it...I called Remington and they were very good about the problem and said they are sending me a new razor immediately........Very good customer service</li>
    <li> Received the razor and it gives an outstanding, comfortable and close shave, better than my prior Remington.    However, it is NOT \\&quot;Cord/Cordless\\&quot; as advertised.  It will not run while connected to the cord (it will only charge), and the manual clearly says that ONLY the 5200 is cord and cordless.    As I am living overseas, the fact that it only will work with 110V is also a pain.  I thought all manufacturers were now making their charging transformers to accept 110 or 220V.  Oh, well, that&#x27;s what adapters are for.     Despite bad reviews I have heard on the 5200, others I know have the 5200, and happy with it and it has none of the shortcomings of the 5100.  As long as you don&#x27;t need 220V and can live with having to keep it charged (it has no charge remaining indicator, unlike the 5200) it&#x27;s fine.  However, if I had to do it over again, I would buy the 5200.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift to replace a broken Remington MS3-2700. I would say that this MS-5100 does as good of a job as my old shaver, and so far has been more durable. The pop up Trimmer is conveniently located, and good for straightening sideburns.    A few things though: This shaver is very loud right out of the box, much louder than my MS3-2700. Loud, as in, if you live in an apartment, your neighbors will probably be able to hear when you are shaving.    The Pop-Up Mini Foil is mostly useless. When extended it is terribly flimsy and I feel that any pressure on my face will cause the foil to snap off. This flimsiness also causes the vibrations to double the loudness of the shaver. I never use the Mini Foil.    The replacement foils, as is with most electric shavers, are expensive. The manual suggests changing them every 6 months, but, with proper care and frequent rotation, I push that to 12-28 months.    Unless you have a weird shaped face and absolutely need it, I would recommend anyone considering this shaver to consider another model without the Mini Foil.</li>
    <li> I got this as my first razor about two years ago, and I do think it&#x27;s a good first razor. But I have a few critiques:    The razor cuts a few hairs every other pass. This problem existed to some degrees when I first got it, but is even worse now that two years have passed. It&#x27;s not too durable.    The razor is too easy to turn on. I took the Titanium 5100 with me on a trip, but apparently luggage had shifted around in the car and pushed the on button. The battery was dead when I got there. There isn&#x27;t really a way to prevent this from happening.    It&#x27;s not clear if it&#x27;s done charging. I can plug it in and I will always get the same indicator regardless of whether the razor is fully charged or not charged at all.    It&#x27;s a little noisy.      It&#x27;s a fair first razor, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust it as anything more than that.</li>
    <li> I have used this same line of shavers for over 30 years and I was always very happy with them.  I bought this to replace the prior model, that began to fall apart and was much poorer quality than previous versions.  This one is a major step down.  These razors were always loud and missed whiskers, but they gave a close shave and they were convenient.  This one is really loud, loud enough to wake up family members sleeping on another floor of the house.  Also, this particular one only works on the battery, not when plugged in with the cord.  It still gives a close but much less comfortable shave, worse than a blade.  It is also suppose to be washable but when I ran the heads under the tap the whole housing leaked water from the cracks.  It still ran but I worry about safety and durability.  As a loyal customer for a very long time I am really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am naturally very happy with this product. I happen to have own one ofthe earlier versions hence my pruchase is effectively an upgrade.  I trust this brand as it does cut all of my beard as it grows out and then tilds back in thus, causing pimples. But this shaver is able to out root the in growth and back growth.</li>
    <li> This is far better than my old $25 Braun set, but it is still not perfect. The Remington is loud and heavy, and you often have to use the long hair extension to get the job done, although you do get the job done to perfection every time without any help from a traditional blade.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this shaver. I was previously using a Wahl brand, but this is much easier to handle and seems to be more solidly built.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst razor that I have ever bought.  It misses so many hairs that I spend more time going over the missed hair using the electric razor than if I were to just use a blade.  By the time I get done trying to get all of the hairs, my skin is pretty much raw as well.  Also, it is extremely loud!  It also doesn&#x27;t operate as a corded razor so if the battery runs out then you have to wait all day for it to charge.  I honestly can&#x27;t think of a good thing to say about this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using rotary shavers for the last 40 years and Remington for the last 10.  I received the 5130 as Christmas gift last year.  Within 6 months the cutter heads started falling out.  Remington replaced it with a 7130 which lasted about 4 months before it developed the same problem.  The flex 360 is the worst design and poorest made razor system I have ever encountered.  When I contacted Remington about the failure of the second razor they told me where I could buy parts.  Their 2 year warranty is a JOKE!  I have a 5 year old Remington #845 micro flex that is still a better razor than any of their current models.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these razors I have owned and I like the way it shaves, less bumps.  The only problem was that after the 30 days were over the battery didnt hold a charge past 3 uses. (3 Days)</li>
    <li> With a couple of short-term exceptions, I have used Remington shavers all my life.  This is one of the best, and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Battery is good.  easy to use . But it will not cut long hairs or hairs in creases of face . I have to go over certain sections over and over .</li>
    <li> It was expensive but I have tried several less expensive razors and they were lousy.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is terrific, it shaves close, as good as the straight razor, is very comfortable and gets it tight spots.&lt;br /&gt;Have had it for couple months and would certainly recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> yes, this shaver&#x27;s quality and user-friendly score reviews are somehow between the good and the ugly that were posted on amazon for this item. short battery life, fragile foil and cutters, dangerous trim cutters on both side, and you have to pull out the cord to shave. it&#x27;s so loud and noisy when you use it, the shaved tidbits keep coming out and drop everywhere if you don&#x27;t hold vertically straight enough, and the cleaning is not easy and thorough but, it actually shaved faster and cleaner than the other Braun shaver i got. anyway, the thing i always noticed when i used it is the loud noise and i hate it!</li>
    <li> I have an older remington shaver that I liked, and wanted to get another one for an upcoming international trip.  The Amazon product description says it is cord/cordless and accepts worldwide voltage.  WRONG!  The MS-5200 does, but the MS-5100 doesn&#x27;t.  The 4 differences are:  5100 won&#x27;t operate as a corded shaver if the battery is low, 5100 only accepts 110 voltage, 5200 has an extra battery meter, and 5200 has 5 extra minutes of battery life in reserve.  I thought it was my fault for not paying close enough attention, but after re-reading the amazon description, I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> this is my 3rd remington razor i have owned and i believe it is the best product for the money</li>
    <li> I have used remington electic shavers for more yeas than i can remember, so when mine finally gave out I purchased this one and it is so bad that I have gone back to using a regular blade razor. It seems remington wants 200+ dollars for one like i had been using &amp; no way I would waste my money fore that one!</li>
    <li> Good, high quality for the price.Arrived and worked as advertised. I look forward to doing future business with your company.</li>
    <li> IT QUIT WORKING AND SHOULD BE RECALLED BY REMINGTON... I rarely used this shaver, as it was given to me as a bDay gift.  So, it had very few uses, like less than 20.  Recharged it recently and went to use it... it STICKS IN THE ON POSITION and wont shut off.  The rubber on/off button falls out, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another worthless piece of junk made in Communist China.  Great for Remingtons profit, but I am not kidding when I say there is NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF.  I had to leave, so I had to put it in the garage as it is running and I cant switch it off.  Where is the Consumer Product Safety Commission when you need them?  REMINGTON SHOULD RECALL THIS UNSAFE DESIGN.</li>
    <li> Dedicated to the Remington brand.  Have been a long-time user.  This is an excellent product.  Can always depend on the Remington.</li>
