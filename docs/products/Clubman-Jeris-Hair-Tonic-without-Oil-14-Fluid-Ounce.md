    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for a touch up.  My hair is a bit too long to use just this but I use Brylcreem in the morning and then touch it up with this at night if I&#x27;m going out.  Smells nice and holds well.</li>

    <li> Nice and clean feel to it  and makes your hair feel the same  and I think it is a good product</li>
    <li> Nothing more than scented water. It did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Scented water nothing more.</li>
    <li> Very useful!  Using this product for over thirty-nine years.</li>
    <li> Not to bad good smell, also purchased the Osage rub. Now the Osage rub is a mans tonic, this would be more of a boys version.</li>
    <li> Exactly what Grandpa was looking for. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I trusted the reviews and Im glad Im not disappointed.After using it for several times I noticed my hair became manageable and my scalp is no longer itching. Moreover, it is not greasy. I love it!</li>
    <li> When I was a kid, all the barbers used this tonic on their customers.  It smells great and keeps the hair in place without being greasy.  I am happy to see that it is available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have a flat top style hair cut really short and at times used a wax stick to stand it up in the front. This will not give you a super glue type hold or styling but does keep everything in place and has a nice clean smell to it.</li>
    <li> Functionality wise, it&#x27;s great!  My hair is far more manageable when I use this, but it&#x27;s not thick enough that it looks like I&#x27;m actually using product.  Unfortunately, it smells like an old eraser from the 1960s.  I finally figured out what that &amp;#34;Old People Smell&amp;#34; is that I&#x27;d occasionally catch of whiff of at the supermarket.  It&#x27;s this stuff.  I probably won&#x27;t be getting this &#x27;flavor&#x27; one again, but I&#x27;ll probably use it &#x27;til it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Good tonic, nice feel and smell.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as I used to use many  years ago. Glad I found it.&lt;br /&gt;Paul in Texas, thanks much.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of getting my haircut 50 years ago.  As a baby boomer I remember my barber using this product when I was a youngster.  It smells good and keeps your hair in place without grease. I only give five stars if something is absolutely unique, otherwise this is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Great, simple. Unadulterated with modern over-refining and chemical additives. Nice, soft smell that I remember as a youth. I alternate this with the version with oil. Some days I use the oil for my scalp. In between I use this one. It has the control without the heaviness of the oil version. Also good for a refresher over an earlier application of the oil.</li>
