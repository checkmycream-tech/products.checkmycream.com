### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>lotion is an excellent, non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I just received this wonderful cocoa butter lotion today and it smells like paradise aka coconut.  </li>
      <li>It spreads well, smells good, and works very good.</li>
      <li>That said, I am happy with the feel of the lotion.  </li>
      <li>it is consistently a great product.</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>I keep catching it throughout the day.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far for what I wanted it to do.  </li>
      <li>though it seems as though Palmers&#x27; tweaks the formula every now and then (notice more in the scent)</li>
      <li>I feel that I will have even better results after continued use, I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks</li>
      <li>I used to be able to get this lotion at the drug-store, but nobody seems to carry it any more.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lotion</li>
      <li>Im a man and im not afraid to say how amazing this stuff is.</li>
      <li>but how strongly it smells.</li>
      <li>However, the scent is way too strong.</li>
      <li>I prefer butters and thicker creams but it moisturizes just fine.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;m able to purchase on Amazon as most stores carry Palmers, just not this particularly lotion.  </li>
      <li>Was a cool lil add on product</li>
      <li>I think you could EASILY find a product with AHA that works equally well and has a much more tolerable smell.</li>
      <li>The scent is so powerful that using it on my arms made my eyes water, so there is no way I could use it on my face.</li>
      <li>It lasts quite awhile, so the price seems worth it.</li>
      <li>I prefer the regular palmers cocoa butter than this kind.</li>
      <li>, so I wanted something to clear them away and this seems to be doing a very good job compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Just like any other lotion but smells good.</li>
      <li>There used to be a 15 oz bottle (cannot find anymore) and the price is right.</li>
      <li>product is great for anyone with dry and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I love Palmers, in general.  </li>
      <li>The smell is okay, but dissipates enough to not annoy.</li>
      <li>I will buying more in the future.</li>
      <li>thanks to my own sweat and tight clothes, and also get a lot of ingrown hairs on my calves</li>
      <li>It is so gentle for the skin that I use it on my face too.</li>
      <li>It is light but not watery, and imparts lasting moisture to the skin.</li>
      <li>So disappointing, because this lotion is great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that my skin retains moisture so much longer using this.  </li>
      <li>I have psoriasis and this really helps to exfoliate my skin and keep it in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think the product does what it should, my skin feels tight, smooth and supple, but the smell!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I normally avoid lotion because it makes me feel smothered.  </li>
      <li>Actually works pretty well.</li>
      <li>In addition, it makes my skin look brand new and soft.  </li>
      <li>I travel quite a bit going from a humid climate to a dry and this helps me maintain not only hydrated skin but smooth skin as well.  </li>
      <li>I use this right after the shower and my skin feels silky soft all day long!</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>makes your body incredibly soft.</li>
      <li>and my skin takes a long time to heal completely so most of the slight spots left over are just old marks from bumps and ingrowns</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, the smell is quite perfumey, it doesn&#x27;t have a nice cocoa butter smell, but an old lady perfume smell.  </li>
      <li>Compared to the thickness of Palmer&#x27;s other product, this is much thinner in consistency.</li>
      <li>I pay $3.00 less at another online retailer and I buy multiples at a time, a mere $20 worth, to get free shipping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t care for the scent, it does eventually fade away but not all of it. I prefer the regular palmers cocoa butter than this kind. I haven&#x27;t noticed a diffrence in my skin.</li>
    <li> I used the cream all over, even my face.  Compared to the thickness of Palmer&#x27;s other product, this is much thinner in consistency. It works well and I did see a difference in the texture of my face.  This is my lotion for as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to get this lotion at the drug-store, but nobody seems to carry it any more. So disappointing, because this lotion is great! Unlike traditional Palmers, this is lighter, and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a chocolate bar. The alpha/beta addition helps exfoliate, so I use it on my back (which is prone to breakouts). It actually makes me breakout less, and I never feel greasy or oily. It lasts quite awhile, so the price seems worth it. I am addicted to this lotion!</li>
    <li> Not necessarily magical, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far for what I wanted it to do.  I have extremely sensitive skin and I get annoying red bumps here and there on my inner thighs thanks to my own sweat and tight clothes, and also get a lot of ingrown hairs on my calves, so I wanted something to clear them away and this seems to be doing a very good job compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s moisturizing and clearing, helping to clear all your little insecurities away one application at a time.  I feel that I will have even better results after continued use, I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks and my skin takes a long time to heal completely so most of the slight spots left over are just old marks from bumps and ingrowns I had before I started using it.</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like piss, buy this. I think the product does what it should, my skin feels tight, smooth and supple, but the smell! I think you could EASILY find a product with AHA that works equally well and has a much more tolerable smell. I couldn&#x27;t give this product a low rating based on the scent, because that&#x27;s not the purpose for it anyway, so, yeah.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Palmers Cocoa Butter With E &amp; Alpha Beta Smoothing Lotion for about ten years now. Thank YOU Amazon for carrying it (I asked you for it). I can&#x27;t find it in my local chain stores any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for anyone with dry and sensitive skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love Palmers, in general.  This products works well (purchased for bumps on arms).  Unfortunately, the smell is quite perfumey, it doesn&#x27;t have a nice cocoa butter smell, but an old lady perfume smell.  Will probably look for different product next time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion and I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;m able to purchase on Amazon as most stores carry Palmers, just not this particularly lotion.  I&#x27;ve found that my skin retains moisture so much longer using this.  I travel quite a bit going from a humid climate to a dry and this helps me maintain not only hydrated skin but smooth skin as well.  I&#x27;ve used this faithfully for 10+ years and though it seems as though Palmers&#x27; tweaks the formula every now and then (notice more in the scent) it is consistently a great product. The smell is okay, but dissipates enough to not annoy. I use this right after the shower and my skin feels silky soft all day long!</li>
    <li> Bought this - and it was a waste of money! It also smelled very weird as well. Just not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Was a cool lil add on product so I decided to try it. Actually works pretty well. I prefer butters and thicker creams but it moisturizes just fine. Would buy again. Plus I trust the Palmer&#x27;s brand.</li>
    <li> Im a man and im not afraid to say how amazing this stuff is. It makes my skin feel like a babys butt.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. It is so gentle for the skin that I use it on my face too. It makes your skin feel and look like silk.</li>
    <li> love it! makes your body incredibly soft. My skin does not break out when using it like other lotions. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It spreads well, smells good, and works very good. There used to be a 15 oz bottle (cannot find anymore) and the price is right.</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry, so this bottle is not going to last long.  That said, I am happy with the feel of the lotion.  I normally avoid lotion because it makes me feel smothered.  This does not.</li>
    <li> So sad that Palmers have changed the scent of this lotion. I can no longer buy this product any more as the sickly floral smell makes me nauseus. What&#x27;s worse is that it lingers for so long I keep catching it throughout the day. Why Palmers decided to change the scent is beyond me. Sort it our Palmer, you&#x27;ve just lost a life-long customer.</li>
    <li> I didnt give this a high rate because its has such a nasty smell to it. It makes me gag. It moisturizes alright but I just cant get past its odor. I dont know if its suppose to smell this rancid or not</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product, despite the smell.  It&#x27;s heavily fragranced and I do wish they&#x27;d change the scent, but, I feel the scent dissipates sufficiently after awhile.  I have psoriasis and this really helps to exfoliate my skin and keep it in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT  a good price though. ADD-ON schmaddon, Amazon!  Shouldn&#x27;t add on items be bargains?  I pay $3.00 less at another online retailer and I buy multiples at a time, a mere $20 worth, to get free shipping.</li>
    <li> I just received this wonderful cocoa butter lotion today and it smells like paradise aka coconut.  In addition, it makes my skin look brand new and soft.  I have been looking for a type of lotion that I can use after being exposed to the sun over the summer.  I decided to do some research and I came across this product and I decided to get it.  I did not even know this even existed since the stores I go to don&#x27;t sell it.  I will buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I wanted something with lactic acid and BHA to use on my face, and also because I need an alternative to Tend Skin for my legs after epilating and bikini line after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is an excellent, non-greasy moisturizer. It is light but not watery, and imparts lasting moisture to the skin. However, the scent is way too strong. I don&#x27;t mind the way it smells but how strongly it smells. The scent is so powerful that using it on my arms made my eyes water, so there is no way I could use it on my face. I will continue using it on my legs, but I am looking for something less smelly to replace it entirely.</li>
    <li> Just like any other lotion but smells good. However I will admit I don&#x27;t use it everyday, like I should.</li>
