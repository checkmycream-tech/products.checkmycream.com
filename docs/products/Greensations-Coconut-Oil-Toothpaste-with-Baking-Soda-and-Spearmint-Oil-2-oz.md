<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this product because I read reviews that said it whitened teeth.  However, it did nothing for my teeth.</li>
    <li> Really a good whitening, gentle, healthy toothpase, LOVE.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it does an excellent job on your teeth!</li>
    <li> Really works, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Hard to get it to stay on toothbrush. Rather have the toothpaste in a tube. Coconut therapy brand toothpaste is amazing!!</li>
    <li> I love it! It has just 3 ingredients and that&#x27;s it. And that&#x27;s what makes it safe for my child too. She loves the mildness and it&#x27;s certainly doing its job without foam, color and other ingredients I can&#x27;t make a head or tail of.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever used.  My teeth are clean, polished, shiny and slightly whiter.  All the crevasses of my teeth feel smooth.  It taste like coconut oil.  The spearmint oil is barely noticeable.  A little goes a long way.  I use about a pea size. Overall this is a great toothpaste.</li>
    <li> waiting for the result</li>
    <li> Does nothing for breath freshening so I added peppermint oil. Not enough baking soda for cleansing so I coat my toothbrush with baking soda first then add this. Will make my own next time and add xylitol for teeth strengthening</li>
    <li> I will continue using on my teeth. I defiantly see an over all improvement in whitening . Gives a very clean feeling.</li>
    <li> was okay... container makes a mess, especially in warmer climates where oil melts.</li>
    <li> It melts unless kept at a cool temperature, but easy enough of a fix to refrigerate it when not in use</li>
    <li> It came liquified but on the label it says it liquifies at certain temps so all you have to do is throw it in the fridge for 10-15 minutes, which is fine. I love coconut oil for oil pulling &amp; teeth whitening which is why I wanted this product, if you&#x27;ve never used coconut oil then it might be a little distasting but I love this product. It has the spearmint oil to calm the coconut taste down but you can still taste it, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. Three ingredients so it&#x27;s safe for you and your kids. Less ingredients is always better. Love it.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but keep in a cold place ... heat will melt it down ...</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty good, BUT I did not like the fact that the oil had been slowly leaking from the container when I opened the package.  Seems a container which could seal better due to how touchy this stuff is to temperature would be a good idea.  If your house is above 77 degrees this stuff will melt.  So I keep it in the fridge now.</li>
    <li> Love how my teeth feel ultimate tooth paste for my family only one we use GREAT!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for breath issues no help but I do rub on my teeth and gums makes them shine and prevents plaque buildup</li>
    <li> The idea is good. But product needs more baking soda as it is very runny. Comes with spatula which is useless given how runny this is.</li>
