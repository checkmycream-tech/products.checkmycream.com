<ol>
      <li>Great Razor!</li>
      <li>This razor is of quality construction and has an excellent heft for ease of use and control.</li>
      <li>In my world perfect can&#x27;t happen.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful construction.</li>
      <li>The weight is good and combined with Feather Razor Blades, gives an excellent, close  shave.</li>
      <li>As soon as you remove it from the box, you will be impressed with the heft, the exceptional machining of this razor, and the design.  </li>
      <li>Great craftsmanship.</li>
      <li>Handle is great and balance</li>
      <li>well it feels great to me.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful razor, feels great in my hands, quality is outstanding...</li>
      <li>Good razor.</li>
      <li>First, it is marvelously well crafted.</li>
      <li>Amazing Razor.</li>
      <li>Its a nice razor.  </li>
      <li>I bought a Seki Edge Feather razor, which I&#x27;m pleased to own.</li>
      <li>A web search brought me to the iKon, I bought and loved it for a year of virtually cut and razor burn free shaving.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality but performance wise not much of a difference from those lower end razor.</li>
      <li>and it does an amazing job, very smooth and comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the great shave.</li>
      <li>I would expect better longevity than my experience.</li>
      <li>Just like my Parker 99r better</li>
      <li>Most reviews make note of using this &#x27;aggressive&#x27; side for a WTG pass, and then using the safety bar for XTG and ATG passes afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of my many DE razors, this is the one I look forward to the most in my rotation.</li>
      <li>It would cost significantly more if I wanted the features of the OSS.  </li>
      <li>I was enjoying shaving a bit and did some research and considered another razor.  </li>
      <li>I was worried when I bought this razor because it was designed for a more skilled hand.</li>
      <li>While there is a wide variety of shavers out there, this iKon OSS represents what I suspect is one of the best you will find.</li>
      <li>And really, for the price, it is a ridiculously good buy.</li>
      <li>One side has a more &#x27;aggressive&#x27; tendency, but I find this aggressiveness is effective but not irritating.</li>
      <li>Very mild, well built razor</li>
      <li>Fantastic weight and a thing of beauty.</li>
      <li>even though I enjoy the design and craftsmanship that&#x27;s gone into them, my Shavecraft is my go-to razor.</li>
      <li>The OSS fit the range of requirements</li>
      <li>The dual head allows me to go more aggressive with the first pass or two</li>
      <li>If you like a really, really mild shave, this might be the ticket for you.  </li>
      <li>Quality is outstanding...just had a chance for a quick touch up shave</li>
      <li>My new favorite razor.</li>
      <li>The 180&#x27;s handle feels nowhere near as comfortable or easy to grip as the OSS&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Only wish it came with some kind of case or box.</li>
      <li>After considerable time and effort online I liked the idea of stainless and considered ATT and Feather.  </li>
      <li>It was my first razor and well worth every penny.</li>
      <li>To be totally honest, if one was to fork out the 80 dollars for the 180, I&#x27;d save up just a bit more and splurge on the OSS instead, or something of equal calibre.tead, or something of equal calibre.</li>
      <li>The OC I use for first pass and it would be fine for a few days growth as well, while the bar side finishes off the other pass or 2 to well 98% of a perfect shave.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t rightly know the proper name for them, but both have sections of speckled metal protrusions that make the handle easier to grip; however, the OSS&#x27;s is much more pronounced, and the 180&#x27;s can seemingly feel easy to fling out of the hand at times especially with so much water involve - at the sink or in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are experienced enough, getting a good shave out of the 180 with proper technique isn&#x27;t all too hard, but the balanced weight of the OSS, from handle to head, makes this a much easier</li>
      <li>Shipping was stellar, breathtakingly fast.  </li>
      <li>However, it really does give a great shave and as long as you&#x27;re very careful when assembling it</li>
      <li>I was not shaving instinctively with the DE yet and switching from one side to the next was a thought process or a side filled with lather not habit.  </li>
      <li>The safety bar was warped w/ waves--which would have made for a very inconsistent shave--I thought the cap and plate were machined</li>
      <li>The 180 is a light razor, which can cause some, especially begininning, shavers to apply too much pressure and ergo cause too much irritation.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>However, if the Seki were to snap in half tomorrow I&#x27;d gladly give iKon another shot.</li>
      <li>The OSS is simply two sided; one side more for stubble (with deep-cut grooves) and another as a simple safety bar.</li>
      <li>After using a Parker butterfly-style safety razor for a couple years, I grew tired of consistently nicking my neck when I shaved, but I really liked saving money over Mach 3 cartridges.</li>
      <li>The blade protrudes from the head in a way that exposes a bit more of the blade than top part of the head, so finding the right angle isn&#x27;t as hard as on other razors, especially the Futur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Futur is a really appreciable adjustable, but it is more on the aggressive side of things, starting to get rather harsh even at around a setting of &#x27;2&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Admittedly, I have a tendency to over tighten things, but the threads were never cut extremely well, so I won&#x27;t take full responsibility for the razor breaking after a year&#x27;s service.</li>
      <li>Razor is exceptionally mild, especially the open comb side, and I found it to be ineffective.  </li>
      <li>This is the only razor I found that had both a closed and open rake on a single shaver, which is very effective for close no-nick shaving for the various beard lies on your face.  </li>
      <li>very  well built, it feel solid</li>
      <li>Really appreciate the versatility of the open comb and safety bar design, Definitely recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It will last forever (no chrome to chip and wear off - no mechanism to jam or become corroded) and the quality of this razor has few rivals at all, and most of them are MUCH more expensive.</li>
      <li>Tried a few different blades but all left stubble after 3 passes and had to clean up with another razor.  </li>

<li> No more nicks, cuts etc.</li>
<li> use both Derby&#x27;s and Feather&#x27;s in it, and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.</li>

    <li> I recently returned to wet shaving after a long hiatus.  With the rising cost and poor quality of the various multi blade disposables, I looked forward to my return to wet shaving.  While there is a wide variety of shavers out there, this iKon OSS represents what I suspect is one of the best you will find. As soon as you remove it from the box, you will be impressed with the heft, the exceptional machining of this razor, and the design.  This is the only razor I found that had both a closed and open rake on a single shaver, which is very effective for close no-nick shaving for the various beard lies on your face.  While pricey, this very solid razor should serve you for a lifetime and still be treasured by your son and his sons!</li>
    <li> Only been shaving with DE&#x27;s now for several mos., after a 30 year stint with cartridges.  Started with a vintage Gillette OC 1920&#x27;s, and then saw a Merkur 20C with brush and stand for less than the cost of the brush.  No more nicks, cuts etc. now.  I was enjoying shaving a bit and did some research and considered another razor.  After considerable time and effort online I liked the idea of stainless and considered ATT and Feather.  It would cost significantly more if I wanted the features of the OSS.  I was not shaving instinctively with the DE yet and switching from one side to the next was a thought process or a side filled with lather not habit.  The OSS fit the range of requirements and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The OC I use for first pass and it would be fine for a few days growth as well, while the bar side finishes off the other pass or 2 to well 98% of a perfect shave.  In my world perfect can&#x27;t happen.  Handle is great and balance well it feels great to me.  I use persona blades and prorasso and TOBS shave cream for my taste.  I&#x27;m not stingy with the blades and use them only 3X, and at .14 cents I don&#x27;t try. Great Razor!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality but performance wise not much of a difference from those lower end razor. Like the weight and grip.</li>
    <li> After using a Parker butterfly-style safety razor for a couple years, I grew tired of consistently nicking my neck when I shaved, but I really liked saving money over Mach 3 cartridges. A web search brought me to the iKon, I bought and loved it for a year of virtually cut and razor burn free shaving. Unfortunately, around that one year mark I went to change the blade and reassemble the razor, as I had done many times, when I realized the threads were stripped and I could no longer tighten the handle to the head. Admittedly, I have a tendency to over tighten things, but the threads were never cut extremely well, so I won&#x27;t take full responsibility for the razor breaking after a year&#x27;s service. However, it really does give a great shave and as long as you&#x27;re very careful when assembling it I would expect better longevity than my experience. Ultimately, I&#x27;ve moved on - I bought a Seki Edge Feather razor, which I&#x27;m pleased to own. However, if the Seki were to snap in half tomorrow I&#x27;d gladly give iKon another shot.</li>
    <li> My new favorite razor.</li>
    <li> Amazing Razor. Great craftsmanship. will last forever. Bought for a gift and he loves it ! Going to save money too !</li>
    <li> Razor is exceptionally mild, especially the open comb side, and I found it to be ineffective.  Tried a few different blades but all left stubble after 3 passes and had to clean up with another razor.  If you like a really, really mild shave, this might be the ticket for you.  If you like a moderate to aggressive shave, not worth taking a chance as they don&#x27;t accept returns.</li>
    <li> Of my many DE razors, this is the one I look forward to the most in my rotation. First, it is marvelously well crafted. And really, for the price, it is a ridiculously good buy. It will last forever (no chrome to chip and wear off - no mechanism to jam or become corroded) and the quality of this razor has few rivals at all, and most of them are MUCH more expensive. I have one or two of those also and yet, even though I enjoy the design and craftsmanship that&#x27;s gone into them, my Shavecraft is my go-to razor.</li>
    <li> The safety bar was warped w/ waves--which would have made for a very inconsistent shave--I thought the cap and plate were machined but they were not.  Not what you&#x27;d expect for this price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful razor, feels great in my hands, quality is outstanding...</li>
    <li> I was worried when I bought this razor because it was designed for a more skilled hand. It was my first razor and well worth every penny. It feels like a well weighted chef knife in my hand. I will buy ikon again. Thanks for the great shave. I use it for my face and head.</li>
    <li> Fantastic weight and a thing of beauty. The dual head allows me to go more aggressive with the first pass or two and then milder with the last. Lots of audible feedback to dial in the correct angle.</li>
    <li> Its a nice razor.  For the price I would have been just as well served with a 34c, and for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> It gives me a close shave. I no longer have an issue with ingrown hairs on my neck. very  well built, it feel solid</li>
    <li> The head reacted with Barbicide and corroded to the point of disolving in some places!!.</li>
    <li> Quality is outstanding...just had a chance for a quick touch up shave and it does an amazing job, very smooth and comfortable shave.  Shipping was stellar, breathtakingly fast.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very mild, well built razor</li>
    <li> Beautiful construction. The weight is good and combined with Feather Razor Blades, gives an excellent, close  shave. Only wish it came with some kind of case or box.</li>
    <li> I have two other razors in the years I&#x27;ve been shaving: a Merkur 180 and a Merkur Futur. The Futur was an &#x27;upgrade&#x27; from the 180.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between those two, there are cons I think are covered by the OSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The 180&#x27;s handle feels nowhere near as comfortable or easy to grip as the OSS&#x27;. I don&#x27;t rightly know the proper name for them, but both have sections of speckled metal protrusions that make the handle easier to grip; however, the OSS&#x27;s is much more pronounced, and the 180&#x27;s can seemingly feel easy to fling out of the hand at times especially with so much water involve - at the sink or in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The 180 is a light razor, which can cause some, especially begininning, shavers to apply too much pressure and ergo cause too much irritation. If you are experienced enough, getting a good shave out of the 180 with proper technique isn&#x27;t all too hard, but the balanced weight of the OSS, from handle to head, makes this a much easier shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The Futur is a really appreciable adjustable, but it is more on the aggressive side of things, starting to get rather harsh even at around a setting of &#x27;2&#x27;. The OSS is simply two sided; one side more for stubble (with deep-cut grooves) and another as a simple safety bar. One side has a more &#x27;aggressive&#x27; tendency, but I find this aggressiveness is effective but not irritating. Most reviews make note of using this &#x27;aggressive&#x27; side for a WTG pass, and then using the safety bar for XTG and ATG passes afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The blade protrudes from the head in a way that exposes a bit more of the blade than top part of the head, so finding the right angle isn&#x27;t as hard as on other razors, especially the Futur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s ever so marginally smaller in length than the 180 and Futur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use both Derby&#x27;s and Feather&#x27;s in it, and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet. To be totally honest, if one was to fork out the 80 dollars for the 180, I&#x27;d save up just a bit more and splurge on the OSS instead, or something of equal calibre.tead, or something of equal calibre.</li>
    <li> Returned to shaving the &amp;#34;old-fashioned&amp;#34; way a year ago. This razor is of quality construction and has an excellent heft for ease of use and control. Really appreciate the versatility of the open comb and safety bar design, Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;This is horrific seller &amp; horrific razor. It is big &amp; heavy and built like a garbage truck. Razor had a very rough finish and metal had plenty of burrs that would slice meat. The seller stiffed me with a $35 restocking fee that was never mentioned on his Amazon page. DO NOT BUY! STAY AWAY!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Good razor. Just like my Parker 99r better</li>
