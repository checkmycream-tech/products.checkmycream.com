<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are the best makeup removing towelettes I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen different kinds.&lt;br /&gt;This wipe does not irritate or break out my acne prone skin. It does not reek or stink of artificial fragrance like others I&#x27;ve tried. There is no sticky residue or any other residue left on my skin after I&#x27;m finished and my face has dried. These wipes remove ALL of my mascara and makeup, even when I wear particularly heavy makeup. My skin feels super soft after using these but not like it has a layer of oily moisturizer or anything suffocating my skin...I think that&#x27;s the aloe Vera, I love aloe Vera!&lt;br /&gt;My eyes do get irritated if I accidentally wipe my eyeball when removing eye makeup, but they don&#x27;t sting/burn and that&#x27;s admittedly my own fault.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only towelette I use where I don&#x27;t need or want to wash my face or at least use toner afterward. Totally recommend it to anyone looking to clean their face without washing (because I&#x27;m lazy at night) --I&#x27;m done buying other brands just bc they&#x27;re on sale or want to try new things.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of facial cloths and find many of them to be too harsh for my sensitive skin. These cloths are a lifesaver. They are wet enough to thoroughly remove makeup and dirt, and they glide easily across my skin. The cloths are smooth and not abrasive. After using them, the skin on my face dries without leaving any stickiness or residue from the wipes on my skin. And after using them my face feels hydrated and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These facial cloths come in a plastic blue soft pack that is compact and easy to store. You get one individual wipe out by peeling back the sticker on top to reveal the opening and then you reseal them by pressing the sticker back in place. I have not had a problem with the sticker not sticking or with the wipes drying out and I have used them for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are so gentle that you can use them daily and not aggravate your skin, even if you have sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t have a washer and dryer in my apartment and these wipes are convenient so that I do not have to use washcloths to wash my face, which would just cause me to have to do more laundry. Instead, these wipes, though gentle, are great at getting all of the makeup and grime off of my face while making my skin feel hydrated, yet fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Use these on trips.  Great after a long flight to wipe off the old makeup and put on a new face.</li>
    <li> I keep a package of these in the car.  On my way home from work, while I am sitting in the worst traffic in the US, I use these to clean the make-up off my face.  They work well for my sensitive skin.  They are also so cool and refreshing after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloths are not overly moist, but moist enough  They are not sudsy like other brands which is nice.  They aren&#x27;t oily either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, so use the 24 hour color stay make-up so most times I need to use two cloths to get my skin really clean.  I don&#x27;t mind though.  I keep wiping my face until I&#x27;ve cleaned every spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to keep them in a Ziploc bag for fear they would dry out in the car, but the seal on the top of it (kind of a removable sticker) is plenty strong enough to keep the moisture locked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the subscribe and save, so I&#x27;m pleased with the price and convenience of having these delivered every month.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and cleans well</li>
    <li> Serves it purpose. but tbh you&#x27;ll be better off just wetting a paper towel and wiping face. save the money.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me acne after use, like most other products used to remove make up. The texture is like silk, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Usually, I&#x27;m a fan of Olay products.  So, when I thought the Neutrogena cleaning cloths left a bit of a too-greasy feeling on my face, I decided to give this one a try.  Unfortunately, it was a terrible decision for two reasons:  1. It&#x27;s horribly ineffective at actually removing makeup.  I have to rub at my eyes HARD to get rid of eyeliner.  Mascara? forget it!  2. It actually burns your eyes.  I end up having to splash my face with water after using this to get rid of the pain, which sort of defeats the purpose of a wet cleansing cloth.  I guess it&#x27;s back to Neutrogena after I finish using these two packages...  So awful.</li>
    <li> Love these cloths works very well with removing make up and cleansing face! I have really sensitive skin and it works like a charm I would suggest you split them in half to save some change they are large enough to be split in half and still work just fine the packaging is horrible put the package in a zip lock bag so they won&#x27;t dry up but every since I&#x27;ve been using them my face doesn&#x27;t break out any more I&#x27;ve been using them for about 2 years now! Great product!</li>
    <li> I love to use these at night when I&#x27;m so tired I just don&#x27;t want to get out the soap and washcloth to wash my face at night before bed. I have a tendency to itch with a lot of products and I don&#x27;t with this one so it works very well cleaning without drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> Love these and they are more expensive in the stores.  Look at the prices in any other store you choose.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine living without these.  Everyday they are what I use &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; I was my face.  They do a great j o b at removing the top coat of makeup and most of my eye makeup. They don&#x27;t replace wash I mg face but they make it better.  BTW great for travelling.</li>
    <li> My face is very sensitive to anything I put on it. This is one of the few products that does not cause an allergic reaction. And it makes my face feel clean.</li>
    <li> They do the job, but they make your eyes burn like satan&#x27;s a$@hole. Use with caution, or try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I use these at my desk and in the car as a quick face cleanse.  Works really well at getting the grim off and leaving your skin feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had bad acne problems since the age of 11 (now 41) and these coupled with the Proactiv and Adapalene Gel really help almost eliminate the problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wipes to remove my make-up and clean my face for quite some time. I tried using other brands, but these seem to work the best at removing everything while not irritating my skin and not smelling like chemicals or a fragrance. I&#x27;m glad Amazon has them on Subscribe &amp; Save so that I don&#x27;t have to go buy them at the store all the time now!</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to these. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup but what I do wear comes off completely and comfortably using these wipes. They also leave my skin feeling supple and hydrated. A recommended part of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; end of the make up kit.</li>
    <li> It removed all of my makeup and oil, but doesn&#x27;t overstrip your skin which is great. I have oily and dry skin.  My nose and the area around my nose is so dry it flakes all the time.  These towelette&#x27;s don&#x27;t dry my skin out as bad.  I have really sensitive skin and it works fine.</li>
    <li> These are great to keep handy and do a good job removing dirt,oil and makeup.  Tend to dry out if not used soon enough, but this is to be expected with such things.  I make sure to close them good and push out the air, then place it in a zip lock bag and push out the air and seal.  Helps keep them wet longer.</li>
    <li> Very handy cleanup with strong odor or skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I use a cleanser in the morning to wash my face.  At night, I use these towelettes to remove my makeup, and I love it.  The sensitive towelettes are great for use around my eye area too- no irritation.  This is the best way I have found to remove my makeup and cleanse, without leaving my skin oily and without having to use water.  When I&#x27;m in a hurry in the morning, I&#x27;ve used these before to wash my face too, and they work great.  I&#x27;ve also found that they are cheaper on Amazon than in the stores (by about $1 a pack).</li>
    <li> Super cleaning ability and convenient.</li>
    <li> I use these to wipe the sweat and grime off my face after working out when I don&#x27;t have immediate access to a shower. They are effective at removing the sweat and don&#x27;t irritate my skin, which is a plus. They&#x27;re relatively sturdy towelettes and don&#x27;t fall apart or leave lint when I wipe around my facial hair.</li>
    <li> OUTSTANDING!!  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I use to use these but I have skin lupus I had to switch to something else. These burn my skin!</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER HAD SEVERE NODULAR CYSTIC ACNE AND AFTER USING THESE WIPES ONCE TO TWICE PER DAY IT IS GONE EXCEPT FOR AN OCCASIONAL PIMPLE.</li>
    <li> Works great on my oily skin, I don&#x27;t use makeup so I can&#x27;t tell you how well it cleans it off. There&#x27;s no fragrance which my skin loves. its a little more on the pricy side for for what it is, although I already have them I can&#x27;t convince myself to order again.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about all of the cleansing towelettes on the market over the years. I found these a few months ago and have been very happy with them ever since. The thing with most of the towelettes they are not wet enough and come out of the package almost dry. These are perfect and I love how clean they leave my skin and they are just right for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These cleansing towelettes remove makeup well, but they are so moist that it tends to get in the eyes and burn if you try removing anything around the eye area.</li>
    <li> Great for travel too.  Throw them in your bag and your good to go.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about carrying a liquid make up remover or facial toner.  These towelettes do both.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like them but no...They made my face brake out...and they stung...and they dried out!!!!! Not satisfied. I would not recommend to buy these.</li>
    <li> I love having these on hand.  Fresh and clean feel with no lingering odors. I will continue purchasing these.</li>
    <li> It does the job of cleaning makeup, etc. off my face quite nicely.  But what makes it especially good is that it leaves my skin feeling soothed as well.  That is what makes me like it better than the brand I was using before trying this.</li>
    <li> I really like these for removing makeup. They are sufficiently wet, don&#x27;t fall apart if you rub a bit, and do remove all my makeup. (note that I don&#x27;t wear waterproof, so I can&#x27;t speak to that). They don&#x27;t leave a film on my skin--in fact, my skin feels very smooth and soft, after using these.</li>
    <li> This gets makeup off easily and with no mess. I have used these for some time and have never had a problem with them drying out, but I use about 5/week so I might go through them more quickly than others. I like this product.</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay makes a good product. Good price. Not my first choice but it will do for the price.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this product did not irritate me at all.  The convenience is just a plus.</li>
    <li> Never hurts my eyes when taking off eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Okay but not the greatest for removing makeup.</li>
    <li> Easy make-remover.  I have been using for years.  A very reliable product. Convenient for travel. My easily irratated skin likes these.</li>
    <li> My wife uses an excellent makeup but it&#x27;s difficult to remove.  With this product it comes off like water.  It&#x27;s a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> Olay makes the best sensitive cloths out there!  Will always buy!  My face has never been this soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied and thankful for the prompt delivery of this product.  It was much needed and very useful for hygiene care after surgery.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t get my eye makeup off all the way so we had to buy eye makeup remover. They&#x27;re good for the rest of my makeup though.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite face cleansing wipes. The deal I got them for was much better than I could get in the store.</li>
    <li> very nice and effective towellettes. have tried a number of brands and this is a very good quality. recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> I use these some nights if I&#x27;m lazy to use soap to wash my face. I also use these after using my weekly clay mask as I&#x27;m not sure if the clay will clog my sink so better safe than sorry. I&#x27;d ordered these along with the Simple Radiance Cleansing Wipes for sensitive skin. I opened the Simple Radiance package first and used all of those before using the Olay ones. I was sold on the Simple Radiance ones and was going to re-order them but once I tried the Olay ones I immediately liked them more. The Simple Radiance ones are more flimsy and not as sturdy. For taking off makeup and clay I prefer the Olay one as it&#x27;s thicker and I seem to get more mileage out of it. I use a few strokes, then fold it over and use the back clean side, then fold again and use the back clean side, etc. I would give Simple Radiance ones 4 stars and Olay ones 5 stars. On nights that I use the Olay ones I rinse my face after and I don&#x27;t have any change in my skin complexion the next day so it works pretty much just as well as my normal cleanser.</li>
    <li> I would be very careful using this around the eyes. It really stings and makes my eyes tear a lot. I only use them around the face and never coming too close to the eye. Otherwise, these get the job done. They don&#x27;t have much of a smell which is nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these. I never have to wash my face before bed, I just keep these in my nightstand. Nicely moist, without getting gross or weird. Good at removing makeup and grime.</li>
    <li> Used other face wipes but by far love these. leaves face not only clean but feeling softer and not dried out.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy because several were purchased together in the order.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived in great shape and right on&lt;br /&gt;time as usual!!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes. I will definitely be purchasing again! Great for sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> great for my gym bag to quickly swipe off make up before a work out!</li>
    <li> Keep these by the bed to remove makeup when I forget or am too tired to get up and wash my face.  They feel clean and do not leave a sticky feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and it&#x27;s great nothing comes close to the quality always my go to wipes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleansers and towelettes, but prefer these and am thankful that they are still available. Pluses: gentle, effective, convenient  for storage or travel, no more make-up stained washcloths. Minuses: a little pricey, may require an additional product for mascara removal, may momentarily sting some skin or eyes, but following with a hot damp washcloth takes care of that. A tip: rotate package regularly to keep moisture well-distributed and prevent drying out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s so gentle but cleans like a dream. Repeat customer and plan to be one for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love these wipes, I use them daily.</li>
    <li> I buy this combo a lot.  Great price and service for this item.  Much better than buying in a store.</li>
    <li> I used these when I was in the hospital and unable to shower, and I now use these cloths at night before going to bed. I do not know if they would work on those of you who wear a lot of makeup, but they work fine one someone like me who wears little or no makeup.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 70&#x27;s and I like this product for initial make-up removal only.  After using a towelette to remove eye and face make-up I use a cream cleanser and tissue off (no water) what remains followed by a warm wet wash cloth.  Judging by the color on the tissue, there is still make-up remaining in my pores after using the towelette.  On days I stay home without make up I use the towelette only and it works OK, but then my face does not need the extra cleaning.</li>
    <li> I am a 42 year old female who has very dry skin, all year round.  In the past, I have used creme cleanser to wash my face (from Aveda, Almay, etc.) and it always felt very tight afterwards.  Then, I would use my moisturizer and over moisturize to help with the tighness, which just ended up making my face feel a bit greasy.  And, every day and night, repeat this process.  My face was so dry that it even flaked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this product as I was looking for something easier and more effective.  I first purchased this in my local drugstore.  After my first use, I noticed that my skin didn&#x27;t feel tight - it just felt clean.  And, I didn&#x27;t need half as much moisturizer afterwards.  After a week of usage, my overall skin eveness and complexion improved noticeably!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 5 years now and love it.  This is basically a pack of 30 wipes.  It lays on its side, and you pull up this plastic flap in the front to view a hole in the middle of the pack where you pull out one of the wipes (just like you would a baby wipe or a tissue).  You reseal the hole with the flap to keep the product air tight and keep it moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this wipe (it&#x27;s the size of a standard tissue), you just wipe your face with it.  It removed all of your makeup and oil, but doesn&#x27;t overstrip your skin which is great.  When you are done, you just throw the wipe in the garbage - it&#x27;s that simple.  And, because it&#x27;s in this sealed package, it&#x27;s very portable - you can throw this package in your purse and use it to freshen up anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this product - the one for Sensitive skin - as there is almost no smell to it.  But, the product for normal skin is also good - same thing except it has a smell to the product and seems to be a bit stronger in terms of cleaning.  I only order that when I can&#x27;t get the Sensitive skin - I have now started to order this from Amazon in quantities of 20 so that I never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I love this product and highly recommend it.e this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! It saves me time every morning and feels great! I&#x27;ve been using them for over a year and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is great to take on trips.  It keeps very well in the packaging and does not dry out.  I use it at home when I remove daily makeup.  Lives up to its claim as \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; wet cleansing cloths -- is generous in size.</li>
    <li> I love these! They are so nice to take camping and take off your make up. Ive told my friends about these and they love them too.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand I can use. The others bother my skin. It feels kind on your face and great to take out of town with you.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t as I expected. It was advertised for Sensitive skin, but what I got was for Normal skin.</li>
    <li> I love love love these! I use them before bed to clean my face. I have very sensitive skin so they are perfect for me</li>
    <li> This is the first makeup removing wipe that I have used. It works okay to me. Before I got to bed I use a wipe and then I use my face cleanser to get anything I missed off.</li>
    <li> wanted something for me to use during the day when i needed it to keep my face feeling refreshed from having an oily face a lot of times during the day or from feeling stressed. didn&#x27;t use them often but these wipes are simple, not weighted down in liquid, doesn&#x27;t drip when you pull it out, makes your face feel fresh and clean. i like olay products anyway. use their night cream already. my mother has used olay for years (the creams) and her face seems to glow and she&#x27;s in her 70&#x27;s. i gave one pack to my daughter for wiping off make up and she uses it pretty much on a daily basis at night before she goes to bed and says it doesn&#x27;t make her break out and wants more! i gave her my pack, now i&#x27;m without! :) wish prices were a little cheaper though with free shipping. but 5 stars for what i think is a  great product!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem to pull the makeup off as easily. Extremely gentle.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves these</li>
    <li> Like others who have said: I&#x27;m lazy at night when it comes to a beauty ritual,&amp;#34; these Olay towelettes are the greatest. It&#x27;s easy to be dedicated and I surprisingly can tell a difference in my skin and I&#x27;m still on my first pack. I&#x27;m a young-looking 66, but if you can change this face, you&#x27;ve done something, yes?</li>
    <li> I have tried several &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; type facial wipes and these are by far the best.  They get all of my eye make-up off and don&#x27;t leave a burning sensation on my skin or in my eyes.  I can get the solution in my eyes and not feel a thing.  These wipes come a little too dry, so I just add some bottled water to the entire pack and end up with wipes that are much better at getting all of my make-up off.</li>
    <li> These have a nice soothing feeling. Removes my foundation easily as well as eye shadow but not mascara. The good thing is that the product isn&#x27;t overly perfumed since that can irritate my asthma. Doesn&#x27;t break me out. And, it seems to moisturize  nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m having it sent every couple months automatically and love not needing to have to remember to pick it up.</li>
    <li> I did really like these wipes - I thought they cleaned the make-up from my face very well and even took care of stubborn eyeliner.  HOWEVER, I decided to discontinue my Subscribe and Save because the soap on these wipes burned my eyes really badly to the point where my eyes would water and I had to rinse them out.  Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive to whatever formula they use, but I wanted to make sure others were aware!</li>
    <li> I use these everyday to remove my makeup.  It even removes waterproof mascara.  Leaves my face clean and not dry.</li>
    <li> The price beat the local drugstore and it is the same that I always use.  Cleans well but not hard on the skin.</li>
    <li> These are great to keep in the bathroom to remove makeup or just wash your face at the end of the day when you&#x27;re too lazy to take a shower.</li>
    <li> I used these while in Ethiopia doing medical work out in the villages where there was no water!  They don&#x27;t feel sticky or leave a residue after use.  My face actually felt really clean after using them.  Will buy them again for the next trip!</li>
    <li> I like these.  They are just the right size and stay moist and don&#x27;t dry out.  I have them on auto-reorder.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again because they burn my eyes. It is also difficult to get all the makeup off.</li>
    <li> Love to clean my face with these every day</li>
    <li> I use to never use this kind of product but there are just days I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my wash and I use only this before going to bed. It works smoothly and I wake up refreshed. great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong when you purchase Olay.  Since I do not drive, I have to make a lot of my purchases online.  I have always used Olay creams, but never the cleansing cloths.  I find that these cloths are so much better then the brand I had been using.  With Amazon, you order products one day and receive them so fast, that it doesn&#x27;t pay to go to a store to purchase items.</li>
    <li> I have used other wet cleansing cloths before but these are by far the best!. While other cloths seem to evaporate off my skin leaving it dry, the Olay cloths leave my face feeling clean, fresh and moisturized!</li>
    <li> Many uses including make up removal on sensitive skin.  These are my absolutely favorite cleansing towelettes.  It&#x27;s a quick way to get make up off your eyes and skin at the end of your day and before bedtime.  There are no harsh chemicals and your moisturizer can be put on after simply cleansing with these clothes.  No harsh soaps, and quick clean up.</li>
    <li> I adore these wipes. They are the only brand I still use that still does animal testing where required by law.(minus 1 star) Drives me nuts but every time I use a new wipe it irritates my very sensitive skin. I try to stay away from these but I ultimately go back. If you have sensitive skin these are pretty amazing and had a nice amount of wetness so it really gets off all the makeup but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m dripping.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these and her beautiful face after 70 years is proof.</li>
    <li> I generally love Olay products so I was disappointed trying these. I like to wipe my face after exercising, hot days, and before bed if I don&#x27;t have time to wash my face. The wipes I&#x27;ve used from Aveeno and Neutrogena have never given me problems, but these were on sale and I like the company so I went for it. They left my face feeling sticky and if it had a residue left over. I have non-greasy thin skin, so usually my skin feels baby soft no matter what. I am now using them as wipes for my cat when he comes inside....</li>
    <li> These are the best cleaning wipes. We use them twice a day. My skin feels great. Make up comes off so easy.</li>
    <li> I usually stick to washing my face with a mild type of soap and the Olay battery operated face scrubber, but when I&#x27;ve had a long day and feel too lazy to remove my makeup properly, I reach for Olay wet cleansing towelettes.  They do a reasonably good job of removing makeup and dirt and don&#x27;t require rinsing.  They&#x27;re a must have in my makeup arsenal.</li>
    <li> I really like these cleansing cloths for the convenience of removing makeup and cleaning my face before bed on nights when I just don&#x27;t feel like doing a full face wash.  I usually only wear tinted moisturizer and waterproof mascara, and these cloths remove that easily (note: my mascara washes off easily with regular facial cleansers too, so it may not be as waterproof as the kinds that require using oil eye makeup remover).  However, these cloths are not as wet as I was expecting, and after 20-30 seconds of wiping, they are pretty much dry.  If you wear a lot of makeup, I think you will need to use at least 2 of these cloths to do a full cleansing.</li>
