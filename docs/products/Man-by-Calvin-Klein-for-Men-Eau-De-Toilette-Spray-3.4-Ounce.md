      <li>great scent.  </li>

      <li>Really great price for the amount on ounce that it has.</li>

      <li>I love the smell and at a great price.  </li>
      <li>A good comparison would be the smell you have when opening the door of a car with leather seats that has a pack of mint chewing gum sitting on the dash on a warm day.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked things made by Calvin Klein, and this is no exception.</li>
      <li>It has a  light, pleasant scent, not overpowering as some.  </li>
      <li>This is where I think Man shines, because it&#x27;s warm, inviting...yet refreshing.</li>
      <li>And most importantly, my girlfriend always tells me how good I smell whenever I wear it.  </li>
      <li>For another grandson -- assume he liked it just fine</li>
      <li>Nothing more to add.</li>
      <li>When he ran out I had to get him more immediately.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok but</li>
      <li>so glad i found it for this price.</li>
      <li>This is where things take a turn for the better.  </li>
      <li>He said that it is more like water in the bottle.</li>
      <li>Great Smelling Perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have paid as much as $29.43 for it.</li>
      <li>I love this fragance.</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne EVER.</li>
      <li>I am not the happiest, and will keep looking for a better after-shave for me.</li>
      <li>My husband and son love it.</li>
      <li>but I can tell people it might be better to buy cologne in a store.</li>
      <li>this is my boyfriends favorite cologne</li>

      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon.com is selling it</li>

      <li>This perfume is sooo sexy, masculin and rich!</li>

      <li>light fragrance, but it has a many air to it.</li>

      <li>This item was fairly inexpensive and shipped at a fast rate.</li>
      <li>strongly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>top notes I get when I first spray is overwhelming sweetness (I&#x27;m not a fan).</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful, howbeit rather light, but very pleasant cologne, with a faint, lingering orange odour that is unique.  </li>
      <li>lol I think I&#x27;ll just go to Calvin Klein&#x27;s website next time buy it</li>
      <li>People have noted the same; I think the best off-compliment this has received is, \\&quot;It makes me think of cuddling under a warm blanket while the window&#x27;s slightly open in the winter.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
      <li>For the man who wants a confident and sexy scent, this one does it</li>
      <li>Fairly priced and the container is classy.</li>
      <li>So you need to make sure the scent is right for you.</li>
      <li>If you are going for a unique smell I would go for this in a heartbeat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s sense of smell and perception are different, so please take this review with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;One of the strengths of CK Man is that it&#x27;s long-lasting (one spray about 1 inch from my skin will linger for about 10+ hours).  To put things in perspective, I usually give one spray to each area behind my temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top notes I get when I first spray is overwhelming sweetness (I&#x27;m not a fan). It feels like someone is crushing fresh rosemary or thyme under your nose while orange-flavored vodka mixed with gin is being sprayed at you.  I don&#x27;t find the sickly sweet aromas very pleasant, and people have asked if I&#x27;ve been drinking when I&#x27;ve met them immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mid notes blossom about 1/2 hour to an hour after you&#x27;ve applied Man.  This is where things take a turn for the better.  Man evolves into something mildly sweet, mellow, and somewhat musky.  It&#x27;s like if you&#x27;re about arm&#x27;s length away from an open cigar box containing a few sticks of unburned incense and sprigs of mint.  This is where I think Man shines, because it&#x27;s warm, inviting...yet refreshing. People have noted the same; I think the best off-compliment this has received is, \\&quot;It makes me think of cuddling under a warm blanket while the window&#x27;s slightly open in the winter.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As everything winds down hours later, Man leaves you with a soft scent of pine; slightly woody, slightly minty, and with a touch of sweetness.  A good comparison would be the smell you have when opening the door of a car with leather seats that has a pack of mint chewing gum sitting on the dash on a warm day.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought one a few weeks ago. and I ordered 2 more!!!</li>
    <li> The best scent for me, elegant, masculine, classy and LONG LASTING..I received more than I expected because i didn&#x27;t knew that it camed with after shave!!!</li>
    <li> This item was fairly inexpensive and shipped at a fast rate. The deal on this product was amazing and I really appreciate how cheap it was for how much I&#x27;ve received. All together, this was a good buy and I would recommend buying from this company to anyone. Thank you!</li>
    <li> i was searching for a long time for this cologne and im so glad i found it for this price. girlfriend can&#x27;t stay off of me... ;)</li>
    <li> Ordered item 2 days ago at a great price and it is already here! Amazing Amazon has done it again!</li>
    <li> Cologne, or perfume for that matter, mixes with the natural scent of the wearer. So you need to make sure the scent is right for you. If you know light wood-based scents work on you I highly recommend this cologne. If not, then I suggest maybe trying it in the store before purchasing or try something else. That being said..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best cologne I have yet to find. I get complements on it almost every day, even repetitive complements such as \\&quot;I still can not get over how good you always smell\\&quot;. I shower in the morning and as soon as I get out and towel off I spray this once. The other gentlemen reviewing this cologne mentioned it is a bit strong when first applied and I would have to agree, but by the time I am dressed and out the door it has mellowed out into it&#x27;s prime scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On special occasions I like to pair this up with another cologne, Calvin Klein One. Just a swipe of the One down my neck and a spray of the Man right out of the shower is a scent that mixes with my body like it was made just for me. Again, it&#x27;s strong when first applied but by the time you&#x27;re out the door it is perfect. I would recommend this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several bottles of CK Man over the last few years, and it still smells as good to me as ever.  All the women I work compliment me when I where it; one even trying to find out what scent it was so she could get it for her significant-other.  And most importantly, my girlfriend always tells me how good I smell whenever I wear it.  I will continue to buy it so long as CK makes it.</li>
    <li> This was a first time that I used this  fragrance. It was delivered fine, and n time, but this scent does not last very long for me. I am not the happiest, and will keep looking for a better after-shave for me.</li>
    <li> i brought this seeing its review and it was good for first few days and now it is without any fragrance,</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Smells Great! Its one of those scents that when you walk past someone they look around to see who that was. 10/10. Worth it!!</li>
    <li> great scent.  Not your typical everyday cologne&lt;br /&gt;if you want something unique, i would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;nice long lasting</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked things made by Calvin Klein, and this is no exception. The smell is great, just right for daily use.</li>
    <li> like the smell and price was affordable for a brand product.  got complement whenever I go to places.  you get what is expected from the maker.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.Two sprays and I&#x27;m good all day.Kinda expected from CK.Im just disappointed because I lost it,or got it stolen 3 weeks after It arrived.many compliments,would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This was a product that was more expensive in stores.  Price was cheaper, shipping cost wasn&#x27;t bad, product was exactly what I needed it to be.</li>
    <li> Soothing aroma, not perfumy.</li>
    <li> My second bottle and my favorite cologne.  Some cologne are made for a specific man and this one is for me.</li>
    <li> I find Calvin Klein man deep and musky (in a good way). It&#x27;s good but not great, but of course this is highly subjective. My wife likes this for daily wear. I&#x27;d rank this in my top three.</li>
    <li> Man is a long lasting perfume from CK with a nice price tag.  I like this for a casual use.</li>
    <li> It is not a great cologne as people have written. Little disappointed. Does not last long and within an hour, it is gone.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and at a great price.  I really like the cologne and my wife does as well.</li>
    <li> this really is a wonderful scent for the price.the top notes of rosemary bergamont, mandarin,and violet leaf express a playful, light, casual, yet more adult essence (than say CK One). I purchased this and Burberry The Beat for casual wear. I&#x27;m finding CK Man packed more often for trips or being sprayed before going out much more frequently than the latter.</li>
    <li> In all honesty I have never smelt a cologne like this one. It definitely smells like the woodlands with a light warm (if that makes sense) smell afterwards. If you are going for a unique smell I would go for this in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for a friend last year and loved it so much I wanted to get some for myself.&lt;br /&gt;When my order arrived the bottle was really warm.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no expert but it&#x27;s feasible the heat from shipping caused the aroma to be altered.&lt;br /&gt;Did some reading on the net and my theory is possible. All I know is it isn&#x27;t the same as the bottle I bought for my friend. It also doesn&#x27;t last long. Can&#x27;t really blame Amazon but I can tell people it might be better to buy cologne in a store.</li>
    <li> this is my boyfriends favorite cologne and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Amazon saves the day! I always find what I&#x27;m looking for here. This is a huge bottle and it will last him a while.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband.  It has a  light, pleasant scent, not overpowering as some.  He likes  it and the container is very nice.  Makes a good gift.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  My wife and daughter tell me &amp;#34;you smell like a man!&amp;#34; everytime I use this product.  It is not whispy nor is it overpowering.  It is &amp;#34;goldilocks&amp;#34;; not too strong, not too weak, but just right.  It is great whether out and about, at work, or for a night out.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of best fragrances in my list.. Its not very strong but still gives a great fragrance which lasts long without giving headeache ;) (due to strong ones sometime ppl get) I already used it and hence re ordered from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for money...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to amazon...</li>
    <li> I love Calvin Klein Man and can only find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I believe the product is not original, the smell fades away very fast and it felt like spraying water on myself</li>
    <li> I dont know how to review it . Its so subjective ! What smells great for me could not be great for you .But in my statistics every one love this perfume. I wish the fixer could be a little better ...last a little longer ...</li>
    <li> Real Deal, Smelt Great, and I was happy it wasn;t fake like the Euphoria purchase i made through another vendor on here.</li>
    <li> This was a gift!! Nice smell.</li>
    <li> I am expecting the scent of this perfume will last the whole day but it last only for about 4 hours. I think you need to spray from time to time to maintain your long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
    <li> It smells nice and I don&#x27;t smell bad like guys who wear Hugo Boss. That stuff stinks really bad. CK Men great stuff.</li>
    <li> We were very happy to receive our order of Man by CK. It is a nice size bottle, and wonderful scent. It has been a good experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I am sorry to find it less available. Also lots of positive comments about it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes this perfume.....I ordered it and it came seal packed but when I opened it, the lid of the bottle was cracked....A big crack was there, so that was disappointing............</li>
    <li> Very quick shipment and an awesome quality of the item! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for this cologne. It was less expensive on line. I shopped at the malls and they didn&#x27;t carry it or it was twice as much.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very good service, I recommend</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cut it for me. Top notes were too sweet, and the longevity of the scent is barely half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;The product seems original but looks like it&#x27;s come from an old stock (and hence the price I presume is what it is). Anyways buying perfume online is like roulette so all the best; it might work out or might not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS : five stars though for providing me comic relief;  to the person who wrote the FAQ document that came along with the perfume. The question was \\&quot;I can&#x27;t smell the perfume on me after a while. Why is that so?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The answer: \\&quot;your nose gets used to the smell after a while, and anyways perfumes are for the people around you to smell, not for you to smell\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Anticipatory bail filing lawyers would be proud of you my writer friend....</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. We both loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product. Arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I typically wear colognes like Aqua Di Gio or Abercrombie Fierce but I received CK Man as a gift. This cologne is lackluster AT BEST.  I work in an office setting and have asked all the women if they like my cologne. They have all said that I smell great all the time but wondered if I stopped wearing cologne.  They have all gotten a close up smell of my neck and have all agreed they can&#x27;t smell CK Man.  I have sprayed it on my arm to test it and can&#x27;t pick up any scent. If you&#x27;re spending over $40 for cologne... 9 times out of 10 you&#x27;re going to get compliments by people about it. This is the 1 out of 10 to skip buying.</li>
    <li> For another grandson -- assume he liked it just fine or I would have heard about it by now.</li>
    <li> very good product! and arrived on the agreed date! I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great gift for a man!!!</li>
    <li> Smells like a trash can... not even joking.. My dad got me this for christmas last year and I haven&#x27;t touched it, it&#x27;s just gross.</li>
    <li> This product really smell great and the scent last all day. Really great price for the amount on ounce that it has.</li>
    <li> Great price on time delivery</li>
    <li> It was a lot cheaper than the store, but didn&#x27;t come with a lid and seemed a little less potent than store-bought.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my husband. First he was soooo against any other smell than his Drakkar. But after he tried it on,this perfume became his favorit!!!! Hi wears now only this one and almost forgot about his favorit in past:):). This perfume is sooo sexy, masculin and rich! Go for it and you will not regret.</li>
    <li> Great Smelling Perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have paid as much as $29.43 for it.I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve worn for years and I use to only find it in upper scale department stores for a hefty price. I&#x27;m glad Amazon.com is selling it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
    <li> Item arrived sooner as expected on great condition.&lt;br /&gt;Love it will repeat business</li>
    <li> The scent is too sweet you even describe it as for a woman not a man . I was hoping for a more masculine scent but this is really like a female perfume .</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my Step-son&#x27;s step-son for Christmas.  I know he&#x27;ll be glad to have it!  It&#x27;s a full-size bottle of cologne and it was VERY reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Do I really need to write a review. It&#x27;s called man for a reason. Women love, everyone loves it but never tell a soul what it is called</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my dad and I expected it to receive it in a week but to my surprise I received it on the second day. That was the best part about this purchase for me.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t buy this product, in this size, in any store, for this price. Makes a wonderful gift. Love it!</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne EVER. I go crazy when my boyfriend wears this stuff! When he ran out I had to get him more immediately.</li>
    <li> It has a very common/average fragrance, similar to other &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; colognes.</li>
    <li> This is another superb fragrance in the Calvin Klein line!  Their colognes, I have found, tend to be on the citrusy side, often fresh, but perhaps somewhat informal - and there is no change here.  This is a beautiful, howbeit rather light, but very pleasant cologne, with a faint, lingering orange odour that is unique.  Doesn&#x27;t last long, no, but this may even be part of it&#x27;s charm.  I like it!  Something to wear on the beach or for a night&#x27;s out on the town.</li>
    <li> Its big, but I&#x27;m not satisfied about the smell.</li>
    <li> This was a great price on great cologne. Nothing more to add. The package came undamaged and fast. Thanks and Merry Christmas.</li>
    <li> Excellent item i recommend to buy to this 100%, is very helpfull for the work and home business administration. BUY IT</li>
    <li> When they use MAN as they name it, they hit the target. Cologne is REALLY Manly. Not too strong of a scent, just enough for both gender to enjoy it. Fairly priced and the container is classy.</li>
    <li> I love the way anything from Calvin Klein smells. The smell last a long time and any woman would love to smell her Man wearing this cologne.</li>
    <li> it lasts all day long this was gift for husband  and he loves it.i  recomend it is parfume for real man</li>
    <li> I gifted this to my father in India because he and I have used this fragrance before. He is completely disappointed with this order this time. He said that it is more like water in the bottle. I definitely doubt how genuine this product is or whether I got a fake copy which is very common through many vendors.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 23 year old son and he really liked it, so I bought it for my fianc&amp;eacute; who is 59. He also really liked it . Calvin  Klein Man is a nice sized bottle and a really good price too. It appeals to both the young and mature. If your looking for a gift for your son/ brother/ husband etc then this is the one to buy. In my opinion you cant go wrong... ps I must admit that when ive run out of perfume, ive had a cheeky little spray myself.. : )</li>
    <li> Unlike the CKone, this Calvin Klein Man, is not for teenagers.  For the man who wants a confident and sexy scent, this one does it&lt;br /&gt;and does it subtle.  I have got complements from women, guys, co workers, so be forewarned, its going to be a hit.</li>
    <li> i got this perfume for my brother birthday and he loved it, it smells really cool and fresh. Ck is the best</li>
    <li> This cologne does not smell like the real&lt;br /&gt; Calvin Klein  but it&#x27;s ok but good price for it  lol I think I&#x27;ll just go to Calvin Klein&#x27;s website next time buy it</li>
    <li> Love it...my boyfriend is enjoying it and I&#x27;m the most too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> light fragrance, but it has a many air to it. doesn&#x27;t last long, but will get you through long enough for a short event/date.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling colognes on the market today.. My husband and son love it. I do to.. The smell stays for along time.</li>
    <li> Great scent, good price.</li>
    <li> I always buy calvin Kliein products and get complements.&lt;br /&gt;This is some nasty stuff il never buy this again,&lt;br /&gt;get euphoria!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this cologne in a department store and really liked it.  My wife tells me that it smells great; that is what matters.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I payed triple at kohls and the bottle was smaller</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s doesnt long last</li>
    <li> I love this fragance. Last longer</li>
    <li> es 100% seguro y una gran alternativa para las compras on line ademas de mostrar una gran variedad de productos</li>
    <li> I love it! It is very nice perfume. Every one should get it...I will recommend to all MAN. Thanks. Awesome Product</li>
    <li> The chicks dig it man. This is a woman getter. I got so much sex from wearing this stuff I had to stop wearing it because I had to get some sleep at some point. i mean enough is enough ladies. Geesh. So yeah it works and it smells....does what is supposed to. Smell good. You&#x27;ll have to take a shower every once in a while though. MAN can only do so much.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with CK!</li>
    <li> me parece que el producto es muy bueno llego a tiempo y cumple con mis expectativas y hay responsabilidad lo recomiendo</li>
