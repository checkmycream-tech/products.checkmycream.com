      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>i only go there for the awesome body products.  </li>
      <li>Love this type of patcholie mix.  </li>
      <li>I bought a bottle of this years ago and I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I have more people compliment me on the scent and ask what it is.</li>
      <li>Even people that dont like patchouli will love this.  </li>
      <li>It lasts forever and isnt overpowering like most patchouli.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this Patchoulli and am never without it.</li>
      <li>This is the same wonderful sweet and warm Tunisian Patchouli</li>
      <li>As usual, Amazon was a great deal with great service from the seller.</li>
      <li>Fragrance oils are the best thing for someone a little more chemically conscious.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The roll on ball makes it easy, with not accidental messes.  </li>
      <li>Not too strong.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this - its earthy, sweet scent</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth a try if u love patchouli or have been wondering about it.  </li>
      <li>I get compliments on this oil because it reminds people of the fabulous 60s and 70s.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the smell</li>
      <li>This oil was used in the Original Woodstock Days because hippies were wearing it everywhere.  </li>
      <li>is long-lasting and clean.  </li>
      <li>kuumba made oils are quite concentrated, last most of the day, &amp; can be amazing if u don&#x27;t bathe in them.  </li>
      <li>Sweet and earthy.</li>
      <li>I have yet to find a good patchouli mixed with something else that was not overwhelmed by the patchouli</li>
      <li>I would have to guess that it lasts &lt; 3 hours after application whereas other Kuumba Made oils have lasted well into the next day for me.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s an interesting &amp; unique scent, but essential oils are waaay to strong to just be worn [ie proper dilution needed].  </li>
      <li>The only place I have been able to find the Tunisian Patchouli is in Asheville NC at Earth Fare.  </li>
      <li>I get compliments daily:)</li>
      <li>It smells really good when I roll it on, but after just a few hours, it&#x27;s like it wasn&#x27;t there at all</li>
      <li>It definitely seems more feminine than most other patchoulis and is nice to layer with other &#x27;too sweet&#x27; smelling fragrances.  </li>
      <li>It mixes well with the other Kuumba oils, like amber resin and rose.</li>
      <li>The handy roller ball bottle prevents waste and over use!</li>
      <li>Classic patchouli scent, lasts all day.</li>
      <li>The smell is earthy, calm and a little sweet on me and musky and earthy on my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I always liked the smell and had hard time finding it.  </li>
      <li>have bought 4 other fragrances from this company and have been 100% satisfied with the quality, smell and overall product.</li>
      <li>you will be surprised.</li>
      <li>This product captures the natural fragrances of the earth.</li>
      <li>i was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>that surprised the hell outta me.  </li>
      <li>my sister, who is an avid hater of anything that even has patchouli as a minor note, even asked &#x27;oooooo!</li>
      <li>I usually mix equal parts of this oil with a french rose oil</li>
      <li>A bit more earthy than the mellow scent that I have purchased from others in the past but, very blendable with other scents.  </li>
      <li>This smells more like weak perfume.</li>
      <li>This is one of the nicest patchouli scents, not too strong or harsh like other products.</li>

<li> This smells more like weak perfume.</li>
<li> This is one of the nicest patchouli scents, not too strong or harsh like other products.</li>
<li> Although this fragrance has a sweet and a little unpleasant powdery beginning almost like a floral baby powder that seems to weave together with the subtle scent of patchouli that slowly becomes more prominent, but always remains joined to that powdery floral scent</li>
<li> Now have to guy a new bottle and will buy it for a few friends.</li>
<li> the initial roll on is a bit heavy, but tones down in a bit &amp; the dry down is kinda sweet, a little soil-like, and soft.  </li>
<li> The scent lasts a long time and does not change at all as it wears.  </li>
<li> Based on this purchase I will definitely try other Kuumba oils.  </li>
<li> I wanted a larger  bottle since I want to use some of it for making lotions and soaps as well as wearing it straight, but the brand I was using was way too expensive for a larger bottle.  </li>
<li> would probably not buy this again as it does nothing to really stand out for me and unfortunately does not last long.  </li>
<li> Careful.</li>
<li> but it seems to be spicier than my other patchouli oils.</li>
<li> This vial is small but will last quite awhile.</li>
<li> I tried this Kuumba oil based on the other reviews and I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else now.  </li>
<li> I would like to give this stuff less than one star.</li>
<li> I had high hopes with this product after reading the reviews; but sadly to say I could not detect any scent of Patchouli.</li>
<li> when patchouli is properly diluted &amp; mixed w/ other oils u can made a divine scent w/o that &#x27;dirty hippie&#x27; stereotype.  </li>
<li> not sure if this is the case</li>
<li> Not happy</li>
<li> The smell is horrible, I will never purchase again.</li>

    <li> i&#x27;ve been purchasing kuumba made oils at a local organic market.  i only go there for the awesome body products.  i&#x27;ve always liked the &#x27;concept&#x27; of patchouli.  it&#x27;s an interesting &amp; unique scent, but essential oils are waaay to strong to just be worn [ie proper dilution needed].  when patchouli is properly diluted &amp; mixed w/ other oils u can made a divine scent w/o that &#x27;dirty hippie&#x27; stereotype.  i read a ton of reviews on kuumba made&#x27;s tunisian patchouli before buying for fear of it not smelling good to me, it being too strong, or headache inducing.  kuumba made oils are quite concentrated, last most of the day, &amp; can be amazing if u don&#x27;t bathe in them.  this patchouli is a &#x27;patchouli hater&#x27;s&#x27; patchouli.  i was pleasantly surprised.  the initial roll on is a bit heavy, but tones down in a bit &amp; the dry down is kinda sweet, a little soil-like, and soft.  my sister, who is an avid hater of anything that even has patchouli as a minor note, even asked &#x27;oooooo! what smells good?&#x27;  that surprised the hell outta me.  even got a number of compliments when wearing it.  it&#x27;s worth a try if u love patchouli or have been wondering about it.  also check out makeupalley.com for more reviews.  they&#x27;re reviews helped my decision.</li>
    <li> Amazing smelling oil. Love to combine the the Amber &amp; Sandalwood! Not an overpowering patchouli.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this - its earthy, sweet scent is long-lasting and clean.  I will buy this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes with this product after reading the reviews; but sadly to say I could not detect any scent of Patchouli. This smells more like weak perfume. Not happy and I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I would like to give this stuff less than one star. The smell is horrible, I will never purchase again. Gross!</li>
    <li> Love this type of patcholie mix.  Not too strong.  Wear it daily</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Patchoulli and am never without it. I get compliments daily:) Thank you for making it affordable to me!</li>
    <li> I like it but it seems to be spicier than my other patchouli oils.</li>
    <li> This smells delish!  It lasts forever and isnt overpowering like most patchouli.  Even people that dont like patchouli will love this.  It also seems to have some kind of attractant for men...not sure if this is the case but it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Very handy to have in your purse. The roll on ball makes it easy, with not accidental messes.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Tunisian Patchouli for many years.  I was purchasing another brand but was paying about $10 for a dram bottle.  I wanted a larger  bottle since I want to use some of it for making lotions and soaps as well as wearing it straight, but the brand I was using was way too expensive for a larger bottle.  I tried this Kuumba oil based on the other reviews and I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else now.  This is the same wonderful sweet and warm Tunisian Patchouli I&#x27;m used to, you get a lot of product for the money, and it&#x27;s a quality oil.  The scent lasts a long time and does not change at all as it wears.  I usually mix equal parts of this oil with a french rose oil and I get told I smell good quite often.  Based on this purchase I will definitely try other Kuumba oils.  As usual, Amazon was a great deal with great service from the seller.</li>
    <li> It smells really good when I roll it on, but after just a few hours, it&#x27;s like it wasn&#x27;t there at all</li>
    <li> Smells great! It&#x27;s a very light version of patchouli without losing the patchouli scent. Just wish it lasted all day</li>
    <li> ive tried several different patch oils. this one is my fav. i recommend you try it out. you will be surprised.</li>
    <li> Careful. It&#x27;s strong. I have yet to find a good patchouli mixed with something else that was not overwhelmed by the patchouli</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this years ago and I absolutely love it.  Now have to guy a new bottle and will buy it for a few friends. I found using the roll on makes it too strong, so I just dab it on and it lasts all day!  I have more people compliment me on the scent and ask what it is.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I enjoy smelling good but I do not like using chemical perfumes. Fragrance oils are the best thing for someone a little more chemically conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for both myself and my husband. The smell is completely different on both of us once it mixes with our body chemistry. The smell is earthy, calm and a little sweet on me and musky and earthy on my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought 4 other fragrances from this company and have been 100% satisfied with the quality, smell and overall product.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this oil because it reminds people of the fabulous 60s and 70s. This oil was used in the Original Woodstock Days because hippies were wearing it everywhere.  I always liked the smell and had hard time finding it.  They used to sell it in much larger vials though. This vial is small but will last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> Sweet and earthy. After wearing it, it takes some time to settle on your body. I enjoy the smell and I love it!</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest patchouli scents, not too strong or harsh like other products. It mixes well with the other Kuumba oils, like amber resin and rose.</li>
    <li> The only place I have been able to find the Tunisian Patchouli is in Asheville NC at Earth Fare.  Since I have not been traveling there since my mom passed away, I searched on Amazon and have to say this is every bit as good as the one from Earth Fare.</li>

I would have to guess that it lasts &lt; 3 hours after application whereas other Kuumba Made oils have lasted well into the next day for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell.  Good quality and company</li>
    <li> This product captures the natural fragrances of the earth. The bottle is labeled beautifully. I will never buy another brand of Patchouli again!</li>
    <li> The products from KUUMBA are out of this world</li>
    <li> Love it. Nice smell and it lasted all day!! I may be beat at the end of the day but the scent stayed!!</li>
