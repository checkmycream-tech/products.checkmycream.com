<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product works ok, but the smell is tough to get over. It is a little greasy if you have fine or thin hair. The smell isn&#x27;t awful, but it doesn&#x27;t go away and everytime you sweat you&#x27;ll smell it!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair but it is thin.  This masque is light and leaves my hair manageable and shiny, and does not weigh it down at all.</li>
    <li> I love the entire Agadir line. It is great for people like me who need some extra smoothness to their hair. My hair is on the courser side and curly. Living in a high humidity climate does not help with frizz or fly-aways. I use this product once a week to help deeply condition my hair and help keep it smooth and silky. What I have found works for me is after shampooing, smoothing this product into my hair, then comb it through. Often I will put on a shower cap and let it sit for 15 minutes. This helps lock the moisture in. Rinse with a warm shower. The results are immediate and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Definitely the best hair mask I have ever tried. Could feel my hair softer and shinier.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing you will feel the difference in your hair.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t really tried it so much but I&#x27;m definitely going to use it in the future and make a better view of it</li>
    <li> Seriously amazing product! I use every product they make. The smell is absolutely amazing! Other people say it&#x27;s too strong, but it fades after hair is dry. Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It really showed me my curl pattern after I deep conditioned my hair. It didn&#x27;t feel super soft though so I added my intense moisturizer (Joico) especially because our hair could always use moisture. I looked forward to seeing how it penetrates the next time I use it.</li>
    <li> I use this at least twice a week because it makes my hair so much softer and it smells wonderful!  After towel drying, I use the oil on my hair and can skip blow drying altogether !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say but this product was too old...it is very thick that you can not just get a little out of the jar...it is clumped so much...I will probably end up throwing it out rather than to take the time nd money to send it back..I can&#x27;t use it...the other product i ordered was the spray and it is awesome...thank you.</li>
    <li> Just an ok mask, it won&#x27;t make your hair more straight or anything</li>
    <li> Been using this for 5 years and I love the smell and what it does to my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is whipped like fluffy butter. It regenerates you hair and leaves it silky soft while repairing the shaft of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use it and leave it on all night wrapped in a shin tight bonnet. Sometimes throw a  cotton wrap in the micro wave and heat it up, wrap it around my head apply the tight cap for an hour or two, rinse and wala silky smooth hair. Excellent hair repair product. Use the full container and see the difference for yourself. I love it!</li>
    <li> Its just ok, smell great. not much difference in my hair. i think this item is over price. don&#x27;t have to try again</li>
    <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now for my bleached hair.  Due to the nature of my job, my hair was exposed to some harsh chemical fumes and started breaking badly.  After my stylist and I tried about everything, I decided to try the masque to my Agadir Oil I loved so much. I noticed that the hair breakage seemed to start slowing down.  By the second week, I went from gobs of hair breaking off to no hair in my comb!  This was the results we had tried so many products over the past month and a half to achieve.  This product is saving my hair.  It&#x27;s kind of thick and gooey feeling but if you can get over that definitely use it. My hair seemed to soak it up the first use.</li>
    <li> my hair is very kinky - very hard to brush out knots etc but found this product made my hair easier to brush and style .</li>
    <li> Hair mask works really well! Not heavy on my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with my first impressions... The texture is definitely funky and the smell is strong (and not the most appealing) in my opinion.  For me, the scent stayed well into the next day, even after flat ironing and using other products.  Oh, also, there is a picture of this exotic-looking model on the lid of the jar.  It sounds weird, but I found it a little off-putting have her in my shower every day. Maybe she would be a bonus for some users or members of their household, but she didn&#x27;t do anything for me :) Anyway, back to the actual product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my first use, I think I didn&#x27;t use enough, since it seemed to do absolutely nothing (except leave its scent behind). After that, I used a bit more and that seemed to help.  I got used to the smell to the point where I barely noticed it, and the texture became a non-issue for me.  I followed the directions, and kept the product on for a good 5+ minutes before rinsing.  My hair felt super-silky and smooth when I rinsed it out.  However, once my hair was dry, I noticed no benefit at all.  My hair was not any softer, no less dry, and did not look smoother or less damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited until I finished the jar before writing my review - the directions say it takes several uses to work, so I wanted to give it time to do its thing.  Unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different though (mine is long, medium-thickness, wavy/frizzy, color treated, and damaged from frequent heat/styling).  The quirks of this product should not be enough to keep you from trying it, but don&#x27;t expect a sure-fire cure.</li>
    <li> My hair has never seemed healthier or fuller. This product seems to help my hair hold a curl better. My hair looks and feels clean longer.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this mask as I recently colored my hair and it was recommended as safe for color-treated hair. NOT TRUE. I used it the first time and was not impressed with the results; my hair looked dull and frizzy. I thought maybe it was a fluke because we&#x27;ve had a run of bad weather here in the South, and that the wind and humidity was at fault. So I used it a second time 5 days later. Results were the same, only worse. After the third time I was thinking What the...? My hair was very dry, dull, frizzy and unmanageable. I looked on the label and saw that it contains keratin protein. That explains the bad results. I am not sure why keratin needs to be in any hair product; hair is made of keratin already so isn&#x27;t that overkill?!?! My hairdresser warned me away from protein hair masks several years ago because she said they will dry out your hair with overuse. I didn&#x27;t even overuse this product and it still dried out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To boot, there is barely a hint of the wonderful fragrance of Agadir&#x27;s shampoo &amp; conditioner in this. I am not sure if that is normal as I purchased it here and not in a salon or drugstore so have nothing with which I can make a comparison. I can mostly smell the plastic of the container. I do use and like the shampoo &amp; conditioner which are keratin-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been getting ready to blame my hairdresser for putting bad color on my hair or for leaving the color on too long because my hair had gotten to be such a mess! I was in CVS yesterday looking at makeup and such and as usual wandered over to the hair products aisle. There I saw a very small spray bottle of It&#x27;s a 10 Leave-in Conditioner. I bought it because it stated on the label that it&#x27;s good for colored hair (but so did the Agadir!). I washed and conditioned with Agadir today (not the mask though) then sprayed my hair pretty heavily with It&#x27;s a 10. I didn&#x27;t dare hope for much but was SO pleasantly surprised to see that my hair was once again easy to comb and after drying was smooth and soft and manageable. So, if your hair got messed up by this mask, I highly recommend the It&#x27;s a 10 spray-on conditioner. There are 2 types - one has keratin and obviously I advise staying away from that one. Just get the regular one, it has restored my fine, medium-length hair to its former healthy condition.d after drying was smooth and soft and manageable.

    <li> I ordered this product because of its many positive reviews, it was a total mistake. I&#x27;ve been using it along with the shampoo and conditioner from the same brand and it did nothing amazing for me other than causing me a serious case of dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had before and killing my natural curls completely. To clarify, I have not used any other product for the last two months, only this until now that I noticed the horrible results and gave up.on it. The only positive thing I can say is that it does makes your hair soft but at what price!</li>
    <li> I highly recomend this product. I was introduced to the moisture masque at my hair salon, where they call me and my daughters the hair bear bunch. All three of us have long curly hair that is healthy but dry. They used it on me that first time for free. Then after my hair was done they told me what they were planning on charging for a treatment. I asked what it was and they showed me the product. I took a picture and sent it to one of my daughters. She found it online at a terrific price. That was 4 tubs ago. I order in sets of two, because I know one of my daughters will run out and need some.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy feeling or looking. You don&#x27;t have to use alot of it so it lasts a long time. I love it and have got several of my friends using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent. It does restor hair look and consistency. Makes my hair more manageable. Manufacturer&#x27;s instructions are clear and easy to follow</li>
    <li> Timely and good price.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything. Smells funny. Overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy again . Sorry I got it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like it . Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and smells great! I would definitely recommend this product. It leaves my very naturally curly hair soft and more manageable. But if you have dry, naturally curly hair like mine, I would recommend that you also use an Argan oil after this product and before styling.</li>
    <li> I like to use this item. I like to give friends this item for the present. It helps my hair to tomoisturize.</li>
    <li> I love the product, I think it is helping! The only thing is it makes my hair feel kinda weird.. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it.</li>
    <li> Makes hair very soft and manageable. The smell is nice and not overpowering. I am a huge fan of the spray by this company so this was another great find. Love it!</li>
    <li> The only &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; I can use on my hair to make it soft, silky, and free of tangles! I love the texture of this stuff, I cannot go without it.</li>
    <li> With half  price compare to the drug store or supermarket, I will buy it again. Good masque. I just wish the scent is a bitt like floral.  Other than that it is good.</li>
    <li> This is great for breakage . It really make my hair look healthier and feel stronger. I also recommend their other products.</li>
    <li> This product moisturizes so well, my husband even likes it! I have very, very dry hair, and using this once a week has made a huge difference in how soft my hair has become.</li>
    <li> All Agadir products are superior and work great. I love how my hair feels after I use this mask, great product!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very thick and moisturizing and it smells great!</li>
    <li> The entire Agadir line is amazing for color-treated hair.  I love it!!!!  I am used to using Shu Uemura, Kerastase and other big buck products but find this line of deep conditioners, shampoo, daily conditioner, hair spray to be superior.  Get in a XL size and you will save a ton on haircare products WHILE maintaining your color.  THE BEST!</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair feel amazing and helps to keep it from tangling all day. I just use it a couple times a week instead of my usual conditioner. (Leave it on for ~5 min.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I heard it is good for African American hair that has heat damage. It worked okay, but I have a few hair mask that are a little cheaper and price and work just as good as this one. I have only used once, so I may try again soon, but not really sure.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Agadir Moisture Masque that has transformed my aging hair from fly-away into manageable, silky and shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months and love the results on my dry damaged hair. I use the rest of the product line as well</li>
    <li> After one use I know I will love this. I have color treated 4a natural texture hair. It can get dry. After deep conditioning and wrapping my hair in a tshirt to dry excess water my hair was soft to touch. It was amazing. Nothing I have found has caused my hair to ever react like this. It says to use bi weekly until traces of damage are no longer there. For me it will be once I find the perfect moisture balance like it was before coloring. I am very impressed and will keep forward with it.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I am looking forward to by more of it.</li>
    <li> A jar of goo that doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is super thick and hard to wash out of your hair. It does seem to add moisture but in a couple of days the effect wears off.</li>
    <li> After reading a couple of other reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give a couple of things that I do that make me really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You will not notice results after one use. Your hair will be silky and tangle-free the first time, but you won&#x27;t see the healing. Use it a couple of times a week for several weeks before giving up on it.&lt;br /&gt;2. I wash my hair and then squeeze out the extra water. I apply the masque and then get out of the shower. I let this stuff sit in my hair for a while (up to an hour) while I putter around the bathroom (cleaning the tub, wiping counters, shaving legs, etc.) Sometimes I even wrap my hair in Saran Wrap while I let it sit. This really does seem to make this work even better.&lt;br /&gt;3. This masque has a strange, gelatinous texture. To work it through the hair, first get a scoop of it in your fingers. Rub it well in the palms of your hands to warm it up and make it more pliable. Then rub it into your hair. I use a big comb to work it all the way through my hair. I put a little extra onto the ends.&lt;br /&gt;4. After letting it sit on your hair for a while, rinse it out and finish with a cold rinse. I haven&#x27;t noticed any trouble rinsing it out - it just slips off the hair and leaves your hair very silky.&lt;br /&gt;5. Follow up with the Agadir spray product after you towel-dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been highlighting my brunette hair for over a decade and it was beginning to look very damaged and \\&quot;bleached\\&quot;. This masque and the spray have made it look much healthier. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look greasy like other similar products I&#x27;ve used in the past. My hair is now very soft to the touch and looks less frizzy. I&#x27;m very happy with it and will continue purchasing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change about this is the odor. It smells a bit like suntan lotion with a faint coconut odor and perfume. I&#x27;m not a fan of the coconut smell no matter how faint it may be. The good thing is that the smell goes away after I blow-dry and flat-iron my hair.y after I blow-dry and flat-iron my hair.</li>
    <li> Once you get past the consistency of this product and give it a little time, you will see pretty amazing results.  Everytime I wash my hair I use this together with the oil.  I used to wear a hat in public every chance I could because of what autoimmune disease has done to my hair over the past five years, and now I don&#x27;t worry about the hat anymore.  I don&#x27;t think my hair will ever be 100% of what it was, but it is certainly much better with this product.  I am on my second jar!</li>
    <li> I had used other products with argan oil but didnt have the same result, and this one was recommended by my hairdresser, is hard to find at the store, they usually sell only to professionals, so Im glad I found it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I&#x27;ve been doing the treatment weekly and my hair is becoming more and more manageable</li>
    <li> I really like this product but the shampoo smells better. They could have perfume this a little bit more. It does moisturize my hair very well</li>
    <li> I got this product and fell in love with it!! it is amazing!!!! I color treat my hair often-and when I get ready to color treat my hair I put this mask on my hair for about 30 minutes before doing a color treatment--It is thick but not greasy--There aren&#x27;t enough words to say how wonderful this product it!!!</li>
    <li> Usually the ingredients are listed according to the concentration present starting with the highest concentration. Masque claimed to be Argan Oil treat has this oil listed at the very last position among ingredients. Masque has very thick consistence which is hard to distribute evenly through the hair. Smell is pretty nice. To rinse the masque completely is  impossible. IMHO, this product is waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this, make my hair shiny and smooth, the only down fall is the s,ell that lingers for couple of day but yet again I have heard no complaint about it form my hubby</li>
    <li> Mask is great but the packaging was damaged. When i opened it the white cover was pushed inside. Seems like none was missing, but still I was expecting new sealed product.</li>
    <li> I like this, it leaves the hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Tames dry, frizzy hair.  Great for humid weather.  I use it as a leave-in on wet hair after I wash and condition, and then blow dry.  Works great!</li>
    <li> My hair came to alive again after I used thi so muchs one 😍 I love my hair right now</li>
    <li> This stuff does nothing for my hair, it&#x27;s just a thick goopy mess that seems to cause tangles.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This Agadir Argan Oil Moisture Masque is an awesome product! The Argan Oil must be the secret for soft shiny and healthy looking hair. The fragrance is like non other and I love it! I don&#x27;t need to wear any perfume with these products because their fragrance is awesome by itself!</li>
    <li> The product is extremely gooey. So much so that it makes it difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> The Masque leaves my severely damaged hair feeling smooth and silky. I use it every other day (that&#x27;s how bad my hair is). I totally  recommend this product for people with all types of hair. My sister, who has never colored or chemically treated her hair, uses it once a week and it helps her hair keep it&#x27;s natural shine.</li>
    <li> great! I would recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I had problems with my scalp being dry and flaky and using Agadir shampoo, conditioner, and oil treatment changed that and I wanted to continue making my hair healthier by using the moisture masque. I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is fantastic. Great for any hair type and works the first time! It&#x27;s worth the money! I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Loves the way it makes the hair feels. The hair is really soft and shiny after it dries and I only leave it on for about 2 mins.</li>
    <li> I used it on my daughters hair and it made it softer than it already was. Also, the drying time for her hair does take less time.</li>
    <li> Ok I got this stuff for me and I love it... It&#x27;s amazing... Really repairs. Then one day I was giving my dog a bath and forgot to bring his conditioner in the bathroom... So I thought what the heck I&#x27;ll use this. He&#x27;s a yellow lab. So afterwards his coat was amazing! People stop me to admire how soft he is. He also smells amazing for a week at least. I know its weird to use a more pricey conditioner on a dog, but I&#x27;m telling you it will completely revitalize your dogs coat. Everyone wants to know what I use on my dog now. Good for people and good for dogs!</li>
    <li> I love argan oil product and this is a great mask to use on your hair when its feeling a little dry. just leave it in for about ten fifteen min in the shower while you shave or was your body or whatever rinse out and your hair is silky smooth</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter in law and she said that the first time she used it she actually saw a difference</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner for a little extra moisture after I&#x27;ve been in the pool or ocean and it works wonderfully.  It&#x27; super thick, like, when you turn it upside-down, it doesn&#x27;t move! No complaints.</li>
    <li> I love the Agadir Argan Oil shampoo, conditioner, and oil treatment. I don&#x27;t notice any benefits from using the masque.</li>
    <li> I use all the Agadir hair products and everytime I try a new one I love them even more.  My hair gets very dry from styling and it feels great now.  I just use it while showering, and I love the scent of all the haircare products!!</li>
    <li> Using this product on my double processed hair keeps color intact and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my dull and burned out hair beautiful and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite hair product ever. I got a sample with a purchase a long time ago and after using it, I decided to buy the full product. I use it about once a week right now and it makes my hair so soft! I love the way my hair feels after using it, and it will last for a while. Also, my hair dries much faster and smoother after using. I have wavy hair that is pretty frizzy, and when I use this it dries looking good without even blow drying. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who uses heat products on their hair or colors their hair, it feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Started using this product through my hairdresser...love how it feels...how it smells...my hair feels great...I have recommended it to others</li>
    <li> I really like this deep/dense conditioner.It has giving my hair lots of moisture. I have thick, med length, curly hair and my curls look lush and well defined after i use it. Helps with my Atlanta weather frizz.I also like the feel of my hair when i blow dry/flat iron it too. I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, smooth transaction. I would purchase again and would recommend. Also the item was just as described online.</li>
    <li> I liked what it does for my dry hair. It made it soft, but not as soft as the regular Agadir conditioner does. I will continue to use the mask, but prefer the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend bcz I loved it</li>
    <li> love this product great for hair</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizes masque I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> After surgery and a stay in the hospital my hair changed. I can&#x27;t really explain what the change was other than lifeless. Just not my hair. My stylist used this and suggested I continue to use at home. It has worked for me. My healthy hair is now better than normal. Warning, a little goes a long way. It will make your hair soft.</li>
    <li> Agadir Moisture Masque is a great product for all type of hair and specially for dry brittle hair - - this product is very thick, yet easy to spread on the hair. Not much is needed in one application, an 8 ounce jar  last through  more shampoos than  most conditioners  That makes Agadir Moisture Masque  a great saving  on hair moisturizer or conditioner...  I just love it.</li>
    <li> Great mild smell, moisturizing, but hard to work through the hair. I often found myself having to add a little bit of water to work it through my daughter&#x27;s hair. I might buy it again, but I like the Mixed Chicks deep conditioner a little better.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have colored hair and it makes it so soft and smooth. Can&#x27;t do without it. Will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> There really is no need for this product.  Between the shampoo, conditioner, hairspray, hot oil, and everything else we can use, this product was a waste of money.  It works, but it rarely gets used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick with a strong fragrance. It helped me hair a bit, but nothing miraculous about it.</li>
    <li> I always buy this product. It works for my hair.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer for dry hair</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because my hair loves this stuff 😊 and the price is VERY competitive!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the argan, or the keratin protein, or a combination of the 2, or if it&#x27;s also the way that Agadir formulates this product. But one thing I do know is that it works. Your hair will become more manageable, and perhaps even better looking. And I was in need of repair treatment in which this product along with their shampoo &amp; conditioner did the trick.</li>
    <li> Even though it leaves your hair soft, it is very hard to put it evenly on it. Hard to take it off, you need to rinse a lot to make sure all is out. Hair gets oily faster since I use this product.</li>
    <li> This is the very first Agadir product I purchased. After using this once I immediately went out and bought the shampoo, conditioner and oil spray treatment. This will put the life back in your hair. It stops breakage and helps prevent split-ends. It does cut drying time in half and also helps keep your hair detangled for about 48 hours after use.</li>
