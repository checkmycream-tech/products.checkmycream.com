      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the conditioner, doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well, but I will keep using the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Carols Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo is a good, and gentle,shampoo that helps maintain moisture and smells clean and not perfumey.</li>

      <li>My hair has experienced lots of growth thanks to the Black Vanilla line, and I will continue to purchase.</li>
      <li>Very gentle on the hair.</li>
      <li>but not only did it do a better job cleaning my hair</li>
      <li>I bought ths product because I wanted something sulfate free to wash my 13 month old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>I tried this product out and it dried my hair out ,smelled good</li>
      <li>I could feel my hair getting clean but even after two shampoos it was still more moist and not as squeaky as it is when I wash it with other shampoos.  </li>
      <li>The product lathers well and smells good but not sure that it did anything to help maintain the moisture in her hair.  </li>
      <li>I am Caucasian and wanted a sulfate free shampoo that moisturized, but didn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Which I personally like, but if scents bother you easily then this shampoo may not be for you.</li>
      <li>After use I noticed my hair is super soft and the ends don&#x27;t feel as damaged as it did before I washed it.</li>
      <li>also, it leaves my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>needed a change from the organix brand because my hair was falling out in large amounts.</li>
      <li>It is a little more watery than most shampoos, but I just used a regular amount.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I really wanted to like the shampoo</li>
      <li>Trust, you do not want to use too much because avocado is an oily butter.</li>
      <li>This helps and it has helped me retain moisture as much as my hair can.</li>
      <li>-iron my hair straight</li>
      <li>Used alone, it makes my hair oily no matter how much I rinse (clumps together in strings) as soon as it dries.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve checked the back label many times and its literally all plants and flowers and natural oils.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny, it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the new Chocolat line</li>
      <li>I only have to use a small amount to get great results.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them to everyone.....</li>
      <li>they work so fast after one use, you only use a little bit , the smell is awesome and no more tears trying to comb out after a bath</li>
      <li>I try to use completely natural products and this really is 100% natural.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fragile and dry out easily.</li>
      <li>My hair was far smoother and straighter than it ever is</li>
      <li>my 6 yr old  </li>
      <li>It was not as soft as I thought it would be afterward either.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft and moisturized this line of products.</li>
      <li>But it really feels just like regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have only used it once so far, but I have to say that I noticed a difference already!</li>
      <li>normal for long hair, i think).</li>
      <li>I am only about half way through the bottle right now</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the lather because using other natural shampoos I was expecting it to feel weird and not really lather.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable after washing no matter how tangled and dry it was before hand.</li>
      <li>And when I went to comb out and blow-dry my hair, I got less breakage and it was so much easier to comb it out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair feels so soft and moisturized this line of products. I have fragile, thin, so-called 4B/C hair that does not like SHEA butter or olive or COCONUT oil very much. I have been natural over 20 years and it has been very difficult for me to find the right products for my hair. I have been a product junkie for about four years and NOTHING seemed to work because natural hair products heavily use SHEA a basis. This product is light on shea (thank goodness).  Well, for the past several months I have used the following regimen: Aloe and water works well daily. Shampoo and deep condition with Carol Daughter&#x27;s \\&quot;Black Vanilla\\&quot; line once a week (co-washing dries my hair). Use a mix of grape seed and sweet almond oils. And, end with twisting the a bit (just a bit) of Avocado Butter. Trust, you do not want to use too much because avocado is an oily butter. Wear a satin scarf at night. So, in essence, I use the liquid, oil, and creme/butter (LOC or LOB) method. My hair is very fragile and dry out easily. This helps and it has helped me retain moisture as much as my hair can.</li>
    <li> needed a change from the organix brand because my hair was falling out in large amounts. the second i switched to this line (use shampoo and conditioner), my hair stopped falling out (except for a few hairs here and there. normal for long hair, i think). also, it leaves my hair super soft and shiny. the only thing it didnt do was get rid of frizz. PLUS, the scent is amazing. i smell it in my hair all day.</li>
    <li> I love Carols Daughter products for myself and for my daughters....the scent of these shampoos is the most wonderful experience....They shampoo wonderfully and leave my hair with volume and shine....I would highly recommend them to everyone.....</li>
    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughters products are amazing they work so fast after one use, you only use a little bit , the smell is awesome and no more tears trying to comb out after a bath my 6 yr old  loves getting her hair \\&quot;\\&quot;did\\&quot;\\&quot; she loves that she can comb thru after one use of these products THANK YOU CAROL</li>
    <li> The scent was so fantastically yummy but I was very disappointed with how my hair felt during and after the shampoo/conditioning process. It was not as soft as I thought it would be afterward either. I am only about half way through the bottle right now but I just do not enjoy the results and will not be purchasing this product again. I thought I would love this but sadly, I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair that&#x27;s past my shoulders.  I bought Black Vanilla Shampoo to alternate with the Chocolat Smoothing collection, because the Chocolat was a little drying.  I washed my hair with this, then followed with the smoothie and the leave-in conditioner.  I used some other Carol&#x27;s Daughter products to blow-dry and flat-iron my hair straight (Khoret Amen Oil and Macadamia Heat Protection Gloss).  I LOVE this shampoo.  It&#x27;s funny, it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the new Chocolat line but not only did it do a better job cleaning my hair, it also got my hair smoother and straighter!  I could feel my hair getting clean but even after two shampoos it was still more moist and not as squeaky as it is when I wash it with other shampoos.  And when I went to comb out and blow-dry my hair, I got less breakage and it was so much easier to comb it out.  My hair was far smoother and straighter than it ever is when I heat style it.  This shampoo is definitely going to be my go-to from now on.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell. I only have to use a small amount to get great results.</li>
    <li> I tried this product out and it dried my hair out ,smelled good but it wasn&#x27;t up to my expectations ,major fail</li>
    <li> I love carol&#x27;s products they leave my hair really soft and manageable. I will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughters&#x27; hair. They are 1 and 3. The smell is beautiful and the consistency is rich. The one problem is that it smarts the eyes if it gets in the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take care to avoid getting products in their eyes, but with toddlers it&#x27;s hard and so I look for products that don&#x27;t hurt. I thought this would be one of such products since a lot of mothers rave about it. Not to be.... When I used the product on myself and I got it in my eyes, it hurt for a good 3 minutes until I was able to completely flush it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo once about a year ago with my pops, he got it for me as a little gift and needless to say I&#x27;ve been in love ever since. I have thick, kinky 4c hair so if it can work miracles on my hair than I can only imagine what it does to others. It leaves my hair soft and manageable after washing no matter how tangled and dry it was before hand. I try to use completely natural products and this really is 100% natural. I&#x27;ve checked the back label many times and its literally all plants and flowers and natural oils. It&#x27;s not especially sudsy which may irk some people. Also a little goes a LONG way.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian and wanted a sulfate free shampoo that moisturized, but didn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair. This shampoo does the trick. I&#x27;m not crazy about the conditioner, doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well, but I will keep using the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo up over a year (just because I don&#x27;t want to throw it out), and every time I use it I have to wash my hair again with something else to get the oily film off my hair.  Used alone, it makes my hair oily no matter how much I rinse (clumps together in strings) as soon as it dries. My hair needs a lot of moisture, but this one is just too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice (and strong). It&#x27;s not too different from the Almond Cookie scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for sometime now, and I can&#x27;t imagine loving another product more. It smells great and get&#x27;s my hair and scalp clean. Very gentle on the hair. I have lots of body and it&#x27;s easy to manage. I only need to use it about once a week. My hair has experienced lots of growth thanks to the Black Vanilla line, and I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and I am very worried they will stop making it! Not all shampoos are for everyone, but this one is for me. Leaves my hair clean and soft (after one wash) and smells amazing. However, I do need to use this with the conditioner - if not then it is a little too cleansing. Meanwhile, I notice there is the same thing but with different packaging on this website, much less expensive. I hope that isn&#x27;t because this is being phased out because I just love it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my coarse hair soft, but my hair does feel clean and smells good.  A little goes a long way and so it lasts a long time.  I have to agree with one reviewer on this shampoo actually making my skin feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> I bought ths product because I wanted something sulfate free to wash my 13 month old daughter&#x27;s hair. The product lathers well and smells good but not sure that it did anything to help maintain the moisture in her hair.  It&#x27;s okay but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I have only used it once so far, but I have to say that I noticed a difference already! It smells great and the lather it rich. I&#x27;m really happy with the lather because using other natural shampoos I was expecting it to feel weird and not really lather. But it really feels just like regular shampoo. It is a little more watery than most shampoos, but I just used a regular amount. After use I noticed my hair is super soft and the ends don&#x27;t feel as damaged as it did before I washed it. The scent also lasts. Which I personally like, but if scents bother you easily then this shampoo may not be for you. Definitely would recommend though!</li>
    <li> It cleanses and lathers well but is surprisingly stripping to my 4a hair. I had to overnight dc to add moisture back. The conditioner is awesome though. Therefore, I really wanted to like the shampoo but I do not.</li>
    <li> Carols Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo is a good, and gentle,shampoo that helps maintain moisture and smells clean and not perfumey.</li>
    <li> I love love love this shampoo. This is the only shampoo that does not leave my hair tangled after washing it.</li>
