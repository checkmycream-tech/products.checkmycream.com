      <li>The color is perfectly bronzed and the spray applicator runs smooth and evenly.</li>
      <li>This is good for a &amp;#34;Quick Tan&amp;#34; but it does rub off on your clothing.</li>

      <li>and I start at the top of my shoulders holding the bag with both hands-</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t need to be perfect either, the next step takes care of that.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I really like it, will be buying more!!</li>
      <li>Have been buying for years and will continue, so much healthier than the sun!!!!</li>
      <li>Came quickly and nicely packed.</li>
      <li>This spray doesn&#x27;t come off so easily.</li>
      <li>Then I take a dime size of lotion and one pump of body oil, rub together, then spread lightly over one leg.  </li>

      <li>Well worth the price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>No streaking &amp; no weird orange colors.</li>
      <li>At certain retail stores; one can equals around $23.00...</li>
      <li>When spraying your back, I shoot alot on my shoulders, then I get a 30lb clean, unused garage bag</li>
      <li>And w this spray I can stay tanned and not afraid to wear white anymore.</li>
      <li>Is say it&#x27;s better just as a pick me up if you&#x27;re feeling pale and heading out.</li>
      <li>Looks natural.</li>
      <li>Go in the back yard pull up your shorts, spray your legs like spray paint, dry for a minute, and your ready to go!</li>
      <li>It gives such a pretty color and I like that you can rub it out evenly with some lotion after it&#x27;s dry!!</li>
      <li>If you see an uneven spot, use the oil/lotion combination to rub in a little more to even it out.  </li>

<li> like you do with a towel when you are drying your back- and shimmie back and forth and up and down</li>
<li> Another trick I use is after it sets up, 15 mins, I spray coconut oil over my legs and arm and rub it in only slightly.  </li>
<li> This also isn&#x27;t a heavy duty self tanner - it won&#x27;t last as long and washes off in the shower.</li>
<li> Just be careful to not spray it on anything it will stain.</li>
<li> Then I repeat the process for the other leg and arms.</li>
<li> Even ask me to write down the brand for them.  </li>
<li> my problem w previous sprays is that they would stain my outfits.</li>
<li> I use it all year round.</li>
<li> I thought that was really bad and disrespectful.</li>

    <li> Awesome product!!! Have been buying for years and will continue, so much healthier than the sun!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, anyone can use this. Go in the back yard pull up your shorts, spray your legs like spray paint, dry for a minute, and your ready to go! It is both an immediate bronzer and a self tanner. I&#x27;ve tried them all, this is the best.</li>
    <li> I received 6 of the quick tan in perfect conditions, but the seventh one was the TESTER!!! and it had a sticker that said tester, so I thought that was really bad and disrespectful.</li>
    <li> I really like it, will be buying more!! It gives such a pretty color and I like that you can rub it out evenly with some lotion after it&#x27;s dry!!</li>
    <li> I love it!  No orange to it at all.  I use it all year round.</li>
    <li> Always works great. Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Been using it for years.  It&#x27;s the most natural looking tan. Compliments all the time.  Not sticky or smelly</li>
    <li> fabulous product! thank you!! When spraying your back, I shoot alot on my shoulders, then I get a 30lb clean, unused garage bag and I start at the top of my shoulders holding the bag with both hands- like you do with a towel when you are drying your back- and shimmie back and forth and up and down and you will have a balanced tan on your back. You can do the same thing for the back of your legs too !!</li>
    <li> In a pinch this stuff gives you a great glow. It dries quick and is harder to mess up than other self tanners I&#x27;ve tried. This also isn&#x27;t a heavy duty self tanner - it won&#x27;t last as long and washes off in the shower. Is say it&#x27;s better just as a pick me up if you&#x27;re feeling pale and heading out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three years and I absolutely love it.  I get compliments ALL the time.  Strangers walk up to me and compliment my tan.  Even ask me to write down the brand for them.  My friends have been begging me to have a spray tan party so I am in April.  It&#x27;s very easy to work with and to get even.  I recommend spaying it while standing in a shower.  I spray on a layer on my legs and arms.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be perfect either, the next step takes care of that.  I wait 5-8 minutes to give it time to set up but not completely.  Then I take a dime size of lotion and one pump of body oil, rub together, then spread lightly over one leg.  Then I repeat the process for the other leg and arms. If you see an uneven spot, use the oil/lotion combination to rub in a little more to even it out.  Another trick I use is after it sets up, 15 mins, I spray coconut oil over my legs and arm and rub it in only slightly.  This gives your skin a mist, youthful glow.</li>
    <li> This spray doesn&#x27;t come off so easily. I&#x27;m happy w it. I&#x27;m a gogo dancer and I obviously sweat a lot and my problem w previous sprays is that they would stain my outfits. And w this spray I can stay tanned and not afraid to wear white anymore.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner. It gives a nice color without any orange. It has a bit of a red undertone. But goes away. Just be careful to not spray it on anything it will stain. Great product! Great color. Will buy again. Seller was awesome. Came quickly and nicely packed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent tanning spray!! I&#x27;ve used this product two years now.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!!! smells good and great color!! NOT ORANGE AT ALL!!!</li>
    <li> I own my own tanning business and recommend this to all my clients for in between spray tans or needing a spray tan last minute. The color is wonderful, easy to use, can doesn&#x27;t clog up and can get a really strong/dark color from it. I recommend this 100%.</li>
    <li> Works well for instant color</li>
    <li> Definetly a must have for any tanning addict out there! The color is perfectly bronzed and the spray applicator runs smooth and evenly. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price. At certain retail stores; one can equals around $23.00... Getting seven cans for only $60 is amazing!</li>
    <li> This is good for a &amp;#34;Quick Tan&amp;#34; but it does rub off on your clothing.</li>
    <li> I order this product quite often. I originally used it when I was in a wedding party &amp; the salon was charging approx $27 a bottle. When you buy the lot, it equals out to just under $10per bottle. Well worth the price &amp; it gives great color. No streaking &amp; no weird orange colors.</li>
    <li> Looks natural. Not orange or splotchy</li>
