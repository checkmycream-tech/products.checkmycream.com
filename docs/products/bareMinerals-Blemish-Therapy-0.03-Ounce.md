      <li>If you have breakouts, use this product it will help your blemishes heal very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not THAT strong.</li>

      <li>Super excited about how easy it was through Amazon!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not used to using a fine talc-like powder to treat my acne</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for a week, and I can already see a huge improvement to my skin.</li>
      <li>Bareminerals is a light and feels like nothing is there.</li>
      <li>I sound like an advertisement.</li>
      <li>This time I saw it was available on Amazon and decided to order it.</li>
      <li>I think this product would be great if you just got the occasional blemish but not for someone like me that has combination skin and gets them all the time.</li>
      <li>I would by fromthis vendor again for future products....very happy with iteam.</li>
      <li>, I have light break outs</li>
      <li>I was told they loved them and got them very quickly, well before the last date.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost positive my skin flared up even more from using this.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for healing blemishes quickly with a simple brush on of the rare minerals.  </li>
      <li>I have her on special vitamins that we do think are helping</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything to help keep it clear but this does a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>this is true.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t comment on that, but for my initial use, it seems to be a good product.</li>
      <li>It was very white and did not have good coverage.  </li>
      <li>I wish it was more &amp;#34;flesh&amp;#34; toned though so that it wouldn&#x27;t require so much blending.</li>
      <li>and I finally have her convinced to drink more water than most people because, it WILL flush toxins from your body that cause acne.  </li>
      <li>It covers blemishes well and works to get rid of them quickly.  </li>
      <li>I received this item very,very quickly.  </li>
      <li>My skin has become sensitive to some of the very strong products.  </li>
      <li>The brush that it comes with is great for other purposes though!</li>
      <li>I just started using Bare Minerals and love how light it is.</li>
      <li>This product helped to dry out my pimples fairly well</li>
      <li>The cost is worth not having to suffer with acne.</li>
      <li>They are a wonderful company and stand behind their products.</li>
      <li>even the deep cystic kind.</li>
      <li>They are a wonderful company and stand behind their products.</li>
      <li>I told her in her pre-teen years that if I  caught her wearing &amp;#34;junk on her face&amp;#34; she was going to be in HUGE trouble because women had gone through fad after fad to find makeup that was good for your skin as well as enhancing your face.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect your acne to go away overnight, but I feel confident saying that you should notice significant improvement after a week or so of religious and continued use.</li>
      <li>This stuff dries them right up.  </li>
      <li>This product takes care of them right</li>
      <li>The best thing, though, was that by mid afternoon I checked the inflammation and it went down.</li>
      <li>I really love Bare minerals products but was so dissappointed in the product.</li>
      <li>We both love Bare Minerals.  </li>
      <li>I love bare minerals</li>
      <li>Not sure if it worked that great.</li>
      <li>I love Bare Escentuals/bareMinerals products</li>
      <li>I am thinking that you don&#x27;t need very much to do the job.</li>
      <li>This stuff absolutely works!</li>
      <li>I would be ok with this if this was mentioned in larger print, like in the title.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many things for my acne and this is the first product that has actually worked.</li>
      <li>I bought the basic kit and the lady tried to sell this product to me at this time, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend more moeny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many concealers, but only this one has worked as well.  </li>
      <li>It works well as the first line of defense to break outs.</li>
      <li>It is actually one of my favorite items.</li>
      <li>Just be aware of the decrease in quantity.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell at all and I have an extremely sensitive nose. It goes on smooth and works to calm down breakouts. I wish it was more &amp;#34;flesh&amp;#34; toned though so that it wouldn&#x27;t require so much blending.</li>
    <li> My daughters have acne.  This stuff dries them right up.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased Bare Minerals Blemish Therapy in the hopes that it would help my mild small breakouts and help prevent them. One week after using this product I have broke  out into cystic acne which I haven&#x27;t had in over a year. The only thing that changed in my normal routine was the addition of this product. I swept in across my chin as the directions specify to help prevent breakouts and I now have severe breakouts there. Also this product states it is a treatment as well as a concealer. It does not conceal at all, it is completely translucent when applied. I really love Bare minerals products but was so dissappointed in the product. I wish I had never tried it.</li>
    <li> I love this brand so I have no problems with the product what so ever</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 3 months ago, and have since tossed out all other blemish treatments I had.&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention that I am allergic to benzoyl, so can&#x27;t use the majority of acne treatments out there when I break-out.  But this I tolerate perfectly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have major acne, just 1-3 (large) blemishes per month.  This product takes care of them right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t have a problem at all with the smell.  Maybe because I am spot-treating and using less?  I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product directly from the company before. It is actually one of my favorite items. This time I saw it was available on Amazon and decided to order it. Extremely disappointed. I&#x27;m not sure if the product was expired or what. There was an off smell to it and it did not work. I will not order this again on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a really small size it is a size of a quarter.  I am thinking that you don&#x27;t need very much to do the job.</li>
    <li> I always love this product. Now, not only myself use it quite often, but also the friends I introduced. But really prefer larger package of this product. What a pitty, the large package discontinued.</li>
    <li> At the age of 25 I try just about any face product that claims to clear your skin. I use bare minerals make up so decided to throw this in the mix. It may do some good but not enough to tell and certainly not enough for the price and smell. This product has a mild sulfa smell that&#x27;s not completely unbearable but for sure not ideal. I think this product would be great if you just got the occasional blemish but not for someone like me that has combination skin and gets them all the time.</li>
    <li> This product works great on the blemishes and redness that I encounter during my makeup routine. Not only does it conceal the redness, but I&#x27;ve also noticed that this product treats and minimizes my blemish occurances with continued usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very little product needs to be used for it to be effective, and the sulfur smell that many take issue with is very minor. This product is meant to be a spot treatment underneath your foundation, not as a sole concealer, etc.</li>
    <li> This did not work on blemishes and I was disappointed.  It was very white and did not have good coverage.  Did not speed healing.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! I know there has been a lot mentioned about the smell of sulfur... this is true. This is the main and active ingredient. If that smell will really bother you, this is not the product for you. However, I find the smell to dissipate almost as soon as I have finished getting ready to leave the house. I do not smell it all day at all. As for the effectiveness... I have to give Blemish Therapy an A+! It gets rids of blemishes without making a mess of your face and without being noticeable to anyone. The powder and the sulfur dry the blemishes and they are gone in two to three days. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had to use this product more than three days in a row. Now, bareMinerals does get a thumbs-down from me because they cut the product size in half! They did reduce the price accordingly, however, now I have to repurchase more often and that is inconvenient. I do not like the fact that it does not last as long. However, as I said, this does not affect the performance of the product. If you are a fan of the \\&quot;bare\\&quot; line... you should like this product as well. It meets all their other factors of manufacturing. I appreciate the more natural approach to healing a blemish than something more chemically harsh. They know what they&#x27;re doing and the product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! Just be aware of the decrease in quantity. However, I am still a fan of the \\&quot;bare\\&quot; line of products as they always produce quality products that do what they say they will do. So if you have occasional acne or blemishes... this product may very well work for you. If you have more serious acne you may want to consult a dermatologist before trying any product. Usually they are all the same, with different names and bigger and bigger price tags. You could try them all and never find one that works. But bareMinerals Blemish Therapy is an excellent product that I have been using for about six years now and I have never been disappointed. In fact, I have been quite surprised at how well the bareMinerals Blemish Therapy has performed. They are a wonderful company and stand behind their products. Buy with confidence.well the bareMinerals Blemish Therapy has performed. They are a wonderful company and stand behind their products. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I just started using Bare Minerals and love how light it is. I also fould it to be a great price! I would recommend the product to anyone with fair skin.</li>
    <li> I have had hormonal acne through the years and continue into menopause.  I use other bareMinerals products and thought I&#x27;d give the blemish therapy a try.  I haven&#x27;t bought it through Amazon yet, only Ulta (I&#x27;m still on my first \\&quot;jar\\&quot;).  It took a few days (more like a week), but I noticed a significant difference out of nowhere.  It seemed like it wasn&#x27;t working at all, then one day I was all cleared up, seemingly out of nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin color is fair.  I use this product once per day under and over my morning moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t conceal unless you brush on several layers.  Even then it doesn&#x27;t really conceal.  It&#x27;s a light-colored powder but goes on translucent enough to where I&#x27;d think even the darkest skin tones could use it, especially if wearing other makeup over it or using it after washing your face at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not used to using a fine talc-like powder to treat my acne so I have a hard time saying I love the stuff, but I do like it and find that it works if you let it.  Don&#x27;t expect your acne to go away overnight, but I feel confident saying that you should notice significant improvement after a week or so of religious and continued use.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  I wear bangs, so have increased oil on my forehead.  This product takes care of it without overdrying. I LOVE IT! And, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other acne products and some of the bare minerals make up I&#x27;ve enjoyed but this one caused break outs.</li>
    <li> Works great if you want a non irritating product.My skin has become sensitive to some of the very strong products.  This is not a cover up, but heals blemishes and works well with powdered foundations.</li>
    <li> I love this product it does a great job of getting rid of acne. However, it doesn&#x27;t conceal very well I tend to just use it at night and by morning my zits are diminished greatly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for a week, and I can already see a huge improvement to my skin. It takes out the red and helps clear up my imprefections without drying my skin the way a lot of acne products do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thinking this product would be okay for the \\&quot;average Jane\\&quot; who gets a pimple now and again.  However, if you are experiencing mega hormonal breakouts on your chin as I am, this might not cut it for you.    I did not find the smell (sulfur) to be overwhelmingly unpleasant &amp; only noticed it if I had the container right under my nose.  I tried using the included brush, but didn&#x27;t care for it. My EcoTools brush did a better job, coverage-wise, but still, I just didn&#x27;t feel this product provided enough coverage for my current acne and/or scarred areas.      I tried this product for two weeks or so, and I really don&#x27;t think it aided in the healing of any of my acne, unfortunately. However, NOTHING seems to be working on my acne, so I don&#x27;t fault Bare Minerals. (I should add, I also do not feel it broke me out any worse...)     So.. who knows.... maybe this will work for you as it does for some people, but I would suggest that if you are a moderate, hormonal acne sufferer, I would not put much hope into this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many things for my acne and this is the first product that has actually worked. It did not work overnight but within a month, I started to see noticable difference in my skin. I recommend this to anyone struggling with acne problems.</li>
    <li> I started out using bareminerals four months ago. It was recommended to me because I had been having issues with adult acne. I bought the basic kit and the lady tried to sell this product to me at this time, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend more moeny. After a month of using it I had no new break outs. I did still have one of those awkward under the skin pimples still...so I bought this and I am not kidding, three days later it was gone. I use this in my previous problems zones daily before applying the matte, and I have all these areas clearing up, like those pore zones are disappearing. I strongly recommend this product. I also have very sensitive skin, and none of the products have irritated me.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Escentuals/bareMinerals products but, this one can be cakey and I really did NOT see any blemish results.  I bought two -- one for my daughter who is thirteen and one for myself.  I just didn&#x27;t see the results I thought they indicated it would deliver.</li>
    <li> Although this isn&#x27;t a miracle worker that zaps away every blemish over night, it does work better than most products I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin much at all. If you apply at least once a day for two-three days on the same spot, it will go away completely. It also didn&#x27;t prevent new blemishes for me, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and was having some break out issues on my chin and underneath. I couldn&#x27;t find anything to help keep it clear but this does a pretty good job. I haven&#x27;t used it long term, so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but for my initial use, it seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals so I thought I would give this product a shot. Everyone complains of the smell so when I got it and actually enjoyed the smell I was shocked! with that said this stuff did little to nothing for my skin, I will probably keep using beens I spent a good amount of money on it, but it feels like it doesn&#x27;t even stay on my troubled spot, its super thin so definitely cant use it to hide anything, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin condition, I have light break outs nothing severe so I&#x27;m going to assume that if you have severe acne this product isn&#x27;t going to be your answer!</li>
    <li> No stars don&#x27;t work...save your money!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Bare Minerals before. Only problem was this time I ordered a color a bit too light for my skin. Will order next color up and blend the two.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing it really does work and dry up the blemish area and conceals it too.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t stick to your face.  Not sure how it can help or hide blemishes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It totally works!!  If you have breakouts, use this product it will help your blemishes heal very quickly.  The Merchant that I purchased this from, MakeupTrading is in California and I am in Florida.  I received this item very,very quickly.  I could not be happier with the delivery of this product from this merchant and I will purchase from them again!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my oldest daughter has a horrible acne problem.  We have been to two dermatologists with no help.  I have her on special vitamins that we do think are helping and I finally have her convinced to drink more water than most people because, it WILL flush toxins from your body that cause acne.  So having said that, I read about this product and thought we have nothing to loose.  She loves it and has told me if she has a spot that starts to burn or itch she will dab a bit of this on that spot and it stops the burn/itch.  She never leaves home without it. We do wish it came in a bigger container because this one is quite small, we would pay the price for a bigger one, I buy it 2 and 3 at a time for.  The cost is worth not having to suffer with acne.</li>
    <li> As a therapy, I don&#x27;t see any difference in blemishes and it doesn&#x27;t cover all that well.  I found that buffing it on as an application rather than dabbing it/patting it covered better and avoided a cakey-ness.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff before and I think it&#x27;s great.  I have very light skin and it doesn&#x27;t show up a weird color or anything.  I don&#x27;t know necessarily how much it truly &amp;#34;treats&amp;#34; acne but it doesn&#x27;t hurt and helps to conceal it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many concealers, but only this one has worked as well.  It also does not further irritate my skin when used on blemishes.  Applying is simple, and it is does not take much powder to quiet redness.  I highly recommend the bM Blemish Therapy.</li>
    <li> I read positively glowing reviews for this and I hoped it would be the cure that I&#x27;ve been searching for for years. Unfortunately, this is not it for me. It causes me to break out with at least two pustules overnight every time I use it. I thought it was pretty much impossible for blemishes to pop up overnight, so I&#x27;ve kept trying my luck with it and it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I sent this to my daughter.  She said she likes it.  We both love Bare Minerals.  I sound like an advertisement.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It works well as the first line of defense to break outs. Covers well, and helps heal sore areas.  You would think I would not have any more breakouts at my age (0ver 50)!  What&#x27;s up with that?</li>
    <li> I discovered this makeup by accident when I was out of my usual spot treatment and borrowed this from my daughter.  The sulfur in this product really works for me.  I have even used a sheer layer over my whole face, at times, which definitely improves my complexion.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I had hoped and dries out skin so the area looks flaky. I suppose I should have assumed this before purchasing since the ingredients and it comes in powder form.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. Love it. It really helps on the start of small pimples. Seems to heal them quicker. Does smell funny but sulfer is its main ingredient which is suppose to stink. Not intended to put all over face. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Anything sulphur will stink but it feels like I am doing something good for myself and beauty always comes at a price.  I love that you can were in day or night and the odor does go away after a few hours.</li>
    <li> Have always used bare minerals...never tried this one..only get the occasional blemish...so don&#x27;t know about hard to treat skin..does a little cover up as well</li>
    <li> This is a great product for healing blemishes quickly with a simple brush on of the rare minerals.  Within a couple of days, the blemish is gone!</li>
    <li> so i read a bunch of reviews saying the smell is terrible blah blah blah. Well i got it and have been using this for about a week. If you cover your whole face with a heavy layer you notice the smell but if you use it like a concealer (dab where it needs to be) you cant tell. Plus, its already done wonders for my skin. I think this is a great product and will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> Does not irritate or break out my sensitive skin and does an alright job at covering blemishes. I&#x27;m unsure of how well this product actually heals them though.</li>
    <li> I love this product and this is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mixed with oily tan skin.  I have adult acne.  I hate it.  I bought this product for the first time not expecting much.  The other day I had two big pimples under the skin forming and thought \\&quot;oh crap, I don&#x27;t have anything to cover it with\\&quot;.  But then I remembered this product, broke it out, dabbed it on.  It definitely was lighter than my complexion but it sort of soaked in.  The best thing, though, was that by mid afternoon I checked the inflammation and it went down. This product helped to dry out my pimples fairly well and I am pleasantly surprised.  I am a product junkie and I love it when it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell IS NOT THAT BAD.  Just don&#x27;t go around sniffin the stuff all day and you&#x27;ll be fine.  Put it on, forget about it, and it won&#x27;t bother you at all.  It&#x27;s not THAT strong.</li>
    <li> No noticable results, better than the redness stuff but not a keeper</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really cover anything, not sure if it works for blemish removal, but it certainly smells terrible, and I haven&#x27;t used it since the first day.  The brush that it comes with is great for other purposes though!</li>
    <li> The brush scoops but cannot pick up the product. The stiff brush makes it harder to apply as it cannot be charged or loaded like other BE brushes. The sulfur does help control oil production, but it does little to deal or diminish blemishes at any stage.</li>
    <li> There is no product that I have encountered in over 40 years which can get rid of a zit faster - even the deep cystic kind. I have used this product for YEARS. Whenever one pops up, I simply dab a bit of the powder on it and within hours the size and redness has drastically improved. By the next day, it&#x27;s almost completely gone. It&#x27;s amazing. My only disappointment is that they changed the amount of product from 2 grams to 1 gram but left it at the same price. The good news, is it only takes a small amount to work...so even the small amount you get will last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> This stuff absolutely works! I bought it with some apprehension that it would not, but still wanted to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. I usually break out on my nose or fore head. Two days of putting the therapy on and its completely gone. Always remember less is more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost positive my skin flared up even more from using this. After the first week I was seeing no benefit, I kept using and now my skin is even worse. Don&#x27;t waste your money- just stick with the bare minerals powder to try and cover up blemishes :/</li>
    <li> the iteam is as desribed.....it also arrived on time.......I would by fromthis vendor again for future products....very happy with iteam.</li>
    <li> This works well on my blemishes when I have them.  Also helps cover the redness.</li>
    <li> this helps with my rosacea quite well, the brush is soft &amp; covers very good. the product came on time &amp; new in box</li>
    <li> For the price of this product I was not too happy with what I received.  I knew the minerals container would be a small jar but did not realize I would be applying it with a doll brush.  This brush is so tiny I find it difficult to hold.  The product does not smell very good and I find that it does not cover as well as it claims.  As far as healing and prevention.... I don&#x27;t know, I keep it in my purse for occasional emergency use.  I am still giving it 3 stars because I stand behind bare essentials products- just very disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> This is a purchase I continue to make because it is effective, on two levels.  Not only does it work to treat and diminish blemishes, but it also conceals them as it works - BONUS!!  Patiently waiting for a larger size...</li>
    <li> Covers my obvious blemishes and has helped to reduce the amount of future breakouts I have! Very light on the skin</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff the first time I found it and never was able to get it in stores again! Super excited about how easy it was through Amazon! yay!</li>
    <li> I tried this product. I was not very impressed. It doesn&#x27;t cover pimples nor did it help in reducing the pimple. It may work for others but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This product smells bad like it is old.  I know the stuff works as I had a sample of it before and it did not smell like anything!  And it worked on mt skin cancer scar.</li>
    <li> My daughter was impressed with this product and loved the creamy texture of this blemish item. She will continue to buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Have use this product for years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> I still love this product.  I always mix a little bit of the blemish therapy along with the [[ASIN:B00375R4GS RareMinerals Skin Revival Treatment ( Night ) - Medium - Bare Escentuals - Powder - RareMinerals Skin Revival Treatment - 4.2g/0.15oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily Asian skin and I break out easily.  Generally stress and weather changes set off my acne.  But with my little night mixture it&#x27;s able to keep my acne at bay.  If my acne gets really bad I would use the mixture both at night and in the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to Amazon selling the 2 gram/0.07 OZ (white jar) of the Blemish Therapy as I go through it quite quickly.  But it seems the manufacturer has cut down on the amount to 1 g / 0.03 Oz (black jar) yet not decreased the price.  I would be ok with this if this was mentioned in larger print, like in the title.  I&#x27;m used to clicking on my order history to re-order so this detail caught me off-guard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this blemish therapy powder for years.  I put it on at night after my moisturizer has sunk in, just in the spots where I would typically break out.  It keeps my acne-prone skin from breaking out without being drying.</li>
    <li> This blemish therapy works well with my skin. Bareminerals is a light and feels like nothing is there. I use this after lotion and before makeup.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Great for my 35+ yr old skin with the occasional bout of blemishes :-/ or to dab on oily skin and it&#x27;s an instant fix. Also, it&#x27;s great for my 14 yr old son to control and conceal an acne flare up (don&#x27;t tell but he puts it on before football practice)....:). Highly recommended! P.S. One little container lasts the two of us months!!!</li>
    <li> The product is great. While my youngest niece was home on spring break, I took her shopping and we went specifically for Bare Minerals. I told her in her pre-teen years that if I  caught her wearing &amp;#34;junk on her face&amp;#34; she was going to be in HUGE trouble because women had gone through fad after fad to find makeup that was good for your skin as well as enhancing your face. She was wearing a Bare Minerals foundation (heaven only knows where that came from) but nothing else.Immediately, I picked up 2 Blemish Therapies (one for each of us) then we went to get her color tested, to get the correct shade, well the lady didn&#x27;t know my niece and picked a shade you could see, the whole point is for it to NOT be seen, so I picked the one I thought was correct and let Bugs pick, she picked mine. They did not have a starter kit in her color. So she wound up with foundation, BLEMISH THERAPY, lip liner (she still doesn&#x27;t see the point) and lip gloss.) I went to Bare mineral site to order matte veil, oil control primer and blush.She needed brushes&#x27; but I&#x27;m not rich, I spoil her. So I came to Amazon for brushes, found the makeup was a little less expensive and because I had wanted to send her suite mates something as well, but at Bare Minerals site they didn&#x27;t have a gift package or collection that would divide between 3 girls, not mention TOO expensive. So, I needed to send brushes and I thought Blemish Therapy, every woman needs it and especially at their age, so I ordered 3. I was told they loved them and got them very quickly, well before the last date. So, the 4 muskateers are at least zit free!!!</li>
    <li> Best acne solution ever!  It covers blemishes well and works to get rid of them quickly.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> My Stylist showed me this. I had gone in for a color and she noticed that I was picking my skin. I have always been a picker when I break out on my face chest ect. I bought one and took it home. I will not be without it ever. It covers my picking and heals it fast. I would not hesitate to buy this product it is a life saver.</li>
    <li> I usually LOVE bareminerals products,never been unhappy with one until this. Dont waste your money on this product it doesnt work at all.I wouldnt suggest it to anyone</li>
    <li> Bare escentuals fan .  This smells like sulfur but it works and zaps any blemish WHILE concealing it .  I can work w/ the smell for the great results...Smell doesn&#x27;t stick around anyway.</li>
    <li> really did not help my blemishes at all.</li>
    <li> i have had mixed results with this product, although i have yet to find a true cure all. i do like the application of powder vs. stick creme or face washes.</li>
    <li> I do not have a serious issue with breakouts but occasionally I have problems my chin and nose.  This product clears it up in no time and stops the pimples that are forming.  I use it as soon as they start and for a week afterward.  The smell is a bit unpleasant, it smells a bit earthy and almost like mildew.....(my husband asked me why my face stinks! LOL!!!). Should you be able to get past the scent, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Does not provide ANY coverage! Ugh. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I never expected to develop zits in my 60s--but after literally decades of relatively blemish-free skin, I started getting an occasional pimple in the area of my mouth and chin.  I tried other products, but this is the only thing that has worked.  As far as the sulfur smell mentioned by other reviewers: it&#x27;s noticeable during application, but even then it&#x27;s pretty mild.  Once the makeup is on, I don&#x27;t detect it at all.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> REALLY strange smell...kind of like tea tree? Not sure if it worked that great. I am used to their traditional foundation, which I love. I am not in love with this product.</li>
    <li> You will see dramatic differences with this product. My skin is prone to acne (adult acne) but this product has made such a difference for me. It looks great and it feels great. I have seen a total difference while using this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has moderate acne. I&#x27;m a fan of Bare Minerals so I was curious to see how their acne product would live upto its reputation.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item as an adjust to total skin care for an acne sufferer</li>
