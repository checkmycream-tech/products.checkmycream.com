<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the most moisturizing lotion.  It has a great scent too.</li>
    <li> The only brand I use anymore. Smells great and works wonders.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> this cream helps no only my skin but my nails grow strong and beautiful!  I can not live with out it!</li>
    <li> My favorite body butter.</li>
    <li> pleasant smell. will buy again</li>
    <li> keeps my dry hands and feet moist without being greasy, wayyy better price that the body shop and just as good;)</li>
    <li> great stuff....this went to my granddaughter who loves mango...</li>
    <li> I formerly had used the lime coconut scent, but for some reason the price increased on that scent.  The tropical mango was much cheaper so I decided to give it a try.  The scent is much stronger and seems to last longer.  I definitely will order more.</li>
    <li> The original is my favorite but this is fine.</li>
    <li> The top ingredients are a bunch of chemicals such as Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohxasiloxane, Glycerin, and then shea butter. These should be put in the product description. The current product description gives the impression that this product is organic and natural, and a lot of the ingredients are not.</li>
    <li> It works great with dry skin, much better than regular lotion which I am allergic to and it smells fresh.</li>
    <li> Smooth and silky Shea butter, this brand is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love It!! I would buy this over and over again. Smells wonderful!! Only problem is it doesn&#x27;t hold the mango smell all day long.</li>
    <li> The body butter works like all the others I&#x27;ve had but I prefer the scent of some of the other jars.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite personal smell of them all but love Tree Hut body butters texture! Very moisturizing, thick. My favorite one is Hawaiian Kukui</li>
    <li> It is very smooth. I love the smell. At first it smelled too tropical, but the smell fades as you apply it. I put this on after I shower with the Tree Hut Scrub and these products together work wonders to the skin. I would recommend this to anyone looking to show their skin some major love.</li>
    <li> t smell and great price.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AWESOME, AND I LOVE USING IT ON MY LEGS AND FEET AFTER EVERY SHOWER.  VERY THICK CREAM, BUT NO OILY FEEL TO IT, WHICH MAKES ME REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I HAVE EVEN USED IT ON MY FACE AND NECK.</li>
    <li> I love the mango scent. I use it when I get out of the shower and it keeps my legs hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth and some of my recent scars actually smoothed out! I am very happy about this product, I will definitely order other products.</li>
    <li> It is not too greasy. A very nice fragrance, goes on easily.  I use it on my elbows, knees and heels at bed time. It won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> These body butters are rich &amp; thick!  They provide all day body smoothness with great fragrance.  They make good hand cream as well!</li>
    <li> It was a gift, it smell so great!!</li>
    <li> In the winter my legs get so dry and itchy, that I want to scratch them till they are red.  To prevent this dryness, I use the body butter on my legs right after I get out of the shower.  I rub it on my legs. It smells wonderful. ( I have also tried the coconut lime - good also).&lt;br /&gt;When I use this, I don&#x27;t have the problem with dry skin any longer - It works.</li>
    <li> I am only giving this three stars because the lid was busted and the lotion was all over the place when I received the order; however, from cleaning up all of the other products that came in my order I had it all over my hands and arms and it smelled great.  My skin felt smooth too, so I am sure it is a nice lotion but I am just upset it was not packaged with more care.</li>
    <li> I love the regular Tree Hut shea body butter so I thought I&#x27;d try the mango version. It feels the same and is a nice moisturizer, but it smells terrible. Way, way over-perfumed. Some might like it but I find it to be just terrible.</li>
    <li> I love body butters and this is the first time I buy this one, I love the smell and the texture, very nice.</li>
    <li> It has a loud smell and doesn&#x27;t work as well as the body butter from The Body Shop - and given that I can get them for 5.00 from time to time...I&#x27;ll just stock up on that.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for a lot less than other massage creams on the market. I expect to buy more when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Nice product for the price, but not crazy about the scent. I was looking for a body shop type butter and feel this is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love this body lotion as it feels great and lasts throughout the day without having to be reapplied.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.</li>
    <li> For the price this can&#x27;t be be beat.  The smell is heaven and it is a nice rich cream, I really enjoy using it and price is great!</li>
    <li> I love this line of moisturizers.  I live in Michigan which has dreadful winters, especially this year.  This body butter helps me to keep my hands properly moisturized.  Importantly, it is hydrating but not greasy (which I would hate).  Love that it is an organic product too.</li>
    <li> I love this Mango Body Butter and the price is really amazing (check out the prices of popular bath and body stores in the mall and you&#x27;ll see what I mean).  I just came back from vacation with a deeper skin tone and this body butter helps keep my dark skin glowing!  At first, the scent was a bit too sweet for me, but it dissipated throughout the day and left a nice subtle scent on my skin.  Do use their sugar scrub first, then follow up with the body butter for extra pampering.  I appreciate that it is not greasy afterwards, even though it slides on like silk.  It is great on the dry areas like your elbows, knees and feet.  Do give it a try because you really can&#x27;t go wrong for the price; I plan to try Tree Hut&#x27;s other scrubs and body butters, as well.  Very happy I found this line of products!</li>
    <li> smells amazing!  Like all their products, this is great!  softens, not greasy, and a perfect solution for dry and/or itchy skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Not too watery or oily.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this cream is great for moisture.  I also use the cream on my feet at night and wake up with smooth feeling feet.  If you like the smell of mango, you&#x27;ll like the cream.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, and even worse feet.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually works to combat dry skin.  It feels like silk, and my skin feels so much healthier.  Mango scent is very nice too.</li>
    <li> I like the thick texture of this product... but I think the regular shea butter scent is nicer.  This is a little too fruity for my needs, but I&#x27;ll keep using it anyway.  Works great on rough heels!</li>
    <li> Have used this before.It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer, has a  very nice scent, not greasy. A bit expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> My favorite fruit is mango, and my sense of smell can detect a fake.  There are so many creams and lotions out there that claim to be mango, but is really crap mango.  Or crango.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has the distinct, authentic mango scent, which is so badly imitated out there that finding a true mango scent is a rarity, indeed.  The shea butter is emollient and creamy, so a little goes a long way.  This gives more expensive products like The Body Shop a run for its money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I found this at a local cosmetic discount store, and it was on sale.  I opened the jar to smell it, and I was so amazed by the scent, I had to take them all home.  I have tried all the other flavors, and while the others smelled amazing, this remains my favorite, since mango is my fruit of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t know how the makers managed to get shea butter&#x27;s distinct, unappealing scent to recede into the background.  Shea butter is great for the skin, but sad to say, smells like melting plastic.  Tree Hut makes an affordable, quality product, and I think it&#x27;s made in the USA, so we should all support it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something more nutty, the Brazillian nut one is great, too.</li>
    <li> I love this body butter not only does it smell amazing it leaves my skin super super soft and moisturized . I bought this at walmart because it&#x27;s half the price. I use this body butter along with the Tropical Mango body wash and sugar scrub and my skin has never been so soft !</li>
    <li> I really love this hand cream.  It smells nice and feels great.  The price is right.  What else do you need?</li>
    <li> Nice creamy thick texture. A little goes a long way. Pleasant scent that is fairly strong. Really works well on very dry skin.</li>
    <li> It a wonderful and excellent</li>
    <li> If you are mangoholic like me - this product is definitely for you. The scent is amazing, it smells like juicy yellow mango and it really moisturizes your skin very well. I also love it since the base is a natural shea butter, not just a regular lotion. I would buy this product in future and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Body Butter From Tree Hut works very well for the ladies at our library. It isn&#x27;t greasy and rubs in well for them to use.I always give it to them for Christmas</li>
    <li> The scent gets hard to deal with after an hour. Great price, but not really isavke</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  The effects last a long time.  I love the scent and my skin is much happier when I use it.  It only takes a little of the butter to cover a large area so it really is more economical than I had originally expected.....always a big bonus.  Will be buying more of this</li>
    <li> I was expecting more if a Shea butter consistency but it turned out to be a cream. However, I still really like the product. No greasy residue on the skin after using and it smells extremely good. Bottom line, I will buy more.</li>
    <li> The mango shea butter smells so good you could eat it. I expected a mango color to the product because it uses puree, but it was not colored at all which was a good thing to me.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel good about using this organic product with genuine fruit puree knowing I am not putting poisons on my skin to be absorbed.</li>
    <li> smells delicious and creaminess is consistent.Just wish it was carried in store like otherTH body butters. I&#x27;m definitely stocking up on this</li>
    <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel real waxy.</li>
    <li> I did not care for this one as much ,as I like the original shea butter better, it smells good. But the tropical mango is too stronge a fragrance for me..</li>
    <li> My wife keeps re-buying this body butter. It is thick and it smells clean.</li>
    <li> The scent is over the top!  I liked it...and then realized I kept smelling the scent, STRONGLY, for quite a while.  It&#x27;s been two hours now, and I finally just had to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could use it as a bathroom freshener, I guess...</li>
    <li> Really love this body butter !  I feel my skin feels nourished after applying it  ,there is also a lotion available in tropical mango as well I really enjoy the smell of this product !</li>
    <li> i have excema and psoraiasis and this product helps to smooth and soften my skin. Especially great after a sugar scrub!</li>
    <li> ottima perche rende la pelle morbida e la protegge con un velo di crema ricca che fa sentire meglio. Le profumazioni sono tutte ottime</li>
    <li> Omg smells sooo freaking good!!!!! 😻😻</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical. Thanks for helping me smell delicious!</li>
    <li> This body butter has a nice texture, and price. Delivery was great.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have with it is that I don&#x27;t like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of armpits that need deodorant that are slightly covered by a mango scent.</li>
    <li> Good smelling cream with alot of moisture and very thick</li>
    <li> My wife loved it, My wife loved it, and the smell, absolutely fantastice. We purchased before and wil continue buying in the future. These work great for gifts too.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I wanted but I used it completely until it was done.  I was looking for a product by sheaaroma.com.  But this is a good product too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is heaven on earth!! The smell of the body butter is fantastic and it just glides on to the skin like clock work, and a little goes a long way, I will definitely buy more of this once I run out</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and works on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this simply because I ran out of my Bath and Body Works body butter, and a friend of mine told me to try this brand. When I got it, it looked like it had been used, half the product was on the side of the bottle and the rest was melting on the bottom of it. I put it in the fridge for an hour and that helped a lot. The actual butter doesn&#x27;t really moisturize though. Whenever I use it, the oils and what not just stay on top of my skin. It takes around 5 mins before it absorbs. The scent is so nice! It smells so fruity and lovely. I&#x27;m really only keeping it for the smell!</li>
    <li> I love the Tree Hut brand. Costco had it last Christmas, but no this year so I found it on Amazon. It&#x27;s great. Leaves your skin soft without toxins/chemicals. My favorite body butter.</li>
    <li> This smells delicious.  I always tell my children that they smell like ice cream and it&#x27;s the only thing that has really helped repair my son&#x27;s dry skin.  It makes it smoother and clearer.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it and it is energizing.  My skin is soft and smooth.  Will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Good product and scent.</li>
    <li> It has a great scent and a great texture.  I use a lot of body Butter... I have very dry skin.  I really like it!</li>
    <li> Have had this for 2 weeks.  Smells great and provides a nice layer of protection for really dry areas. Try it.</li>
    <li> great price and great product!!!  cheaper than buying it at the store.  This is my favorite scent and the body butter is very moisturizing, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Tree Hut stopped making this for a few years. The old butter had some dye in it to make it orange, this does not. No difference between the function of the product. I used to wash dishes in a kitchen and would get really dry hand that would crack and bleed. Using this twice a day helped heal my hands and prevent the cracking. I still use it once a day before bedtime to keep my skin soft. It goes on thick and needs to be rubbed in more than a standard lotion, but it hydrates more and lasts longer. I put it on at night before bed and it lasts till the next night. I&#x27;ve tried some other body butters after they stopped making this and I&#x27;m really glad Tree Hut started making this again because I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that worked as well as this.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome. Sure wish it had cocoa butter mixed in. It&#x27;s great just the way it is though.</li>
    <li> I will be wanting to order this again because the smell is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is protected from the subzero weather that we have this winter because I am using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick and rich, but rubs in well.</li>
    <li> What I like about body butter is that unlike lotion it gets absorbed into the skin so you don&#x27;t have that sticky feeling. It also smells great..</li>
    <li> I got this with the scrub and body wash I smell so good after using all them and it leaves my skin oh so soft and moist even n these cold winter months.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! The smell is exactly what you would expect &amp;#34;tropical mango&amp;#34; to smell like. Lotion is thick and creamy but not greasy.</li>
    <li> Love the way this smells. And you can&#x27;t beat the &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; price.</li>
    <li> Good feel - Good smell  Will buy again</li>
    <li> Bought  all the tree hut  products the only thing I use for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff I keep reordering this is my 3rd</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used a Tree Hut product. I will certainly purchase more body butter made by Tree Hut</li>
    <li> Great texture very thick and soothing Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so scented.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to use and wear as a result</li>
    <li> This is a really thick and rich body  butter. A little bit goes a long way. It is a little greasy to the touch at first, but it absorbs in relatively quickly. The scent is pretty strong and I happen to like the smell of mangos, so I enjoy the luxurious perfume. I use it as a body lotion, and a quarter-sized amount is about all I need to moisturize dry skin areas.</li>
    <li> It is quite by chance that I discovered this brand.&lt;br /&gt;It is not found in France, but Amazon solve the problem; o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know and continue to use almond butter and honey, and I wanted to buy another one of another &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;My choice fell on the mango. I wanted the tangy and fresh at a time. No heavy scent if too oppressive.&lt;br /&gt;And the Tree Hut Shea Butter Mango together all at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount in the pot used to hold long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Heat a little of the white and flavored butter between your palms and apply to dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I put my butter after each shower. Well it sticks a bit and I have a little trouble to put on my clothes, but when I&#x27;m in no hurry, I can wait and threading clothes do more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mango smell is chemical, I will not lie, but very nice.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like I imagined: sweet and tart at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;The smell stays on the skin a good time, but especially my skin is moisturized. No tugging !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good brand that deserves to be discovered in France.</li>
    <li> I am the biggest fan of Tree Hut products and this new Tropical Mango body butter is sublime!  The scent reminds me of beautiful Negril, and the smooth texture of the body butter is just wonderful.  I usually buy my Tree Hut body butters from my local Walmart, but they don&#x27;t carry this new scent. I bought several Tree Hut butters and gave them as Christmas gifts to my sisters this past year and they all loved them.  Amazon made it so easy to purchase these favorite products and they arrived so nicely packaged.  I will certainly be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I had a previous version of this very product and bought this one hoping it would be the same. It wasn&#x27;t. It has been changed and this new version is greasier and is not absorbed as well as the previous one. The scent has changed also and not for the better, I was disappointed, I wish Tree Hut would go back to the old product. In this new form, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the mango smell. The cream is so thick and feels great.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it!  This product smells amazing, covers well not sticky to touch. You cant beat the price either!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a a lotion that would not dry out especially in the winter months and i found it. I alternate between scents and people are always asking why i always smell so good. I love how it keeps my skin moisturized all day. I can&#x27;t complain about dry skin anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this body butter in the dead of winter because of my extremely dry skin. I had previously purchased a mango scented body butter from Bath and Body Works, but this one was half the prize and felt higher quality. It&#x27;s not something you would want to put on in the morning before getting ready for the day because it&#x27;s thick and can make your clothes stick to you. However, covering legs, arms, and other dry areas before bed allows it to really moisturize your skin overnight. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more :)</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture</li>
    <li> Love the scent, love the thickness, love how it absorbs into my skin without leaving a greasy feel. Nice! I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Everything great. Fast shipping.Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Smell so good, I want to eat it. It&#x27;s thick too</li>
    <li> I have used Shea Body Butter before.  This is a new fragrance.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT, USE ON BODY DAILY. WOULD WITHOUT A DOUBT, PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> A coworker of mine buys this from SAMs Club and it cost her 15 bucks! It&#x27;s smelled so wonderful I wanted some to! Found it on Amazon for 10 bucks cheaper!</li>
