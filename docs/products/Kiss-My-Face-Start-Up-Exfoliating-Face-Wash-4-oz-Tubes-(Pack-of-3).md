      <li>Easy to use.</li>

      <li>Great for my super sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>This is a nice gentle cleanser that seems to help gently exfoliate too (which become more and more important as we age).  </li>
      <li>So happy with this and many of the other Kiss My Face products.</li>
      <li>This product smells great and really wakes me up, while containing all organic and natural ingredients!  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well-rated on the EWG toxics list for being pretty safe.  </li>
      <li>a gentle cleanser which is great for sensitive or aging skin.</li>
      <li>Rinses clean without drying...</li>
      <li>I honestly have not had this clear of skin on over 3 years!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years with great results and I had tries ALOT of products.</li>
      <li>I really regret that this product doesn&#x27;t work better for my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also pregnant</li>
      <li>There leave you with smooth skin and they have a pretty smell, so you won&#x27;t mind applying them to your face.</li>
      <li>It is no longer available at my Whole Foods (why?!?)</li>
      <li>Although it certainly worked just fine before then, too.</li>
      <li>The price was right and delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>So far, I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>I am sure all of you are tired of me telling you how great all of the Kiss</li>
      <li>Oh and the scent seems very clean, not artificially fragranced, almost like a soft lemon and lime beverage scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from adult/hormonal acne ever since I got pregnant with my first child.</li>
      <li>This is gentle enough to use on eyelids and keeps my super sensitive skin happy.</li>
      <li>Have been using this for the past 2 years and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, lasts a long time, smells amazing</li>
      <li>Very gentle exfoliation.</li>
      <li>, organic works really well!  </li>
      <li>Even have cousins who have stopped ordering Pro Active because this has worked better on their skin!</li>
      <li>Most other face washes in the store have ingredients in them that can be harmful to your baby or fetus if pregnant or breastfeeding while using them.  </li>
      <li>It has a real nice, very subtle smell too.</li>
      <li>However, if you use makeup daily, this will enhance rather than harm your skin and make it easy to get all the makeup off EVERY night the way we are supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I have an oily t-zone and sometimes some sensitivity, but this formula seems so pure.</li>
      <li>I have my whole family and my boyfriend&#x27;s whole family hooked on this stuff.</li>
      <li>After using this my skin is so much softer.</li>
      <li>I have very acne prone oily skin.</li>
      <li>It feels fantastic on my face and definitely improves the skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Kiss My Face products!</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive, combination skin with dry patches and oily patches and occasional mild acne that frequently feels tight or itchy after you wash it, then this might be YOUR perfect face wash, too!!!</li>
      <li>It leaves my face clean and balanced, and it even shrinks the pores a little--and keeps them from growing larger.</li>
      <li>It just wasn&#x27;t getting my face clean enough.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, which is why i bought this product in the first</li>
      <li>(it was only mild before, but still).</li>
      <li>It is light, refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or dry.</li>
      <li>I know you will never buy the high priced stuff that does not do what it promises ever again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a harsh cleanser but keeps my face clean of blackheads, especially in the t-zone area.   </li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I am a new breastfeeding Mom, and saw it recommended in a magazine.  </li>
      <li>My skin has cleared up completely!</li>
      <li>After a couple of days of not using the product my face started to clear up again,</li>
      <li>My skin is clear (even through pregnancy) and soft.  </li>
      <li>I prefer something that isn&#x27;t gel-based or at least with a tad more scrub.</li>
      <li>I had horrible skin most of my life and it was such a relief to finally have gorgeous blemish free skin.</li>
      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since other people are giving it such good reviews, i&#x27;d suggest anyone considering this product find a store that has a sample bottle and apply a little to their forearm to check for a reaction before putting any on their face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fast becoming addicted to Kiss My Face products.  </li>
      <li>For the first time in my entire life I actually feel like I can go out without make-up on.</li>
      <li>I think it just takes a while for your skin to calm down from all of the harsher cleansers and balance itself out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>It only takes about a dime-sized amount to waah my entire face and neck; the first tube lasted almost 6 weeks using it always once per day, occasionally twice.</li>
      <li>This exfolioating face was is not harsh -- it&#x27;s a gel that you can tell is working to remove the day&#x27;s makeup and grime, but doesn&#x27;t dry the skin or leave it oily.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it is a little more expensive than other drugstore options, but it is so worth it!</li>
      <li>No harsh or crazy chemicals in the stuff, all natural organic ingredients which is something I strongly believe in since our skin absorbs this over time.  </li>
      <li>After a few months the old scarring started to clear up as well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m fast becoming addicted to Kiss My Face products.  They are light and fresh feeling, and do a great job.  This exfolioating face was is not harsh -- it&#x27;s a gel that you can tell is working to remove the day&#x27;s makeup and grime, but doesn&#x27;t dry the skin or leave it oily.  I also use the KMF toner.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by size, this has lasted me 2-3 months, you only need a small dot.</li>
    <li> So far, I LOVE this stuff. I have very acne prone oily skin. I&#x27;m also pregnant so I&#x27;m also dealing with hormonal acne. You name it, and I&#x27;ve tried it! Everything from harsh products, like proactive and obagi, to natural products, like acure and yes to tomatoes. I wanted to use something natural during my pregnancy and figured that my skin was already such a train wreck even with harsh products, it really couldn&#x27;t get any worse. So I tried this face wash, palong with kiss my face toner, acne clearing gel, pore shrink mask and I use reprechage honey almond scrub when needed. My skin has cleared up completely! I&#x27;ve suffered from adult/hormonal acne ever since I got pregnant with my first child. I honestly have not had this clear of skin on over 3 years!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s so gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I have an oily t-zone and sometimes some sensitivity, but this formula seems so pure. I especially love that it&#x27;s an effective cleaser, but has a very low hazard score on another cosmetics safety website. Oh and the scent seems very clean, not artificially fragranced, almost like a soft lemon and lime beverage scent. In order to get my eye makeup off, I will wash with this twice. Then again, I do that will almost any cleanser anyway, just to make sure all the dirt, makeup and residue is fully removed. I don&#x27;t like toners.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, which is why i bought this product in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few hours of using it the first time, everywhere i&#x27;d applied it broke out in a rough rash. Now, a week later, my skin&#x27;s almost back to normal, and alas, i&#x27;m back to using the non-organic and relative un-earth-friendly exfoliating cleanser i had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read through the list of ingredients quite carefully, and i know i&#x27;m not allergic to any of the ingredients, so i&#x27;m not sure why my skin reacted so poorly to this product. I use other Kiss My Face products with no adverse reaction, and like the brand overall, so i&#x27;m disappointed that i can&#x27;t use this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since other people are giving it such good reviews, i&#x27;d suggest anyone considering this product find a store that has a sample bottle and apply a little to their forearm to check for a reaction before putting any on their face.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a harsher scrub because of the exfoliating factor, but it&#x27;s a gel that goes on smoothly.  It smells great and works well.  My skin seems to like it.  I love that there are no harmful chemicals.  If you are looking for a grainy scrub, keep looking. This is a good cleanser that&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> One of the purest facial exfoliants you can buy.  No harsh or crazy chemicals in the stuff, all natural organic ingredients which is something I strongly believe in since our skin absorbs this over time.  Very light on your skin, no granules in it which I know some people like.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I definitely save some nice money buying from Amazon since it&#x27;s CRAZY expensive at Whole Foods.    Cheers</li>
    <li> I replaced my Proactiv: Step 1 with this.  It doesn&#x27;t have the little scrubbies in it, but it still exfoliates just as well, except this doesn&#x27;t burn my skin and eyes.  It smells very strongly of candied citrus (mostly lime-y).  It only takes about a dime-sized amount to waah my entire face and neck; the first tube lasted almost 6 weeks using it always once per day, occasionally twice.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I keep a bottle in the shower and use it every morning.  It&#x27;s not a harsh cleanser but keeps my face clean of blackheads, especially in the t-zone area.   I keep a bottle of the creamy cleanser by my sink and use it at night to wash off my makeup.</li>
    <li> I ADORE THIS STUFF! I use it every time I shower, and I hope to have it on hand for the rest of my life. It feels fantastic on my face and definitely improves the skin. The smell is also wonderful.</li>
    <li> cleans well but sometimes i have to wash twice to get all the dead skin off of my face.  you will still need actual scrubs once in a while.  This is not a scrub.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great for my super sensitive skin. Very gentle exfoliation. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years with great results and I had tries ALOT of products.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash I use. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but gets all my make up off. Helps prevent break outs</li>
    <li> Kiss My Face Products are awesome! There leave you with smooth skin and they have a pretty smell, so you won&#x27;t mind applying them to your face. I highly recommend Kiss My Face products!</li>
    <li> When I found out I was pregnant, I needed to find a safe face wash.  This face wash has been absolutely the best I have every used and I will not be switching back to anything else.  My skin is clear (even through pregnancy) and soft.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My supermarket was out of the product so I checked online.  The price was right and delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> I could not say this is the worlds best exfoliator but it smells fabulous and spreads easily on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years. I&#x27;m middle aged but still have slightly oily skin.  This is a nice gentle cleanser that seems to help gently exfoliate too (which become more and more important as we age).  It has a real nice, very subtle smell too.</li>
    <li> gel based and exfoliating agent is quite tiny. I prefer something that isn&#x27;t gel-based or at least with a tad more scrub.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I am a new breastfeeding Mom, and saw it recommended in a magazine.  Most other face washes in the store have ingredients in them that can be harmful to your baby or fetus if pregnant or breastfeeding while using them.  This product smells great and really wakes me up, while containing all organic and natural ingredients!  It makes my face glow as well:)</li>
    <li> a gentle cleanser which is great for sensitive or aging skin. Easy to use. Takes off all makeup including eye makeup. Rinses clean without drying...a bit expensive. However, if you use makeup daily, this will enhance rather than harm your skin and make it easy to get all the makeup off EVERY night the way we are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It is like this face wash was custom designed for my skin. If you have sensitive, combination skin with dry patches and oily patches and occasional mild acne that frequently feels tight or itchy after you wash it, then this might be YOUR perfect face wash, too!!! I have been using it for 4 years. It is no longer available at my Whole Foods (why?!?) so I order it here. Yes, it is a little more expensive than other drugstore options, but it is so worth it! For the first time in my entire life I actually feel like I can go out without make-up on. It has made that big of a difference in my skin. I have practically zero acne now (it was only mild before, but still). One thing I&#x27;ll say is that this dramatic skin transformation didn&#x27;t happen over night. The longer I use it, the better my skin looks. I would say it took about 6 months to start seeing definite improvement. Although it certainly worked just fine before then, too. I think it just takes a while for your skin to calm down from all of the harsher cleansers and balance itself out.</li>
    <li> This is gentle enough to use on eyelids and keeps my super sensitive skin happy. I have combination skin and this is great for keeping my skin happy.</li>
    <li> Very gentle, lasts a long time, smells amazing, organic works really well!  Great find.  Been using this for years with the toner!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! I have my whole family and my boyfriend&#x27;s whole family hooked on this stuff. Even have cousins who have stopped ordering Pro Active because this has worked better on their skin!</li>
    <li> Fresh, lively, effective--simply the best face wash I have ever found. A previous formula with more alpha-hydroxy acids was even better, but this is still the best I can find. It leaves my face clean and balanced, and it even shrinks the pores a little--and keeps them from growing larger. I use it as my primary face wash, and it&#x27;s a great way to to start the day.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace cetaphil. It just wasn&#x27;t getting my face clean enough. This is nice. It cleans much better, has a pleasant light lemony scent, and leaves my skin clean but not tight. I love that it has 5% aha due to the citrus. It has always helped any flakeiness my skin was experiencing.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for the past 2 years and my skin looks great. I had horrible skin most of my life and it was such a relief to finally have gorgeous blemish free skin. After a few months the old scarring started to clear up as well. So happy with this and many of the other Kiss My Face products.</li>
    <li> I forgot to take this on vacation and my skin changed and i broke out shortly after. After using this my skin is so much softer.</li>
    <li> I wish I could like this product. It is light, refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or dry. Unfortunately (and perhaps this is a result of the climate I live in), my face feels oily after a couple hours and I keep getting horrible whiteheads in places on my face that I rarely, if ever, get them. After a couple of days of not using the product my face started to clear up again, and then I tried using it and the whiteheads returned. I was even getting them on my neck. I really regret that this product doesn&#x27;t work better for my skin.</li>
    <li> I am sure all of you are tired of me telling you how great all of the Kiss My Face products are.  Pick out something to try from their line.  I know you will never buy the high priced stuff that does not do what it promises ever again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for along time.  It&#x27;s well-rated on the EWG toxics list for being pretty safe.  It is one of the cheapest face cleansers you can buy that is relatively safe.  It&#x27;s a clear gel-like cleanser, on the thin side.  Does a good job.</li>
