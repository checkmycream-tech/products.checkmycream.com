      <li>I love the feel and results of this face polish.  </li>
      <li>It is a pretty peach color, so it looks good in the shower or on the bathroom vanity.</li>
      <li>It is a good scrub, no doubt, but it did not blow my mind and it most certainly did not do wonders for my skin.  </li>
      <li>Got a sample of this somewhere and loved it so much I had to buy the product!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The grains are really fine and gentle for a good scrub.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>I first tried my friends and then had to buy my own.</li>

      <li>THIS PRODUCT DOES A GREAT JOB, LEFT MY FACE</li>
      <li>The granules are just a perfect size that don&#x27;t irritate, yet big enough to think they might be effective.</li>
      <li>FEELING SO CLEAN AND SMOOTH</li>
      <li>I originally got this as a sample from an order on Sephora, and it sat in my travel bag for a month before I went on the road...</li>
      <li>By far the best facial polish I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>It is FARRRR superior to any other scrub I&#x27;ve used, with the exception of Lancome Exfoliance Confort, which I also love.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re a fan of Laura Mercier or even if you&#x27;re new to the brand you&#x27;re sure to enjoy this scrub.</li>
      <li>This scrub is very effective, yet gentle enough on your skin that you can use it almost every day.</li>
      <li>have loved this for a long time!</li>
      <li>and my skin is glowing from the first time to now!  </li>
      <li>I also appreciate that the scent of this is very soft and neutral, perfect for those who don&#x27;t like heavily perfumed products.  </li>
      <li>I love how soft my skin feels after using this.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey but in my opinion, totally worth it.  </li>
      <li>Ive tried other exfoliating cleansers and none work as good as this polish.  </li>
      <li>I just love it in general.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product, just not worth 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this product, it smells good, it&#x27;s gentle enough for daily use, and it leaves your face feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I want something that will be effective at sloughing off dry skin, but</li>
      <li>It is very gentle on the skin</li>
      <li>It has a very light fresh scent that I honestly didn&#x27;t notice until reading other reviews then going back to smell the</li>
      <li>The little microbeads make your face feel so good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different cleansers/face scrubs including everything from St. Ives to Proactive, to Dermalogica, to Philosophy, Lancome, Clarins...</li>
      <li>This is my favorite skin scrub, it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
      <li>It does, however, have a nice amount of moisture in it, so doesn&#x27;t drag on the skin when you massage your face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and everytime I use it, it makes my skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin clear, clean, refreshed &amp; exfoliated.</li>
      <li>My skin from the first use months ago instantly became smooth, and it felt at peace in a way.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product that I use at home, and especially when traveling -- sample size lasts a week -- in lieu of lugging a battery-operated face polisher.</li>
      <li>Anyone who wants to have smoother skin, lessen their blackheads should really consider giving this a try.</li>
      <li>It really does polish your face.  </li>
      <li>I actually get excited to use it.  </li>
      <li>I especially look forward to using it when I travel: after a day getting whipped with industrial strength pollution, it&#x27;s a treat to clean off the grime with LMFP.</li>
      <li>But just &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; clean isn&#x27;t enough for a product of this price.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too harsh and leaves my skin SUPER soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and LM Face Polish is gentle but thorough.</li>
      <li>My husband even noticed after just a few uses that my skin was clearing up and told me that I looked radiant :)  </li>
      <li>(my normal cleanser is DDF Advanced Micro-Exfoliating Cleanser, which i use with my Clairsonic Mia2 and until this seemed to be the only thing that kept my face from looking like I was back in high school).  </li>
      <li>I received this as a free gift after purchasing a butt-load of other Laura Mercier products at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>; I REALLY USED SO LITTLE , SO I KNOW THE TUBE WILL LAST A LONG TIME; I AM IN MY 70&#x27;S, WITH FAIRLY GOOD SKIN  </li>
      <li>and I have very sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
      <li>The little exfoliating bits are the perfect size to completely wipe away dead, dry skin without scratching and doing damage to your skin.  </li>
      <li>Even if I have a bump that wants to surface I use it and the following day that little bump isn&#x27;t there anymore it doesn&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing my second one very soon!</li>
      <li>I have dry, sensitive skin prone to mild acne here &amp; there.</li>
      <li>When I do put on a little foundation it goes on so smoothly</li>
      <li>The smell is minimal, but what little there is, is nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for me to use every day; I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Tiny microscrubbers really make a difference.</li>
      <li>and I have fairly sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and still battling ever-changing acne on my face.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this a number of times and it is gentle, yet thorough as a facial scrub.</li>
      <li>I gave it a try and WOW.  </li>
      <li>just enough &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to really polish</li>
      <li>The small bead-scrubbers leave your skin soft and clean but not dry, and not raw feeling like some exfoliators can do.  </li>
      <li>This scrub uses tiny little wax beads, so they are perfectly smooth and glide over the skin.  </li>
      <li>I am 33 years old and have needed to use Proactive for the last 5-8 years because, lets face it, I had/have adult acne.  </li>
      <li>The first thing that I noticed was that the \\&quot;beads\\&quot; in the product are not too big and not too small, nor are they too harsh or so fine that they seem ineffective.  </li>
      <li>The bottle itself lasts a VERY long time, and has siginificantly reduced my old acne scars to the point where I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wear foundation every day (score!).  </li>
      <li>A little pricy for me to consistently repurchase on my budget, but if you can afford to have it on hand regularly, definitely buy it.</li>
      <li>For context, I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have skin that is dry, sensitive and acne prone.</li>
      <li>Even with daily usemy skin does not dry out.</li>
      <li>If you have very sensitive skin, you can still use this product every other day.</li>

    <li> This is the perfect face wash. I love it! It leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed. The little microbeads make your face feel so good. I highly recommend it.</li>

    <li> Hi, I&#x27;ve been using this wonderful product for about 7 months now and it&#x27;s unfortanetly finish. I will be purchasing my second one very soon! A little bit goes a long way! It is very gentle on the skin and I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and it&#x27;s a wonderful product for those like me. My skin from the first use months ago instantly became smooth, and it felt at peace in a way. Even if I have a bump that wants to surface I use it and the following day that little bump isn&#x27;t there anymore it doesn&#x27;t get better than that. When I do put on a little foundation it goes on so smoothly and my skin is glowing from the first time to now!  I haven&#x27;t seen a few relatives in almost 7 years and they were telling me my skin is glowing! It&#x27;s a little pricey but you get what you paid for!!!![[ASIN:B004JTON5Q Laura Mercier Flawless Skin Face Polish 3.4 oz]]</li>
    <li> Leaves skin clear, clean, refreshed &amp; exfoliated. The smell is minimal, but what little there is, is nice. It is a pretty peach color, so it looks good in the shower or on the bathroom vanity. A little goes a long way. My bottle lasted for months with daily usage. I found it terrific to use pre-moisturizer &amp; pre-makeup, as it gets rid of dry flaky skin AND unclogs pores all in one fell swoop. It didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts- actually, I had not one breakout the entire time I used my tube. A little pricy for me to consistently repurchase on my budget, but if you can afford to have it on hand regularly, definitely buy it. It is FARRRR superior to any other scrub I&#x27;ve used, with the exception of Lancome Exfoliance Confort, which I also love. I have dry, sensitive skin prone to mild acne here &amp; there. It may be a little \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot; for oilier skin, but it just depends on your particular preference.</li>
    <li> I love this face polish. It does a great job cleaning your skin without drying it out.</li>
    <li> This scrub is very effective, yet gentle enough on your skin that you can use it almost every day. Most scrubs are very abrasive so the best way to use them is 2-3 times a week. If you have very sensitive skin, you can still use this product every other day. It smells wonderful - a soft kind of peach. I just love it in general. It makes my skin oh-so-smooth and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I&#x27;ve repurchased this for myself, my sister, and even my boyfriend! It is on the expensive side though...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and everytime I use it, it makes my skin so smooth and soft.  There are other products that give similar results, but I like the fact that the polish is not that invasive nor rough to the skin.  Anyone who wants to have smoother skin, lessen their blackheads should really consider giving this a try.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product, it smells good, it&#x27;s gentle enough for daily use, and it leaves your face feeling so soft and smooth. If you are considering buying this then go ahead and do it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I had received a small sample sized tube of this with a purchase I had made from Sephora.  I gave it a try and WOW.  You can immediately tell that this is not your average exfoliator.  The little exfoliating bits are the perfect size to completely wipe away dead, dry skin without scratching and doing damage to your skin.  I have dry skin so I only use it about every other day.  It is a bit pricey but in my opinion, totally worth it.  Also, a little really does go a long way.     If you&#x27;re unsure about making the purchase, you should order it from Sephora because you can always return it to your local Sephora store.  (though I doubt that will be the case.)</li>
    <li> Tiny microscrubbers really make a difference. Face &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; indeed.</li>
    <li> This product works great without being too abrasive. The grains are really fine and gentle for a good scrub.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite skin scrub, it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used for years.  I worked in the skin care industry for a few years, and one thing I learned is that you have to be careful with some scrubs that contain a &#x27;natural exfoliant&#x27;, as the microscopic rough edges of these exfoliants can grab on to your pores.  This scrub uses tiny little wax beads, so they are perfectly smooth and glide over the skin.  I use this twice a week, I keep one in the shower and one by my sink.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> have loved this for a long time! just enough &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to really polish</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES A GREAT JOB, LEFT MY FACE FEELING SO CLEAN AND SMOOTH; I REALLY USED SO LITTLE , SO I KNOW THE TUBE WILL LAST A LONG TIME; I AM IN MY 70&#x27;S, WITH FAIRLY GOOD SKIN  AND THE FACE POLISH WILL HELP TO KEEP IT THAT WAY;  DID NOT FEEL TOO HARSH  AND GOT RID OF ALL THE DRY SKIN;</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product with something else I ordered a couple of years ago.  I&#x27;ve been ordering it ever since........It really does polish your face.  It only takes a small amount and it really does polish your face. Laura Mercier, please don&#x27;t stop making this product!!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a free gift after purchasing a butt-load of other Laura Mercier products at Macy&#x27;s.  I am in love.  I am 33 years old and have needed to use Proactive for the last 5-8 years because, lets face it, I had/have adult acne.  This works better than the Proactive ever did, leaves my face feeling smooth and soft, glowing, and perfectly moisturized.  It use it in conjunction with Laura Mercier primer and tinted moisturizer and wish I could go back and repeat my high-school years, just to erase the awful memories of &amp;#34;pizza face.&amp;#34;  Laura Mercier is the only woman for me, now and forever.</li>
    <li> Ive tried other exfoliating cleansers and none work as good as this polish.  Even with daily usemy skin does not dry out.</li>
    <li> This made my Face break out in ways like never before.</li>
    <li> Have used for only 2 months, so I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star YET, nor can I see any visible difference in my skin. It does, however, have a nice amount of moisture in it, so doesn&#x27;t drag on the skin when you massage your face. The granules are just a perfect size that don&#x27;t irritate, yet big enough to think they might be effective. It has a mild and very pleasant scent. But just &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; clean isn&#x27;t enough for a product of this price. It must perform, so I&#x27;ll be patient and give it the benefit of the doubt in the meantime.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product that I use at home, and especially when traveling -- sample size lasts a week -- in lieu of lugging a battery-operated face polisher. I have sensitive skin and LM Face Polish is gentle but thorough. It leaves my skin feeling clean and healthy. I especially look forward to using it when I travel: after a day getting whipped with industrial strength pollution, it&#x27;s a treat to clean off the grime with LMFP.</li>
    <li> great face polish , my wife loves it</li>
    <li> This scrub will change how you feel about washing your face.  I actually get excited to use it.  I first tried my friends and then had to buy my own. It brightens and smooths your face without drying and leaves a really nice scent.  Only a little bit is needed.  I use once a day to every other day and I have fairly sensitive skin.  I also use Philosophy&#x27;s purity, and can feel the difference in my skins texture when I massage it into my face.  A great find!</li>
    <li> After reading all the other reviews, I ordered this scrub.  Everyone was gushing about how wonderful it is, so I guess I had really high expectations.  It is a good scrub, no doubt, but it did not blow my mind and it most certainly did not do wonders for my skin.  It&#x27;s a good product, just not worth 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product works great, leaves my skin feeling very smooth. It is expensive though. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for weekly exfoliating and it&#x27;s not too harsh on the skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the feel and results of this face polish.  For context, I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have skin that is dry, sensitive and acne prone. Because of that, when I look for something to exfoliate my face I want something that will be effective at sloughing off dry skin, but without irritating my skin or causing my acne to flare up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub fits the bill.  The exfoliating particles are small enough that they don&#x27;t feel excessively rough or irritating on the skin, yet they still successfully scrub dead skin away.  I love how soft my skin feels after using this.  The base of this is also creamy and feels luxurious on the skin.  I also appreciate that the scent of this is very soft and neutral, perfect for those who don&#x27;t like heavily perfumed products.  As with any exfoliating product you have to be careful not to overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a fan of Laura Mercier or even if you&#x27;re new to the brand you&#x27;re sure to enjoy this scrub.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does a great job washing away dirt and pore clogging garbage. It&#x27;s not too harsh and leaves my skin SUPER soft and smooth. I use it a couple times a week. By far the best facial polish I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this somewhere and loved it so much I had to buy the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love everything about it, it&#x27;s a polish and that&#x27;s what it does. I&#x27;ve noticed how if I stop using it I get way more bumps. I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with coconut oil as moisturizer and my skin has been looking great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and still battling ever-changing acne on my face.  I originally got this as a sample from an order on Sephora, and it sat in my travel bag for a month before I went on the road... Boy did i regret not using this sooner!  The first thing that I noticed was that the \\&quot;beads\\&quot; in the product are not too big and not too small, nor are they too harsh or so fine that they seem ineffective.  I&#x27;ve used many different cleansers/face scrubs including everything from St. Ives to Proactive, to Dermalogica, to Philosophy, Lancome, Clarins... you name it.  This product blew all of them out of the water for me.  It has a very light fresh scent that I honestly didn&#x27;t notice until reading other reviews then going back to smell the product-- it&#x27;s pleasant.  The small bead-scrubbers leave your skin soft and clean but not dry, and not raw feeling like some exfoliators can do.  My husband even noticed after just a few uses that my skin was clearing up and told me that I looked radiant :)  It&#x27;s gentle enough for me to use every day; I have fairly sensitive skin but i still like to alternate in my regular cleanser 2-3 days a week to keep variety in my routine (my normal cleanser is DDF Advanced Micro-Exfoliating Cleanser, which i use with my Clairsonic Mia2 and until this seemed to be the only thing that kept my face from looking like I was back in high school).  The bottle itself lasts a VERY long time, and has siginificantly reduced my old acne scars to the point where I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wear foundation every day (score!).  I use this, alternating with Olay Regenerist and DDF Protect and Correct moisturizer and could not be happier with my results!</li>
