      <li>I love it --</li>
      <li>I love this color \\&quot; Chicago Champagne Toast.</li>
      <li>While it isn&#x27;t my favorite color, it is my favorite polish.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE OPI</li>
      <li>Love this color and love OPI.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite OPI color.  </li>
      <li>Chicago Champagne Toast is a gorgeous, deep almost mauve color that looks very nice with my medium skin tone.  </li>
      <li>Polish is the best ever, does not chip like other nail polish either.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>OPI nail polish applies easily and covers well.  </li>
      <li>This one seemed kind of clumpy for some reason, but the color is really pretty.</li>
      <li>and they givin smooth.</li>
      <li>But it didn&#x27;t go on as smooth as I was hoping.</li>
      <li>The polish applied smoothly and lasted 6 days before I noticed any chipping.  </li>
      <li>Love the color - just the right amount of purple tones....</li>
      <li>i keep up my hands and feet looking clean smooth and colorful.</li>
      <li>Came faster than expected and price is great.</li>
      <li>very rare color never see this before wearing it right now</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>This color is very pretty, like a fading sunset.</li>
      <li>It is a good nail polish, but does not hold for a long time.</li>
      <li>AND LOOKS GOOD FOR A LONG TIME.  </li>
      <li>Love OPI and the soft muted colors.</li>
      <li>OPI seems to have the right shades.  </li>
      <li>It is a beautiful deep mauvey shade - that is also shimmery and looks different depending on how you move your hands or feet.  </li>
      <li>I ordered several nail polish shades at one time and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Sure, I occassionally use another brand, but I ALWAYS come back to OPI!</li>
      <li>Pretty color.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with this color, It has become one of my regular colors.  </li>
      <li>Love the OPI colors and lasting capabilities.</li>
      <li>I love OPI polish... and especially this one!!  </li>
      <li>My local salon no longer carried this color and I love it</li>
      <li>This color looks better with my skin tone than some of the current colors out in the market.  </li>
      <li>such a rich glamour color--perfect for Those Events!</li>
      <li>The true colour is a more dark metalic lavender.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>so much for the fast delivery &amp; Amazon too.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Painted my own fingernails and then had my toes done at the shop last night in this same color!  </li>
      <li>My nail shop didn&#x27;t carry it anymore, so I brought my own when I went for my pedicure this past week, and now I&#x27;m wearing &amp;#34;Chicago Champagne Toast&amp;#34; again!</li>
      <li>It is very soft, but not sparkly  </li>
      <li>or if it is just an old bottle, but the color did not meet my expectations or match what was on my nails already!</li>
      <li>This is a pretty, shimmering medium pink.</li>
      <li>BUT WITH A LITTLE MORE PINK.  </li>
      <li>It does have some shine and is not as matte as some of the newer shades, but I like it as it has just the right amount of brown to tone down the pink.</li>

<li> OPI with a good base coat will last on me, over a week.</li>
<li> It is a neutral color with just enough pink to make it stand out from your skin.  </li>
<li> Arrived as expected.</li>
<li> Lacquer was as expected.  </li>

    <li> I ordered several nail polish shades at one time and this is my favorite. The color goes well with lots of things. Good color to have.</li>
    <li> This color is so fantastic!  It is a beautiful deep mauvey shade - that is also shimmery and looks different depending on how you move your hands or feet.  I love it -- but so does my teenage daughter -- surprising we would both like a nail polish, but that also shows what a great product the Opi Chicago Champagne Toast is!</li>
    <li> This was a gift. She loved it.</li>
    <li> This photo is obviously incorrect. The true colour is a more dark metalic lavender. I can never get enough of this polish.</li>
    <li> Love the color, product and price!</li>
    <li> Love the OPI colors and lasting capabilities.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color for the summer.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this color!  Nice lavender/pinkish tones to it.  Beautiful!  Painted my own fingernails and then had my toes done at the shop last night in this same color!  I am loving my nails today!  This is one I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> ~I absolutely love this colour.

    <li> Lovely color. Great price.</li>
    <li> such a rich glamour color--perfect for Those Events!</li>
    <li> Lacquer was as expected.  Arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> I love this color \\&quot; Chicago Champagne Toast. OPI seems to have the right shades.  This color is the perfect shade of mauve.</li>
    <li> great color. this is a good neutral color with a bit of shimmer and pop. it can be wore to work or for socializing. good quality.</li>
    <li> Hated this color! Was not for me.. Much more mauve then you see in the picture. Just a warning it&#x27;s not a shimmery pink..</li>
    <li> This is another color that I will use often.  It is very soft, but not sparkly  and I like bling!!</li>
    <li> Love the color - just the right amount of purple tones....</li>
    <li> Pretty color.  It&#x27;s hard to find colors with the pearl affect right now.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! I&#x27;m going to Chicago soon and plan a Champagne Toast for my hands and feet!</li>
    <li> My local salon no longer carried this color and I love it so I found it online and am very happy.</li>
    <li> Love OPI and the soft muted colors.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this color, It has become one of my regular colors.  A bit of a copperish bronze with a nice metallic, but not glittery shine As always, OPI makes a great product.</li>
    <li> What can I say .... OPI is excellent nail polish!!  OPI nail polish applies easily and covers well.  If you are looking for a quality nail polish, I recommend you try OPI.</li>
    <li> Love this color and love OPI.</li>
    <li> I HAVE WORN NOMADS DREAM FOR YEARS AND THIS WAS SO CLOSE BUT WITH A LITTLE MORE PINK.  I LOVE OPI AND I ALWAYS BUY OPI, IT HAS GOOD SHINE AND IT LASTS AND LOOKS GOOD FOR A LONG TIME.  THE SELECTION FROM THIS PROVIDER IS VERY GOOD. THE PRICE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN IN MY NAIL SHOP. I ALSO LIKE HAVING SEVERAL BOTTLES OF THE SAME COLOR SO I CAN ALWAYS HAVE ONE WITH ME AND AT HOME FOR A TOUCH UP OF AN ACCIDENT.</li>
    <li> I have trouble keeping polish on--for even a day. OPI with a good base coat will last on me, over a week. This is a pretty, shimmering medium pink. I like it.</li>
    <li> OPI is sure known to give great colors,decent prices, and along with a color your sure to love. I was impressed with the quality of the shipping so nothing would break. Along with the prompt arrival. The Chicago Champagne Toast color will be great for a toe polish. I might even wear it on my finger nails</li>
    <li> I love the color and the OPI brand is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is the best polish I have ever used.  It goes on beautifully and lasts for days.  This color is very pretty, like a fading sunset.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is awesome I just love it for summer winter whatever it satys on and no chipping.I would recomend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> great service - great polish - thanks</li>
    <li> Great color!  I got these as gifts and everyone loved it!</li>
    <li> But it didn&#x27;t go on as smooth as I was hoping. I have other opi polishes and they givin smooth. This one seemed kind of clumpy for some reason, but the color is really pretty.</li>
    <li> I have never seen this color before. It is really a great shade. I really like it. Order and delivery could not have been easier</li>
    <li> The color shown on the site is not what I received. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a bad batch from OPI or if it is just an old bottle, but the color did not meet my expectations or match what was on my nails already!</li>
    <li> I have looked for this OPI color for a while and finally found it online.  This color looks better with my skin tone than some of the current colors out in the market.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a mauvy shade. It does have some shine and is not as matte as some of the newer shades, but I like it as it has just the right amount of brown to tone down the pink.</li>
    <li> It is a good nail polish, but does not hold for a long time. You have to use a top coat otherwise it will not hold longer then a day.</li>
    <li> Stays on longer than other nail polish.</li>
    <li> love the color. covers well.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this color!</li>
    <li> Love the polish!  My nail shop didn&#x27;t carry it anymore, so I brought my own when I went for my pedicure this past week, and now I&#x27;m wearing &amp;#34;Chicago Champagne Toast&amp;#34; again!</li>
    <li> While it isn&#x27;t my favorite color, it is my favorite polish.  Sure, I occassionally use another brand, but I ALWAYS come back to OPI!</li>
    <li> Beautiful cover and durability.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite OPI color.  It is a neutral color with just enough pink to make it stand out from your skin.  This is a color that can be worn with any outfit and any skin color. This is a MUST have color for any nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite color YEARS AGO.  I was very happy that I found it online.  I don&#x27;t remember it being this dark, but I still like the color.</li>
    <li> I love OPI polish... and especially this one!!  I haven&#x27;t found any I like better for my toes.  It&#x27;s just beautiful... PERFECT.</li>
