      <li>Omg best stuff in the world</li>
      <li>and they were talking about the best lotion to help with chapped skin that I decided to get some.  </li>
      <li>THE PRODUCT IS GREAT!</li>
      <li>Good, non greasy product.</li>
      <li>but as soon as you wash or shower, you need to apply again and in the winter months, you are winning a losing battle!?  </li>
      <li>My favorite hand lotion of all time!</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t&#x27;t have an overpowering scent, It is a light &#x27;clean&#x27; scent that is quite pleasant.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until reading on a FB Cast Iron Cooking page (with over 100,000 members), many of whom are cowboys, and ranch hands, etc</li>
      <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve found for rough, scratched hands.</li>
      <li>Fantastic for a retail salesperson.</li>
      <li>Corn Buskers Lotion is a great lotion for extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>i should fill a bath tub full and just sink in like jello mold</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get that part, but for me, it seems true.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s only as good as the time it&#x27;s on there,</li>
      <li>Order was packed well and received quickly, too.</li>
      <li>Hands did not crack for the first time in YEARS!</li>
      <li>An old time favorite that still does the job.</li>
      <li>This lotion has a pleasant scent and it really does heal rough skin...</li>
      <li>Works great on dry rough hands.</li>
      <li>One of the best products for rough skin I have ever used, and is hard to find in stores in my area.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
      <li>Well, my hands have actually STAYED soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
      <li>My dad and brother would use this in the early 40&#x27;s when they really PICKED CORN</li>
      <li>And, if you wash your hands a lot because of your job (doctor, nurse, teacher, etc) or simply because you do (!), then you&#x27;ll love that this is non-greasy or slippery, but also that it seems to penetrate and really actually eliminate the dryness and chapped skin.</li>
      <li>I could not believe how instantly it made my hands, arms and legs as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
      <li>This lotion leaves your skin soft and deeply moisturize without oily residue!</li>
      <li>However, buyer beware that like many products, if you seek you will find (a lower price elsewhere) &amp; in this case, it can be had for less than half at your local WalMart.</li>

<li> Sorry when they quit selling it in my local stores.</li>
<li> I really don&#x27;t use slot of lotion as I really hate the oily feeling other hand lotions leave behind!</li>

    <li> did nothing for my cracked finger tips</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband since he wanted this. He loves using Corn Huskers on his hands and he likes the smell.</li>
    <li> Omg best stuff in the world i should fill a bath tub full and just sink in like jello mold</li>
    <li> FYI: THE PRODUCT IS GREAT! However, buyer beware that like many products, if you seek you will find (a lower price elsewhere) &amp; in this case, it can be had for less than half at your local WalMart.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve found for rough, scratched hands.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand lotion of all time! Keeps my dry hands from snagging delicate fabrics, and leaves NO GREASE on clothes. Fantastic for a retail salesperson. Order was packed well and received quickly, too.</li>
    <li> Good, non greasy product. An old time favorite that still does the job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a classic. Works great on dry rough hands. There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s been around for years, it&#x27;s a lotion that works.</li>
    <li> My dad and brother would use this in the early 40&#x27;s when they really PICKED CORN&lt;br /&gt;The team pulled the wagon and the men walked the rows and threw the corn in the wagon.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when they came from the field their hands were bleeding. They also wore extra gloves under the leather gloves. History!!</li>
    <li> Why did I forget all about Corn Huskers? It wasn&#x27;t until reading on a FB Cast Iron Cooking page (with over 100,000 members), many of whom are cowboys, and ranch hands, etc and they were talking about the best lotion to help with chapped skin that I decided to get some.  Oh, my goodness! I could not believe how instantly it made my hands, arms and legs as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt! And get this, it seemed to STAY that way! I don&#x27;t get that part, but for me, it seems true. You know how you apply lotion and it&#x27;s only as good as the time it&#x27;s on there, but as soon as you wash or shower, you need to apply again and in the winter months, you are winning a losing battle!?  Well, my hands have actually STAYED soft and smooth.  Anyway, I recommend. And, if you wash your hands a lot because of your job (doctor, nurse, teacher, etc) or simply because you do (!), then you&#x27;ll love that this is non-greasy or slippery, but also that it seems to penetrate and really actually eliminate the dryness and chapped skin.</li>
    <li> Used it for years. Sorry when they quit selling it in my local stores. I will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a pleasant scent and it really does heal rough skin...</li>
    <li> Bought this for the winter months as I&#x27;m outside at work when need be. Hands did not crack for the first time in YEARS! I still use it and it lasts a LONG time as only a little is required to cover the entire hand area.</li>
    <li> One of the best products for rough skin I have ever used, and is hard to find in stores in my area. Shipping took about 4 weeks though!</li>
    <li> Corn Buskers Lotion is a great lotion for extremely dry skin. I really don&#x27;t use slot of lotion as I really hate the oily feeling other hand lotions leave behind! This lotion leaves your skin soft and deeply moisturize without oily residue! It also doesn&#x27;t&#x27;t have an overpowering scent, It is a light &#x27;clean&#x27; scent that is quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing that works on my dry, cracked hands. I tried everything. Coconut oil, lotions, etc. Nothing worked. I worked in a bakery and was washing dishes a lot. This saved my hands!</li>
