<li> Rating not appropriate - just pure admiration.</li>
<li> Guerlain EDP smells much nicer than EDT more of base contents than alcohol in EDT&#x27;s.</li>
<li> But in the last few years the guerlain representatives told me that aux de perfume wasn&#x27;t being imported into the United States, and the strongest habit rouge strength they all had was the toilette water, that had barely any scent at all.</li>
<li> /&gt;Shipping was a little bit messy</li>
<li> /&gt;Given this taste, the smell of talcum this colony generates a shock in my nose that I could not overcome.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of talc is very strong and sometimes disgusting.</li>
<li> Has you can determine based on fragrance reviews, this is somewhat complex</li>
<li> fragrance is not for the faint of heart.</li>

    <li> Nice, spicy, wintery scent with great projection and longevity.</li>
    <li> One of my new favorite fragrances. A very sexy, professional smell. This would be a great choice for a signature scent. I love that this was originally formulated in 1965.</li>
    <li> This is the most classy and delicious men&#x27;s perfume ever.&lt;br /&gt;I will never change it, it&#x27;s so unique and alluring.&lt;br /&gt;Citric, flowery and spicy like no other.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was a little bit messy but I finally got it.&lt;br /&gt;Love Amazon!</li>
    <li> Wooody, sweet, long last, there´s something you get used on the smell and then you really love it. I stared with one splash and now I just need to force myself to stop, it´s addictive.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance</li>
    <li> I find this a very nice scent in a cool climate here in the Pacific NW and for an older person my age (60+).  Keith Richards wears this for goodness sake - hahahaha.  The price is not bad for a quality men&#x27;s perfume like this one. My wife loves this.  It clearly conveys quality, maturity, style. Has you can determine based on fragrance reviews, this is somewhat complex so I will not try to describe here.  It has a very good silage but is not overpowering by any means.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using habit rouge aux de perfume since I was a teenager. Traditionally I would go to a department store that had a guerlain counter. But in the last few years the guerlain representatives told me that aux de perfume wasn&#x27;t being imported into the United States, and the strongest habit rouge strength they all had was the toilette water, that had barely any scent at all. Therefore I was happy to order and recieve the aux de perfume from amazon.</li>
    <li> The blend of old wonderful things of history, art, architecture in the midst of a vibrant up to date population. The thing is, you don&#x27;t choose Habit Rouge, Habit Rouge chooses you. And If you are chosen you are so very lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is not for the faint of heart. It is a rich, riveting and romantic call to only the bravest of the brave who are not afraid of embracing tradition with a flair for the unusual and a great joy for living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A legend, classic and forever, timeless perfume. Rating not appropriate - just pure admiration.</li>
    <li> I wanted this fragrance for quite a while, love the smell of it, a friend introduced it to me and after I got it I recognized the smell very well. Guerlain EDP smells much nicer than EDT more of base contents than alcohol in EDT&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to be used during my non-Creed days. I like it and have had good compliments from women.</li>
    <li> Ordered Eau de Parfum, got Eau de Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is obviously a scam.</li>
    <li> Love it; my husband favorite perfume</li>
    <li> Good but not what it was 25 years ago.</li>
    <li> Good price for a good cologne.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find out this was in fact the real deal, I am a satisfied customer indeed. I will certainly purchase this again if It is still at a good price.</li>
    <li> My taste for the Eau De Toilette is by acid  and Woods scents. Cyprus is another scent that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;Given this taste, the smell of talcum this colony generates a shock in my nose that I could not overcome.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of talc is very strong and sometimes disgusting. My wife could not stand the smell and threw it away three quarters of a bottle.</li>
    <li> Arrived when promisedand packaged well. This fragrance has not changed over the years and I am very pleased with it.</li>
