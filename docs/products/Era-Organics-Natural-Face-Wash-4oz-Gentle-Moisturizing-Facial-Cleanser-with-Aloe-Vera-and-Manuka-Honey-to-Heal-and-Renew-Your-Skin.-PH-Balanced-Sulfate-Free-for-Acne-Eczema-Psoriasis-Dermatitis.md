      <li>Still waiting for the perfect cure for the dermatitis and still battling some redness, but this face wash is gentle and soothing and my face is noticeably smoother.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little under a week. This is the first face wash I&#x27;ve tried that hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin. My skin has never looked so good - though, I am pairing it with a few other things so I&#x27;m not sure that I can fairly give this wash full credit.</li>
    <li> Another great product!! I use the soap with the complete cream and it makes my face so soft and cleared me up. I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother me at all!! Tyler the seller is great and I would highly recommend his products!!</li>
    <li> This product is great! Leaves my skin feeling super smooth. Is a very gentle cleanser and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! I had been struggling with dry, acne prone skin (w/ bonus perioral dermatitis) for a while trying to find the right combination of products to keep my skin happy. This is the first of Era Organics&#x27; products that I tried and I&#x27;m so happy that I found it. My skin has been generally clearer and much more hydrated. I started using this face wash around the time I was diagnosed with perioral dermatitis and started taking antibiotics. I have since stopped the antibiotics and am happy to report that this face wash does not give me acne or dermatitis flare ups. It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been so great, in fact, that I have tried several of their other products and love them all too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very good luck with face washes/creams, but based on the good reviews I thought I would give this and their face cream a try.  My skin is very sensitive and always red (I&#x27;ve never been officially diagnosed, but pretty certain I have rosacea), and no face wash/cream I&#x27;ve ever tried has made any difference.  After just a few days of using this face wash/face cream combo only once a day in the morning, I could already see a difference!  I&#x27;ve had such little luck in the past that I started wondering &amp;#34;is it really the ERA Organics stuff, or am I just having a good week?&amp;#34;  Then I went on a vacation for almost a week and forgot to bring it, and my bright red face let me know that it was indeed this wash and cream doing the trick.  For the first time I have finally found something that makes a difference in the redness in my face and it&#x27;s organic and all natural to boot!  Hallelujah!</li>
    <li> I loved the product. First of all, it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It is really hard to find the right cleanser for me because most of them tend to dry out my skin. So this one was a win for me because my skin felt refreshed and clean. I do recommend this product to people with sensitive skin, and to those who value natural organic ingredients in the product which guarantee that their skin won&#x27;t get any irritation.</li>
    <li> I used this as a body wash and I was pleased with it. Its not too thick and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. It rinsed off clean and that is one thing that is important to me. Also I am very sensitive to scent. This has no scent, so I was very glad for that.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and razor bump prone. After shaving i applied day bump stop. I just this face wash not only it completely cleans my face. It stops hair bumps. I recommend it to all skin types.</li>
    <li> Love the ERA Organics facial cleanser! As someone who does not usually go for fragrance-free, I am very happy with the ever-so-subtle cucumber-y freshness of this silky cleansing serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never experienced such a gentle cleanser that left my skin so thoroughly clean.  Truly the highest quality that gives that spa-pampered feeling.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin...unfortunately, I developed a rash along my jawline after using this face wash.  While I&#x27;m sure it works for many, this product is just not for me.  HOWEVER, Era Organics customer service was refreshing!  The person I dealt with was pleasant and refunded the purchase promptly after I described the situation.  I will definitely check out their other products.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is working wonders for my face.  I have noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out nearly as much as my old cleanser.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> Leaves my face clean and smooth. Perfect partner of the complete moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for about a week and I love it so far. I love that it is 100% natural and it has really diminished my blackheads when nothing else has. I also love that it&#x27;s PH balanced- very important.</li>
    <li> Using this facial wash was pleasant it did not dry my skin out like most I&#x27;ve used in the past and the scent was mild it made my skin feel clean yet not dry and tight.. truly recommend this to anyone who like organic natural stuff  o harsh chemicals in this one... thanks for letting me try it... the price was great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s winter and my skin is acting up. No shock there as I have very thin, dry skin which is prone to acne. Upon searching for a gentle cleanser, I came upon this option and rather liked the amount of information as well as the claim it could help with skin irritations. It seems odd to me that the majority of the reviews here are from users who were given the product free of charge. A good number of reviews state that this product lathers so well and creates a rich foam which I don&#x27;t believe for a second. After using this product I can say this DOES NOT lather AT ALL. It&#x27;s a very runny, watery liquid. I feel like I&#x27;m making my skin more read by trying to rub a watery liquid into my skin to clean it. Using this in the shower is sort of a joke. A reviewer stated that they only needed a dime size amount to thoroughly clean their face. After reading this and using the product, my eyes hurt from rolling so hard. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is clean but time will tell. I plan to update after a while of use but my first impression is not good. There is no decernable smell. What also makes these products and claims seem deceptive is the fact that another company, DermaChange, offers the same exact products on Amazon at different prices in bigger sizes. Is this company and their formulas just a cash grab hidden behind an organic front? To make matters even MORE fishy is the fact that when a user asks a question about the product, the company is the first to reply. I feel that asking a question about a product is a way fro me to gather information from CUSTOMERS who aren&#x27;t paid to comment. Having the company automatically respond is a dirty tactic in my opinion. There is an avenue for customers to contact companies and I think that should be respected.   JUST FOUND ANOTHER COMPANY ON AMAZON SELLING THIS PRODUCT. Wild Naturals and DermaChange offer the same formulas.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I have sensitive skin and have to be careful about what products I use on my skin. This stuff is fantastic, leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; refreshed because it&#x27;s not stripping my skin of vital nutrients the way some harsh soaps do. Also, I like the fact that it contains Manuka Honey and Aloe Vera which are clinically proven to stimulate your skin&#x27;s immune system and keep your skin well hydrated. It nourishes cells and restores your body&#x27;s natural Ph levels. I use it everyday since I got it &amp; I love it!</li>
    <li> A good cleanser that cleans but still doesn&#x27;t dry out you skin. It contains Aloe and Manuka honey. I am a fan of Monuka honey and so many products are using it now because of all the benefits of this honey. The cleanser washes away all the makeup and dirt and grime and leave skin clean but not uneasy tight. It has taken it&#x27;s place in my arsenal of face washes.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive and dry skin so i am reluctant to try anything new on my face. I had heard some good things about this product so i thought i would give it a try.  I am so glad it did. Era Organics facial cleanser cleaned by face without leaving any residue and withought tightening my skin. I loved the way it made my skin feel and i didnt feel any burning like i sometimes do with other cleanser. I will be repurchasing this thats for sure.</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  It was a bit more than I usually pay, but it&#x27;s wonderful.  You only need a little and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.  I have very sensitive skin and this works well for me.</li>
    <li> Very good natural product!</li>
    <li> I have the sensitive &amp;#34;Asian&amp;#34; skin where anything I use I break out or my face never feels completely clean. After using this Era Organics natural face wash my face feels so much cleaner and my break outs is no more! I love the fact that this face wash is all natural and do not have those harsh chemicals drying out my face. I am also using this as my body wash and I have noticed my dry patch areas like my elbows and knees are no longer dry and my skin tone from my face, to my legs are looking healthier and smoother. My husband is also noticing the healthy change and has told me my skin feels softer and looks better. A little of this wash does go a long way. I highly recommend this to anyone with skin issues looking for a wash without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for 2 weeks now and it does not burn, itch, or even sting. The only issue I have with it is that it leaves my skin very dry after applying and rinsing my face. I was hopeful that it would do the opposite, but it unfortunately did not. My skin is already extremely dry and flaky, along with having Rosacea so I am now searching for another product. Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I am always trying products, searching to find a good one. So when I tried this, I was really happy with the results! I have sensitive skin, mild eczema and dry skin. I also have really rough skin on my feet so I really require something that is gentle on all skin issues. This definitely fit the bill! It is made with all natural products including honey and aloe to soothe, heal and revitalize the skin! It gently cleaned my skin. It did not leave my skin oily, greasy or leave and film. I didn&#x27;t feel dry when I got out or like my skin needed to be lotioned up right away like most cleansers do. I actually was surprised bc I thought this made my skin softer!  I am happy to have recieved this item to review! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  It&#x27;s light and refreshing. Leaves my skin so smooth that a few times I&#x27;ve forgotten to use moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The operative word to describe this product is NEUTRAL! Except maybe the bottle, there ain&#x27;t nothing \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; about it! I suppose it has what could be described as a scent, a more or less NEUTRAL one, certainly no added perfumes to enhance it, AND THAT&#x27;S NOT A BAD THING! If just applying with your hands it foams little more than water. It seems truly all natural and NEUTRAL to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly prefer to use it after the \\&quot;E-ra\\&quot; Dead Sea mud, because my face really feels brand new and I don&#x27;t want to alter the effect with an inferior cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t seem to have any allergies to anything I&#x27;ve experimented with on my face this last year, certainly I&#x27;ve had no reactions... yet. And though I&#x27;m not a dermatologist,I do know how to spell it, so I feel confident in saying that if YOU are one of those people with hyper-sensitive skin that reacts negativity to just about everything, this product MAY be exactly what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who has really bad eczema. She used it the first day on just her face to see if we noticed a difference. The next morning her face was noticeably less inflamed, and her skin was smooth and even toned. This stuff works, although pricey for the size. But with that being said, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price. It works!</li>
    <li> Love this product ! Fast shipping ! My skin has never looked or felt better . Thank you Era Organics. I will definitely recommend you to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> I really like what it do to my face</li>
    <li> great product, great servie</li>
    <li> Love the face wash...so gentle....I have very sensitive skin and this face wash is non irritating....leaves my skin soft and non irritated...would definitely purchase again...and Era Organics reaches out to the consumer...I nice touch....I like the fact that this is a natural product....glad I made this purchase....</li>
    <li> I have been using this in conjunction with the Relief Cream for my facial eczema. So far using these two products has been the only thing to bring relief after about 6+ months of this problem and start healing my irritated skin. I am sensitive to a lot of traditional products, so finding this was a great thing! This face wash leaves my face feeling smooth and clean. It does not irritate my eczema like all the other face washes I have tried has. I have just ordered the mud mask in hopes of helping my acne. My only gripe is the price, I wish it was a little lower or offered in a larger size for a slight discount per oz. Hope they come out with more products!</li>
    <li> Wow finally found a cleanser that&#x27;s gentle and works will always order from here shipping was so fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It has cleared my skin, and helped me with a case of  mild blepharitis. I use it in my morning shower to gently clean my eyelids, and have seen a marked improvement in the condition of my eyelids. I am also very impressed with customer service, and that&#x27;s an important part of any product I buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for something that used all natural ingredients. This has far exceeded my expectations. I had extremely dry, itchy skin and no matter what I tried it just wasn&#x27;t going away. I used this for probably about 3 days before I could see a noticeable difference in the dry skin on my nose and forehead. I use this on my Clarisonic and when I am done my face feels extremely soft and clean. I am so happy to not have itchy, flaky skin anymore and I was very surprised how great this product was. My friend decided to buy it after I told her how much I loved it and she can&#x27;t get over it either. Definitely a great purchase!</li>
    <li> This is the only cleanser that has actually worked with my problematic skin, and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout it keeps my skin nice and clear. The only downside I would say is I wish the bottle was bigger for the price you pay. Other than that thi product is a must in my skincare routine! And the ingredients are natural!</li>
    <li> I have to wash my face with this twice to remove my makeup. Also, I have to use a ton. I do like the product but for the price and quantity I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a high quality product,  working very well on the combination skin with high sensitivity to everything that is not natural.</li>
    <li> This is not for oily/combination skin because whenever I use it, it gave me pimples on my face. But, I really like their other body cream product.</li>
    <li> I have had a struggle with blepharitis and eczema. My face was red and scaly and my eyelids swollen and sore. I ordered this cleanser as I couldn&#x27;t find a cleanser that didn&#x27;t burn. After washing my face and eyelids, this cleanser did not burn, and my skin felt moisturized and not taut and dry. I also use the Relief cream, and will never be without them again. I  am so glad I found this company, the products are excellent and the customer service is topnotch. I am very pleased and will be reordering.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make me feel clean after using.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have really sensitive skin and this seems to be very gentle and moisturizing too.</li>
    <li> Excellent facewash! Very gentle on the skin and their customer service is fantastic. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have adult acne....luckily I found this product....my face is clear and I swear my wrinkles are less noticeable! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Wish the face wash came in a bigger bottle! The moisturizer feels like you have nothing on. It&#x27;s so light! Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like my old one.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash I ever used. My face feels soft, smooth and clean. It&#x27;s a small bottle but a little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t use it to remove make up though. I think I&#x27;ll be using this cleanser for a long time and I would recommend to anyone of any age or gender.</li>
    <li> Great daily cleanser, but would still need to use an exfoliate cleanser occasionally too. If you use it on your Clarisonic it works great!</li>
    <li> My daughter (13) has very sensitive skin.  This cleanser works well for her. It has not eliminated blackheads but it makes her skin glow and appears to be very good for her skin.  I plan to try it myself because of how healthy her skin looks and because of the pure ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is a new must have for my daily routine, it is gentle and does not dry out my skin but still gets it sqeaky clean. I have super sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out at all. (I have normal to dry skin)</li>
    <li> Cleanses well. Doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry. Feels good</li>
    <li> I liked the face wash... it makes me feel fresh and my skin looks clear post the wash.</li>
    <li> Broke me out. Do not buy if you have severe acne.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that truly does what it says and claim...perfection in a bottle..im a black man with oily prone break out skin...this cleanser is a GOD send...i hope it never goes out of business or change the ingredients...its perfection! !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a soap person my whole life so this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a face wash consistently. It&#x27;s very creamy, and a little goes a long way. Works great!</li>
    <li> Been through a lot of cleaners and this is the only one that keeps my face clear :) It&#x27;s a bit expensive for how much you get though.</li>
    <li> This would be especially good for dry skin; it&#x27;s almost too much for my skin, but it&#x27;s soothing, especially in the winter. It has a sort of neutral odor, not perfumey, and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Nice gently soap.  Keeps my face soft and supple! :)  Happy with this product!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t further irritate my skin and left it super soft. But i prefer the tea tree soap i had been using. I get really dirty some days and I felt my soap was a tad better at getting the grime off my face. Other than that it is a great gentle face wash.</li>
    <li> Just bought so I am trying if.</li>
    <li> No my face broke out so bad !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use another brands ( Derma change ) skin treat face lotion with Manuka honey . had no issues with the ingredients in a product</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I wish it came in a much larger size as I use it on my entire body. I will never need another cleanser</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through hundreds of face wash products to find one that actually works. This not only made my skin clearer than it has ever been, but it feel softer and healthier as well. This truly works wonders, and you can feel and see a difference in less than a week. I have the moisturizer as well and i can&#x27;t leave the house without applying it or I can tell the difference (especially in the harsh winter winds). Highly reccomend both the wash and the moisturizer. It has a higher cost than others but nothing compares to the quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the moisturizer after battling an under eye dermatitis reaction to another &amp;#34;organic botanical&amp;#34; product purchased here on Amazon. I had been battling this rash on my delicate under eye skin for 3 months! It looked awful and the only thing that helped was steroid cream from a doctor, but every time I stopped using it the rash would come back worse. I was having a viscous steroid rebound cycle! I had stopped using the steroid cream for about 4 days and the rash was returning as usual right when these products came in the mail. Instead of starting the steroid cream again I used only these two products and it stalled the rash progression for the first two days, and over the next 3-4 days I could tell it was better! It&#x27;s been a week and I expect it to be fully gone in one more week. I&#x27;ll update in another 1-2 weeks on if it is still helping. I also have sporadic jawline acne that I&#x27;m hoping it helps as well.</li>
    <li> This face wash doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  I like it so much I just ordered two more bottles.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks, and my face has cleared up significantly.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week and I love the product. I love that it is scent free. It feels very high quality and really helps to moisturize my skin. The aloe vera and manuka honey really work well together to leave my skin feeling like a million bucks. My skin is pretty sensitive so I was excited to find this one does not irritate at all, probably because its made with organic ingredients and sulfate free etc. I just know it works and I love it. My husband and my baby use it too</li>
    <li> Keeps its promise&lt;br /&gt;This product indeed works as it promises. I had a little irritation on my skin before I used this. It helped me reduce the redness and itchiness overnight. Plus it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. If I had a chance, I would give it a 10 star. I think aloe vera and manuka honey combination makes it perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin on my face so having a wash without a bunch of chemicals is big for me. I am Really enjoying this face/body wash. There is no scent at all, which is great for face washes. One thing that is important to note is if you are expecting lots of bubbles, you won&#x27;t get that. I have found this true in a lot of natural soaps as they don&#x27;t contain the chemical that creates the bubbles. If you are used to bubbles this may take a bit of getting used to, but once you do it won&#x27;t bother you. You don&#x27;t need the bubbles to get clean. I am only using this on my face at the moment. It makes my face feel very clean but not tight like it&#x27;s too dry. Great face/body wash!</li>
    <li> Having skin that is quite sensitive, I was really excited to try out a new product that is not only  organic, sulfate free, paraben free, fragrance free, and without harsh chemicals or preservatives, but effective at the same time. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;The first wash, my skin did sting a bit, I&#x27;ll admit. The next few, though, everything seems to be going great! In fact, my only qualms with this product lie with the fact that it TRULY is fragrance free, so doesn&#x27;t give off a, uh, very pleasant scent. That really doesn&#x27;t really matter to me, though, if it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, so far I am loving it and I can already see some improvement in the appearance of my skin!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. I use it as a face wash and it does a great job at cleaning my face, yet it doesn&#x27;t strip it of moisture. Brilliant!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it does not dry my face like the other so called gentle cleansers. Using all natural products is not really true in this products look at the ingredient list. I also need to use a ton of it to cover my face entirely and i think a lot of people who wrote a review on here agree with this point. The reason for that is because the product doesn&#x27;t have any foaming agents which is great of course. As far as the acne (I suffer from acne since 16), I think it helped a little, but I don&#x27;t see major differences (yet) though and I still breakout and continue using benzyl peroxide. I am not sure if I will buy it again but if I were to stick with it it would be because it has really great natural ingredients (specially manuka honey which i absolute love) in it and the price is great. I love their face moisturizer cream, not this face wash as much</li>
    <li> This stuff is my absolute favorite facial wash! It leaves my skin feeling soft, supple and refreshed! Washes all my make up off perfectly! Not irritating to my skin, which is very dry and sensitive. My skin was so dry and flakey and this stuff works fabulously! I would highly recommend this to anyone. Works great, smells good and moisturizes too. I Love it!</li>
    <li> this really works, And does not cause any breakout or pimple unlike other products</li>
    <li> I used this product first on my face with makeup and it worked great.  I didnt have to use a makeup remover and I found it to work well without scrubbing my face off.  It has a soft texture and lathered up nice without water.  My face felt clean but not stripped of natural oils.  I have sensitive skin and this product is by far the best I have used on my face for cleansing.</li>
    <li> While this cleanser does not get as soap sudsy as other cleansers do, it most definitely removes even the most stubborn eye makeup and leaves my face feeling clean but not overly clean or dry.  A little does go a long way so I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a cleanser that is pure, simple and effective.</li>
    <li> Real good&lt;br /&gt;Good for acne&lt;br /&gt;The skin becomes soft&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> Only been using for a few weeks but so far so good.  Leaves skin feeling clean but not dry.  I have sensitive skin and it has been fine for me.</li>
    <li> This face wash makes my skin feel so clean, yet not dry.  I have dry patches of skin that have completely cleared up after one week of use of this product followed by same company moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It broke my 7 mth old son with ezcema face out real bad when the product said its good for babies with eczema it do not work it burned him bad. I don&#x27;t think this product was made for African American babies...but I used it on my face it get it clean but you have to use so much just to get a good lather the cost of product is too high should have been $8 instead of $20. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I find this face wash no more effective than those sold in brick and mortar stores.  My skin is extremely sensitive with dry areas.  I purchased this after reading many reviews.  It seemed to be highly rated, but I am not impressed.  I have since ordered Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Recovery Softening Cream Cleaner. It&#x27;s a huge 16 ounce bottle, and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle, but had to order a second bottle. I never want to be without Paula&#x27;s Choice. If they ever make the decision to discontinue Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Recovery, I will inquire as to whether I can purchase a 55 gallon drum.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Have a couple of Era Ogranic products and they are great!&lt;br /&gt;Tried all other brands one can think of (or see advertised) and none can compare.</li>
    <li> overall happy with this product. I have sensitive skin on my face and I dont like using just anything. this was gently and left my skin feeling clean but not &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; like some cleaners do. I bought the face lotion too that they make, it was also super gentle on my skin and absorbed naturally, didnt feel greasy or heavy at all. I have redness to certain area of my face, i feel like the cleanser and lotion together are helping reduce that in my skin. NOte, i dont have problem skin, its relatively on the dry side so i cant speak for its ability to clear up acne/pimples.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on the HCG diet, and it is the only wash that did not terribly dry out my skin or interfere with the HCG protocol.  Highly recommend; gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a cleansing system for sensitive skin. I came across this face &amp; body wash by Era Organics. It&#x27;s formulated for sensitive skin and is also recommended for people who deal with PSORIASIS, ECZEMA, DERMATITIS, ACNE and more without causing pain or irritation. Another reason I opted to try this is because they do not test on animals. :-) It&#x27;s also 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser contains aloe vera and manuka honey. I&#x27;m starting to see more and more products with this honey. As with other products I&#x27;ve tried with manuka honey, I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell. It&#x27;s not bad, i just don&#x27;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe Barbadensis Gel, Cocamidalpropyl Betaine, Glycerine (vegetable derived), Polysorbate 80, Leptospermum Scoparium (Manuka Honey), Tocopheryl Acetate, Centipeda Cunninghamii (Cehami), Gluconolactone, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tapioca Starch, Cellulose Gum, Xanthan Gum, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this cleanser on my face only for 5 days. Aside from the smell I was impressed.The smell, I can&#x27;t explain it. It&#x27;s not unpleasant. It&#x27;s just not to my liking. A super strong honey scent maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinsed clean, no residue and my face felt super clean. It didn&#x27;t dry out. I didn&#x27;t feel I need to rush and put on my moisturizer. Up to a few days after I stopped using it, my skin remained clear and felt good. I plan on trying moisturizer from this brand so I&#x27;m hoping that by combining the two I&#x27;ll have amazing skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it less than a week, but I can already tell a difference. Also very impressed with their customer service- small, family owned company determined to impress! I highly recommend trying their products.</li>
    <li> i just received the cleanser with the moisturizer and i really love these products.    really.    not just like, but love.    i switched from using Alba Botanica to Era Organics and i&#x27;m so much happier!    my skin is so much happier!    Era Organics is blessedly fragrance free which is good news for me because i&#x27;m allergic to some essential oils (especially lavender) that cause my skin and eyes to burn, swell, and turn red.    i like having cleanser and moisturizer that are made from the same company because skincare works at the cellular level and i don&#x27;t want the formulas to clash.  sometimes even this doesn&#x27;t work for me.    thankfully, Era Organics loves my skin.    no stinging or burning the whole day.  that&#x27;s a first in a really long time.    after i use the cleanser, my face doesn&#x27;t tighten up like it always does with other products.    i still need the moisturizer but at least my face isn&#x27;t stripped and hurting before i put it on.    thank you Era Organics!</li>
    <li> Era organics is a gentle face cleaner that is odorless and perfect for anyone with allergies or looking for a more natural cleaner. My skin is very sensitive. This product works great to cleanse and leaves my face feeling fresh and moisturized. Because it is sulfate free it doesn&#x27;t really froth/bubble when you use it but you still walk away with a clean feeling. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser in conjunction with the Relief Cream for my mom who suffers from rosacea.  She was using Oil of Olay Cleanser for Sensitive Skin and a prescription cream from her doctor with little to no results...redness, itching, scaly patches and blisters.  I first bought her the Relief Cream and she saw such an improvement that I bought her the cleanser.  She loves it!  The blisters on her nose are gone and there are only a couple of dry patches left.  I&#x27;m now going to purchase the cleanser and Complete Cream for my 26-yr-old daughter so she can have beautiful skin for the rest of her life.  Highly recommend Era Organics products!  And in an age of crappy customer service, theirs is stellar.  The owner of the company personally emailed me to find out if I was happy with the product; I was blown away.  Give their products a try.</li>
    <li> This face wash is pretty amazing! I found it while searching Amazon for sulfate and paraben-free face products to combat my perioral dermatitis. While expensive, a little goes a long way and my skin felt clearer, smoother and softer after just one washing. In the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using the face wash, I&#x27;ve continued to see similar results and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Still waiting for the perfect cure for the dermatitis and still battling some redness, but this face wash is gentle and soothing and my face is noticeably smoother. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> This is the first cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used that made my skin feel so incredibly soft. Most cleansers strip the skin, and the moisturizer adds the softness. This product is amazing in that it cleans and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Thank you thank you thank you for a product that actually does what it says it will do!! I absolutely love this cleanser and my skin has never looked or felt better! I use it on my face as well as in the shower and I could not ask for a better organic product! It washes off cleanly and leaves absolutely no residue behind! My skin looks and feels fresher, younger and hydrated. I use this cleanser in combination with the relief cream and dead sea mud mask and what a trio it is!!  It is so nice to know my skin is healthy and the product I am using is all natural and not the chemical laden garbage you get from other products. I am trying to go as organic as I can and these products are perfect!! I have used it for months now and  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Previously used Clinique, however I now have a new favorite... this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t smell like a bucket of chemicals which is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Very nice, gently foaming facial and body wash. Doesn&#x27;t burn or have a harsh chemical smell.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!  It is hypoallergenic and great for my sensitive skin.  It has no alcohol, no mineral oil, is fragrance free, sulfate free, paraben free and was not tested on animals.  All of those things are great but it also makes my skin feel so clean and it does not dry me out at all.  Some cleansers make my face feel tight and dry...especially this time of year...but not this one.  I love the way my skin feels after washing it.  This cleanser even helps sooth psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis, acne and more without causing pain or irritation. I think it&#x27;s safe to say that you can use this without worrying about drying your skin out or irritating your sensitive skin.  It hasn&#x27;t bothered me one bit, and that&#x27;s one reason why I was so excited to try it.  I have tried SO many cleansers and my skin just ends up more and more irritated...but not this time.  I look forward to trying more products from Era Organics in hopes that I&#x27;ve maybe found some new skin care products for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the face wash and the moisturizer for 6 weeks.  I am over 50 and have been experiencing enlarged pores and combination skin with occasional breakouts.  I read all the information on the website about this product and even had an email exchange with the owner.  I had never been educated in the ph level of my skin and how using products with too a high a ph level could damage my skin. I spend well over $1000. a year in skin care to have no appreciable difference in my skin for years now. I have not been using cheap skin care, I have always been a believer in you pay for the best ingredients. With just 2 weeks of using both the face wash and moisturizer I could see my skin become new, like it was healing and completely different.  Different in that my pores are smaller, my skin is so smooth and has a firmness that it has not had since I was in my twenties.  I feel like my face detoxed in the first week, like the blackheads and clogged pores were unclogging themselves.  I have never experienced anything like it.  I realize now that by using facial products that had a different ph level than my skin meant that my skin just couldn&#x27;t fully function therefore never heal, so I would get into a never ending cycle of handling the bad effects of using the wrong ph level products with more wrong ph level products and on and on and on I have gone. I now see and feel the difference. I felt like I needed more and more exfoliation type products and I bought into the idea that with my age, my skin was needing to have layers peeled off to reveal more youthful skin.  Now with using these products and only these 2 products day and night my skin is no longer fighting with me and it is truly more beautiful and youthful.  I also am wearing less makeup to cover the imperfections as the imperfections are less and less.  The owner has told me that they are developing of a mask which I look forward to using.</li>
    <li> I like the era organics moisturizer better than this cleanser. Cleanser leaves my skin feeling a little dry. Doesn&#x27;t smell that great either</li>
    <li> I was presently surprised that this face wash was too watery! I was hoping it would be more of a moisturizing creamy cleanser. Other than that, I like this overall:) I would recommend the moisturizers over the cleanser!</li>
    <li> I originally bout this facial wash for my daughter who has problematic skin and decided to try it out one. All I can say is WOW! The difference in my skin in just one use was amazing. I asked my daughter how it was working for her and she said she was blown away, too. In her case, she has dry skin and is prone to eczema patches. The patches are clearing up and her skin is looking so much better. In my case, I tend to have oily skin and still have blemishes. In one use, my skin felt normal, not oily. In a couple of uses, I can see that the blemishes are clearing up. While the product may seem expensive, a little goes a long way, and having clearer skin is priceless!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It works great for my sensitive skin that is prone to getting red. I also had a good experience with the costumer service for Era Organics. Nice and efficient!!!! Will be buying again when I run out.</li>
    <li> What drew me to this is that it is all natural and perfect for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is just as it is pictured above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I get older I am on the look out for anything that is natural and does not contain a lot of extra stuff because my skin is so susceptible to fragrances and chemicals. This smelled kind of like honey.  Not a strong smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put about the size of a dime into my hands and rubbed onto my face.  Went on really soft and easy to put on.  After rinsing just patted my face dry.  My skin felt so smooth to the touch.  I love it.  I am not terribly old but I did notice the difference in my wrinkles too.  They were not as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I reciieved my replacement bottle of Era Organics cleanser for the face today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out considering the first time I purchased it, my experience was not good.  The company that produced the product reached out to me and offered to replace the defective product without any questions asked.  They were apologetic and expeditious about getting me another bottle of the product in efforts to satisfy me, the customer, which was a refreshing experience in this day and age!  I tried the product again and was extremely pleased with the quality of the cleanser, it leaned my face completely and the consistency was good.  With this product a little goes a long way so use sparingly.  I commend this company, Era Organics for standing behind this product and satisfying the customer.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and very dry as I used Ziana gel.  My doctor recommended to find some gentle face wash instead of the regular ones as those cause burning.  This one is perfect.  No more burning.</li>
    <li> With the cold weather my face was very dry. No burning or dryness with this stuff. My face has cleared up and just looks better! I use once a day when taking a shower. I love it, will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have very dry sensitive skin and recently tried Era Organics Natural Face Wash after falling in love with their Complete Natural Moisturizer.  Well, I&#x27;ve fallen in love a 2nd time over with this face wash!  It has a silky consistency that comfortably spreads over your face and easily rinses off.  A small portion cleans my face and neck while leaving it soft and supple with no irritation.  It cleans gently yet still cleans facial grime and sweat after gardening and exercising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have asked if this cleanser will remove makeup.  I do use a separate makeup remover before cleansing, particularly as I wear waterproof mascara.  However, this cleanser effectively and gently removes trace residual makeup including lipstick and facial powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new staple in my beauty products and another great Amazon Prime Value.</li>
    <li> I love it. will buy again. great customer service.</li>
    <li> My second order of this face wash. I love it so much! I just wish that, for the price, that the bottle was much bigger. It seems like a lot for so little of the product.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this cleanser but chose to buy it based on good reviews and the fact that it works well on sensitive skin. I mostly use it before bed as it feels cool and calming on my skin. It has more of a cream consistency and does not lather up very much. The smell is ok; barely noticeable and neither bad nor great. The product itself is glittery but it doesn&#x27;t leave glitter residue on the face. It&#x27;s too soon to notice long term results; my skin feels hydrated and super softer after I use it (mind you I have VERY dry skin!) but it doesn&#x27;t do much for the redness on my cheeks and forehead (which is no surprise as very few non prescription products will help that). Bottom line: I&#x27;d repurchase this cleanser for night time use, or when I want to use a milder face wash. I also love that it&#x27;s natural. You can definitely feel the difference from other face washes because of how mild and non harming it feels on your skin. Good product!</li>
    <li> Love the way my face feels after using it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This face wash is the best I have ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT)! It does not dry out my face and after using it for about a week, I have noticed a difference in the brightness and condition of my skin. My chin acne has cleared up too! Highly recommend this face wash; its worth the price and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> You can tell from the moment you start washing your face, this is like NO OTHER face wash. The consistency is different. It doesn&#x27;t lather that much, but cleans a lot better! Very moisturizing! I&#x27;ve used other face washes that are moisturizing, but do not clean well, and leave a skanky residue behind. This doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind. Just soft, clean, well moisturized skin. I LOVE it! I have sensitive, acne prone skin, that doesn&#x27;t like most products I try. Best face wash I&#x27;ve used! Cleans eye makeup off very well also!</li>
    <li> I was considering returning this face wash because it does absolutely nothing to remove eye makeup but I still decided to give it a try and use another soap first to remove the makeup. I&#x27;m happy that I did decide to give it a try because it fixed my dry damaged winter skin. It leaves my skin feeling nourished and mosturized. Also I have acne prone skin and this did not make me breakout at all.</li>
    <li> Talk about a totally organic experience, this face wash is amazing!! I only use organic products &amp; this is the number 1!! I love how moisturizing it is &amp; how my skin felt after using it. I will be buying again !! It also arrived when it said it was.</li>
    <li> purchased and used by a man. love it, would buy it again</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews for anything, but this product deserves one.  I am currently on accutane (day 50 80mg) and was desperately waiting for it to start working.  The acne has somewhat gone away but left behind are these red marks that wouldn&#x27;t fade, until i got this product.  Within days my face looked insanely better.  The natural pH and aloe and honey are what i credit this too.  This is the most i have ever spent on a facewash, i usually use dove and cetaphil, but this just changed the game for me.  Doesn;t really have a scent and the texture is a light lather,. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> The best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m a 56 year old woman with Rosacea and could not wash my face much as would get bumps under my skin. This face wash is the only one I&#x27;ve used that is actually getting rid of the bumps under my skin. I noticed the bumps were getting smaller the first time I washed my face with this product.  I now look forward to washing my face and wash it twice a day with this product. I bought my 30 year old daughter a bottle of this as she&#x27;s always had major acne issues.  She also noticed how good her skin felt after the first wash.  She&#x27;s used it for three days now and I&#x27;m hoping after using it for a couple of weeks she&#x27;ll have the same success I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  My evening routine is to use a cleansing cloth to wipe off my makeup from the day, use my cleanser and then go over my face with toner on a cotton ball.  Every time, I would need at least 2 cotton balls and additional toner to wipe off the rest of the makeup after I washed my face with my cheap cleanser (Target purchase that also advertised no parabens, no sulfates).  I thought this was normal!!  I was curious about better cleansers, read the other reviews and saw results after just one use!  When I used the toner on the cotton ball after washing my face with the cleanser, nothing was on the cotton ball.  It really did clean my face and remove any excess makeup.  The next morning my skin was brighter and smoother.  I love Era Organics!</li>
    <li> Love it... leaves face feeling clean and fresh...</li>
    <li> Very effective products,  This is my second order of the face wash.  If you have problem or maturing skin (I have both), I would recommend this face wash.</li>
    <li> It was OK.  I like more lather and this doesn&#x27;t have as much as is prefer.  The smell is good.  I just don&#x27;t know if I would order this again.  The bottle seemed small.  I still LOVE the face cream and will definitely be a returning customer for other products.</li>
    <li> The cleanser feels so good on my face after I use it. It is so light and airy and I love that it is healthy for the skin.</li>
    <li> There are so many things I love about this cleanser. The product is paraben free, hypoallergenic, and sulfate free. Also there is no scent which is a pleasant surprise. I used it to wash off my makeup and it did such an amazing job. It is a light cleanser and not greasy at all. My skin felt aglow and clean when I used it. Amazing! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I am always on the search for a new, better facial cleanser. I have very sensitive skin that is usually dry and prone to breakouts. As you can tell, it is pretty difficult to find the perfect combination of things in one bottle. I searched through Google trying to find something that appealed to my skins needs but it seems that every thing fell short. I came across this little gem under a search for &amp;#34;organic facial cleansers&amp;#34;. I found a list of ingredients and started to look up the benefits for each one. It states that it is ph balanced which is a must for your face and private areas. I tested this with a litmus strip and it was indeed right at 5.5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a brief list of how some of the key ingredients are beneficial for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera- treats acne and moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;Manuka Honey- anti fungal and antibiotic properties, acne &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just seeing that these two ingredients are at the top of the list I knew that it had to be a great opportunity to try and get my facial concerns under control. I literally couldn&#x27;t detect any smell which is a plus because many other products claim to be &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but there is usually a funny plastic smell. It created a good lather, which I love and rinsed off without leaving my skin feeling slimy or squeaky. It felt very clean and fresh. I&#x27;m very pleased with the cleaner and will be purchasing again for backups.</li>
    <li> Era Organics is a diamond in the rough.  I  love to try new face cleanser.  When I was given the chance to add to my growing collection of face cleanser, I was so excited.  It felt so good on my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a dime size amount at a time.  A little goes a long ways.  I wet my face first then use the dime size amount of cleanser to rub over my entire face.  It lathers a small amount but not so much you could get some in your eyes or mouth.  I then use mildly warm water to rinse it off. It washes off nicely and does not leave a film on your face like some I have used before.  I then pat my face dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results are:  I really like the way it makes my face feel  the price is a little steep but a little does go a long ways so it should last about 4 to 6 weeks.  I also like that it can be used for acne so my teenager can use it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this product again because of how it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best face washes I have ever used. You can feel it working when you wash your face with it. I could tell a difference right away in my complexion after I started using this. My face cleared up and just shined. I looked younger and felt better about myself. If you suffer from blemishes or problems with your skin this is a great product to try out.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic face wash! It removes makeup and impurities with ease. It is so gentle on my skin, which is great because my face can be very sensitive to lotions, cleaners, makeup... I will break out and stay broke out for sometimes a week. I have even had some lotions that left my face &#x27;scalded&#x27;. That is very painful and hard to get the heat out of it.&lt;br /&gt;It is also for ALL skin types. So you don&#x27;t have to worry about grabbing the wrong one for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;This face wash is not only for cleansing but it also will restore it to it&#x27;s natural balance. While this is called a face wash, it can be used on the body, as well, but I choose to just use it on my face since it&#x27;s so gentle and it&#x27;s a small bottle. You can use it for every wash, unlike some products that say once a day or every few days, which should also speak for how gentle it is.&lt;br /&gt;What makes this wash so good? Best answer: it&#x27;s organic! It contains ingredients you recognize: Aloe Vera, Glycerin, Manuka Honey.... Ingredients that are known for healing, restoring and cleansing, leaving your skin soft, clean and moisturized. Just what we want and need! They also have other products that I&#x27;ve tried that are just as good and ORGANIC!</li>
    <li> face feels soft and nourished, soothing on eczema too</li>
    <li> I have Contact Dermatitis around my eyes and it can get pretty bad.  The doctor recommended washing with Baby Shampoo which is very drying and was not the right solution for this issue.  I have tried many, many products, including prescription steroid cream all to no avail.  Last night I used this product for the first time and again this morning and the skin around my eyes seems much better, no longer red or flaky.  I then put some of Era Organics Face Moisturizer on the area and this definitely helped.  I will update as I continue to use this product but so far I am extremely pleased.</li>
