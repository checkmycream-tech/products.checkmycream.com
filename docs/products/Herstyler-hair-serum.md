      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Got it today, I love the product but when I got it the oil was all over the box where it squirted out</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pleasure to buy this from Amazon; as always, fast shipping and impeccable service.</li>
      <li>It smells great and makes my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>Love how smooth it makes my hair look without making it look greasy.</li>
      <li>it smells great and it makes my hair soft.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light, nutty and sweet without being too cloying; this is perfect to use 2 to 3 times a week for adding extra shine to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it makes my hair super smooth.</li>
      <li>I searched for this on Amazon after I got a free sample at the mall...</li>
      <li>Oh and I received free shampoo and conditioner with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Today I was excited to have received it and plan to travel with it in two days.</li>
      <li>This product left my hair so soft and smelling great!</li>
      <li>My favorite is Timeless 100% pure Argon oil.</li>
      <li>It really makes my hair to look healthy and calms any frizz.</li>
      <li>It really does help my hair feel softer and more manageable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
      <li>Not bad,</li>
      <li>Am now able to wear my hair as I did in high school (silky smooth and straight).  </li>
      <li>I got it fast and all went smooth.</li>
      <li>It smells awesome, the scent lasts all day (as opposed to only about an hour with other hair serum), and makes my hair the softest</li>
      <li>not only does it make your hair smell good, but it also makes your hair SILKY soft</li>
      <li>This serum works great on african American hair.</li>
      <li>I tried this product at a cart in the mall and it made my hair super soft.</li>
      <li>recommend using pure Argon Oil instead.  </li>
      <li>(that bottle is 3.4 oz., but still too much $ for me)  </li>
      <li>This stuff works very well.</li>
      <li>But I am very astonished to find out from the picture posted in amazon that that&#x27;s how the bottle of this serum is.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny!!</li>
      <li>Another brand with the exact same ingredients (I compared labels) being sold at a mall kiosk month was $75 a bottle.</li>
      <li>BTW, I am 65 years old!</li>
      <li>I have read the rating and  were very interested in purchasing other products from this brand like shampoo, conditioner, etc..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d really like my money back.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m completely sold, and I&#x27;ll be buying this stuff for the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>If you want soft, shiny hair then get this serum.</li>
      <li>I have thick and straight hair, the primary issue I work with is adding volume to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product, especially at this price.  </li>
      <li>It keeps me from getting breakage and split ends, especially with the consistent day-to-day use of my hair dryer and flat iron.</li>
      <li>I put this stuff in right before straightening, and it literally cuts my straightening time in half.</li>
      <li>Be careful to not use too much or your hair may feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>Not that my hair takes long to straighten anyway (normally about 10 minutes), but this stuff lets me straighten my hair in 5 minutes tops.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stop playing with my hair all day long - that&#x27;s how soft it is.</li>
      <li>Just a little goes a long way and the price is right too.</li>

    <li> I have thick and straight hair, the primary issue I work with is adding volume to my hair.  HerStyler does an amazing job at conditioning my ends and smoothing my hair follicles.  However, I suspect it weighs down my hair so it&#x27;s not something I use on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I have a secret to share-- I bought this serum mostly because of the smell!  The fragrance is light, nutty and sweet without being too cloying; this is perfect to use 2 to 3 times a week for adding extra shine to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pleasure to buy this from Amazon; as always, fast shipping and impeccable service.</li>

    <li> I searched for this on Amazon after I got a free sample at the mall... This product is a lot greasier, and doesn&#x27;t have the same fragrance as the description. Not bad, but I&#x27;ll pay more for a better product.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing hair serum I have ever used in my life.

    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  It makes my hair so soft and shiny!!</li>
    <li> This serum works great on african American hair. It&#x27;s not heavy or weigh the hair down. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 3 years and I haven&#x27;t found anything that&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> the bottle had leaked during shipment so I was not very happy.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It really does help my hair feel softer and more manageable. It keeps me from getting breakage and split ends, especially with the consistent day-to-day use of my hair dryer and flat iron.</li>
    <li> not only does it make your hair smell good, but it also makes your hair SILKY soft</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product, especially at this price.  I have suggested it to a number of friends, who are also very pleased with it.  My hair looks and feels fuller with this product.  it holds the style longer, and I get compliments on my hair after using it.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It smells awesome and leaves hair shiny and just perfect. Oh and I received free shampoo and conditioner with my purchase. Thank you lots. It did take forever for me to receive (2 long weeks), but that is because USPS lost my package.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my hair shiny and smells great.  It also protects my hair from getting damaged when I blow-dry it and straighten it.  It is comparable to other leave in serums.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff so so so sorry it is so hard to find now. I bought extras! Best hair serum.</li>
    <li> Got it today, I love the product but when I got it the oil was all over the box where it squirted out</li>
    <li> Very good hair serum, it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;and is a real good price from Amazon.  I got it fast and all went smooth.</li>
    <li> Works as well as aveda for a lot less money</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>

    <li> My bottle was cracked when I received it and there was serum everywhere. I&#x27;d really like my money back.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for permed and colored hair!</li>
    <li> The reason why I gave only three stars is not because of the product itself. I have read the rating and  were very interested in purchasing other products from this brand like shampoo, conditioner, etc.. So I decided to give a trybfor the serum. Today I was excited to have received it and plan to travel with it in two days. When I opened the outside paper box, I pull out the inside content and was shocked!!!!!! The inside hard paper was &#x27; flooded&#x27; with the serum!!! I thought the lid has been forgotten or one forgot to turn the upper cover to &#x27; close&#x27;. But I am very astonished to find out from the picture posted in amazon that that&#x27;s how the bottle of this serum is. This is just too annoying to know that ont spend money to but something that gets so disappointed because of the failure of the bottle where is not safe for shipping, either for bringing the bottle to travel with. I hope the manufacturer can correct this problem. Otherwise it&#x27;s a pity that the customers don&#x27;t purchase this product anymore, not because of the product itself( actually I am happy with the serum)but because of the bottle!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The mall tried to sell this to me for $75 and I got it for a steal. Works wonders.</li>
