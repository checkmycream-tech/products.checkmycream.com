    <li> Excellent product. Works well on my skin type. Oily in T zone area.</li>
    <li> Best skin care line I&#x27;ve used that actually does what it claims to do</li>
    <li> My skin has done a 360 using this night and day. It&#x27;s truly balanced out my skin and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Face feels great, no break-outs, and cleans well. I use the entire line of Ormedic products. Love all their products.</li>
    <li> perfect for sensitive skin. so glad when i find it on amazon for better deal than salon pricing</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, and learned about this product from my salon. I LOVE IT! It lasts for like 6-7 months! I am indian, and for some reason have really sensitive skin, this is gentle and smells so good. I use it in the shower, and follow up with Juice Beauty&#x27;s moisturizer (which I can magic cream!)  together they are unbeatable!</li>
    <li> This is an affordable and natural cleanser with a nice scent! I particularly like when there is mango in the ingredients but it seems they mix up ingredients with what is in season. Recently I received one with green tea instead of the mango. I like it too and I enjoy how long the product lasts..a little goes a long way! I have adult acne and enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> I always use this face wash and purchased from here for the first time. This smells much stronger than what I&#x27;ve purchased from other places, including my facial person. It left my skin irritated and dry. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same as what I&#x27;ve used. I will not buy from here again. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash and usually purchase it from my esthetician, but something definitely seems off with this one I purchased from Amazon. Texture and smell are different, and I&#x27;m starting to break out from it (which I haven&#x27;t before). The bottle was also different from what was pictured. But everything else on the label read the same as my original version. Very strange...So be warned before purchasing this one!!</li>
    <li> Cleans face very well but I think I like to old formula better. I didn&#x27;t realize it had wheat in it and I&#x27;m allergic.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, it is a wonderful, gentle facial cleanser that is good for any skin type.</li>
    <li> I love this Facial cleanser. It very gentle on my face and all my makeup washes off easily. Does nto dry my face like some cleansers do. Last a long time. You just need a pea size amount. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love Image skin care products for my irritated skin. I love that it is gentle, but deep cleaning. Leaves my skin soft and naturally moisturizes</li>
    <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and this is the best facial cleanser she&#x27;s ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t make her skin dry nor does it break her out.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product, and this was exactly as expected.  This meets my expectations and I will continue using.</li>
    <li> This cleanser smells and feels great. I have tried several of the other Image cleansers and this one is my absolute favorite! Doesn&#x27;t strip my skin like some others. Thick gel cleanser lathers nicely and smells fantastic. High quality product with excellent results.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my skin!</li>
    <li> This face cleanser was recommended to me three years ago by an aesthetician after I finished treatment with Accutane.  It is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve used since then because it leaves my skin feeling clean, fresh, and soft.  I have somewhat oily skin, but washing with this face cleanser gently removes the oiliness without making my skin feel tight or stretched like many other products.  It also keeps my acne at bay.  This is only a problem if I slack on washing my face for a few days, but as soon as I wash my face with this cleanser the acne recedes again.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this product. Makes my skin smooth, soft, and clear. Also, it removes my makeup like a charm; sometimes I don&#x27;t even need to use makeup remover. Win in my book!</li>
    <li> Ugh. this product and the others that I purchased caused a horrible allergic reaction on my face and neck. It happened twice as I didn&#x27;t think that using this product would elicit the same reaction. Boy, was I wrong!</li>
    <li> this skin care line is amazing I highly recommend to anybody with troubled skin!  if only I would have found it sooner!</li>
    <li> This not only smells great, it also feels so soft and smooth. And you need just a drop or two, so it will last forever.</li>
    <li> A mild, but very good cleanser.  It even takes my eye make up and mascara off well. I Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This smells SO fresh and cleans my face beautiful without drying. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing. I had some from a Salon and was not scented and texture was different. The on on Amazon had a really fruity smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser - expensive but worth it.  Seller did great follow-up.  Promptly delivered and well-packaged.</li>
    <li> Really great facial cleanser, its organic and its very great on my skin . I have sensitive skin and it works great on me it takes away all the redness and inflammation . I use this one only in the morning, and at night i use another face wash that has salicylic acid. It lasts a long time just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would help my acne. It didn&#x27;t. It smells good and lathers nicely, but didn&#x27;t help my acne at all.  I like that it&#x27;s all natural but I have found other products that work better. Not worth the $20.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57 &amp; still have breakouts &amp; lg pores, plus wrinkles. This cleanes pores well. A little goes a long way. I do follow with Image vit C moisture cream.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I have purchased it from my dermatologist several times. I looked for options to purchase it on line and was considering purchasing it through an Amazon vendor. But, buyer beware. The manufacturer, Image, says on its website that Amazon and eBay vendors are not legitimate sources for this product! They only sell through licensed doctors and aestheticians. So, if you want the real thing go to Image&#x27;s website, enter your zip code, and locate the nearest vendors for their wonderful products.</li>
    <li> Does not take much so don&#x27;t over use. IT cleans great with just a little!</li>
    <li> My face tends to clog easily and overproduce oil so using 1-2x today (intervals with a lotion type cleaners) it does the trick. Love Ormedic for the quality and price too.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the Coldwater Creek Spa once.  I ran out and didn&#x27;t want to drive all the way out there, so I bought this online.  Same great product.  I only use it once every 3 days or so because it is gel based which is used for cleansing oils.  I also get the Vital-C face wash by this same brand to use on the days in between because it is moisturizing.  LOVE.  Pricey but worth it.  A little dab goes a long way.  Easily lasts me about 7 or 8 months.</li>
    <li> My package arrived in the mail yesterday and when I opened it, I was disappointedly surprised to see that the packaging had changed after ordering at least 4 bottles over the course of 3 years. It is supposed to be a &amp;#34;new and improved version&amp;#34; of the Image Ormedic Facial Cleanser. In addition to the change in packaging, it has a new strong and sharp scent. The smell is so different and unappealing that I have a strong feeling that it is not going have a positive affect on my face. The old formula was the only facial product that cleared up and prevented my teenage and adult acne. Although I&#x27;m very hesitant after seeing the most recent reviews of this product, I&#x27;m going to try the cleanser out and update my post.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Works well and leaves my face feeling super clean. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  It is gentle but cleanses very well.  No residue left behind and no drying out feeling.  Also great for sensitive skin.  This is a great all around face cleanser.  It has a very light foam to it and rinses easily.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! It&#x27;s fresh, smells nice and leaves your face feeling really clean. It froths up into a lather with water and rinses off well. I like the fact that it seems safe and healthy, not too harsh on your skin.</li>
    <li> Received my products in a few short days in great condition. Enjoy this refreshing and sensitive wash on my ever sensitive skin. Highly recommend... just don&#x27;t try to take through the airport because TSA will take it and you&#x27;ll have to order all over again :( worth it though :)</li>
    <li> terrible! new formula smells and caused a terrible allergic reaction... so disappointed because i used this cleanser for the past 5 years.</li>
    <li> This face wash is excellent, very gentle and clean.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful organic face wash that is healthy. It gets the job done without using harmful chemicals or  drying your skin. Its good to wash twice with any face wash you use to ensure cleanlyness. Their other products are great too.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product from the clinic I go to for weight loss and they also do a variety of things other than weight loss and after just one day of using this (also used the vitamin c cleanser) I immediately felt the difference! My face felt so much fresher and it felt soo amazingly soft , like a babies booty!! I would totally recommended this product, it can be a tad bit pricey but if you have sensitive dry skin like myself I feel price doesn&#x27;t matter as long as it helps.</li>
    <li> Really great cleanser.  This is a really good line of facial products.</li>
    <li> Received my product on time.  This cleanser leaves my skin very soft and clean. I love the smell, very refreshing. It&#x27;s the best!!!</li>
    <li> This was the first time ordering this product from this vendor.  When it arrived it was not in the packaging I am use to seeing or as in the picture.  I became cautious immediately that it was a fake.  It even smells different and does not work the same.  After a week of using it, my face has begun breaking out.  EXTREMELY dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so some skin products irritate my skin. I was first introduced to this line by my skincare specialist- And I like all of the products she recommended me - This cleanser foams well - I say not as easily as other foaming cleansers but it definitely does the job. The best quality about this product is that it feels gentle while it does the job- I love this product. I was without this cleanser for about a week and my face started breaking out- I am a believer- Give this cleanser a try!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use any other product on my face</li>
    <li> The best cleanser I have ever used!</li>
    <li> this product is simply amazing.  i noticed a difference in my face after the first use. leaves my faces over all clean and fresh. I have issues with redness in my face and this product seems to reduce this. ALSO, best smelling facial product. ever.</li>
    <li> I trust this stuff. The woman who introduced me to this product researched it well and she ought to know.</li>
    <li> Image recently changed this product slightly.  I actually prefer the new formula, which I find lathers a little better and smells better than the old version (which always smelled kind of like banana to me - this is a little more citrus, less banana).  I have combination, acne prone skin that is slightly aging (late 30s), and I live in a very dry climate.  I have been using this cleanser most of the time for the past 6 years (after it was recommended to me by an aesthetician), and every time I switch to something else for a brief period of time, I regret it.  Try this product.  You will love it!  It also works great with a Clarisonic, if you use one for cleansing (it does not just absorb into the brush but lathers nicely where you don&#x27;t need to use a ton of product).  This is a little pricey, but it lasts a very long time - a little goes a long way.  One bottle lasts me several months (about 3-4 months), using it twice a day.  Also, to all the &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; who complain about buying professional skincare products on Amazon - this product is not available in my area anymore (except at a hotel spa, 45 minutes from my house)!  The two spas I purchased from no longer sell this line locally, in part because Image makes it hard for them to place small orders for consumers like myself who prefer to buy locally.  So please, reviewers, stop lecturing about how we should not buy on Amazon/ebay/etc., and how we must only buy from a licensed professional.  For some of us, this is the only place we can buy this great product line.</li>
    <li> I do love this facial cleanser. It feels smooth and the fact is natural adds to the product choice. Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I was really excited about trying this facewash because i had heard good things and a local spa sells it. However, though it smells really good and it does remove all my makeup, it does not prevent breakouts. I was very happy about this being all natural and hoped that it would prevent breakouts, but it just isn&#x27;t the facewash for me. Every time i use it, i breakout somewhere else, and it actually tends to dry out my skin, which i was really surprised by. All the reviews said nothing but good things, but i guess my skin just doesn&#x27;t like it. Too bad...the search continues for me...</li>
    <li> sealed bottle, brand new. saved my $$ on this purchase</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years, after my one and only facial. I am so glad I can find it on Amazon now.. It is wonderful and the only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face (PH balanced) or leave makeup residue that causes breakouts.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cleanser. Use morning and night. Just a couple drops does the job. I am a licensed Esthetician and highly recommend this skin care line. I use all of their products. Used to suffer from acne and hyperpigmentation. Now free of acne and dark spots. I have studied skin types for the past few ears and also study ingredients and how they work for different skin types. I would highly recommend going to the source of where IMAGE is sold only because the founder of this line does not allow it to be sold online only through licensed skin care professionals. Estheticians and Physicians... So something to think about before purchasing here.</li>
    <li> Just as I remembered!!! Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> liked all natural ingredients</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  The ingredients are top quality, it has a great natural scent and it is foamy and light and my skin feeling cleansed, removes all of my makeup</li>
    <li> Love it and that it is possible to use little, and then have it last a long time.  If I went through the bottle faster, I would not buy it.</li>
    <li> Thought I never switch to any other producs except Mary Kay which I have been using last 15 years plus.  That&#x27;s now changed after my facial treatment at the local OC Wellness Spa in Huntington Beach, CA.  Great product with excellent natural scent which is very important to me.  I am worth it therefore I am for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you OC Wellness Spa c/o Staphanie who introduced these products including OBAGI-C (Serum)</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser, and have used for over a year!  It cleanses thoroughly, yet gently.  Seems to help my adult acne prone skin.  I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser. It smells amazing, is gentle on my sensitive skin, and cleans very well.</li>
    <li> My aesthetician recommended this cleanser along with the Ormedic the Anti-Oxidant Serum after my last facial.  I am 48 and in perimenopause - the skin changes have been difficult to cope with to say the least.  After just a week of using both the Sking Balancing cleanser and the serum my skin&#x27;s texture, moisture and feel improved noticeably.  I have now been using the products for nearly a month and I have gotten several compliments on how great my skin looks.  I notice that my skin is softer, moister and smoother to the touch. One of the most unpleasant aspects of the hormone changes has been getting deep pore blockages; since using these products I have gone a month without one breakout.  I am delighted with this product and will be adding some of Image Skincare&#x27;s other products to my routine in hopes they are as good as the two that I have already tried.</li>
    <li> I use all the Image line for face wash, SPF moisturizer and the night cream.  Love them all.  This is so fresh and light, smells good and you only need a tiny bit.  It foams up so it feels like I&#x27;m washing my face.</li>
    <li> Gear face wash it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft :)</li>
    <li> Love the Facial Cleanser by Image.  I live in Colorado where my face tends to really get dry, after using this product I find I have had much clearer skin and my face is not as dry as it used to be.</li>
    <li> I love the whole line of products. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it. The scent of this motivates me to wash my face. Really wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers for my combination skin and keep going back this product.  Its the only cleanser I have found that gets my skin really clean, removes makeup, no need for a toner and does it all  without stipping or leaving a residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB</li>
    <li> Recommended by aesthicians and seeminly gentle and effective for dry skin.  I&#x27;m continuing to use this product and will probably reorder.</li>
    <li> very gentle cleanser, does not dry my skin , smells great</li>
    <li> Cleanser doesn&#x27;t over dry.  Also only need a small amount to use so it lasts a long time.  Best for normal to dry skin types.  If your skin is really oily, which mine sometime is, best to use something for combination skin.  I tend to use this only in the morning and use something stronger at night.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Besides smelling great and giving me an even wash without drying out my skin, it is all natural.  For years I worked with women and Bio Identical Hormone Replacement therapy.  I was shocked how many women were using product chalked full of hormones that effected their levels.  This product is safe and effective.  Its the perfect balance!</li>
    <li> Dries out my skin really bad. My face looked like a snow covered mountain. Bought Spa Girl&#x27;s Eucalyptus-Tea Tree Cleanser, and my face cleared right up and has zero blemishes. My daughter used it, and after seeing 2 bottles through, she had a horrible case of white heads. Eucalyptus-Tea Tree Cleanser cleared those right up as well. My mom used 2 bottle as well. She had to change to Eucalyptus-Tea Tree Cleanser as well because Image Ormedic Facial Cleanser was drying out her skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought Image Ormedic Facial Cleanser from our facial lady. She said we had to use 1 whole bottle for our skin to adjust and we would have our faces back after the second bottle. 6 bottles and over $120 later, we were worse for wear. With Eucalyptus-Tea Tree Cleanser by Spa Girl, our faces cleared up within 3-5 days.</li>
    <li> I purchased this face wash because of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and \\&quot;organic\\&quot; slogans but unfortunantly my skin did not react well to this face wash AT ALL. I have always used Cetaphil because my skin is so sensative so I took a chance using this and it broke my skin out so bad I would have at least 2 new pimples everyday and alot cystic. No longer than 3 days after I stopped using this my skin cleared up. This is a no go for me</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser! Love love love!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, but not a high-end luxury cleanser. I have dry skin and this cleaned fine, but I think I need something more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> One of my sons was recommend this Ormedic facial Cleanser and so far it seems to be working the way it,s suppose to .This has helped prevent future outbreaks with his Acne. Smells good also.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and fell in love with this Image Ormedic Balancing facial cleanser a few years ago.  In the past, I have purchased it directly through Image Skin Care, but due to time constraints I decided to purchase through Amazon this time around.  I still like the product, but I am concerned by the fact that this cleanser (purchased here) does not seem to be quite as thick in consistency as the ones I&#x27;ve ordered directly from the source company.  It almost seems a bit watered down and I require more product than normal to do the job.  Slightly disappointed and will be going back to the source for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product... I first brought from my dermatologist Dr. Deborah Grayman this product is awesome and make face feel so silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> Leaves your face feeling good and smelling great,but it really doesn&#x27;t clean your face. After using i could see my face not being clean, so i used a makeup remover wipe and was left filthy so yea not a good CLEANER.</li>
    <li> Had an OXYGEN facial recently and afterwards was given a trial kit of IMAGE products to use afterwards including this item.  Ended up ordering ALL five products because my &amp;#34;combination - post menopausal still w/t-zone&amp;#34; skin has never looked so good!  Bonus &#x3D; everyone in the household benefits from this product!</li>
    <li> very gentle and leaves your face very clean.  it does not dry out skin.  i will order again for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. My face feels clean without feeling dry or irritated. I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I had the item for about 3 month now and I still have 1/2 bottle left. Cleans skin well without drying it out.</li>
    <li> It best not recommended for oily skin type because its a gel cleanser. The cleanser will leave your face feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser every morning after I shower when my skin is most sensitive. It does not sting at all but cleans my face completely.</li>
    <li> Not particularly thrilled about this cleanser.  It has not worked as expected so will not recommend.  Simply a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This face cleanser is AMAZING.  It is the only thing I will wash my face with now.  My skin is so much more clear and not irritated like it was with soap.  There are not a lot of facial cleansers that are PH balanced for your skin.  The new formula is as good, but still pretty darn good.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product several times before. I love the way it works and the way my skin feels. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash I can use without breaking out. After trying many others and about one year of non stop acne, this is the most gentle on my skin. I use this along with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Helps prevent breakouts.  I have been using it for years and swear by it.</li>
    <li> Great Price for the product! Half the price of the salon I go to! My skin got extremely dry for the first week or so, but I powered through and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> I wanted the product pictured. I received the new bottle which has chemicals that I cannot use. Total waist of $50. Very disappointed in shipping time and product.</li>
    <li> love this gentle cleanser - does not irritate already infammed skin</li>
    <li> Best face wash ever! I&#x27;ll never go back to ordinary stuff again.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Image skin care line. Keeps my skin balanced. Cleans well without drying it out!</li>
    <li> I give this product a five star rating for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it gets your face clean without feeling like all the moisture has been stripped from your skin.  Secondly it only takes a tiny amount to wash your whole face,so it&#x27;s economical, and thirdly it had a very light, but clean scent and no color added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price, great face wash!</li>
    <li> Attention anyone with problem skin!  You&#x27;ve found your product for life.  I was using proactive however, my skin became inflamed.  After a trip to the spa where they used the Image line I glowed!!!  Highly recommend.  LOVE</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermalogica for several years and was looking for a change just to switch it up. I have combination skin that is sensitive so many that I have tried irritate my skin. My esthetician recommended this product to me and I love it! It is gentile, cleans face well (even to remove makeup), and smells great. A little goes a long way. This bottle will last 5-6 months. It is difficult to find in local spas, etc. so I love that I can purchase from Amazon. The bottles have an expiration date on the bottom so you know you&#x27;re getting new product.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended that I try this and I am so glad she did.  A very soothing cleanser that leaves you feeling extra fresh!!</li>
    <li> best cleanser I have used so  far</li>
    <li> This feels very silky to the touch, leaves skin feeling replenished and clean.  Used this in a regimen to help my acne/dermatitis face and I&#x27;m a believer in this product.  Have ordered my second bottle now.  Excellent for every-day facial cleansing, it never feels like it&#x27;s stripping your skin.  Very gentle and hydrating.</li>
    <li> Excellent amazon seller. Item new as described. Fast post to Sydney, Australia. Thank you</li>
    <li> I went through this so quick because I absolutely LOVE the smell.  I got another one and was just as pleased.</li>
    <li> The skin type indication said &amp;#34;irritated&amp;#34;, the ingredient list seemed very good and I liked that it was all natural and organic,  so I bought this cleanser with high hopes. Unfortunately my hypersensitive skin didn&#x60;t react well to this cleanser. It is not the worst reaction I&#x60;ve had to a skin care product.. Yes, my skin actually did glow for a while, but it gave me a slight stinging sensation during washing and this sensation remained for several hours. I also experienced more frequent flushing than I&#x60;ve been used to lately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser has a very strong scent to it, which I find overpowering. It also looked as if it left a film on my face and my skin fast became very oily (I have an oily skin type)  I don&#x60;t recommend this cleanser for people with rosacea-like symptoms (like my own) or for people sensitive to smells.</li>
    <li> Very calm face wash for oily/acne skin. Balances out uneven skin tone</li>
    <li> Great cleanser! I never use make up remover when I wash with this cleanser because it takes everything off my face. It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. I have sensitive acne prone skin and this never irritates me or flares me up.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is amazing.  I can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks.  A little goes a long way and it smells great too!  I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> My skin has always been so hard to use any product on. I find a product that dose not irritate it, then it would always start to irritate it. But this product so far, and I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a month, has not irritated my skin. Although I feel it would if used more then once a day. For now I will be happy to have clean smooth, even got a coming the other day, skin.</li>
    <li> Was a great cleanser.  Just confirmed that the formula has changed and the ingredient list is almost twice as long.  Formula is now thicker and smells different and stronger.  My wife and I used this for years and loved it.  Now my wife is breaking out within days of using the new formula.  5/5 for the history we had.  New formula is a 3/5.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser you will find on the market. Leaves your skin really clean and soft. Don&#x27;t need to use a lot and a bottle lasts a while. Have been using for 6 years.</li>
    <li> What a DIFFERENCE in my skin since I started using this product!  Very gentle with a very pleasing fragrance and a small tiny little dabl will lather into a really nice lather, so the bottle will last a loooong time.  Therefore, it&#x27;s a good buy too!  I will always have this in my cabinet, guaranteed!</li>
    <li> I went to a day spa and the aesthetician used this on my sensitive skin.  Since then I have been using it weekly for breakouts and other little skin irritation on my face.  I really love this product.  It&#x27;s good to use consistently for at least a week to tame the flare ups on your skin.  I have sensitive skin and this product does help soothe mild skin issues.  Not overnight, but in a few days things tend to clear up.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This cleanser was recommended by my dermatologist.  The formula works well with my skin, so I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser without any build up or stickiness.</li>
    <li> Only thing that doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout in allergies!</li>
    <li> The smell is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have been using this facial cleanser for almost a year! I am never switching!!! It is perfect to remove makeup and cleanses deep into your pores! Plus it is gentle and organic! I believe it has regulated my oil production as well in my t zone. ABSOLUTELY WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
    <li> This is not the bottle I got and the product inside is not Image.</li>
