<li> I have been using Boss No 6 cologne for a long time.</li>

<li> And after half an hour there&#x27;s nothing left to smell at all..</li>
<li> My issue is that I spent close to $60 for nothing.</li>

    <li> looking for this in a long time and i have been receiving good complements from girls! so good so far</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne of all time. I&#x27;ve been purchasing Hugo Boss #6 cologne for at least 10 years, possibly more. I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but the sandalwood note in this cologne mixes very nice with my natural essence, and the scent seems to last forever. Furthermore, I receive a lot of compliments on #6 and will continue to purchase this cologne indefinitely.</li>
    <li> At least that&#x27;s what one woman told me.&lt;br /&gt;Most women tell me I smell good and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re into women.</li>
    <li> My husband bought a small sample last year before our wedding and recently decided he wanted more. Great value and a very appealing fragrance. It&#x27;s light but has a  very smooth smell.</li>
    <li> I wish this came in 50 gallon drums. Everybody compliments this scent. Wish it was a little less expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> it has a weird hole in the bottom of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This cologne is wonderful!  My husband wears different colognes, but this is always my favorite!  I request him to wear it.</li>
    <li> Muy bien, llego a tiempo y era lo q esperaba. desde Ecuador, vendedor serio y responsable, todo bien nuevamente entrega rapida.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for a friend and he loved it. It came on time and new.</li>
    <li> FAKE... IS NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t express just how amazing this scent is. A light yet lasting scent. My issue is that I spent close to $60 for nothing. The box arrived damaged and had leaked about 1/5 of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Perfect, love the scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using Boss No 6 cologne for a long time. I bought this new 6.7oz from Amazon recently not happy at all. This new cologne doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin or doesn&#x27;t smell like department cologne. I think all this cologne are fake or too old. Also cologne box was broken. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this product for many years now, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered online..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately upon spraying the smell was wrong, and after sitting on the skin for a minute, there&#x27;s nothing that resembles the original fragrance at all.. This smells like cheap vodka from a supermarket, I imagine.. And after half an hour there&#x27;s nothing left to smell at all..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to that, the regular product doesn&#x27;t sting my skin when it hits a freshly shaven face.. This stings like a bugger!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mistake for buying online at this price.. I should have known.. I shall stick to shops where I get the real thing..</li>
    <li> One of the best in the price range.</li>
    <li> Fake Perfume, you spend it in a short time the smell disappears !!! I hope the police investique this North American company that sells these products. The perfume looks like a colony of water, upset !!!</li>
