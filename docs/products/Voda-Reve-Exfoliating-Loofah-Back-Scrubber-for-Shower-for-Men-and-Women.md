<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> these were bought as a gift and the recipient&#x27;s loved them.  Very nice and I might order 2 more for myself and my daughter! Thanks for a very good and reasonable priced product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tall guy and all the loofahs and scrubbers I&#x27;ve previously purchased are just too darned short to get a good scrub. Not this guy...length gives you plenty to work with and its put together well. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Fantastic back scrubber/scratcher</li>
    <li> Where has this been. It has one side with scrubber &amp; other you can just apply body wash. It for anyone who has trouble wash from shoulders to lower back. No more pulled muscles.</li>
    <li> Reaches places nicely</li>
    <li> Great back scrubber for people who are tired of using long handled brushes.  The only thing I would change is that the scrubbing fabric needs to be more rough to properly scrub.  It seems to be too smooth for my liking.</li>
    <li> I think a traditional loofah on a stick would be better, or just as good.  Kind of awkward to use early in the morning when all you really want is hot water, and to be clean.</li>
    <li> This product wants to roll up as you try to pull back and forth across your back.  I wish I had paid the extra  $  and got the best one.  Maybe it would have been better.</li>
    <li> feels good and wooks well</li>
    <li> Seem that product is inconsistent in quality... mine is Hard as a brick. does not bend at all. and gives a TERRIBLE itch! wired ....</li>
    <li> It is a little too hard and not easy to move. Lighter with strong grip would have been better.</li>
    <li> It does what it says, but after using it I prefer a brush for my back.  My wife likes it.</li>
    <li> This back scrubber is the perfect solution for washing your back. I&#x27;m a tall man and it finally solves the problem of making sure all of your body gets scrubbed clean. Love it!</li>
    <li> satisfied with product , received next day.</li>
    <li> One of the straps broke on my second use. I found it awkward to use before the strap broke, so I am not impressed with this product. It went right into the trash.</li>
    <li> very hard to use. only a small part was the scrubber</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband for Christmas. He hasn&#x27;t seen it yet, but it looks to be nice quality. It came with another small scrubber which was also nice. Neither item looks feminine which I like a lot. Perfect stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> Great item and great service.</li>
    <li> Excellent really. My boyfriend is away &amp; I decided to hire a temp lol does the job almost as efficiently.</li>
    <li> Item new and promptly delivered. Reluctant husband loves being able to scrub his own back in &amp;#34;hard to reach places.&amp;#34;  This is a repeat buy for sure.</li>
    <li> fast service. Item us just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Scratches my back.  And i&#x27;m glad i don&#x27;t have to use my nails anymore.  This gives me more relief and also lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on arms and legs and neck too.  Don&#x27;t really get the non scratchy side as it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hanging makes a /_\ triangular shape.  Might collect water from the showerhead.  Not sure how to clean properly</li>
    <li> The handle broke on the second use.  Initially, it appeared to be of good quality but took very for the handle ot pull away from the scrubber.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to get at those hard-to-reach spots on the back and elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say that I do not like this scrubber. It is well made, but it is just too smooth. It is less scrubbing than terrycloth. My old scrubber was a net mesh and more invigorating, but it wore out. I will be looking for another replacement. (And, yes, I know this one has two sides, but for me, they are soft and softer).</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for a long period, but it seems to be what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the recipient absolutely loved it.  I had it mailed to me because of other items I was including with this gift.  It was packaged very well and arrived as stated in excellent condition.  I would definitely recommend this company&#x27;s products without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Great service-exactly as described</li>
    <li> Although I like the feel and functionality of this scrubber enough to give it 5 stars, I must give it 2 because it began ripping at the seam after my first use. It is possible I just received a defective scrubber that caused it to tear, I just wish there was someway I could have it replaced. Good product, but beware of potential durability and longevity issues.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Now I can reach my whole back. It is wonderful and exactly what I wanted.  It also came with a foot scrubber that is excellent.</li>
    <li> The wife LOVES it...Perfect stocking stuffer......</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY HELP YOU KEEP YOUR BACK CLEANER THAN EVER. THIS ONE FOR A MAN WORKS BETTER THAN THE DUAL SIDED BACK SCRUBBER. I LOVE IT. KEEPS YOU BACK AND SIDE CLEANER THAN EVER. A GREAT PRODUCT FOR A CHEAP PRICE.</li>
    <li> Nice product - as pictured</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it was sent in a speedy manner and arrived on time.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Should be wider.  Time will tell if it gets moldy while hanging in the shower.  It is a little on the small side.</li>
    <li> This works great for me, I can hit all the spots. Feels great as well. I believe that it will also be easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great scrubber but the loops on each end are kinda weak mine tore after a week of usage...I sewed it back up..and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I have been undergoing occupational therapy and still have a hard time reaching around my back. This has allowed me to wash my own back.</li>
    <li> This scrubber is just the answer to reaching all those hard to get to spot on your back. It does a gentle job of scrubbing and buffing. Would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Works well, rinse after use or it will not be soft or lather well on next use.</li>
    <li> Back scrubber is great! It arrived on time as expected.</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> Kind of hard to use unless you are flexible.</li>
    <li> It is hard for my wife to use.  She had one from Hawaii that more like a soft towel that you could easily put around your back.</li>
    <li> used this this morning loved the feel of getting the nitty gritty gone lol</li>
    <li> Reaches the spots where your fingers can&#x27;t scratch.  A High Quality Back Cleaner/Scratcher</li>
    <li> Son loves this.  He received as  Christmas present and at 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; wonders now how he lived without it.&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about buying one for myself now.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Throw out those clunky and nasty looking back brushes--this is a very effective and user friendly product.</li>
    <li> The scrubber works perfectly.  It is generous in size and well made.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Very good device in all ways!</li>
    <li> Garbage. So gentle and soft I could use it to soothe the world&#x27;s worst sunburn. No exfoliating feeling whatsoever. I liked the Aquis scrubber much better- http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I20Q72/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_12#</li>
    <li> Loofa part is about 12&amp;#34;, in the center of the scrubber. Wish it was a little longer. The human model they use must be 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; tall, or shorter;-)&lt;br /&gt;It dries out, at 75% humidity, and does not show signs of mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s really helping get my back clean, and getting rid of acne.</li>
    <li> My back is clean without a partner to wash it for me. This product is working great for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this in the shower.  It&#x27;s the best back scratchier I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Buy it for my whole family.  Could stay in the shower for hours!!!!</li>
    <li> The rope handles are not sewed good enough, after one use they pull loose. the back scrubbers are fine. a while back i bought 5 and the handles pulled loose in all 5. i ordered 5 more but i haven&#x27;t tried these yet. you offer to replace them but don&#x27;t tell me how to contact you.</li>
    <li> I always needed one. This one feels good &amp; cleans great!</li>
    <li> Very well made scrubber - loofah section is long enough to cover most of back when pulling it, which is nice as I have rotator cuff problems and can&#x27;t do excessive motion.  I don&#x27;t have to keep repositioning it to cover back from shoulder to lower back.  Entire scrubber length is just as pictured in advertisement.  I also use it on my legs.  Loofah is not excessively rough - does not leave skin scratched (as some loofahs do).  Shipping by company was fast!  Good deal.</li>
    <li> To start with, this product helped me clean my entire back for the first time in a long time! Not only that, but it helped me get over a sensitivity problem with the skin on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema, which causes my skin to be overly sensitive to touch or abrasiveness. For example, a friend slapping my back jokingly? Instant pain and crazy itching sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually helped me get over that problem! Over the course of two weeks, I gradually worked this scrubbing &#x27;tool&#x27; into my shower routine. While it definitely bothered me at first, it now worked my skin to the point where cleaning my back no longer bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was uncomfortable to use at first, but I learned how to position my arms so that it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a man, I have back hair. The main problem I have with this, is that hairs get caught in the material portion. Due to how the fibers are laid out, getting the hairs out is pretty difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while they say this can hold bars of soap, mine definitely cannot. I can&#x27;t even fit a half-used bar of soap into the &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34; area because it looks like the material was manufactured too large on the back part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product! Especially since it&#x27;s a nice balance between soft and exfoliating on the material part. It&#x27;s also fairly priced and arrived as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Worked out really well, it&#x27;s pretty decent quality and the perfect length for me (I&#x27;m 6&#x27; tall)</li>
    <li> Husband love it heavy duty</li>
    <li> Wish I had it sooner.</li>
    <li> Great back scrubber!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this junky thing before.</li>
    <li> The loofah came in the mail fast and it&#x27;s definitely well made! Nice and exfoliating!</li>
    <li> Using it and working just fine.</li>
    <li> bought for my husband. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Husband loves his back scrubbert</li>
    <li> I like this Loofah Back Scrubber, But it could be a little longer in length and a bit longer piece of Loofah!</li>
    <li> Husband loves this! He was never able to scrub his back the way he wanted (unless I did it) until this! GREAT gift for anyone.</li>
    <li> Works as intended and is good quality.</li>
    <li> I wish it were a bit longer.  After a couple uses, I am questioning the longevity.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this back scrubber. It does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> Met expectations and arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Havent used it too many times so far since I just got it. Hoping it will last a long time. Quality looks and feels good. So 5 stars so far!</li>
    <li> Bought it for one of my husbands Christmas gifts. He says his back really appreciates it.</li>
    <li> Much bigger and nicer than expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! When this one wears out, I plan on buying another one!</li>
    <li> I love this scrubber!!  It&#x27;s very well made, and I love that there are two different textures - one side is a loofah and the other side is softer.  I just recently got mine, and it was JUST IN TIME to help me take care of post-sunburn back peeling that I was unable to reach prior to purchasing this!  I found it extremely helpful that there was an information card included that told me how to properly wash/maintain it!  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone considering buying a loofah!</li>
    <li> works great, but the soap keeps falling out of the pocket.</li>
    <li> The scrubber side is pretty comfortable. Not painful like a plastic one would be. The other side is great, too. It&#x27;s soft. It does a better job than my other ones.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok but I find it  difficult to use and it does not get used as often as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Got moldy after just a month</li>
    <li> Better than expected. The extra length compared to others on the market was wonderful.</li>
    <li> the soap falls out of it</li>
    <li> The strap broke on one end after 1st use. It was ok but not worth the price paid for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dog, you say what. My vet showed us this when our dogs back legs started having trouble following the front and she needed help getting around. It is the right length to loop under and hold on too. I need to soften up the scratch-er as the dog is not liking that. Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy this for my back, but It looks like it would work well. My vet liked the picture, it is a good selling point and stands out when looking for your product.</li>
    <li> Received the product in good shape Look forward to getting ing in the shower and using it.</li>
    <li> The loop handles will not stand up to any sort of strain. At least not enough for someone that&#x27;s really looking to scrub their back.</li>
    <li> Finally I can wash all of my back..with the option of a soft scrub or a hard one.  It&#x27;s long enough to get good motion and handles are firm and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Nicely made and effective on the areas of skin I can&#x27;t reach. The loofah surface as a good feel.</li>
    <li> Much better than wooden hadled xcrubber.</li>
    <li> Scrubs skin clean with a pouch for the soap and I use it all over because of its abrasive cleaning power.</li>
    <li> Product as described and delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> It destroyed very quickly, it&#x27;s not a long term product</li>
    <li> Good product good transaction</li>
    <li> Love this back scrubber,  I had the occasion to interact with Janelle in Customer Support.  Fantastic customer service</li>
    <li> HAVE TRIED OTHER BACK LOOFAHS, BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST THAT I HAVE EVER USED!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - really fast shipping!</li>
    <li> a little short and hard to use especially if you are handicapped</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND THINKS ITS THE BEST HE HAS EVER USED.</li>
    <li> not rough enough. Ok quality. Can&#x27;t fold and hang.</li>
    <li> Perfect for washing and exfoliating backs!</li>
    <li> The 2-handled loofah scrubber takes a bit of practice before you can use it effectively. I kept dropping it in the shower. it was easy to rinse out and I hang it on a towel bar to dry out before using it again. I would like to be able to run it through the laundry with the towels from to time since it can pick up bacteria from your skin, but I&#x27;m concerned that&#x27;s it would shred the other fabrics in the washing machine - maybe I&#x27;ll try it on some old towels first, and will post my results later. I received a discounted product in exchange for my evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this &amp;#34;loofah&amp;#34;.  It really is just too soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like it exfoliates at all.  It feels just like a washcloth.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the quality of the back scrubber.  It is extremely helpful for my husband, who has limited movement in his shoulder and finds a back brush difficult to use.  I will follow up on this review if problems occur with the product.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I&#x27;m petite so it&#x27;s kind of big but the handles make it easy to maneuver.</li>
    <li> Rub a dub dub, works great in the tub.  I like it a lot.  I use it in the shower....the only thing i worry about is my elbow breaking my shower glass door.</li>
    <li> Great product; I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> very hard not flexible not exfoliating</li>
    <li> Product is growing fungus.</li>
    <li> The Voda Reve Exfoliation Loofah, feels well made and is easy to use. I personally prefer a loofah that is a little more coarse, but these does seem to do a good job of cleaning.</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully well, gets the places I cannot do unassisted. Thanks for making this product available at such a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> quick ship - cool product</li>
    <li> This has proved to be an excellent loofah for my back acne. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to exfoliate in hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> This should be everyone&#x27;s after work out shower tool. When my arms are swoll after a workout and I hit the shower washing my back is a feeble attempt without this.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> works great, gave up on the brush this is way better and much eaiser to use</li>
    <li> Great idea but stitching exfoliating side is separating and will no longer hold soap</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my needs</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Thanks! Feels great scrubbing my back works much better than a long handle brush..</li>
    <li> This is the first loofah that actually performs well for me.  It doesn&#x27;t fall off a stick and it reaches everywhere I need to scrub.  I love how it is so flexible. I can even exfoliate my arms, feet and legs.  Holding the handles I can get pressure in the hard to reach places. I love the great back scrub I get.  I can hang it in my shower so it is convenient to use and then it can drip &amp; air dry after my shower.  I like the versatility of having a reverse side that is smooth to use when I have an area I do not want to exfoliate.</li>
    <li> arrived with a slot cut into the exfoliating pouch, a bar of soap will fall out the cut.  I still use it since I don&#x27;t use bar soap with it.  It is worth the price.  I would prefer the coarse material on both sides with stronger handles  -  room for improvement - four stars.</li>
    <li> I love this scrubber. I use it with eucalyptus soap which really does a good job.</li>
    <li> A MUST HAVE in the shower, nice n long, easily controlled by handles. It&#x27;s the real deal, exfoliates back n shoulders, feet with a few quick swipes. Loufa type scrub in middle, just take your body shower gel...I use Olay 7, spread it on outside of loufa section n scrub away. I don&#x27;t care to insert a bar of soap...just squirting on middle section n exfoliates the best for sections that get dry n we can&#x27;t reach.Heavenly! Can&#x27;t live without it😊</li>
    <li> Great product. Grt service</li>
    <li> I bought 3 and everyone loved it. Great for the price. Great gift idea.</li>
    <li> Works great - peels that dead skin off your back.  My back has never been healthier.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. The soap pocket is cool and makes so aping up easier.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this back scrubber! It is longer and easier to use; perfect for my tall husband and for me too! I love the pocket for the soap that allows me to clean and exfoliate at the same time. Bottom line, this is the best back scrubber! I&#x27;ll be getting these for \\&quot;spa gifts\\&quot; for family and friends.</li>
    <li> I love love love it!  It makes getting your back so easy! It&#x27;s made well and the straps are so Easy to use to get my back ,shoulders, and even my feet.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I love this back scrubber! I was pretty skeptical with the design. I have always had either just a plain loufa or one of those back scrubbers on a stick. I was pleasantly surprised with how versatile this design makes the scrubber. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She loves exfoliating, and I thought this looked like an easy way to get some good exfoliation action on the back. That&#x27;s always the challenge - reaching the back/shoulders without straining and stretching. This loofah solves the problem. After having this for a few weeks, my wife is insisting that I get my own, so I&#x27;m going to do just that. I have moderate eczema on my back, and this feels amazing and does a great job at exfoliating that dead skin away. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for a family member.  I&#x27;ve had one for several years, and I love it! I&#x27;m sure the recipient will love it as well.  I was impressed with the speed with which this order was delivered.  I will order from you again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my Mother who loves it.  I have no idea how this thing does.  I kept getting emails to leave feedback for this item, so this is it.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. However, a long handled brush works even better. I like this because it&#x27;s easy to take with me when I&#x27;m traveling and not as bulky as a brush.</li>
    <li> Not what I&#x27;ve expected.</li>
    <li> Up-date:  I don&#x27;t know how long these things are supposed to last, but I got mine in June and Thanksgiving is coming up.  I&#x27;ve used it EVERY day since I got it and neither the loofah part or the handles are showing any signs of wear.  I&#x27;ve washed it several times in a mild vinegar solution (as advised) and it still smells fresh and clean.  Pretty good in my very damp bathroom. I&#x27;m more impressed with this product the longer I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should tell you that this is the first loofah I&#x27;ve ever used, so I have nothing to compare it with. I always associated loofahs with spas, and I&#x27;m not really a spa kinda gal.  It turns out that I&#x27;ve been underestimating the advantages of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This back scrubber is 30&amp;#34; long;  34/35&amp;#34; counting the sturdy cord handles.  The loofah part is 11&amp;#34;  Even with my slightly impaired shoulder, I was able to scrub my back with it with no trouble or strain on my arms.  And afterwards, when I sluiced water over my shoulders, I actually FELT it. If you exfoliate regularly, you know what I mean.  It&#x27;s amazing how much difference removing the layers of dead skin makes in how sensitive and smooth your skin feels.  Since I started using this every day, I&#x27;ve had much less trouble with Itchy Shoulder Blade Syndrome, which is the bane of the elderly and others with limited arm mobility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a fine foot scrubber.  I can still reach my feet (which is more than many of my contemporaries can claim) but being able to flip this over the bottoms of your feet and see-saw it back and forth is fast and does a great job.  There&#x27;s a slot behind the loofah where you can stash a cake of soap.  I just rub soap on top first and that works fine.  But if you have a bar of scented soap, it would be very luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to the loofah/exfoliation game, but I can see real advantages to it.  I also think that this would be a wonderful gift to an older friend or relative whose mobility isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  It makes bathing easier, and that&#x27;s got to be a good thing, right? It&#x27;s sturdy and well-made and looks like it will give years of service with proper care.  I was worried that it would stay wet and get moldy,  but I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and it still smell fresh.  My bathroom is VERY damp, so if I&#x27;m not having a problem, you won&#x27;t.  I do plan to wash it regularly in a mild vinegar solution as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free sample provided for review.It makes bathing easier, and that&#x27;s got to be a good thing, right?

    <li> One of these is easier to use than a long-handled back brush, and covers more area on my back at any one time.</li>
    <li> Afterl surgeries that limit my mobility to wash my back, I have found a product that not only exfoliates my skin but is easy to get all the hard to reach places.  I actually feel like all these years I have never cleaned my back the right way. I am thrilled to have discovered this product. It&#x27;s very reasonably priced and we&#x27;ll worth every penny you pay for it!</li>
    <li> I have been really impressed by this product!  I love the long straps which help me get my whole back.  My husband is 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; and he&#x27;s been stealing it because it&#x27;s easier for him to use this to get his huge back.  The material isn&#x27;t too rough, but just rough enough to exfoliate nicely. And the smooth side finishes the job nicely!  I hope to try out more products by Voda Reve in the future!</li>
    <li> I am experiencing breakouts on my back and have been looking for something to do a better job of washing in the shower. It&#x27;s easy to use, it&#x27;s rough enough to exfoliate, but the pressure is what you  make it. I am very happy with it, use it and hang it to dry, couldn&#x27;t be simpler.</li>
    <li> As advertised, firm but not rough on the back; next best thing to a back rub ;)</li>
    <li> Just what we have been looking for. It is just the right length.</li>
    <li> This back scrubber is worth every penny!  A brush just doesn&#x27;t do the job but this back scrubber totally fits the bill.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My first-ever negative review. Bought two of these and they both fell apart (split along the length of the loofa pad) after just 3 or 4 uses. Unbelievable. Highly recommend the Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber instead.</li>
    <li> I Love what this scrubber has done for my back! It&#x27;s made my back so incredibly smooth, but my son keeps stealing it from me! He plays football and he was complaining that he was getting bumps and acne on his back. He used the loofah side of the scrubber once and his back immediately started improving. Now I cant hardly get it back from him. Looks like I will be purchasing another one of these scrubbers for me to keep in my shower, and I better get another for my husband while I&#x27;m at it! I would highly recommend this back scrubber to anyone!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. This exfoliating back scrubber is just perfect for the shower. Long enough to reach the middle of your back, but supple enough to buff your shoulders, knees, elbows, well you get the idea. Rinses out beautifully and dries overnight, just an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This so good I love it&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I used this scrubber twice before one of the hand straps came loose.  Used it again, and the other side of the strap came loose and the strap fell off.  So I am now trying to sew it  back on.  Not impressed with the durability of the product obviously.  However, I do think it is doing a credible job for what I bought it for—rubbing the bottoms, sides, and heels of my feet.  Due to arthritis, I am unable to cross my legs to use other products and this appears to be my best solution yet for my feet.</li>
    <li> Does the job of back scrubbing.  The handles seem a little flimsy, so I am hoping it will hold up and I wish the scrubbing surface was a little rougher and bigger, but after five uses, so far so good.</li>
    <li> This scrubber has a soap pouch and provides you with a scrubbing side and a gentler polishing side. It also comes with a skin polisher for those areas around the feet that may have loose skin or slightly callus areas.  Who knows, for those with hands the size of a bear paw it might even work as a finger nail file! An addition bonus, it arrived on the estimated date of delivery.</li>
    <li> One rope broke (became unstitched) after about 3 weeks.  Nice feel overall.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Love the small pocket where you can slip in a bar of soap. Perfect length for scrubbing your back., Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised; long enough to cover my 6 &#x27; 4&amp;#34; frame;fast delivery</li>
    <li> A guys backs scrub . My boyfriend  loves it.</li>
    <li> Good quality and the wife likes it so that&#x27;s all that is important.</li>
    <li> Like thwe brush a little better, but a nice product none the less.</li>
    <li> Looks like a &#x27;freebie&#x27; you get when you buy cologne. Lasted about 1 month. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> It bunched in one place (inside the back scrubber), so it&#x27;s akward to use.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the string/handle pulled out of the loofah on one end the first time I used it.  I assume from poor stitching. It is still usable and could be easily repaired.  I have replaced it since with one from another store which I paid $3.00 for.  The replacement seams to be better made.</li>
    <li> as pictured, shipped on time..</li>
    <li> Great seller and came quick! Very pleased and it works great. They even included a foot scrubber with it. Awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> This back scrubber should come with that model using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to Mary - a woman I know who wanted a loofah but couln&#x27;t reach around to use it.  She reports she&#x27;s very satisfied but wishes the loofah side was more full of loofah.  This is practically a 12 star rating from Mary, who is a known curmudgeon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Voda Reve!</li>
    <li> I really like the Loofah Back Scrubber, although being a bit uncoordinated and not as flexible as I was when I was younger, I find it to be a bit difficult to use. I also ordered a long-handled back brush from Kmart and use the two interchangeably, with satisfactory results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product concept for me as I have shoulder issues and need something to help wash my back. I really like the feel and reach of the back scrubber and highly recommend it based on performance and ease of use. I wrote a review a few weeks back giving it 3 stars because one side of the string/rope handles broke and provided additional detail around that particular issue. Customer support apparently saw my review and independently reached out to me. They apologized, attributed the issue to a manufacturing issue, and provided a replacement product at no charge and within a very short time frame of addressing the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since used it, stretched it, and abused it to see how it would hold up and it seems they are correct that it was a glitch in the manufacturing process. The stitching holds with no observable sign of weakness. Based on their excellent customer service support and reusing the product, albeit for a brief time so far, I have revised my rating from 3 to 5 stars. It is very good and other benefits I mentioned in my prior review (i.e., ease of drying, use of rougher scrubber for exfoliation, soft, retains soap, ease of cleaning) remain true for this replacement product. Overall, it performs as advertised and recommend it without hesitation. It is particularly helpful for those with limited range of motion that have a need for a good back cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> After two years of use my loofa on a wooden handle finally petered out and I decided to try this Back Scrubber thinking&lt;br /&gt;that it will work better, i.e., from top to bottom.  And it did and it doesn&#x27;t come any better than that</li>
    <li> After having a wonderful loofah for many years, I decided to get another one.  I couldn&#x27;t find one similar to the one that I had so I ordered this one.  It is ok but very thin and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting a good exfoliation out of it. However, I will use until I find another one similar to the one I used to have.</li>
    <li> The strap that you use to move it nearly ripped off the main body right away (1st use).</li>
    <li> Used for the first time today...looks promising.</li>
    <li> This works as described. I use the exfoliating side first then I buff with the smooth side.  The strap handels are not sewn all the way through and I worry they might come out or off.  The exfoliating side gets hard when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Pleased with my purchase -I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> This Back Scrubber is of a very good Quality and should last a long time.Exfoliating the skin is crucial for the body. It allows the skin to breathe, which is good for a healthy appearance.A good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great loofah! I would highly recommend it to anyone. The long straps make it very convenient to reach the back and shoulders without being awkward and uncomfortable. I got one for myself and even the hubby, so you know that its good when the hubby wants one:) The natural material has been great for exfoliating with just enough scrub (I even used it on my face-not too soft and not too rough) I have used other loofah&#x27;s and scrubbers where I have felt they weren&#x27;t doing anything or were just too abrasive. There is even a pocket on this loofah where you can place soap which I found very helpful. Maintenance on this loofah has been easy. Simply rinse, wring out, air dry and if you feel you need further cleaning you can clean with water and vinegar, all natural. I have enjoyed this loofah by Voda Reve and look forward to using more of their products in the future. Thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;It has been 10 months since my purchase and I am still very satisfied with the Voda Reve Loofah!&lt;br /&gt;I love low maintenance and this has held up to my expectations. I simply rinse the loofah after use, squeeze out excess water, a little reshaping so it lays flat for next use, but then I just hang it on a hook in my shower to air dry. The surface hasn&#x27;t lost that exfoliating roughness that I like...and I am still using it!!! I know with past scrubbing products, they have gotten too soft or yucky being left in the shower, but this loofah has worked great for me! not to forget, the hubby&#x27;s is still hanging next to mine:)&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job! I would still recommend this loofah. Thanks Voda Reve for making a good product!</li>
    <li> Very Speedy, condition - excellent, brand new.  Loved the bonus foot thingy too...thank you!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price</li>
    <li> Good product,works well.</li>
    <li> really good quality!! So glad I chose this one even though it was a little more money. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Works great.  I feels great on your back.  I apply liquid soap on the loofa sponge part and go to work with a vigorish scrubbing action.  My back feels great after the shower.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I went back to my old loofah on a stick. These are a little awkward.</li>
    <li> Very well made. The handles on each end are sturdy.  Having 2 different sides is great, plus the pouch for bar soap is a terrific way to use up those &#x27;almost gone&#x27; bars that are not big enough to use.</li>
    <li> Works great. Was hoping for a tad bigger scrubbing area.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of this type of back scrubber. The product is as advertised, but for me, I may need a different material with more scrubbing potential. Good item for the price though</li>
    <li> Love this back scrubber.  Not so harsh that it tears your skin, and the  &amp;#34;polisher&amp;#34; is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for just a few weeks now, but have found it works as advertised.  I faced a little bit of a learning curve as to how best to access all areas of my back - wish the Loofah area was a little longer but I&#x27;m getting the hang of it.  I use it on my legs and feet as well.  It definitely leaves my skin feeling well-scrubbed and I&#x27;ve already seen improvement in my skin.  I haven&#x27;t run across any issues thus far that would give me concern as to the quality or likely longevity of the scrubber.  I consider this to have been a wise purchase and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Too smooth. Almost like using a soft rag. I had one in the past that was rough and would get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great product and value</li>
    <li> I had given up buying back scrubbers because they never seem to work well...but now my search is over!  I have dry skin and am constantly needing to exfoliate and nothing has ever worked well!  With this scrubber it is so easy to get to every bit of your back without a massive workout!  Plus it feels so good...not too rough but rough enough! It even works great on your feet to give them a good exfoliation and rub down!  My husband is tall and always has a hard time getting a back scrubber that works for him but now he is in love!  It has even helped clear up some acne on his back..bonus!  Can&#x27;t wait to purchase this for my friends and family so they can enjoy it as well!  Thank you Voda Reve!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you would expect. A good all round back scrubber.  The soap holder works for liquid soap not really any solid soap...but all in all terriffic</li>
    <li> A superb buying experience, superb product, shipping arrived before expectation. My back is happy assisting in making the rest of me happy and possibly healthier.</li>
    <li> It works ok, but I think it&#x27;s too short for the western men size, it&#x27;s hard to use it for it&#x27;s main purpose, that it&#x27;s scrubbing your back. I have to adopt some awkward position with my arms in order to scrub my back. Also, one of the handles broke only after the third use. I would not recommend this product unless they make it longer and with more sturdy handles, basically the length of a regular bathroom towel (that&#x27;s the reason why they all are that size, so you can dry your back).</li>
    <li> Great product. Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> well made but soap does not stay on long enough yet hope this is because it&#x27;snew</li>
    <li> The back scrubber arrived, and looked fine.  I positioned like I would to scrub my back.  The seam on one of the handles gave out.  I really did not apply any pressure.  I returned it, and have my refund.</li>
    <li> A well made, very handy product. JR-NYC</li>
    <li> Works well and as described.</li>
    <li> I love this loofah! I have dry, itchy skin that feels so much better after using the scrubber to exfoliate. My skin has never felt so soft or so clean. I finally can reach part of my back that I couldn&#x27;t get with a washcloth. Using it makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa, particularly with some aromatherapy shower gel squeezed into it. It&#x27;s a good length, and it&#x27;s easy to clean and store, which was important to me. Also loved the free heel scrubber that came in the package. The heel scrubber is spa-quality too. I&#x27;d get this again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> just wish there was a smaller version for small women...but it works great</li>
    <li> It fell apart second time I used it!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This is great for lathering up the back and scrubbing. It has a pocket for a bar of soap so it can soap up and clean your back with little fuss.</li>
    <li> I think the Loofah could be about 5 or 6 inches longer and my girl friend thinks it is a little hard to use. But over all it is ok.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, this is the best loofah, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star for rope handles almost ready to fall off after one bath.&lt;br /&gt;No, I am not pulling on it too hard, - bunch of people report exactly same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they should have done is use one piece of rope, in a ring, all around and sewed in.</li>
    <li> Have only had it for a week or so. Good product. Prefer this over back brush.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Voda Reve Exfoliating Loofah Back Scrubber!!!! The packaging included use and care instructions which I found quite helpful.  When moistened the loofah expands considerably, providing a good area of coverage when scrubbing the body. The design of the long handles with wash cloth makes it comfortable and easy to use when scrubbing the back shoulders and neck and the hidden pocket for the bar of soap makes it efficient and provides a good lather. The best benefit of all  is my skin feels softer after each use. I have used back scrubber brushes in the past, which require awkward twisting and turning to scrub hard-to-reach places. I definitely prefer this loofah back scrubber which is easier to use, has a greater area of coverage and leaves my skin feeling great! This product is very well made and dries quickly between uses.  I will be letting family and friends know about this great find and also plan to buy more as stocking stuffers this Christmas!</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Like the large size.  Works great.</li>
    <li> like most items made in China it&#x27;s a piece of (*&amp;^%) only thing good for is to fill garbage can</li>
    <li> It takes a few times to get use to using it but definitely gets to places your arms cannot reach.  Perfect for exfoliating right under your shoulders.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s very well made and long enough I don&#x27;t have to become a contortionist (that&#x27;s &amp;#34;double-jointed&amp;#34; to all my friends in Rio Linda), to use it.  I comes nicely packaged and delivery was very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will make great stocking stuffers, so I&#x27;m ordering more. Thanks a lot!!!</li>
    <li> They are as ordered.  Since they are gifts, I do not know how good or bad they may be.  Hoping they are wonderful and enjoyed.</li>
    <li> Great way to exfoliate your back and relieve itchy, dry skin.</li>
    <li> Product is great!  But what is even better is the customer service from Bixore!!!!  I plan on doing more business with them in the future for sure!  Thanks!!!!!</li>
    <li> Use gently....was a bit harder and smaller loofah in middle but like the fact that it has handles. Hang to dry. Cleaning instructions were included. Much better than the wooden handle one I used previously.</li>
    <li> Fast service. Product as described</li>
    <li> The scrubber arrived on time and was packaged nicely.  It is a present and I know my daughter is just going to love this!  It looks great.</li>
    <li> Great product! Bought as gifts.</li>
    <li> Was exactly as mentioned, and got here on time. Thank you, would order again. It is a gift so I havent used it.</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly as described.</li>
    <li> These are great, especially for the winter months when your skin is all dried out. I use the loofah, then moisturize.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay - but once you have used it once, it gets very stiff.  And even re-wetting it with warm water does not make it as malleable as it had been.  But it still does the job okay.</li>
    <li> I got his for my husband and he loves it. It&#x27;s strong and durable and really cleans his back better than any other thing he has tried.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Fabulous product , will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great scubber, really gets the skin tingling</li>
    <li> arrived safe and sound, and right on time.</li>
    <li> I had been contemplating a back scrubber that would work.  I&#x27;ve been suffering from back itches for a long while, and thought of a loofah scrubber long enough to enable self-scrubbing.  This one addressed my need, and I&#x27;m quite satisfied!  For now!  I hope it serves me for a long while.</li>
    <li> Great item, Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this product for quite some time.  I love the width and the grips...  This product is amazing for keeping the skin on your back as soft and healthy as can be.</li>
    <li> Just tried it for the first time today, LOVE it, been wanting one of these for a long time!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised, long and sturdy enough for a 5&#x27;8 guy. Does the trick of getting to the back that your hands just won&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing</li>
    <li> Works great when your back just needs a good scratching as well as washing when in the tub/shower.</li>
    <li> Was too soft to make me feel like it&#x60;s actually cleaning!!! I wanted to use it for my post workout shower but I regret buying it now :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite arthritic, so it does allow me to wash my back a bit more easily. But it&#x27;s not quite the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; I was hoping for. All in all, I use it, and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one for years but hadn&#x27;t found another one until now.  It helps me keep my back more clean and to slough off surface cells.  And to reach any part of my back if I get an itch!  I use it daily.  This one arrived quickly as ordered, all good.  Lacking 1 star only because the one I already have is slightly less wide--maybe 3/4&amp;#34; more narrow, and I like a little more narrow better, in order to work around the bumps, hollows, and corners of my back.  This has a loop on each end, good for holding onto while using, but also good for hanging on a hook behind your bathroom door or wherever.  I use mine mostly on my back, but it also feels good all over--around my legs, arms, lightly across my stomach.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Exfoliating Loofah is not scrubbing my back</li>
    <li> It scrubs and can be used easily on the back but when it dries, the loufa hardens and takes a while to soften up on the next use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. It&#x27;s effective without being too abrasive. Great seller!</li>
    <li> just tired it this morning and it was a wonderful experience, for those who have never tired one should, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> She loves it and we both use it. Was a stocking stuffer for wife&#x27;s 2014 Christmas.</li>
    <li> Perfect for getting those hard to reach areas of your back...</li>
    <li> excellent for reaching your full back..feels good</li>
    <li> Gave it to my significant other; he loves it.  Reaches his whole back, not just the shoulders like his bath/shower brush did.</li>
    <li> works great!&lt;br /&gt; bought it for my hubby and it&#x27;s just what he wanted&lt;br /&gt;great for the back</li>
    <li> Works great - very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Very convenient and useful. Good products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for reaching those hard to reach reach on your back.  My middle back and shoulders have never been this smooth before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and great product.</li>
    <li> A fine quality product that we really enjoy.</li>
    <li> Put it to use within 15 minutes of delivery....worked great....</li>
    <li> It works better for me than my back brush and with my limited range of motion and painful shoulders, it&#x27;s just what I needed.</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading. The loofah actually has curled up (widthwise ) so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat on my back. I only get about an inch or two of contact on my back. I get the result I want but it seems like it needs to be stiffened along the width so it lays flat.</li>
    <li> Sooooo much better than using back scrubbers on a stick! They almost always fell apart and were uncomfortable in my hand. It was hard to comfortably and thoroughly scrub my back.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great! For the first time I can comfortably scrub all of my back! The product is well made - looks like it will last a long time. The loofah side provides a nice scrub without being too stiff or scratchy. The other side is soft and cushiony and gives you soft soothing wash. I love it that there is a pocket to hold a bar of soap - so convenient. It took just a little practice to figure out the best way to hold the handles to maneuver the the scrubber over my back but now I use it to wash all of my backside even down to my buttocks. And for the first time the skin on my back feels really clean and smooth - no more itchy skin!</li>
    <li> I product is good but it could be longer for more ease of use.</li>
    <li> One of the two sides of the string broke. I have used for less than five days. Un-fortunately, I will not send it back, it would take a week for the item to dry out. Maybe the thread that holds the string should be better sew on. Triple stich? Can not contact seller because, if you answer other issue, the program directs us to Amazon. Great idea, but needs to be better stich.</li>
    <li> Fell apart after 2 uses. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This loofah thing is awesome. I could write a long review of pros and cons but just buy it. I know it looks ridiculous and people will judge you for it. But say goodbye to back acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions, comment and I&#x27;ll try to answer.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and customer service. I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for quite some time and I haven&#x27;t been able to find as quality of a product as this one. I used it in the shower this morning and it was beyond expectation. I&#x27;m surprised by the quality of the design-it seems very durable. Thanks to the seller for quick response to my questions, and fast shipping. I will be ordering more for other family members.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my new Voda ReveTM Exfoliating Back Scrubber, wish I had discovered something like it years ago. The first time I used it I heard some snapping sound in the handle and realized it would not withstand to much arm pressure while using. The second time I used it one of the handles snapped and is just a long hanging string now. I don&#x27;t care. I can still hold on to the ends of the thing and it works find. If you are a dainty person without much upper body strength it probably won&#x27;t break. It&#x27;s still a good scrubber. Peace.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; part of the loofah isn&#x27;t scratchy or rough.  I was kinda hoping for it to be a little scratchy/rough.  It does a great job though.</li>
    <li> Having gotten much older, using a wash rag to clean the back has become more difficult.  The Loofa Back Scubber for showers was a perfect replacement.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Its a little hard to get the soap out after use, otherwise is ok and does what its supposed to</li>
    <li> Does a great job, especially for the bigger guy, ,makes it easier to get to those middle of the back spots.</li>
    <li> Received the back scrubber within two days of ordering the product.  I love the quality and the ease with which I can now get to every part of my back in the shower.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; long. Great loofah material for a good scrub. Well made,</li>
    <li> Better than brush. Happy with my purchase and your service.</li>
    <li> I have previously purchased the brushes, the loofas and the various other back scrubbing options. I LOVE that this one has the rough loufa and the softer cotton on the other side, the pouch is big enough to handle a full bar of soap making it easy to store and use. I am pretty tall (6&#x27;1) and this not only works great on my back but also on really scrubbing off dead skin prior to shaving my legs. Will order more in the future for gifts and as needed. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! Previously I had been using a hand held brush- but couldn&#x27;t reach my entire back. With this I am able to exfoliate-leaving my back very soft.</li>
    <li> I thiink everyone should have one of these! I am a 6&#x27; 1&amp;#34; female, but even if I were, this would be perfect for me. I just love their loofah and they way I can exfoliate my back with ease!  Ideal for men too!</li>
    <li> I found the back scrubber a great tool for reaching all of my back.  I love it. It was a pleasure dealing with Bixore through Amazon Marketplace with the little problem I had.  They were so quick to respond and immediately  replaced the torn one. I recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a smooth back.</li>
    <li> This is simply a great loofah! Great quality and makes back scrubbing so much easier. I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> rope broke immediately</li>
    <li> cords on the end are already coming unsewed. Other than that it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> The back scrubber is just what I needed. It was difficult for me to wash my back with the brush but holding the scrubber in one hand and the other hand helped me to get where I could not before.  The best thing is that I can scrub the bottom of my feet which is great.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but the straps  are an issue</li>
    <li> Rope handles pulled out within a week of use.</li>
    <li> great product.. great service</li>
    <li> Great product.Really gets the hard to reach spots</li>
    <li> This scrubber is really great. I wish I had ordered one months ago. It is easy to use, easy to clean and it makes my skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> More clutter for the shower.  Left to drip dry and mildew appeared.</li>
    <li> helpful product. does just what it says</li>
    <li> It was not the quality that my previous loofa were. The loofa part was not as good.</li>
    <li> Ahhhh, a loofah-like back scrubber - feels sooo good, and it&#x27;s long enough to reach all the right places. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great product shipped very quickly. I love the fact it also has a pouch for soap and made of good quality material. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> 1st roped handle broke off after one week and the 2nd broke off after 2.</li>
    <li> Not really what I was expecting I guess. There is a ridge in the inside that makes using a little difficult.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Somewhat small in the center loofah. Nicely made but thought it would cover more of an area.</li>
    <li> I would have rated this 5 star if it were just a little bit longer.  Other than that, this back scrubber works fine - even on the bottom of your feet.</li>
    <li> I like the back scrubber. It could be improved by extending the  Exfoliating part.</li>
    <li> Works great for scrubbing my back.</li>
    <li> Never wrote a review before. Ordered this to help manage some back acne, works really great especially with acne fighting soap. It came with some small paddle with some kind of rough sand paper thing on it, maybe it&#x27;s to keep the rough part of the loofa still rough? I don&#x27;t know. The product is great though I&#x27;ve noticed significant improvement, there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to miss a spot with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Voda Reve Exfoliating Loofah Back Scrubber for 5 days now and can already see and feel the results. I will be buying several more. I have highly recommended thei Loofa Back Scrubber to friends.</li>
    <li> Works well though you need to soak it in the shower for a bit to get the luffa to soften</li>
    <li> Great product; really works great!!</li>
    <li> Great for massages on the back!</li>
    <li> bought as a gift. looks good will get my self one some time.</li>
    <li> Buy it!!  You will not be disappointed.  It is SO well made, it should last you for years.  I&#x27;m addicted now.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this product is as described if not better.  Your skin will love it and you will love your skin.</li>
    <li> Strings came off after third use</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. Just as described. Loved getting the follow up email from the company too!</li>
    <li> Loved how smooth my back felt after using it.</li>
    <li> Handle broke on third use. Will not purchase any more of their products.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  He loves it!  Great quality.</li>
    <li> I love my Exfoliating Loofah Back Scrubber.  It&#x27;s just perfect for me and everything I expected.  I have arthritis and cleaning my back is difficult until now.  I was surprised how easy it was to use and my back feels so clean and tingly after i use my back scrubber.  It&#x27;s hanging in my shower, ready for the next use.  Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he loved it.  It is long enough for a tall man to use with ease.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a couple days until the stitching started coming undone along the side of it with the cushioning in the middle falling out, and stitching towards the top handles also coming undone. I attached some photos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2/5/15: As you can see they contacted me right away about the defective product and sent me out a new one via overnight shipping. They were extremely nice about the issue I had. I have received the new scrubber, I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times though. This one hasn&#x27;t had the issue my other one had yet, so I&#x27;m happy so far! It&#x27;s a great back scrubber.</li>
    <li> Much better than a brush as it is easier to use and get to the areas on your back that are tough to reach.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to wring dry and it gets lumpy when wet so it doesn&#x27;t make even contact with your body when you use it. It is a nice product but has a few downfalls.</li>
    <li> Does not handle as well as I had hoped!</li>
    <li> Works, just OK. The loofah is stiff and wont bend when it is used. The grips do not seem sturdy enough to use the pressure needed to bend it. I may soften in the future but given reviews of the weakness in the &amp;#34;handels&amp;#34;  I dont believe it will last that long.</li>
    <li> Great...works wonders.</li>
