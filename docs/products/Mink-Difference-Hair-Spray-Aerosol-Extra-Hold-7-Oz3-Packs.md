<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the reviews I read that was positive I found to be true. it is a good hold (not heavy) and does not have the strong odor of some hairsprays. it is also a good price!</li>
    <li> Driving a convertible with fine hair makes hairspray an almost necessity. This leaves your hair feeling almost natural. Brushes out easily and quickly for unexpected &amp;#34;encounters&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My mother is in her 90&#x27;s and has used this product for many years. She loves it, so when she was unable to find it in our local department stores, etc. she thought all was lost. So, I tried Amazon to see if it was available and I found a 3 pack of Mink Hairspray. Thanks to Amazon for making my mother so happy. Other products were heavy on her hair and unable to comb but Mink does it all for her, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years...it&#x27;s the best for extra fine hair.  (haven&#x27;t been able to find it the local stores lately)</li>
    <li> love this hairspray, smells good, holds well without hair feeling stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> Has always been my favorite hairspray and lives up to its name....so soft and  silky feeling and never sticky even in humid conditions.</li>
    <li> I have. used Mink for over twenty years.  It may be used as a holding spray or styling  product.  Does not  build up on the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who has used it for years. It is hard to find. I am glad it is still available via the internet. She thinks this is the best hair spray made. She will not use any other spray.</li>
    <li> We were very pleased to find Mink Hair Spray available.  It is no longer available in the our stores.  Thank you for the quick shipment.</li>
    <li> Best Hair Spray Ever! I have bought expensive brands from Salon&#x27;s &amp; always went home washed my hair again, style &amp; use my Mink to hold my hair! Hard to locate now, I&#x27;m a loyal customer for over 15-20+ years, I&#x27;ve used this product for as long as I can remember&gt;?I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores now {2010}, around 4 years ago, I could sparingly find it here &amp; there, sometimes on a bottom shelf in a Grocery or Drug store, then I had to start asking retailers to please stock it! No one would/could do so, so I started my on-line search &amp; found it on Amazon! It is the ONLY hair spray that holds your hair&#x27;s style, &amp; you can still easily run a brush or comb through it with ease! A Big advantage to \\&quot;MINK\\&quot; -it smells wonderful! Like perfume*for your hair, &amp; softness you do NOT find in other hair sprays!&lt;br /&gt;I am \\&quot;Brand Loyal\\&quot; and highly recommend this product! If I had more time, I&#x27;d post a video of soft, bouncy hair after spraying a style! Tash in SC.</li>
    <li> Wish I could still buy this in stores, but seems to no longer be available.  However, as long as I can get it online, I will be ok.  Have been using this hairspray for 20 years or more.  Actually remember the day a friend recommended it to me.  I tried it and never went to anything else. I tried some others over the years, but none were as good as MINK.  Not even the pricey hair salon sprays.  I think I like it better than other sprays because it is light and yet holds hair firmly in place.  Then, it brushes out easily with no stickiness.</li>
    <li> This product is the best, makes your hair soft, but firm enough for a slight wind. You may brush your hair without worring about the hairspray pulling your roots out of your scalp. I have used this product in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, but was upset that most stores in my area do not provide this great product. I have purchased over 20 this time, and have given to family members to enjoy. Hey, I would try it, since the price is not that bad, and I bet you will like it...</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000RCLXFC Mink Difference Hair Spray, Aerosol Extra Hold - 7 Oz,3 Packs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aerosol version of this product is a let down.  The original pump spray was a winner leaving hair shiny and brushing out without a trace.  Since it is no longer to be found anywhere, I ordered the aerosol and now regret having purchased 6 containers.  It does not hold my hair the same as the pump spray, it is a diluted version.  It still brushes out without leaving any white powdery residue in my hair, as most all other hairsprays, but I miss the original that I used for so many years.  Hope the pump version makes its way back into the market soon.</li>
    <li> Customers please be aware this is an aerosol spray not a pump.  I ordered it thinking it was pump.  Apparently Mink is not producing the pump anymore which is a shame!!  It&#x27;s the best hair spray on the market and I&#x27;ve been using it for 25 years!!  Okay Mink, fess up!  Why are you not making this anymore???  Am disappointed....</li>
    <li> Mink hairspray is by far the best!  Couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore &amp; after a little research, I found it at WALGREEN&#x27;S.  I just wished they would sell the \\&quot;humidity\\&quot; one in the copper colored can.  But I am not going to be choosy!  At least they carry the regular one!  If anyone knows where the other one can be purchased, please let me know.  Barb</li>
    <li> I have used this hair spray for a very long time and I love it. I must say not every where sells it. The service was great with ordering it .I highly recommend ordering from this company. The only thing I felt the cost of shipping was a little high.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best hairspray I ever used.  I can no longer find it in drug stores or Harmon&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is great because it doesn&#x27;t have a nasty smell like some do. It seemed to hold well, but I don&#x27;t think I would label it as &amp;#34;extra firm&amp;#34; hold. More medium.</li>
    <li> Local Walgreens stopped carrying this so I&#x27;m forced to order it but don&#x27;t like any other product as well as Mink.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find Mink in the stores. I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s easy to find it through Amazon. This product is the best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s never sticky.</li>
    <li> Great buy since it is no longer  carried in stores!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over 30 years...lived in Michigan, used it there--then moved to Arizona, and continued buying it.  So far, Walgreens was the only place I could buy it -- now they&#x27;re all discontinuing buying it for their shelves...why, I don&#x27;t know.  It&#x27;s such a good seller, and I won&#x27;t use any other brand, because Mink does not leave your hair stiff or sticky, brushes out easily.  I checked with 3 different Walgreen stores, and they didn&#x27;t have any...at the 4th store I checked at least a store employee said she would place an order, and call me when it comes in....I was thrilled.  Other than that, you&#x27;ll have to go online and buy it from Amazon.com or any other website you can find it on.</li>
    <li> I stopped using hair spray for years, but the hair style I have now necessitates it.  I was pleased that this old standard that I used for years was still out there!  YAY!</li>
    <li> this has been the only hairspray my DAD has used for many years, he still has a full head of hair. just wish it were more easily available, and at a lower price</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, can&#x27;t find it in my local stores anymore, so I buy it by the case on Amazon.Great hold without stiffness. I get compliments on my purfume all the time. I don&#x27;t wear any. It&#x27;s the hairspray!</li>
    <li> This is a reasonably priced product that does a great job of holding my hair in place without making it look like it is glued together. I tried it because I was tired of the look I got with the cheap hair sprays from places like Wal-Mart, and I did not want to spend what the salons charge for their sprays. This fit the bill, and I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I have used Mink Difference hair spray for 20 some years I think.  It holds without being stiff or sticky in humidity.  Even if the wind is blowing, my hair style holds all day.  I cannot find this hair spray in stores any more so was grateful to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Got one bottle out of three that actually sprays I was pissed because I love this item...!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and I love it. It does not feel like you have spray on but holds well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this brand! It is so sad that this brand is no longer sold in most stores.  I have used Mink since I was 13 years old! Nothing works better with my curly long hair and smells as pleasant. I can&#x27;t tell you how many complements I have received over the years for how nice I smell. I don&#x27;t use any perfumed products since I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances. This one is mild enough that I can wear it everyday. It hold my hair very well. I usually spray my wet curls and it keeps them right without crunchiness after my hair is dry.  I use it on my dry hair too and it holds it well for all my activities.  Please don&#x27;t stop making this product. I&#x27;ve tried so many others and nothing compares to Mink. Either they are too fragrant or too sticky or not sticky enough. Mink is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped my order quickly and nicely package. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. It is a soft hold and not sticky.  Very difficult to find in stores so I was so happy to find it online!</li>
    <li> I think this is the best hair spray ever......for my hair anyway.  It is a great product and has been around for many years.  I used it in the 80&#x27;s, and 90&#x27;s.  Then I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  I&#x27;m so thrilled I checked Amazon.  Is there anything that Amazon does not carry?</li>
    <li> The smell is old woman hairspray smell and it just doesn&#x27;t hold as good as Tigi&#x27;s Hard Head.  I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s just not worth using all three cans until I can repurchase Hard Head.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> This is great hair spray.  Last time I bought it the label said it was &amp;#34;cruelty free.&amp;#34; It is so hard to find hair spray in an aerosol that is cruelty free.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray known to man. It is flexible and holds well without appearing as if you have sprayed down your hair with hairspray, I do not like for my hair to be stiff and look stiff but this is amazing stuff. I have a hard time finding it in stores and was tickled to be able to buy three packs at such a great price.  Please don&#x27;t stop making this product....</li>
    <li> I used to use water free spray by Matrix, but they discontinued that a while go.  This is a pretty good substitute.  While it doesn&#x27;t have the super flexible dry hold (meaning it get&#x27;s a little hard) it smells incredible has great hold and shine.  Goes a long way too!</li>
    <li> I have been using Mink hair spray for the last 20 years, I love the way it holds your hair, and never gets sticky. I havce a hard time finding it in the stores, and when I do find it I pick up all that they have.  Latley I have found no Mink anyware, so I had My husband find it on line, and ordered 9 cans.  Thank you for the best hair spray in the world.  Jane Danek</li>
    <li> my favorite for years</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!!  I am so happy to find it on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> this is a great hair spray and my Mother says its her favorite and i like it too.  works for us</li>
    <li> I have used it for years! It is the best for my long fine hair which I wear up during the day. It easily brushes out. Often I am complimented on my fragrance when I am only wearing my Mink hairspray. I can&#x27;t find Mink in the stores near me but I won&#x27;t change brands so I order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> nothing special to me. My hair is fine and it&#x27;s not much of a hold and no added shine</li>
    <li> It is the only hairspray that my wife will use, it makes it easy for me to get her something she likes.  She has been a user of Mink for a long time and it has never let her down, and again it makes it easy for me!</li>
    <li> It holds my hair in place without making it feel like straw.  My hair is still soft, not sticky or stiff feeling but stays in place.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and it works great. It comes to the front door quickly so we don&#x27;t have to try and find it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I want to love it but it actually does smell like the hairspray my mother used 40 years ago when I was a kid.  It&#x27;s fine.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up in my hair and it holds without being too sticky.  I just don&#x27;t love it because I am still mourning the loss of the discontinued Dove damage therapy hairspray and I can&#x27;t seem to find a good replacement for it.  This isn&#x27;t bad!  Actually better than some of the more expensive sprays I have tried.</li>
    <li> The best hair spray I have ever used. It holds while keeping hair soft. I also love the fragrance too.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t see but your hair knows it&#x27;s there</li>
    <li> What can I say that others have not already said.  The best hair spray made.  Was very glad to find it on amazon after my local Walgreen&#x27;s quit carrying it.</li>
    <li> Best spray ever..my hair looks totally. natural. but doesn&#x27;t. blow around!</li>
    <li> Holds really well without the &amp;#34;helmet&amp;#34; look.  And doesn&#x27;t have an offensive odor.</li>
    <li> Have used Mink Difference for years, and as far as I am concerned, it is without a doubt one of the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I WAS DISAPPOINTED. THE SPRAY DOES NOT HOLD MY STRAIGHT HAIR AS I HAD HOPED AND I WILL TRY OTHER BRANDS.</li>
    <li> Lasts throughout the day, even though my hair is very thick. For this reason I find that I absolutely need to wash my hair before styling it almost every time, as I have a lot of hair as well. Overall very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is perhaps the best hair spray I have ever used. Provides great hold and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product.  My favorite hairspray that I can no longer purchase in stores.  I have run into a problem with a bottle not spraying well by the time I get to it, but have been able to free it with hot water.</li>
    <li> The best hairspray ever!!!!</li>
    <li> This hair spray lives up to its reputation,,,,, soft and strong.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  Have for years.  It holds great without that stiff hairspray feel.  Leaves hair feeling soft to the touch.  Great Product</li>
    <li> I use Mink Hair Spray for years &amp; I like it. It isn&#x27;t hard and sticky. It hold your hair and still your hair move easily.</li>
    <li> I love this product i have very long hair and it never leaves my hair sticky</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray.  I have not been able to find it locally for a year now.  It was sent very fast, but two of the tops were crushed. Don&#x27;t really need them.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this hairspray for years and the grocery store no longer handled it.  She is glad to get it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mink for years and love it!  It&#x27;s not heavy and gives great hold!  Wish I could find it in the stores again.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant aroma, does the job and is the only one I will use.  I was very disappointed years ago when they stopped making the mousse.  I order on line because I can&#x27;t find locally.  As far as I am concerned, it is the only one I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOOOOVE MINK HAIRSPRAY!  I&#x27;ve been using Mink Hairspray for years and am suddenly unable to find it in my local Walgreen store.  I felt so lucky to find it in the Amazon stores, because I won&#x27;t buy anything else!&lt;br /&gt;Mink has no stickiness and leaves my hair soft and natural.....  Holds nicely without the stiffness.</li>
    <li> This leaves nice so flexible hair, it is never stiff or sticky. Hard to find in my local store here</li>
    <li> Best hair spray for my hair.</li>
    <li> This HS is the best Hairspray of all time. I love the way it makes my hair feel and the way it smells and the texture it creates . Hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is good, always in stock and ships right away.  Best part is you don&#x27;t have to run all over town to find a store with some in stock.  I have very fine hair and this is the best hairspray for me.  It&#x27;s very lightweight, not stiff but holds all day.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised, shipped without any delays and arrived on time. Most of all, it made my wife happy. The only negative that I had was in the total cost, much to high. But as her dad was employed for years at Tony&#x27;s it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairspray for at least 20 years.  It is the only one I have found that holds the hair but does not feel stiff or hair sprayed. It also doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.  It is really hard to find in stores.  So now I buy it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon for offering this wonderful hairspray.  I can no longer find it in the retail stores.  After trying many other brands I am glad to be able to come back to Mink Difference.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray ever. I had previously used it,but then it became unavailable. So then I had to try other products.This was bad because I kept getting reactions  from the other brands. So glad you are stocking it. It not only has nothing in it that I am sensitive to, but is a great product as well. Please keep it in stock. Thank you</li>
    <li> excellent product. would definitately recommend it to other gals. does want it says it will do. not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> I wish that I could purchase this locally. It is the only Hair Spray that our family will use.&lt;br /&gt;and it has become almost impossible to purchase ouitside of the internet</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more reasonably priced hairspray to replace the pricey Oribe I have been using and I&#x27;m thrilled with this brand.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, but local stores do not handle it anymore so have to order on line.  Just hope that it continues being on the market.</li>
    <li> great hold, even in high wind conditions.  Love it. Nothing else compares to the hold you get with this product</li>
    <li> love it and has a nice smell</li>
    <li> The manufactures of Mink have changed the quality of the product and it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as it did years ago.</li>
    <li> wife loves this and cannot find at local stores,  It holds her hair better, does not leave the sticky feeling many do and makes her hair have a shine also,</li>
    <li> Been using this hair spray from since the 70&#x27;s.  All the stores have stopped stocking it in my area.  Was so happy to find out they are still in business.  I ordered a six pack and will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I have used Mink Hair Spray for about 20 years, BEST hair spray ever made. Don&#x27;t know why the stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
    <li> The product is a good and I like it, but I was expecting the &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; spray as described, not the aerosol can.  I prefer the pump sprayer rather than the aerosol can...  I will keep my order, of course, but will not expect the pump feature in the future...  a more accurate description would be helpful.  Otherwise, the shipping and delivery, condition of the product upon arrival was excellent..</li>
    <li> This is the only place you can get this now.  We love to use it and it works so good in humidity.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand my mother will use.  She loves it, and she cannot find it in stores. The hold is great, but her hair does not feel stiff.</li>
    <li> Used Mink hairspray many many moons ago and loved it.  We moved and I was unable to find it anywhere, therefore I had to start using something different.  I have tried and used just about every product on the market without feeling totally content.  Until I happen to think of looking it up online, and whallah!!!  I found it on Amazon and the price is fantastic!!  I am a happy little camper.  Now, I just have to stock up enough to last me a lifetime, just in case they stop making it.</li>
    <li> Always use it.  Good stuff!!</li>
    <li> The only one that satisfies the wife. It holds, is not sticky, and is not stiff. I wish they sole in stores like they used to.</li>
    <li> I think the new product is an knock off. I just received my 3 cans and the smell is totally off and the spray nozzle on the last authenitic Mink can had a brown depressor that was thick, not this rinky dink white depressor. It&#x27;s not the same. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this hairspray and it&#x27;s almost impossible to find in stores today.  Glad to be able to purchase online.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray and it&#x27;s very hard to find.  It holds my hair in place without making it sticky or stiff and I live in humid Houston.  So glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it because of the name. I use it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. It holds it in place and isn&#x27;t sticky. Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> No other hair spray will do.  Shine galore. Flexible hold.  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when my local stores stopped carrying this item.  I have been using it for years because it doesn&#x27;t have the horrible hairspray smell and works so well for me.  Thankfully I can still get it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> We like it but the after you use it a bit the spray button has to be cleaned with hot water or it doesn&#x27;t spray right!</li>
    <li> Gentle on my fine hair. Holds without being stiff and can comb it after! Other hair sprays damage my hair</li>
    <li> what I wanted on time</li>
    <li> I have been using mink hair spray for years and I still love the way it smells and does not make my hair stiff. It has a nice shine also.</li>
    <li> Very good product and very fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I have used mink for years because of the moisture and shine that it adds to my hair. It holds without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many many years and when I couldn&#x27;t buy in local stores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a supply via Amazon. Only spray that does not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;make hair stiff as a board but still holds in place</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray in either pump or aerosol.  It goes on lightly but still holds extremely well, without that solid &#x27;lacquer&#x27; feeling.  It has a pleasant scent and brushes out without breaking your hair into pieces.  Like all the others here I wish it were still in stores (even Walgreens doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore), but am pleased to find it here.  Now I just need to find a good source for Revlon Lovepat makeup!</li>
    <li> I have been a mink hairspray user for years,always found it al Walgreens until yesterday. I panicked and called my husband to find anywhere online and order it. I like everyone else tried all the expensive brands and in between. Mink is the best. Thanks Amazon - please always sell it.  I will be a customer forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mink for 20 years and once in a while I try something else with no success.  Mink is just the best they make.  I&#x27;d tell anyone and everyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> I  chose this product because i thought it was the same product used years ago. It frizzed  my hair and did not  hold. Will return.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve gotten Mink Difference hairspray at Walgreens. However, they recently discontinued carrying it so I was really happy to discover it on Amazon. I&#x27;m very sensitive to all of the added scents most hairsprays have but Mink Difference is unscented and is a great hairspray besides.</li>
    <li> One of the best Hair Spray in the market!</li>
    <li> Products arrived in a timely matter &amp; items were extactly as I wanted. Will order again when I need more.</li>
    <li> I can only use this product due to my allergy to certain hair sprays.  It has a soft smell with no perfume smell to it.  It holds great but is not sticky and my local retailers do not carry it any longer which is a shame. Glad I found it here.  Will continue to use.  My granddaughter just started using some of what I just purchased and she said she really liked it also.  Looks like I might have to purchase  a larger  quanity when I place  my next order to make sure I have enough for her and myself.</li>
    <li> Holds great, yet leaves your hair soft, not hard to the touch. Brushes out without leaving residue. Pump bottle better for ozone, but harder to find.</li>
    <li> What can I possibly say about this &amp;#34;tried and true&amp;#34; product. Shipping was prompt, product was in tact, quality is more than excellent! So glad this could be acquired!</li>
    <li> Great buy, as Its can&#x27;t  find this in any local store</li>
    <li> This hairspray does a great job on my fine and thick hair!  It gives a strong hold, and it is not sticky even in the high humidity of the south. It is getting hard to find in my usual drug stores, so I am happy that I can  purchase it through Amazon. I have used this product since the 80s and I have tried other sprays, including high end salon brands - but I always go back!</li>
    <li> I agree with all of the other reviews - this is the best hairspray and I have used it for over 20 years.  The last store I could ever find Mink is was Walgreens, on the bottom shelf, but they&#x27;ve finally stopped stocking it.  Like everyone else I&#x27;ve turned to the internet to find my favorite product.  Firm hold without a stiff look and you can easily brush or comb it out.  Please don&#x27;t stop making this product!</li>
    <li> The only hair spray that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with the glued down feel . I have used it for years and had to go on line&lt;br /&gt;to get it now since I cannot find any stores that carry it anymore.</li>
    <li> Have used it for over 25 years and love it.  Just cannot find anyone in my area that sells it now.</li>
    <li> A terrific product suddenly removed from my favorite (and only convenient) source; so I am so delighted to &#x27;discover&#x27; it on AMAZON.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> BEST hairspray foh-ever!  I have no idea why this is so difficult to find but I&#x27;m HAPPY to find it on Amazon.  Amazon . . . you NEVER fail me!  Excellent hairspray.  No helmet-head.  Holds your style but you can brush through it.</li>
    <li> Kay:  Mink is sort of an &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; product........ I like the fragrance and the hold is not so firm as your hair looks  and feels like &amp;#34;a helmet&amp;#34;....... I live in the South and humidity is rampant.  It holds well in hot, sticky climates as well as damp rainy weather.</li>
