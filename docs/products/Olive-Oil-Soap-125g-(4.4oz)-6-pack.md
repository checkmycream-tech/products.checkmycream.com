      <li>Your wise to shop around &amp; buy this in bulk as provided.  </li>
      <li>They did smell good, but did nothing for my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells great, kicks up a good lather and gets me squeaky cleans, all while making my tattoos look fabulous!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent, gentle cleansing soap.</li>
      <li>This soap is nice, but it does have a bit of a mineral smell.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>great soap..... great for dry skin in the winter!</li>
      <li>The condensed bar means more olive oil, you will have no complaints.      </li>
      <li>But now that I&#x27;m used to it, it is an easier and more efficient way of cleaning both.</li>
      <li>have just ordered 12 more bars so that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
      <li>I wanted something more moisturizing than the non frgrance soap I was using.</li>
      <li>Here are seven more words words words.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Given all these factors, I will certainly continue buying and using this very nice soap.</li>
      <li>of all, I was able to purchase the soap through Amazon with free shipping.</li>
      <li>I received my order within a week, which was very quick given that the product was mailed from Greece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cons about this soap is that it doesn&#x27;t lather very good, and when finish using the soap you need to keep it dry or it will turn slimy.</li>
      <li>Its fragrance is natural and very mild, the consistency is perfect for scrubbing, it cleans like a charm, and it leaves skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Came wrapped in a plain brown paper wrapper and was in perfect condition.  </li>
      <li>It is free of all the chemicals and fragrance that are dumped into most American products and olive oil has amazing healing properties.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my scalp clean without drying out my hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves me feeling clean, but not squeaky stripped</li>
      <li>I have used it to wash my hair and it makes it squeaky clean and leaves no scent in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also this  free shipping is very fast!</li>
      <li>I did a little research and found that olive oil soap was suppose to be very good for both.</li>
      <li>i love it ,it s pure olive oil soap ,</li>
      <li>It does leave our skin feeling nice, soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;SUDS - In the hands, adequate suds...</li>
      <li>Great green karma too.</li>
      <li>I gave a bar to my 82 year old mother who was having the same problem and she is just as happy.</li>
      <li>I suffer from atopic dermatitis and most soaps and lotions irritate my skin (even hypoallergic and sensitive skin varieties).</li>
      <li>This is a very nice olive oil soap and I have tried a few.  </li>
      <li>My skin is super sensitive to fragrance and dries out easily.  </li>
      <li>Other that those minor issues, IT A WONDERFUL SOAP FROM GREECE!!</li>
      <li>I have tried olive oil soaps from other sources and am very pleased with this one.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle.</li>
      <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar of soap itself is very large: 4 inches by 1.5 inches, which makes it a bit unwieldy to hold and use, but I suppose it should be thought of as a better value than a smaller bar of soap, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;According to what I&#x27;ve read, olive oil soap is rich in vitamin E and beta carotene, as well as being an antioxidant, it stimulates new cell generation, slows the progression of wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It shipped fast and was worth the cost; I will continue to purchase again and again.</li>
      <li>I use this soap daily and love it - cleanses, moisturizes.  </li>
      <li>This is a VERY gentle soap, so gentle that i would trust it for a baby.</li>
      <li>It is great in the shower it does not turn to mush like other soaps and it also seems to last longer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay soap, but doesn&#x27;t seem much different from the ones that they sell in New York City without having to get it from Greece.....</li>
      <li>The order arrived very quickly--about 1 1/2 weeks from the time I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and one bar does everything: hair, face and body.  </li>
      <li>I realize that this soap is made from a real food product (olive oil), but think they should have done something to keep it from smelling like rancid olive oil.  </li>
      <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Really, what&#x27;s not to like?  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe how fast it got here considering it comes from Greece.</li>
      <li>was shipped fast concerning</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product keeps it soft and clean.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend  this soap.</li>
      <li>and i highly reccomend it,great for the price .</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product and found it to be consistently high quality.  </li>
      <li>I did try this soap on my face in the shower and after about a week of use my face still looks normal.  </li>
      <li>With a shower pouf, normal suds fest.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and suffered for years from chronic excema.</li>
      <li>My old lady loves it too!</li>
      <li>I found this soap here on Amazon while looking for soap that wasn&#x27;t laden with chemicals and after having used several bars of this, I hope it&#x27;s available for a long time.</li>
      <li>all natural</li>
      <li>My skin stays soft and another bonus-</li>
      <li>that is has the natural scent.</li>
      <li>(All 3 soaps were &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; but the ingredients do carry a natural smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most moisturizing and least scented.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
      <li>so I use a sensitive skin cleaning cream on my face.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients are olive oil, sodium chloride (salt) and citric acid (a natural pH balancer).</li>
      <li>to the other, very foamy but very moisturized after use it.</li>
      <li>pure olive oil soap can be used as a face or body soap, as well as a shampoo for dry hair.</li>
      <li>There is a slight fresh, herby, olive oil scent when I shove my nose into it</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive facial skin</li>
      <li>I will use no other.  </li>
      <li>It NOT like the brand commercial soaps, its NATURAL WITH OUT ALL THE HARMFUL CHEMICALS that you cant pronounce or spell.</li>
      <li>, doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, isn&#x27;t heavily scented, and leaves you clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with dry, sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great stuff.  Reminds me of trips to Greece when I was younger. The bar size is convenient.  I like that is has the natural scent.</li>
    <li> I found this soap here on Amazon while looking for soap that wasn&#x27;t laden with chemicals and after having used several bars of this, I hope it&#x27;s available for a long time. It&#x27;s a simple soap that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, rough, and irritated and my husband is equally happy with it and also uses it as shampoo.</li>
    <li> This olive oil soap is the best, the best! I have so many tattoos that I look like the Sunday funnies. After washing with Papoutsanis Olive Oil Soap my tattoos are as bright as the day they appeared on my skin! I have kinda dry skin but this stuff has that problem solved. It smells great, kicks up a good lather and gets me squeaky cleans, all while making my tattoos look fabulous! Try it, you will like it! Shipping was fast and I will definitely be a repeat customer! PS: My old lady loves it too!</li>
    <li> Thankfully I was proven wrong to worry about milled soap w/salt (necessary) and no glycerin.  The condensed bar means more olive oil, you will have no complaints.      It&#x27;s gentle and one bar does everything: hair, face and body.  Your wise to shop around &amp; buy this in bulk as provided.  Great green karma too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the service in obtaining this product, and very satisfied with the quality of the soap.</li>
    <li> I suffer from atopic dermatitis and most soaps and lotions irritate my skin (even hypoallergic and sensitive skin varieties). This soap doesn&#x27;t. It is very gentle. I also use it to wash my hair, and its works great. It leaves my scalp clean without drying out my hair. I will be buying this soap from now on.</li>
    <li> This is excellent soap. It lathers well, doesn&#x27;t get mushy in the dish-as long as it&#x27;s kept dry, doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, isn&#x27;t heavily scented, and leaves you clean and refreshed. Unlike heavy scented soaps like, Coast, Zest, Irish Spring, Dial and etc., this soap&#x27;s Olive Oil is a natural moisturizer which includes vitamin E that keeps your skin from drying-out. It&#x27;s no wonder why the Romans used Olive Oil to moisturize themselves after their baths. They obviously knew there was something in the oil that enhanced their skin. Ah, to be Greek or Roman....that is the question....</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have very sensitive skin and this product keeps it soft and clean. It shipped fast and was worth the cost; I will continue to purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product and found it to be consistently high quality.  The price is reasonable.  I have tried olive oil soaps from other sources and am very pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> This soap is made from 100% Greek olive oil. It is completely vegetarian and does not contain artificial colors, fragrances or perfumes. The ingredients are olive oil, sodium chloride (salt) and citric acid (a natural pH balancer). To my nose, the soap has a very slight odor, which may be the olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pure olive oil soap can be used as a face or body soap, as well as a shampoo for dry hair. I&#x27;ve used the soap several times to wash my hair. I like the squeaky-clean feel that the soap imparts, without drying my hair. It&#x27;s also a different experience to use a bar of soap for both my hair and my face - I&#x27;m so used to using separate shampoo and facial cleansers. But now that I&#x27;m used to it, it is an easier and more efficient way of cleaning both. It lathers well enough for me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar of soap itself is very large: 4 inches by 1.5 inches, which makes it a bit unwieldy to hold and use, but I suppose it should be thought of as a better value than a smaller bar of soap, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to what I&#x27;ve read, olive oil soap is rich in vitamin E and beta carotene, as well as being an antioxidant, it stimulates new cell generation, slows the progression of wrinkles. It does seem to give my skin a more youthful look. Hydroxytyrosol, an antioxidant found only in olive oil, provides anti-inflammatory effects to help heal skin abrasions, rashes and even sunburn. It is also non-greasy and will not clog pores, helping those with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, I was able to purchase the soap through Amazon with free shipping. I received my order within a week, which was very quick given that the product was mailed from Greece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all these factors, I will certainly continue buying and using this very nice soap.</li>
    <li> After using this soap for about 3 months, I have found that my skin has actually become softer. I will continue to use this soap until they stop making it.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice olive oil soap and I have tried a few.  I would buy this soap again.</li>
    <li> Replaced Dove soap in our home.  Will order again when it runs out.  Here are seven more words words words.</li>
    <li> I realize that this soap is made from a real food product (olive oil), but think they should have done something to keep it from smelling like rancid olive oil.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent, gentle cleansing soap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay soap, but doesn&#x27;t seem much different from the ones that they sell in New York City without having to get it from Greece.....</li>
    <li> i love it ,it s pure olive oil soap , all natural and i highly reccomend it,great for the price .</li>
    <li> great soap..... great for dry skin in the winter! was shipped fast concerning were it was coming from! great price too!</li>
    <li> The order arrived very quickly--about 1 1/2 weeks from the time I ordered it.  Came wrapped in a plain brown paper wrapper and was in perfect condition.  My skin is super sensitive to fragrance and dries out easily.  I had been using Kiss My Face Olive Oil soap for the last 1 1/2 years and thought I&#x27;d try this soap and Olivella when I saw them both on Amazon.  This brand turned out to be the best of the three.  It&#x27;s the most moisturizing and least scented.  (All 3 soaps were &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; but the ingredients do carry a natural smell. all the same.)  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with dry, sensitive skin.  Hope they never stop making it!  5+++ stars!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted something more moisturizing than the non frgrance soap I was using. THIS IS PERFECT. I don&#x27;t feel guilty, or like there will be impending doom, if I don&#x27;t use lotion on my sensitive skin afterwards. It leaves me feeling clean, but not squeaky stripped clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUDS - In the hands, adequate suds... With a shower pouf, normal suds fest.&lt;br /&gt;FEEL - Lots of slip. Some ppl have said &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34;... Which is actually close, but definitely not in a gross way.&lt;br /&gt;SMELL - There is a slight fresh, herby, olive oil scent when I shove my nose into it lol... But unless you sniff the bar, there was no scent while using, or left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I already like this soap a lot .I used to use other olive oil soap for two month .Compare to the other, very foamy but very moisturized after use it. Use for hair,face,hand and body. So practical. I don&#x27;t need anything other than this. Also this  free shipping is very fast! Took only 10 day from Greece to WA U.S. (250g soap are not shipping free)&lt;br /&gt; I recommend 2 pack of this if you want order the other.</li>
    <li> Tired of dry and itchy skin and the products I tried were not helping. I did a little research and found that olive oil soap was suppose to be very good for both. Tried a few different soaps  that said they were pure olive oil, but found they actually had palm, coconut or other oils added as well as other things I could not pronounce. They did smell good, but did nothing for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Found Papoutsanis on Amazon did some research and discovered it only had 4 ingredients all of which I could pronounce. Decided to give it a try. Can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am that I did. Itchy dry skin has gone away. I gave a bar to my 82 year old mother who was having the same problem and she is just as happy. I also gave it to my aunt and a friend and they are now using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people have complained about the smell, but all I can detect is a faint earthy smell that is gone by the time you are done drying off. It is great in the shower it does not turn to mush like other soaps and it also seems to last longer. I have used it to wash my hair and it makes it squeaky clean and leaves no scent in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just ordered 12 more bars so that I don&#x27;t run out. Can&#x27;t believe how fast it got here considering it comes from Greece. Would highly recommend  this soap.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive facial skin so I use a sensitive skin cleaning cream on my face.  Soaps make my face very red and it remains red for several hours.  Continual use of soaps and my face becomes tight and itchy.  I did try this soap on my face in the shower and after about a week of use my face still looks normal.  For others out there with sensitive skin there are only a few ingredients in this soap.  sodium olivate, sodium cloride, citric acid, Agua.  I use this soap in the shower in the morning and use the cleansing cream at night.  I do not use it as a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and suffered for years from chronic excema. A Greek friend had me use this soap and my skin healed.  I have now been using it for about ten years-- I will use no other.  It is free of all the chemicals and fragrance that are dumped into most American products and olive oil has amazing healing properties.  Also don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t be walking around smelling like olive oil!</li>
    <li> I just placed another order! I&#x27;ve given some as gifts to friends and realized I have only 1 left for me:(. It&#x27;s the Only soap I use before going to bed and not worry about putting lotion on. My skin stays soft and another bonus- no soap scum! Best olive oil soap ever!</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no complaints about this soap.  Its fragrance is natural and very mild, the consistency is perfect for scrubbing, it cleans like a charm, and it leaves skin soft and moisturized.  Really, what&#x27;s not to like?  A bonus was the shipping--directly from Greece with two wonderful Grecian stamps.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It NOT like the brand commercial soaps, its NATURAL WITH OUT ALL THE HARMFUL CHEMICALS that you cant pronounce or spell. I was surprised that this soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the other commercial brands. This is a VERY gentle soap, so gentle that i would trust it for a baby. The cons about this soap is that it doesn&#x27;t lather very good, and when finish using the soap you need to keep it dry or it will turn slimy. Other that those minor issues, IT A WONDERFUL SOAP FROM GREECE!! Ps: when u receive the soap u get Greece stamps.</li>
    <li> This soap is nice, but it does have a bit of a mineral smell.  My husband and I don&#x27;t mind it, but it definitely does not smell like typical, fragranced soaps.  It does leave our skin feeling nice, soft and clean.  Unfortunately, it took about 3 - 4 weeks to receive the bars though, so plan on exercising some patience.  :)</li>
    <li> I use this soap daily and love it - cleanses, moisturizes.  I don&#x27;t use any other soap.  This is a must have.</li>
