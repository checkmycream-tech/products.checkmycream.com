<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best stuff for rash, etc</li>
    <li> Excellent for babies and also for anyone who may have a need for a skin booboo.Smells nice and works great on young and old.</li>
    <li> My mom uses this. She was getting it while at the hospital and its the only thing that seems to help. She wanted some for home- and this is a great deal. She went out and bought one of these in a local medical supply store and paid almost 20 dollars. This is a much cheaper alternative. Arrived fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works on my daughters rashes.  I have ordered a lot of this and I would recommend this to anyone who has a baby with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> works great on dry scaly skin rstored to normal after an injury</li>
    <li> Excellent healing, but if it comes up against clothes, it will leave marks.</li>
    <li> Very effective.Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great for diaper rash.</li>
    <li> Got this to help my mom.  She loves it!  And the company that shipped it out was quick; they even through in a freebie Skin Repair Cream moisturizer that&#x27;s pretty good stuff too.</li>
    <li> While I find this a little on the greasy side it provides superb coverage.  I do have to remind myself that it does not absorb quickly into the skin so as to not get it all over my clothing.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time on sensitive skin and it really&lt;br /&gt;works.  Relieves pain and restores skin. I use it on my&lt;br /&gt;husbands bed sores but it is also perfect for sun burns.</li>
    <li> This item works super. I would and have purchased more.  I had some from my mom who was prescribed this. My grandson had a very bad diaper rash and put this on at night.  By the next morning it was cleared up. Do not hesitate to purchase this.</li>
    <li> While hospitalized the guy in the next bed told me about this stuff. Now I have two best friends. Really really works well protecting those intimate places needing a little help.....</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I am using it for bed sore healing/prevention. It goes on easily and remains most of the day. For more problematic areas I cover the Calazime with Anti Monkey Butt powder. It makes a powerful barrier.</li>
    <li> If you have any skin breakdown, this is the stuff to use.  Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t paste like other barrier creames.</li>
    <li> My father in law needed a protectant because he had a huge wound on his bottom.  We ordered this for him not knowing if it was a good one.  He said it helped him a lot and his wound has heeled since he was able to use a protectant.</li>
    <li> Helps the itching and inflammation without steroids. It&#x27;s white paste so you can&#x27;t put it on your face and go out in public. I use it at night, however, and it helps a lot.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle since I don&#x27;t know when. You. Just need to put on little  and before. You know it  your. Already  healing up definitely recommend  for anyone needind to heal up</li>
    <li> LIKE THE HEADLINE IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS. HELPS MY 89 YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER FROM GETTING DIAPER RASH AS SHE HAS LOST ALL BLADDER AND BOWEL CONTROL.</li>
    <li> Good product will reorder</li>
    <li> i have used both the Remedy skin repair cream and Remedy Calazime Skin Paste.  Unless you really need a barrier paste I recommend the Remedy Skin Cream.  The entire Remedy line is exceptional and used in hospitals around the country.</li>
    <li> Calazime does a wonderful job with hard to heal skin problems.  While it is difficult to find, it is worth looking hard to locate it.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product at the hospital and was so glad that amazon had it. It is difficult to keep elderly parents protected from diaper rash issues. I have tried other products but their were the consistancy of petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> Great product, great value!!  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> It is a great product for preventing bed sores.  You only require a small amount and the zinc effect is great for the skin.  I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These products  are excellent for helping to protect the skin of elderly and/or ill loved ones.  I happy I found them.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff have used it for both my kids and given it to relatives for theirs.  It can literally cure diaper rash in hours.  Amazing product, works great on heat rash and irritated skin as well.</li>
    <li> This has been a big help for my wife who has had a skin disorder.  Thanks for making is so available.</li>
    <li> excellent coverage but it will stain clothes</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product when I was in the hospital.  This product is great for chapping and cracking skin. With just one application you will see a remarkable improvement!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Only down was it took a while to ship</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> My aunt was given this product in the nursing home.  When she came home to her own home I ordered it for her. It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I will reorder it for her when needed. Whole transaction was great.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice but it is way too thick. So much so, I have difficulty spreading it on my mom&#x27;s skin. Desitin is a little easy to work with and I have not noticed any advantages in this product over the Desitin.</li>
    <li> My 85 year old mom has paper thin skin and we both love how nourishing it is. Great moisture barrier and it smells great! I keep ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have skin rashes from time to time due to systemic lupus.  They can be absolutely horrific to live with, the itching is so intense I have scratched until I bled.  I have tried everything under the sun and nothing seems to work, with many things making it worse, including creams prescribed by a dermatologist.  I had been suffering with a new bout of rashes for several weeks when this product arrived in the mail.  I have not had severe itching since applying this.  Soothing and pleasantly scented, it stays on and doesn&#x27;t perspire off.  Best yet, it works!  I am ordering more now to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> The product works really well to keep a bed ridden patient&#x27;s skin from getting bed sores (at a really great price).</li>
    <li> This item was excellent for the matter I had that it resolved - namely a serious skin rash. It was wonderful.</li>
    <li> The paste arrived on time and in perfect condition. Very little of the paste needs to be used to get a satisfactory result.</li>
    <li> Great to use on bottom to prevent diaper rash on handicapped person.&lt;br /&gt;Probably could be used elsewhere, but that is the main purpose for us.</li>
    <li> Nice to have found this protectant paste cheaper than could be purchased at local stores.  Good to use for sores, due to having to sit for long periods of time due to spinal stenosus.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the same skin protectant used by Hospice Aides for their patients who are mainly bedridden. It is &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; cream for skin irritations, such as bedsores.  If you do use this on your feet and hands, in normal situations, use socks or gloves to protect your sheets; also wear footcovering if getting up during the night on an uncarpeted flooring - the same ingredients which protect skin also causes a slippery effect on wood floors.  An all around excellent product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works miracles!!</li>
    <li> Loves this product for diaper rashes for my babies!  After one diaper change, we can tell a huge difference.  Very thick and keeps them protected!</li>
    <li> real protection for you skin</li>
    <li> a family member I care for is constantly sitting.  This product had helped tremendously to keep the skin in a healthy condition.  A little goes a long way and should be applied sparingly, at least that is what seems to work well in our case.</li>
    <li> I use this cream all the time.  Wonderful product for skin rashes.</li>
    <li> Awesome cream to releif the itching and burning</li>
    <li> My Aunt is 96 and she is incontinent. This product has helped to clear up occasional rashes and keep her skin protected.</li>
    <li> I love this product and think is one of the best lotions to help relief, heal and protect sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Was told this works well for mild bed sores/pains...  My mom is going thru chemo - perfect.  Just rub it on the area that is starting to feel sore - ...</li>
    <li> I am a nurse and it is occasionally stocked on my unit for patients raw skin. It is so much better than anything else I have used. Protects and heals , has really good ingredients, and smells so good, like oranges and herbs. I loved it T first use but did not realize I could purchase it on Amazon! I sometimes get rashes or eczema that I will use it for instead of the baby diaper rash products.</li>
    <li> My daughter was in the hospital for the first 2 months of her life, she had gotten a diaper rash at one point while we were there and they gave me this, it works wonders! I took it home and used it on every rash she had until it was gone!&lt;br /&gt;I kept the empty bottle so I could try to find it at some point in time when i was all out of all the other creams I had stocked up. This one still tops them all and I finally decided to look it up on amazon to see if they sold it and was ecstatic to see that they do!&lt;br /&gt;Bought it and awaiting the arrival so I have it on hand for if my daughter ever gets another diaper rash</li>
    <li> this is what we were given in the icu for my loved ones but. it seems to be a good product. the service was fast, the item got here quickly. no complaints here. I would shop with them again. this is my second time ordering form them.</li>
    <li> This stuff works when other stuff won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> works well great price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best stuff I have found for sore spots .Fast healing.</li>
    <li> We purchase this on a regular basis as it seems to provide better relief than other products</li>
    <li> We would highly recommend this product because it goes on smoothly and protects the skin for at least 24 hours. It is excellent for dry, cracked skin areas and hospital patients who are bed ridden.</li>
    <li> I ise this on my babys bottom for her diaper rashes, this literally cleared it up in 2 nights, seriously an AMAZING PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Yes...men care about their face also..this was given to me while in hospital by RN to combat extreme dry skin after being on several medications.  Just happened to try it on face...literally by the end of week, my face had a smoothness I had never experienced before.  My complexion was even...and no more blotchy redness.  I use it nightly before bed...and truly believe it makes morning shaving much more comfortable.  Try it men....it works!</li>
    <li> Works GREAT for diaper rash. Better than anything else!</li>
    <li> I have been using Medline Remedy Olivamine Calazime Skin Protectant Paste  on my mother who is incontient and confined to her bed.She gets rashes, I have tried many different pastes and creams, nothing compares to Remedy Olivamine Calazime Skin Protectant  Paste. It calms and heals her rashes in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> this is terrific as they used in the hospital</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!  I use it on my acne prone skin and it dries it out without drying the skin and heals lesions by morning.  Awesome stuff, and such a nice citrus scent!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a nurse &amp; I am very pleased with how well it works for me.</li>
    <li> My 97 year old uncle who&#x27;s bedridden this past year. We put the calazime paste on his abrasion and it heals immediately.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This paste works wonders on severe rashes and irritations. My husband, just out of the hospital, had a severe rash with raised red bumps all over his back and between his legs possibly due to allergic reaction to medications.  This paste was originally given to us to use from Hospice. My husband was unable to get out of bed and this paste, rubbed on his back gave him great comfort and he was able to sleep more comfortably.  This comfort was very important so he could sleep and recover.  Ordered a large quantity of this paste to keep on hand and the order was received very quickly.  Would reccommend this product and Amazon sites to all who need products delivered right away.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it for my disabled husband.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for several months and she is completely satisfied with the results she is getting.</li>
    <li> It provided good skin protection.</li>
    <li> put this on an open sore and it is healed in 24 hrs. well worth the cost. used it for 3 years.</li>
    <li> My husband has diabetes and when he was in the hospital with sores on his legs the nurse had different lotions that she was using.&lt;br /&gt;They were all this brand.  This one she called the butt cream at her house because it was the best cream for getting rid of diaper rash and sores that it causes.  My granddaughter had a problem with her urinary track and it caused her urine to be very strong and it would actually blister her skin sometimes.  We started using this cream and haven&#x27;t had a problem since.  It is the best cream!</li>
    <li> I use this product for a person whose is almost immobile and has skin problems similar to bedsores.  This products was recommended by the wound care specialist medical doctor.  It has worked VERY well.  The skin has healed.  We continue to apply for preventative care.</li>
    <li> I have to change my thoughts on this cream because I tried it on myself and ouchy did it burn. Now I know why my Mother used to keep wiggling in her chair. I suggest trying it yourself before you use it on anyone in case their skin is sensitive too.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed, and it didn&#x27;t do much to clear up my baby&#x27;s diaper rash.</li>
    <li> great for healing bed sores</li>
    <li> Exactly what my friend wanted!</li>
    <li> My wife has been dealing with skin ailments for years (she is quadrapoligic)sp.  She went into the hospital for pneumonia.&lt;br /&gt;They used this product.  A skin condition that we had been battling for years just plain went away!  What more can one say?</li>
    <li> This topical cream is the brst pain relief ever for my medical issue.</li>
    <li> Gentle and soft. Works well.</li>
    <li> The order arrived timely and intact.  I have used this product and find it to be very good for insect bites and itchy spots on my skin.  Just had trouble finding it until I located it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the BEST diaper rash cream. I was given this from a dr to use on my grandson. I will use nothing else.</li>
    <li> We always keep this product on-hand to prevent skin irritation/damage for bed-bound loved one. Works like a champ, reasonably easy to remove without harming skin too. Pleasant scent. Not too thick but definitely a paste, not a cream that disappears into the skin. Great for incontinence care routine or to prevent skin breakdown when user uses plastic-backed chux pads.</li>
    <li> If you are having skin issues, this is great stuff for them.  We have used this on scraped injuries that just can&#x27;t heal well for where they are (typically in a skin fold area).  This helped even soften a few callouses caused by rubbing of braces on skin even with socks on.  Feels nice to the touch and not greasy.  Does tend to act like calamine lotion (the pinkish dabs on skin) and does not absorb like other lotions and creams do.  Also worked on some eczema skin area too.</li>
    <li> I have lymphedema and have to use lotions on my skin under my bandages.  Can&#x27;t use anything with petroleum (rash).  My therapist used this and the result was amazing.  I make my own lotion using coconut oil, raw shea butter, Biotone dual purpose massage lotion and this all mixed together.  I get rave reviews.  This is a really great product especially if you are chemically sensitive.  Smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> This has worked great for my son&#x27;s diaper rash.  It is much thicker than a lot of the zinc oxide products we have tried and seems to work better for us.  It does have a pink color that makes the diaper look pinkish on the inside and is scented but I actually think it smells good!</li>
    <li> This worked well on my sons bad diaper rash! Very much recommended! It also smells great unlike Desitin which has that medicated smell.</li>
    <li> This cream heals all skin irritations quickly and pleasantly. I love it. The Amazon price is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> Used as a diaper rash cream. This is fantastic. Worked fast and was non irritating. This is the cream that every mother should have. It is far superior to other marketed products.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Very soothing for sensitive irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Great for rashes and other irritations</li>
    <li> We got this cream in the hospital to help with diaper rash.  Nothing works better. Must buy if you have kids</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several winter seasons now and it&#x27;s a life saver especially with dry cracking hands from working in healthcare. The delivery time was excellent!</li>
    <li> This is  great for rashes. Believe me with all of the little grand kids this product is a must have!!!</li>
    <li> So a family friend whose child had a recent stint in the hospital (which is where she got it) gave me this when my son had a rash right after sandy and there was no store for me to get cream from. I was skeptical about using it b/c my son has eczema and his skin is very sensitive. He had a rash, I had no other options, I put it on him. When I checked his rump in the morning the entire rash was literally gone. It was like he had never had a rash at all. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT IT is that it&#x27;s not like the extra strength Desitin that wont come off of your child&#x27;s skin when you go to clean it next. I&#x27;ts like you have to scrub that stuff off and who wants to scrub their child&#x27;s rash?!?! This has the right amount of creamy, pasty goodness. If your child has a really bad blistering rash it will take 2 MAX 3 days to clear but if you catch it in the early stages it will clear in a matter of hours AND if you use just a dab at every change your child won&#x27;t get a rash at all.</li>
    <li> My mother is 93 and I found that this cream works wounders for her. We use it every day and I find that my family also like to use it when the need is there. I tell all my friends about this cream and how great it works.</li>
    <li> best crème for hard to heal areas.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I came across this product when I was a new mom and none of the other creams were working on my son&#x27;s diaper rash. I would have to use gallons of the other creams for it to even start to work. A friend gave this to me and it worked almost overnight! He&#x27;s rash always looks 10 times better after the first night, gone after the second application in the morning. It also has worked on eczema patches and other rashes my family has had. My son and I also have sensitive skin but I have never had any issues with this cream.  It seems expensive but a little bit goes a long way and it works so much quicker than the other creams. Completely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I use this on my children&#x27;s bottoms when they get red and it heals it UBER quick! Great product and would recommend it to EVERYONE!!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this in the Rehab center where my mom was placed for a while. Great stuff and goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It was purchased for an elderly parent who has been getting sore from wearing briefs. This is an excellent company to work with. They were extremely helpful when needed.</li>
    <li> This is a very good skin protectant. The product arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> this is a great product it works great for diaper rash and just great for dry skin, would recommend to all</li>
    <li> Good product.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I ORDER IT FOR MY ELDERLY MOTHER HER HOME HEALTH AID USES ALL THE TIME ON HER RASH WORKS  GREAT.....HOSPITAL&#x27;S USE IT ALL THE TIME.....</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. My doctor recommended it after my surgery........Husband</li>
    <li> My father has a pressure sore, and Calazime provides him with much relief.</li>
    <li> Nice thick lotion. It&#x27;s perfect for dry skin and feet.</li>
    <li> This stuff was recommended to me by a good friend! I love it, works so well for my dry cracked feet!</li>
    <li> Love this smooth adhereing cream. !!!  It has pleasant fragrance. After several applications my sores were healed.&lt;br /&gt;I  recommend this to anyone having  skin issues.</li>
    <li> I had an eczema type rash on my face for several months.  Nothing would clear it up until I used this product.  Now my face is totally clear.  I also use this when my son starts to show signs of diaper rash.  It clears it up immediately.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I use this for severe diaper rashes.  I apply at night and the next morning it&#x27;s usually gone, or 90% better depending on how bad the rash.  I also use for raw chapped hands in the winter, and minor cuts.  It works great.  Very thick and pasty - great smell too.</li>
    <li> I order these for my mom, she uses them for my step-father.  He has Parkinson&#x27;s and does not move around well anymore.  Mostly is confined to sitting or laying in bed.  He frequently gets bed sores and skin irritation due to this and my mom uses this pretty much daily to help relieve the irritation and help with the sores.  It really helps to clear up his skin and help him feel better, more comfortable.  It was recommended to her by a home nurse (they uses it at the rehab center she works at) and I&#x27;ve been ordering it for her ever since.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> Great product and price! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Recommended and used in the hospital for diaper cream. Glad to find it here! Sent one to daycare and the provider (who has changed diapers all day for 22 years) just loves it and suggests it to other families.</li>
    <li> This works great. It will heal irritated skin really fast and usually within one day depending on how much irritation. It only takes a little bit and it heals so well that even with a pretty severe irritation it doesn&#x27;t usually take more than 24-48 hours to totally heal the irritation while bringing instant relief.</li>
    <li> Great Product &amp; Good Price!!</li>
    <li> highly recommend, this cream works wonders for many many things. I have used it for minor burns, and it helped with recovery.&lt;br /&gt;also great for extreme dryness in some areas.</li>
    <li> It was not for me.  Purcahsed for neighbor who&#x27;s bedridden.  Used by primary caregiver and aide who visits twice a week.</li>
    <li> i had bought this originally for some pregnancy related eczema on my hands and then after the baby was born my hemorrhoids came back with a vengance. I tried everything. Preparation H, Tucks, sitz baths...nothing seemed to be helping and it burned even when I was lying still. I did some research and found some people used zinc oxide and it worked well for them. I remembered I had this cream that had zinc oxide so I crossed my fingers and gave it a try. OMG! Instant relief! The menthol cooled the area and it didn&#x27;t feel like it was burning anymore! I was soooooo miserable but thanks to this cream, I feel like recovery will go so much smoother and I can tend to my newborn better! I dunno what I woulda done without Calazime!!! (I swear I didn&#x27;t get paid for this. I&#x27;m just soooo excited to be pain free!)</li>
    <li> An amazing product. Used at hospital and was so grateful that it works so well.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this heavy product.  It does not nourish the skin, is very drying and only worsened my dry, cracked skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the greatest! Works wonders to prevent and relieve breakdown. Wound care dr and nurses advised us to try this product and it&#x27;s never let us down! I give it as baby shower gifts too!</li>
    <li> The hospital gave this to my husband when he had groin irritation including open areas. One application and it was almost gone! I have continued to use it for various things where I would have used A &amp; D ointment. This product works very well, smells nice and is not real greasy. I specifically looked for it on Amazon because I was afraid of running out &amp; not being able to purchase more since it is used @ medical facilities.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best cream I have ever used. When I got sick a few years ago I was given this in the hospital and I have been using it ever since. The smell is wonderful, and you can feel the cream working on your skin, I have very sensitive skin and havent ever had a problem using this. Also this is GREAT for small lesions and such the moister barrier is unbeatable &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> use with nutrashield (blue cap)  as they did in the hospital on my sisters infections.  works great.  could not want more.</li>
    <li> hospital used this for pressure sores in hospital and he has developed flakey scales of skin on legs. I thought this might work to repair the skin but so far it has maybe repaired some but he hasn&#x27;t used it enough to give a accurate review</li>
    <li> used for my mom who had terrible bedsore and 3 operations to correct it. this was really instrumental in her not getting any more skin deterioration.. I would HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is heavy duty paste, you can&#x27;t even spread it, I had to pat it on the skin and then put some other lotion all over. This is best used for rashes and red spots.</li>
    <li> Calazime Protectant Paste heals with one application overnight.  Its the best I have ever used.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> We use it as a diaper cream works great. Nice smell easy to clean off. Begin using it for 5 yes no rashes at all in that time</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product while at the hospital. I loved it so much and does a great job on diaper rash.</li>
    <li> Very quick very effective.....</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended to me from the wound care doctor to use INSTEAD of using the Mepilex dressings, on my mothers bottom for pressure sores.  We had been using the Mepilex for over two months with absolutely no changes.  She said all the bandages do is trap moisture in the wound, which will never let it heal.  I was skeptical, because the hospital is the one that put the bandages on and I was under the impression that it needed to be covered.  I couldn&#x27;t be more wrong (and so was the nurse at the hospital, I might add)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I started using this cream on a quarter size, stage 2 pressure sore, and within 1.5 weeks, it was completely gone! Now, that is all that I use at every brief change.  It works like magic!</li>
    <li> I love this product and it works as directed</li>
    <li> This is the best cream i I have ever ran across I will continue to use it as long as it is on the market.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells nice!</li>
    <li> Fast service! Great stuff , hospital used it where he was born</li>
    <li> I like it and it works well. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that it&#x27;s a bit hard to spread onto the skin after application even though it has a slick feeling that gives the impression that it should be easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I use cloth diapers and this is NOT cloth diaper friendly!  I went through tons of products that were CD friendly trying to treat my baby/toddler&#x27;s rashes (he&#x27;s got very sensitive skin and poops a lot) and nothing really cut it.  CJ&#x27;s Butter is great for mild rashes, but when he gets bad rashes, I need something strong.  I mean, his rashes turn into open, borderline-infected, sores.  It&#x27;s awful.  His poor bottom.  But it&#x27;s ok; slap on a crapload of this stuff, throw a dry cloth wipe over it (to protect the diaper) and voila!  No more rash!  Well, at least, noticeable healing starts right away.</li>
    <li> I received 2 tubes on what I ordered and 6 tubes of another Remedy product.  How difficult is is two fill the order with the correct product.  The Calazime product gets the 5 stars the other six get the 2 stars. Not really happy about this.  Maybe not oder from Amazon again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Barker</li>
    <li> Received the wrong product and apparently personal care products are not returnable.  So , warning... Buying this kind of product online doesn&#x27;t always save money.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I noticed a friend applying Calazime to her bunion and out of curiosity - I purchased and applied it generously over both feet.  The following day I observed a noticable decrease in the size of my bunions (both feet) and the corns appeared as if they were healing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of  application (day/night with socks on); it became apparent that I was on my way to having attractive feet for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Works great on diaper rashes</li>
    <li> All I can say is:  Wow!  I was in the hospital a while back, and I arrived with a nasty ant bite (I am very allergic to ants).  My doctor prescribed this product, and it worked like a charm as far as making the horrible itch go away.  Now, with out fail, we take it with us when we go camping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very highly recommend this product.  You can not go wrong with it when it comes to nasty insect bites.</li>
    <li> The stuff works great and was recommended by our doctor.  It is nice and thick and makes a good barrier between the messy stuff and the babies bottom.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I bought it for my elderly mother-in-law.  Protects the skin from moisture and pressure.</li>
    <li> Good barrier product. Great for adult diaper rash.</li>
    <li> It worked well where others tried just worked so-so.  I always buy the twin pack when we get down to just one.</li>
    <li> So far product has done as described and helped an itchy skin rash.  User has problems with arthritis in the fingers and having difficulty opening one of the the containers. Purchased 2 and one opened easily.</li>
    <li> This is what they used in the hospital while my daughter was there as a preemie. I use it every diaper change and have only had the beginnings of diaper rash a couple times in several months and this cleared it right up again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. It heals quickly and its thick but not hard to wipe off. I love it for my toddler.</li>
    <li> Great item and price point for a case of these. Have a chronic wound we are caring for and these work great. Nurse at wound care clinic was even surprised at quality and price point as it exactly what they use Works great on Sensitive / long term care skin</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I have ordered from JDC I would recommend them to anyone the service is quick and the product is the best out there and most hospice nurses and nursing homes should use this product</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cake. It is great for the bed-ridden elderly.  Clears up sores and protects skin.</li>
