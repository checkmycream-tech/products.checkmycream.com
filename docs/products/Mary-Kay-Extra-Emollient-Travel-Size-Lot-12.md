<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best night ointment I have ever used.  I have very dry skin all year long.  Great size for traveling.  I have the big tube for use at home.</li>
    <li> I have used this for lip balm for years - a great product with many uses. Odorless, non irritating, very lubricating.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Came quickly.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great these as lil gifts for a Tea party, have had it as of yet, I&#x27;m sure the ladies will love it</li>
    <li> Love the little tubes. They travel everywhere with me.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this product.  Travel size is easy to carry and works great.  This product is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and I love the small tubes as I can keep one in every room and one in my purse. I&#x27;ve used Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream for 40 years and I&#x27;m convinced it has kept the wrinkles away.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!  You save big time on the travel size, compared to buying a singular tube.  I get these for my purse, stocking stuffers or guests, especially during  the winter.  My Father-in-Law gets HORRIBLE cracks on his fingers in the cold, he uses up this stuff once I introduced it to him during a visit.  No odor, so anyone can use it.  Just be careful on the amount, if you use too much, it can get greasy!</li>
    <li> Good price, great product!</li>
    <li> I have used this Mary Kay Emollient for over 30 years.  My entire family uses it for a variety of reasons.  Mine is very dry skin &amp; when you wet your face and rub in a small amount you are still able to feel softer skin the next morning.  Daughter uses for lips, elbows &amp; dry heels.  It is just great stuff!  Thank you for making the travel size available.  Great for carrying in the purse or backpact.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the night emollient cream for years but the one I ordered seems different and has an overly strong stench to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> If your skin is dry, cracked and brittle - this is the product for you. I have used Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream for the past seven years. It works!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Have used it for years.  I have used it for moisturizing, softening elbows, soothing sunburns on all parts of the body, and as hand cream.  Also gentle enough to use on my babies &amp; children.  Glad it is also offered in the travel size to keep in my purse.  Again, EXCELLENT product.</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream for dry skin and for those who live in dry areas.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BEST product I have ever used for seriously chapped lips...when all the other stuff just isn&#x27;t getting the job done, I put a good coat of this on before going to bed and wake up the next day with un-chapped lips. Who knew? And it seriously lasts forever...I&#x27;m just now ordering some because I&#x27;m almost out of the 2 oz tube I got as a gift 8 YEARS ago.</li>
    <li> this is a great pruct and the travel size is good to carry on trips also</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world for chapped anything. Used in in the Arctic to potent my face and lips from windburn. Love the small sample sizes for portability</li>
    <li> have used this product for years for any kind of skin softening, even used it&lt;br /&gt;for diaper rash.  its a must to carry with you in your purse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years as my skin has always been dry (even as a teenager). Having the travel size is great as you can use it for lip balm or hand lotion at night (very sparingly and with damp skin). I&#x27;m not a huge Mary Kay fan or makeup user, but this hands down is the best night cream I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> feels like butter and lasts entire night</li>
    <li> A new Mary Kay product for me to try and I really like this lotion. My nurse mother has enjoyed it as well.</li>
    <li> Got the three piece hand care kit and the third step was just a hand cream. I used this product a long time ago and loved it after the satin hands so I got these to make up for the loss of it in kit. It&#x27;s as great as I remember and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> A few years back at my job my hands were getting so dried out they would crack and bleed, I guess from having to wash them so much. I literally tried just about everything on the store shelves! Everything I bought just made my hands hurt and burn. This includes big brand name lotions and salves. Nothing helped. My mother-n-law had a jar of Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream. She put some in a container for me to try. That same night I put some on before bed. First and most importantly IT DID NOT BURN! The next morning my hands were already feeling better. I put it on the next night as well and by the second morning my hands were just about healed. I don&#x27;t know how it works, it just does!! Since then for dry skin I use this! Now I wouldn&#x27;t use it like a body lotion. It is a bit greasy. But for very dry hands, feet, elbows or lips this is the stuff you want! I haven&#x27;t been without it since that first night I used it! My whole family uses it in the winter for their lips, my husband and I and my 3 kids. I also use it on my 6 year holds cheeks after coming in from playing in the snow. It does have a light scent, not anything overpowering. I&#x27;m sold on this stuff and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!!!</li>
    <li> They are soooooo tiny!</li>
    <li> Decided to try the small tubes and like it much better than the larger tube and travels much better carrying the smaller size too!</li>
    <li> Very convenient to have the small tubes- they last longer without spoiling or drying and are great for purse or travel.</li>
    <li> have not used yet but i&#x27;m sure I will like it if I get a chance an see a need</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of this product. I REALLY enjoy having these smaller tubes available because I keep them all over the house. I use this A LOT on dry lips and certainly around my eyes. Shipping was quick. Will buy again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years but have never gotten the travel size.  Great for the purse and for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST product...forget putting it on your face (lips, maybe!)....I use it on my feet at bedtime with socks.&lt;br /&gt;It is the most heavy duty moisturizer I have ever used!  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay night cream.  Try it on your feet! Try it on a baby for cradle cap...it works wonders!</li>
    <li> Worked great but had a strong odor. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a few friends.</li>
    <li> I use this for my fingernails and cuticles.  Works very good.  Works very good on other dry areas such as elbows.</li>
    <li> USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 40 YEARS.  IT&#x27;S THE BEST !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD HAVE ORDERED THE LARGE SIZE, BUT HAPPEND TO CLICK THE WRONG BUTTON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIDN&#x27;T MATTER  THEY LAST A BIT LONGER BY USING TUBE AT A TIME , WITHOUT OPENING A WHOLE TUBE !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 25 years to smooth and soften skin.  It is a heavy-duty night and day facial ointment.  I love the small size - great for purse and traveling.</li>
    <li> They must have changed the scent.  When I used to get this product 20 years ago, it had an extremely mild scent.  Now, it&#x27;s too strong for me.  The product, itself is excellent as a moisturizer, especially when diluted with water.  Won&#x27;t buy again because of the smell.</li>
    <li> I had expected to receive the (daytime) extra emoillent moisturizer but the product was the heavier night time &amp;#34;salve&amp;#34;.  Had I investigated further or communicated with the supplier, I would not have purchased this.  I now see others have asked this same question.</li>
    <li> Great product and great delivery service</li>
    <li> I carry these in my purse as a lip balm.  Can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
    <li> This was a fantastic deal. I love the fast delivery. IT&#x27;S A GREAT BUY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and yes I recommend everyone to purchase from here</li>
    <li> I made this purchase because after I was bit by a dog in March, my doctor gave me a tube of this to use for healing and scarring. WOw! was she right? Much better than antibiotic cream ......It helped the healing process so much.  God is the healer, and Mary Kay night cream is a really good helper. I now give out these samples to family &amp; friends when they need it.</li>
    <li> Use this product nightly..maintains moisture for several hours.</li>
    <li> I love the extra emollient products and used the cleansing cream for years. MK has discontinued it,  but try Albolene Cleansing Cream for a similar product.  You can buy it off of EBAY or in some drug stores.  It is very similar.</li>
    <li> I am a consultant and we still. Have this MK product...we don&#x27;t carry the samples...I get my samples here and have been please with serive and prices....thanks I love them in my purse and when I travel I don&#x27;t have to take my large tube.Also in vegas we have such Hard wate3r my skin stays dry ..this has been my God send and relief for that thanks</li>
    <li> I wanted these to put in a small christmas gift for 6 of my coworkers.  This stuff is wonderful on chapped lips and dry skin.  They loved it and the transaction was very good, fast shipping, product exactly as stated.</li>
    <li> This goes on really greasy, but give it a few minutes and your hands will be so soft.  Be patient and you&#x27;ll be surprised.</li>
    <li> Second time to purchase. will buy again</li>
    <li> LOVE it. It is EXTRA EMOLLIENT - definitely understand that means it is for DRY skin. However, I&#x27;m chronically dry and live in the desert, so I can never get enough moisture. It&#x27;s a thick, pink, gel-like texture. I like the smell, it&#x27;s not exactly a fragrance but it does have a distinctive and pleasant soapy scent. It&#x27;s too oily to use on my face, but is super on my neck, shoulders, elbows, knees, hands and heels. In summer and during pool season, I can even use on my legs and arms. These are VERY small containers - .42 oz (keep in mind the airline limits are 2 oz, so this is only 1/4 of that). However, because it is a concentrated product, even .42 oz yields multiple uses. It&#x27;s tiny enough to fit into my smallest clutch and even one of my wallets, and it&#x27;s PERFECT to tuck into a pocket.</li>
    <li> I will turn 46 on March 25th, 2013.  I have been slathering my face with wrinkle creams since I was 18 and I still look like I am only in my early 20s.  This product is fantastic and stays put on my skin * a great product to use in the forever-freezing/rainy/windy/snowy state of Connecticut, where the harsh weather conditions exist for a good ten months of the year.  It&#x27;s seriously hot maybe ten days total and I live to feel the heat.  This was a great deal to get twelve good-sized tubes, which will last me a long time, because you seriously only have to squeeze out a couple of millimeters at a time and it goes over your face and stays put.  I hope Mary Kay always manufactures this.  I have a tube in my purse, a tube in the bedroom, and ten extras leftover to place everywhere else.  I am very pleased to have found it.</li>
    <li> What a deal!!!  Small little tubes to fit in my purse or anywhere for that matter. Super product to soften any dried out skin.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to get this on Amazon I need more than I tube now I have it in the car my office and home Thanks for offering this to me its a great product</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I use it as an eye cream as well. Works better than any eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I  put it all around the eye. It does not irritate my eyes like many creams do. I also dampen my face so that I can spread it a little thinner so my face does not feel greasy.  Love this cream.</li>
    <li> even thougth they were samples that said not for resale on the back of each one,it was still a good deal to me,as they&#x27;ve been discontinued at mary kay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this &amp;#34;lip gloss.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have loved this cream flr years.  it is the only thing that keeps my feet soft. and now i can keep sone at work and in my purse for my dry hands!</li>
    <li> I just moved and couldn&#x27;t find an MK rep who carries it. Was happy to see I could get it quickly on line!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these as Christmas gifts for my fellow preschool teachers. We wash our hands a million times a day and this is an amazing product to help protect and treat chapped hands.</li>
    <li> I have used the MK Extra Emollient cream for years. In the past I have purchased the large tubes. I have found the travel size tubes work so much better. I can easily fit them in my makeup bag for travel as well as keep one in my purse, bag for work etc. Love the smaller sizes!!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Good experience</li>
    <li> I cannot adequately express how much I love these little tubes of extra emollient night creme.  I have used them for years and have one or two tubes stashed in my purse at all times.  I mostly use the small tubes for my lips and purchase the larger tubes for application to larger areas of my skin such as my feet, my face and hands.  I never leave home with out this travel size tube.  It is one the products on my top 10 list of favorite all time \\&quot;use it every single day\\&quot; products.</li>
    <li> Was longer getting to me than I&#x27;d originally been told, but when it did get here, love the product and the size.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom because she loves this product and after doing math I found out that this was cheaper to get than one tube of a bigger size</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of Mary Kay&#x27;s &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; creme that can be worn anytime day or night.  I won&#x27;t say it gets rid of wrinkles but it definitely softens them which makes them seem to fade away.  After cleaning my face, I massage this into both my face, neck, and hands while watching TV.  My skin responds to everything that&#x27;s in it!</li>
    <li> Very thick  and rick cream.  I use it for dry heals and feet .  It works better than any product I have found, even those made specifically for dry feet and heals.</li>
    <li> This was a repurchase from Amazon of this moisturizer.  It has been around a long time and is one of the best avaiable on the market.  Purchasing it trough Amazon is as economical as I can find it.  I have used it for years and highly recommend to any and all.</li>
    <li> This is very heavy and I don&#x27;t like the feeling when I put it on, but my hands are noticeably softer with regular use, so it certainly does what it is supposed to do!</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever!  Bought this long ago and just got to reviewing it so not sure if this great deal is still around.</li>
    <li> I have used Mary kay extra emollient night cream for many years...on my face, my hands and my feet.  It keeps them soft and just feels really good.  Not for hot humid weather.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for lips, feet - it absolutely works and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> LIKE THE SMALL SIZE AND GREAT FOR TRAVEL</li>
    <li> I have been aware and had used this product off and on since the 1970s and it is great for dry skin. For over twenty years it kept my eczema under control. Recently, the formula must have changed because it does not work on my eczema an longer. It is still great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product in a great travel size or for your purse.  One for everyone in the family, and then still more left for when you run out.  I love it for dry skin patches, chapped skin or dry lips.</li>
    <li> a bit expensive, but worth it; thick and creamy - perfect for night time, and day us in very dry areas. i recieved the product in a timely manner.  thank you.</li>
    <li> love this product. works great especially in winter I Love Love the travel size</li>
    <li> I hope they never stop making this stuff.  I love it and I love those travel sized tubes.  I keep one with  me at all times as my skin gets very dry.  It works great as an intense after-shower moisturizer in the winter.  I also use it before dipping my hands in paraffin wax.  Easy on the eyes, and great for hands, elbows, knees and feet and cures chapped lips!</li>
    <li> These are perfect sized for travel, your purse, all sorts of functions. I love the small tubes, I put one in each of my separate cosmetic bags.</li>
    <li> Love them and size proves useful</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry hands. This is a nighttime emoliant. However, I use it lightly every morning. I never have to put lotion on the rest of the day, it just stays with you. It&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> perfect size, love this product.  I always have it with me!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product for my lips. My mother and sisters use it too. I personally use it on a daily bases for chap stick. The smaller tubes fit well in your purse.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for mini gift baskets.</li>
    <li> I was entirely pleased with all aspects of this product. If it&#x27;s available, I may buy more if it is available from the same vendor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased ... I got a years supply of pittance.  You can buy a 2.1 oz for $15 or buy these 12 x .45 oz &#x3D; 5.4 oz for the same price.  Your call.</li>
