      <li>This is a gorgeous color.</li>
      <li>It is a gorgeous teal like color.</li>
      <li>used this polish on my own nails.  </li>
      <li>The color is a teal under bright sunlight and an ott light.  </li>
      <li>I used three coats (like with most gelish  polishes) and got a beautiful vibrant color.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the wear of this gel polish as well.</li>
      <li>and I have to say I love this color.</li>
      <li>I had perfect coverage with 2 coats and it did last 2 wks.</li>
      <li>I was expecting this to be more of a glue, it&#x27;s sort of a teal.</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>Love the color, but I had to use 4 coats for it to show on my nails.  </li>
      <li>Love this color and brand.</li>
      <li>Love this color.  </li>
      <li>I love that it goes on smooth and lasts over two weeks!</li>
      <li>but so so pretty on!!!</li>
      <li>In some office light, it took on a bluish color.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, rich bold, color.</li>
      <li>It has good coverage and only needed two coats to get to the described color that was shown</li>
      <li>The polish went on well and provided full coverage in two coats.</li>
      <li>This color is such an awesome shade of teal/turquoise, and has this aaaalmost neon quality to it, that changes depending on the light you&#x27;re in.&lt;br /&gt;It is not as opaque as some of my other Gelish colors, so it needs one more coat, but it&#x27;s such a cool color, it&#x27;s worth the effort!  :)</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll definitely need to work with this color, but it&#x27;s gorgeous once you get it right.</li>
      <li>THIS COLOR IS VERY BRIGHT FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS</li>
      <li>Using white will show this polish&#x27;s less than perfect formula, and using no undies will dampen the shade&#x27;s brightness.</li>
      <li>THEN IT GOES TO A DARKER TEAL BLUE/GREEN STILL PRETTY COLOR</li>
      <li>Color is pretty, but not for me</li>
      <li>First thing I did when this arrived</li>
      <li>This is my first review on a product</li>
      <li>The polish did apply smoothly and evenly and dried with no wrinkling.  </li>
      <li>Since my nails are much longer than my granddaughters, it took 4 coats to get solid, opaque coverage.  </li>
      <li>I thought this blue would be a little brighter, but its still a very pretty color</li>

<li> it is long lasting</li>
<li> Plus, I didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it to be delivered!</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not really a turquoise.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
<li> I would recommend using a light blue (Gelaze For Audrey, is what I used) as a base coat under Radiance is My Middle Name.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s closet to a blue than a green</li>
<li> I have had some other gelish polishes that the polish wrinkled but did not have that with this one.</li>
<li> a pg bond and base color is applied first</li>
<li> I had a hard time looking for this shade of turquoise in a gel polish but after months of looking I found it..</li>
<li> lil thin</li>
<li> and I feel you can&#x27;t go wrong with harmony gelish.</li>

    <li> lil thin but so so pretty on!!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be more of a glue, it&#x27;s sort of a teal. I do like it, but the picture made it look like I would be getting a sky-blue color.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Love the color.</li>
    <li> Polish is excellent! Perfect color! Plus, I didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it to be delivered! It was here within the week!</li>
    <li> This is my first review on a product and I have to say I love this color. I had perfect coverage with 2 coats and it did last 2 wks. I have had some other gelish polishes that the polish wrinkled but did not have that with this one. Great color for summer. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color...looks amazing on brown skin or a nice tan!</li>
    <li> THIS COLOR IS VERY BRIGHT FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS THEN IT GOES TO A DARKER TEAL BLUE/GREEN STILL PRETTY COLOR JUST WUSH IT WOULD NOT FADE</li>
    <li> I used three coats (like with most gelish  polishes) and got a beautiful vibrant color. It&#x27;s closet to a blue than a green so it&#x27;s not really a turquoise.&lt;br /&gt;When a pg bond and base color is applied first it is long lasting and I have no regretsabout my purchase.</li>
    <li> Beautiful neon teal color.  The polish went on well and provided full coverage in two coats. I used all the polishes in the All About The Glow collection to make multicolor nails for my granddaughter.  They were so cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this polish on my own nails.  Since my nails are much longer than my granddaughters, it took 4 coats to get solid, opaque coverage.  The polish did apply smoothly and evenly and dried with no wrinkling.  The color is a teal under bright sunlight and an ott light.  In some office light, it took on a bluish color.  I have attached pics to show how the polish looks in different lights.</li>
    <li> Color is a lot darker than pictured. But still is a beautiful color. Chickettes.com has great swatches of all gelish colors. Check out site before purchasing. I Recommend this color</li>
    <li> I had a hard time looking for this shade of turquoise in a gel polish but after months of looking I found it.. I love the wear of this gel polish as well.</li>
    <li> First thing I did when this arrived was opened it to look at the color. It is a gorgeous teal like color. I cannot wait to use it. Have to wait out my current color.</li>
    <li> Love this color and brand. Goes on smooth, rich bold, color. I have a lot of committees in this brand.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color......</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous color. I love it. I have several colors and I feel you can&#x27;t go wrong with harmony gelish.</li>

    <li> Color is pretty, but not for me</li>
