<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Perfect eye make-up remover.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and like it a lot. Initially found out about it through a Dermatologist that I go to. A little pricey (cheaper then buying it from a doctor) but worth it if you have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now and still love it. I leaves my skin soft. Most other cleansers leave my skin dry.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great. I like it because if I&#x27;m in a hurry or on the go, I can wash my face without water by using this. My face feels moisturized after as well. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years now. It&#x27;s the only one that works for my sensitive and often acne-prone skin. It has done wonders on evening out my skin tone. Not nearly as blotchy pink as it used to be. Love the Exuviance line!</li>
    <li> The only reason for a 3 star rating is that the product feels greasy on my face and is difficult to rinse off.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleansing cream for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin. It clenas well, but doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
    <li> I think this cleanser is good. Easy to use and not greasy at all. Skin gets soft and moistured after rinse it off. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell.  I don&#x27;t like coconut smell.</li>
    <li> Gentle, non-drying formula. I have used it for many years. Whenever I try something new I always go back!</li>
    <li> I started using this cleanser over 2 years ago. I did a ton of research and finally ended up selecting Exuviance. I&#x27;m always impressed by the way comes in the boxes. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with one being open or broken etc. The price is great as I&#x27;m paying for quality. Not only do I use it now but so does my teenage daughter.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this cleanser at a local department store but they discontinued the line.  I am so happy to find it on Amazon!  I have been using this facial cleanser for over ten years and have not once had a break out since using it.  I have combination skin and this is truly a gente cleanser.  My face does not feel like a shriveled up prune after cleansing.  Instead my skin is nice and soft.  Oh, and my husband used this as well.  He works in a factory and we&#x27;ve notice that he no longer gets blackheads on his nose or forehead.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I love it .I want to receive this product on a regular basis. It is very gentle on your skin. Very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well but doesn&#x27;t remove all makeup</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! It cleans super heavy eye makeup with eyeliner and mascara off in one sweep. It also doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue afterward like a lot of makeup removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I got to try this as a sample and I absolutely love it and I want to get a bottle of this, this is by far the best cleanser for my face and I&#x27;ve tried other brands and haha it&#x27;s not as amazing as this stuff. This is my new favorite product line.  Will be purchasing this soon!!</li>
    <li> I used this for a number of years (I use the pump bottle) and love the results.  I used it with the rest of the line - toner and day &amp; night moisturizers.  Thought maybe I&#x27;d save a little money by trying other products, so I tried The Body Shop Aloe Calming Facial Cleanser and its whole line, and I tried Avene Extremely Gentle Cleaner Lotion and its whole line.  No comparison.  I am going back to Exuviance - will alternate with the others to finish up the other products, but this is my standard for sure now.</li>
    <li> Have used for several years, this and other Exuviance products are very good fruit/glycolic acid products.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every cleanser out there and this is my all time favorite.  It leaves my skin feeling much more hydrated and moisturized compared to other cleansers.  I swim laps 3 days a week so need a good cleanser for removing chemicals and any bacteria from the pool.  This has worked great.  I can&#x27;t say enough about Exuviance products.  They are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing product.  It is very gentle and leaves skin feeling like lotion was applied instead of dried out as it feels when you use soap.  This is accomplished with no strong scent which is important for anyone who is scent sensitive.</li>

    <li> Best face wash ever, extremely gentle, have used for years.</li>
    <li> it arrived faster than i had expected. i&#x27;ve known this brand recently and i love it!&lt;br /&gt;so i&#x27;ve decided to try this one too. i don&#x27;t like smell but it works nice for taking off my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;i usually used to use shu uemura. i will see which one is better for me.</li>
