      <li>Some of the products available over the counter and through my doctor contain chemicals that I do not want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>and it really works as it claims to!!!  </li>
      <li>I must say I really like your product!!!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The proof is in the pictures - a remarkable difference in my and my family and friend&#x27;s opinions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only used about 1/3 of the product, I started using it as a hand cream too and the spots on my hands are fading as well.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed more and more dark areas that my mother so lovingly calls “age spots”.</li>
      <li>I am very impressed that this product is able to use natural ingredients to do the job of lightening dark skin spots!  </li>
      <li>so far.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
      <li>I love the sun-kissed look, I really truly do.</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
      <li>I can target the spots better and don&#x27;t use as much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a blessing to see that Trinity proudly states their Christian beliefs on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Being of a certain age,</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smooth, non greasy cream that absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to do, is safe, and above all it works.</li>
      <li>This not only did a great job at lightening these, but also pleasantly surprised me with the amount of hydration it added to my skin as well.</li>
      <li>I received this product  complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion.</li>
      <li>AND that says a lot since it&#x27;s summer right now.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I received a free copy of this book/Ebook/Product to review.</li>
      <li>The smell of the product is quite mild and the cream is really creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;After six weeks of regular use, I honestly haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
      <li>I like the way it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Trinity enLIGHTen has made a remarkable difference over the past 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for this enLIGHTen Miracle cream!  </li>
      <li>I am interested to see how Kojic Acid  works in lightening my melasma.</li>
      <li>After about a week, I noticed the area was consistently brighter and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After 2 weeks of use I went camping and forgot to pack my new best friend, so that set my progress back a little.</li>
      <li>It has a light scent, barely there and even that fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this cream really works for me.</li>
      <li>I can really tell the difference.</li>
      <li>really like it as a brightener.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really helping to even out and brighten my skin, so thank you for making this product.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely a rip</li>
      <li>It does seem to help surprisingly quickly with evening out my general skin tone on my face</li>
      <li>This is a nice size jar and will last a long time.</li>
      <li>do like very much that this company offers a 90 day satisfaction guarantee.</li>
      <li>I thought the cream had a smooth texture and dried quickly.</li>
      <li>I got a full body rash the same day using it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting close to the bottom of the jar, so I will be placing a new order soon.  </li>
      <li>Melanin is produced by the body to darken skin, and enLIGHTen helps block production of melanin, so as skin regenerates, the new cells are lighter than those they replace.</li>
      <li>ok..I am getting old!</li>
      <li>does not contain  harsh chemicals like hydroquinone, bleach, or any other skin-damaging ingredients, and is supposed to be good for sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
      <li>applied the lightweight and creamy lotion morning and night as directed and am very pleased by about 98% reduction of the larger spot on my forehead and about 75% reduction of a smaller round spot on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it uses natural and effective active ingredients to lighten skin and reduce dark spots.</li>
      <li>recommend this cream to anyone who wants to lighten their skin or simply pamper their face.</li>
      <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t bleach your skin, but rather it naturally fades by blocking melanin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is all natural no bleaches or chemicals.</li>
      <li>I am concentrating this cream on the spots on my face directly and the backs of my hands.</li>
      <li>I’m old, I’m</li>
      <li>I recommend people to at least try this product and see the results for themselves. :)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not messy at all to apply.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have just a couple dark spots on my face—one close to my eye, and one on my nose. I also have terrible dark circles under my eyes. So my hope for this product was that it would lighten the two dark spots on my face and my under eye circles. (Note: Nowhere did I read that this product claimed to reduce under eye circles—I just hoped that it would.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six weeks of regular use, I honestly haven&#x27;t seen much difference. I hoped that at least the dark spot on my nose would diminish, but it hasn&#x27;t seemed to change at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My impressions of the product itself: it has kind of a green tea smell to it—not bad, but not really nice, either. I do very much like the way it feels on my skin; it has a nice cooling sensation. Also, a little bit goes a very long way, so I&#x27;ll be able to use it for a long time ... but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll keep using it, since I haven&#x27;t seen any results after six weeks. I do know that some people have had great success with it, but this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a free copy of this product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I dont like the scrub nither the cream</li>
    <li> My experience using the it was phenomenal. The texture of the cream felt luxurious like silk. A little dab goes a long way.  It has helped me to get into a routine of better  face care. Not only have I seen a difference in my facial tone, but my friends and family have as well. I am more confident about having my picture taken .  I am also in love with the aroma of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this cream to anyone who wants to lighten their skin or simply pamper their face. I believe it could be used as a moisturizer even if you don’t need your skin lightened. In my opinion you wont be disappointed in the look ,feel and results of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a free copy of this product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

    <li> I doesn&#x27;t work. I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Summer! Oh how I do love summer time. I was the queen of summer time tans. I love the sun-kissed look, I really truly do. Although those summer tans from my teens and twenties have caught up with me big time in my 50’s. So as good as it felt to me then to be tan; it feels a million times worse NOW!! Now thanks to wrinkles, and these stupid age spots I feel like I’m 90! I HATE age spots!!! I swear I can handle wrinkles and sagging skin better than these dang spots!!&lt;br /&gt;EnLIGHTen is a Miracle Skin Lightener in a jar. EnLIGHTen has a creamy texture with a light subtle scent. This is not a greasy, harsh cream in the least. It doesn’t dry out my skin. It only works to lighten the dark spots considerably! I started to noticed subtle differences in a little over 2 weeks but the jar states it can take up to 6 weeks to see changes. After 2 weeks of use I went camping and forgot to pack my new best friend, so that set my progress back a little. I am concentrating this cream on the spots on my face directly and the backs of my hands. I’m deeply encouraged!&lt;br /&gt;This cream also has Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid that helps with wrinkles too as well as lightens spots AND nourishes and hydrates the skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;Never tested on animals to the package which contains the words: “You are all fair, my love; there is no spot in you.” Solomon 4:7  It’s such a wonderful touch.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, non greasy cream that absorbs quickly. This doesn’t dry out my skin or cause any irritation. I’m pleased with my progress so far.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> My mom has quite a few age spots so I gave her Premium Skin Lightening Cream to try. She has been using it over a month and she has started to see a slight difference of her spots lightening. I believe this takes time for this process to work. This is a nice size jar and will last a long time. She will continue to use it in hope that her spots will lighten even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all natural no bleaches or chemicals. It is safe for your skin. The company offers a 90 day money back guarantee if you are not satisfied. For spots to totally disappear it will take a couple of months. I received this product  complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.</li>
    <li> Good whitening cream. But the container was pretty small. It works perfectly well for the face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been teased about the hyperpigmentation spots on my face.  Trinity enLIGHTen has made a remarkable difference over the past 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the lightweight and creamy lotion morning and night as directed and am very pleased by about 98% reduction of the larger spot on my forehead and about 75% reduction of a smaller round spot on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proof is in the pictures - a remarkable difference in my and my family and friend&#x27;s opinions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only used about 1/3 of the product, I started using it as a hand cream too and the spots on my hands are fading as well.

    <li> I love the product just from the packaging which contains: “You are all fair, my love; there is no spot in you.” Solomon 4:7 (NKJV). It&#x27;s a blessing to see that Trinity proudly states their Christian beliefs on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Being of a certain age, yeah ok..I am getting old! I have noticed more and more dark areas that my mother so lovingly calls “age spots”. Yeah.. not something I am thrilled to sport around shouting.. I’m old, I’m old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve seen ads for products and even talked to my doctor about what can be done. Some of the products available over the counter and through my doctor contain chemicals that I do not want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When asked to review the Trinity enLIGHTen Skin Lightener, I was more than happy to give it a try. I thought the cream had a smooth texture and dried quickly. It does not leave a greasy feeling and I can apply the rest of my makeup or nightly creams without having to wait for it to dry. It has a light scent, barely there and even that fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results on brightening:  Only after a couple of days of using this product my skin began to look brighter as soon as the product was applied. After about a week, I noticed the area was consistently brighter and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results on reducing the discoloration: After two (2) weeks I started to notice subtle changes in the darker areas. Overall, the treated area is softer and the skin looks healthier, but the age spots are still visible. Could they be a little lighter? Maybe, but it could also be too soon to make a judgement call on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it as a brightener. I can really tell the difference. Based on the results in just a little over two (2) weeks, I would expect to see continued improvement in my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been applying this to my forearms which have several scars from being a tomboy as a child. Those areas have made greater strides than I ever expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the TRINITY enLIGHTen Miracle Skin Lightener for the brightening results and encourage those with sun damaged skin to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase this product knowing it is backed with a 90 day money back guarantee if for any reason you are not satisfied with their product, they’ll refund your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.ould recommend the TRINITY enLIGHTen Miracle Skin Lightener for the brightening results and encourage those with sun damaged skin to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase this product knowing it is backed with a 90 day money back guarantee if for any reason you are not satisfied with their product, they’ll refund your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> it works..I love it. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> If I could give it a negative star I would. I broke out so bad I ended up at the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Having olive skin complexion, it did not work for me. The dark spots  might have gotten worst.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work the way i expected</li>
    <li> Absolutely a rip off!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return the items</li>
    <li> This Product is terrible! I cannot believe it has so many great reviews! I got a full body rash the same day using it! This has never happened before... Waste of money</li>
    <li> Waste of money!!!!!!do not buy this nonsense</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products to make my skin look and feel better, so I was happy to have a chance to order this through a promotion in order to evaluate and provide an honest review.  I&#x27;m always cautious to check the fragrance in personal care products since I have allergy issues.  This has a very light and pleasant scent and does not aggravate my allergies at all.  The texture is smooth and creamy - very pleasant!  I like the way it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  It does seem to help surprisingly quickly with evening out my general skin tone on my face and I&#x27;m hoping with continued use to see some even bigger results with some discolorations from acne scarring on my shoulders.  Definitely a high quality product that I am happy to continue using!</li>
    <li> this cream really works for me. I really enjoy how its making my skin glow. dark spots are fading and my skin looks a little bit more even. i use it only at night. I will continue buying.</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing good just started on it but my skin feels really good !</li>
    <li> Used it now for over 6 months... I&#x27;ve noticed little if any improvement in the skin discorations I got from laser treatments.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I have just received it, therefore I need to use it for a while to determine its effectiveness. SO for now here is why I do like EnLighten:&lt;br /&gt;EnLIGHTen smells wonderful!  I like that it uses natural and effective active ingredients to lighten skin and reduce dark spots. I am interested to see how Kojic Acid  works in lightening my melasma. I have not tried products with this combination of active ingredients: Kojic Acid, Arbutin, Niacinamide, Vitamin C, Kakadu Plum, Salicin and Lycopene, all of which are supposed contribute to lightening and brightening skin.&lt;br /&gt;EnLIGHTEN does not contain  harsh chemicals like hydroquinone, bleach, or any other skin-damaging ingredients, and is supposed to be good for sensitive skin like mine.  It is supposed to help to lighten freckles, birthmarks, dark inner elbows, knees, age spots, sun spots, liver spots, acne scars, old scars, melasma, choasma, hyperpigmentation, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, senile lentigines and more.&lt;br /&gt;I do like very much that this company offers a 90 day satisfaction guarantee. I will be reposting in 90 days to update this review on effectiveness!</li>
    <li> some improvement shown , need more time</li>
    <li> I must say I really like your product!!!  It&#x27;s been the best skin lightener I have found.  It&#x27;s really helping to even out and brighten my skin, so thank you for making this product.  I&#x27;m getting close to the bottom of the jar, so I will be placing a new order soon.  I can&#x27;t think of or can&#x27;t recommend any changes that I feel would make Trinity enLIGHTen Miracle Skin Lightener a better product.  I like the current formula and it really works as it claims to!!!  Just don&#x27;t discontinue it, please!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for this enLIGHTen Miracle cream!  I am very impressed that this product is able to use natural ingredients to do the job of lightening dark skin spots!  With the exfoliating ingredients it also doubles as a bit of a cleanser.  It also has sea kelp as an oil free moisturizer and leaves your skin feeling fresh and healthy!</li>
    <li> i cant comment on iys performance...broke my skin out. had to return it</li>
    <li> Made my skin very dry.</li>
    <li> This product did not deliver on expectations.  I have been using as directed every day since purchasing it and have seen zero change.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I actually love this... I started seeing the result in just a couple of days that it started to get cleaner and more lighter. Keep applying it and it&#x27;ll be white and clear in no time! It might not work on everybody due to how your body works with it, but for me, it&#x27;s been a few days in it&#x27;s going smoothly. I recommend people to at least try this product and see the results for themselves. :)</li>
    <li> I have this really weird red spot that I have had pretty much since I was little; near my eye. I also have several spots in places on my thighs that I wished to lighten. This not only did a great job at lightening these, but also pleasantly surprised me with the amount of hydration it added to my skin as well. I think this product is great at lightening any sort of skin issue. I have even used it for some of my freckles. I like that it doesn&#x27;t bleach your skin, but rather it naturally fades by blocking melanin. It&#x27;s easy to do, is safe, and above all it works.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for months with no results.</li>
    <li> The bottle was open so disappointed I sent back</li>
    <li> Excellent results! But it is extremely liquid, and expensive for a small size! one can to be used for just three weeks!</li>
    <li> About the Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EnLIGHTen is a skin lightening cream that uses natural ingredients to lighten skin, fade dark spots and treat melisma/hyperpigmentation. Melanin is produced by the body to darken skin, and enLIGHTen helps block production of melanin, so as skin regenerates, the new cells are lighter than those they replace. The result is gradual lightening of the skin. Unlike most skin lightening creams, enLIGHTen does not contain bleach, hydroquinone, mercury or any other harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Upon receiving this small jar you would never imagine in a million years that they cream you had wished for was finally here, but yes indeed it is. This small jar of miracle cream has natural ingredients in it that when applied to your freckles and skin spots will lighten them considerably. The smell of the product is quite mild and the cream is really creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It has a pale yellow tent to it and goes on fairly smoothly without any greasy after feel, which is a plus. Within two weeks of application you will be happy with the results. I could even use this on a trip we recently took. It is small enough to drop in your purse and the consistency is so creamy you won&#x27;t have any run-off and it&#x27;s not messy at all to apply. I highly recommend this cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I received a free copy of this book/Ebook/Product to review.

    <li> This could be the ANSWER! I&#x27;ve had unsightly brown spots on my arms and legs mostly. I researched till I came across Miracle Skin enLIGHTen. Well, it&#x27;s only be a week and I&#x27;m allready seeing some improvement. I apply twice daily. Here&#x27;s a tip: I use a cosmetic brush...slightly bigger than lip brush. I can target the spots better and don&#x27;t use as much. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin either! So, I&#x27;ll continue to use and look forward to giving it a 5 star rating!</li>
    <li> I personally dont use skin bleach. i purchased this for a family member that is insecure about her skin tone. I was able to get it at a discounted rate. she says she likes it. It&#x27;s very simple to use and hasn&#x27;t caused any skin irritation or sensitivity. she&#x27;s been using it for a month, and the difference is there. She took before and after pictures which show change. AND that says a lot since it&#x27;s summer right now.</li>
    <li> This cream did nothing. My skin discolorations are not too bad, but the cream did not diminish them at all. This product was a waste of money.</li>
