    <li> Super fast shipping and friendly company however this product does not have enough conditioners to support the dry climate of New Mexico. I&#x27;ve never had so much breakage.</li>
    <li> Meh..&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced and no slip.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I like the fact that this is 32 oz  instead of the 8 oz of conditioner  they have in their original website. Best conditioner i&#x27;ve used for curly hair. I will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> Love this and you get so much</li>

    <li> I purchased EO grapefruit &amp; mint hair conditioner. I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews with positive results and I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;ve experienced the opposite? My hair is fine and colored but not at all over-colored. The results after using this particular product: my hair feels like straw and is difficult to comb out. It&#x27;s as if I happen to purchase the one that missing some ingredients? I don&#x27;t know? I&#x27;ve read very few negative reviews so I&#x27;m not sure what happened. I just know my personal experience was negative. Sorry ☹</li>
    <li> I absolutely love, love, love this conditioner!! Not only does it provide me with the moisture my hair needs, but it cleanses my hair better than anything else I have tried. It is a replacement for my devacurl no poo! Amazing product!</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t love this conditioner. I have 3c curls and my hair loves moisture but I don&#x27;t think the conditioner was moisturizing enough. Also the price is very expensive. I was able to find at my local Tj maxx for 10 dollars instead of 20 plus.... And shipping.</li>
    <li> Great Product. All Natural</li>
    <li> Works wonders, makes my hair so soft and tangle free and best of all it smells great.</li>
    <li> I just boght it so I still havent see the results but first time I used it, the first thing I noticed was the smell. It has a great smell like minty so your hair feels amazing. your scalp feels sooo clean. I will update as soon as I see results</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner.  Smells really good and it keeps my hurrr soft.  I use a dollop and only put it on the ends of my hair, and then I wait a few minutes before fully rinsing it out.</li>
    <li> Glad it doesn&#x27;t have parabens, etc.  But isn&#x27;t very moisturizing</li>
