      <li>how amazing this color really is....</li>
      <li>I am not into orangey colors on my nails, but this actually looks great ...</li>
      <li>I love the copper, not crazy about the purple.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wowie,  I def recommend buying this. It 100% is one of the best nail polishes I&#x27;ve ever worn. It has the perfect amount of sparkles. It&#x27;s copper tone can look good during any season and can match any outfit. It does appear a little lighter in the picture. If your hesitating to buy this. BUY IT. It came perfect in shipping condition wise, and it shipped pretty fast! It hasn&#x27;t chipped in 3 days compared to an Essie Nail Polish that chipped the next day (that I bought on Amazon) but I really recommend this. :)</li>
    <li> I love this polish. It last such a long time and i loved that i didn&#x27;t see any chipping. And the color is beautiful. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Like all the other reviewers I thought I&#x27;d be getting a redish/bronze color, but in person it&#x27;s not. Rally Pretty Pink is more of a pink/purple base with bronze/gold micro glitter. It&#x27;s not the sellers fault because this color glimmers so much that it&#x27;s hard to capture what color it really is. It&#x27;s a really pretty color though. When I saw it in the bottle I was hesitant, but it&#x27;s a gorgeous color for fall and I could see myself wearing it for New Year&#x27;s. The color also works really well with my medium/olive skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPI nail polishes glide on super smooth and dry pretty fast. I&#x27;m always scratching because I have eczema so it&#x27;s hard keep on nail polish because it&#x27;ll chip easily, but so far it&#x27;s stayed on pretty nicely.</li>
    <li> I love this polish in the picture above. I really wanted to love it on, but it looks very different. This is a purple polish which is kind of copper-y in the light. I love the copper, not crazy about the purple. I keep trying to love it, but so far it is prettier in the bottle than on my hands. That could just be me though...</li>
    <li> This shade does not disappoint.  It is hands down the best I&#x27;ve purchased from OPI.  The microglitter is to die for!  I recently purchased OPI&#x27;s It&#x27;s My Year which is very similar but purple instead of pink and am in love with both. This is definitely a shade that I&#x27;m proud to wear and looks great with all skin tones (I&#x27;m very fair and it&#x27;s often difficult to find shades that don&#x27;t make me look pasty).  It stayed on my fingers close to a full week without chipping.  Shipment was quick and arrived in my mailbox within 3 days.</li>
    <li> I like this color a lot, however the color isn&#x27;t as reddish as shown in the picture. A good color nonetheless!</li>
    <li> Hides chips and imperfections. Goes with anything. Strong gold sparkling shiny tones. Good consistency. This is my third bottle! sweet</li>
    <li> I am wearing this nail polish right now! It has lasted me 2 weeks, and even if it chips a bit, you can&#x27;t tell because it is so shiny, it blends in with the actual nail. :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so shiny and looks as if a \\&quot;transparent coat\\&quot; had been put, although it hasn&#x27;t! I love this nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I thought I could on,y wear it during the evening, for a party or something. But I have been wearing it for everything really, it can be so casual and fancy at the same time. I hope this makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looove this nail polish and advise anyone to buy it! :)</li>
    <li> i saw this on a friend and just had to get it... It really isn&#x27;t PINK, but more of a goldy colour.. it looks green in some lighting but it is a superb colour! this is my first bottle of OPI and I&#x27;ll be sure to buy more. Application is a breeze.</li>
    <li> The nailpolish is beautiful. It goes on very well, like all other OPI products. It takes a few coats to get it to be as vibrant as the picture portrays though.</li>
    <li> Wow, I think this might be my FAVORITE nail polish color of all time! It&#x27;s a pinky-peachy shade with a TON of beautifully brilliant/sparkling gold micro-glitter, I know some people mentioned seeing purple hues as well but I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a couple of days and have seen no hint of purple in this polish (in any light). Two coats is more than enough to get the full opaque effect of this polish. You simply cannot appreciate the how pretty this is from the picture...trust me!</li>
    <li> This polish looks interesting in the bottle, but not particularly memorable.  But wait till you have it on.  It goes from interesting to SPECTACULAR!  In certain lights, the gold gleams like King Tut&#x27;s treasure.  The color shift is pink-purple, and quite striking. I get lots of great compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite colors! I always get complements when I wear OPI Rally Pretty Pink.</li>
    <li> This shade isn&#x27;t something I would normally wear--but it&#x27;s pretty and has interesting undertones to it! Can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice pink sheer sparkly polish, but not too glittery.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite summer OPI shades!  It&#x27;s a perfect combination of a sheer pink with fine gold glitter, so it can appear to be pink, gold, or a combination of the two depending on the angle your nails are viewed from.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this great summer neutral!</li>
    <li> Love this color. It&#x27;s a more rose colored version of Its My Year. It works with my skin tone both when I&#x27;m so pale that I&#x27;m almost transparent and when I&#x27;m actually tan. It&#x27;s achieved the perfect balance of Rose and gold. Seche Vite topcoat really makes it look fantastic.</li>
    <li> I got them in the mail pretty recently and I was due for a manicure so I decided to try it out and I just love it so much. OPI nailpolishes really are superior. It goes on easily, and the color is so lovely! I got a lot of compliments on my first day of wearing it out. Make no mistake, as other reviewers have stated, the gold is the prevailing color and the pink shimmer seems to be the undertone. But it is truly an excellent color! I&#x27;ll definitely only be buying OPI nailpolishes from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this color. I wore it out and my friends loved it. The polish came in less than a week.</li>
    <li> This neutral color is really pretty with the pink undertone and lots of sparkle - Lots of Compliments. I&#x27;m horrible about maintaining my nails, so dark colors that chip easily turn me off because they require too much maintenance, This color last well AND hides imperfections well too! This is my second bottle that I can only find on Amazon - thank goodness it is still here!</li>
    <li> Really pretty and subtle.</li>
    <li> Love this color!!  It&#x27;s shiny and sparkly, too, and changes according to the light and the movement of your hand.</li>
    <li> Love the shimmery, micro glitter in this nail polish. I am not into orangey colors on my nails, but this actually looks great ... on it&#x27;s own or under either gold or black shatter/battered.</li>
    <li> So this wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all. I thought it was going to be orange looking like in the photo and great for Halloween but then read that it was \\&quot;Rally Pretty Pink\\&quot; and thought ok, I&#x27;ll get used to that...but it isn&#x27;t pink either, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this is, is a GORGEOUS pinkISH purple filled with gold glitter dust. It&#x27;s amazing looking. I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s going to be on my nails next week with my next manicure. WOOT! I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like with nail stamping art over it. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to be gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for purchase. It&#x27;s a beautiful color that you shouldn&#x27;t HAVE to live without. It&#x27;s my favorite mistake :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m newly obsessed with this shade! As other commenters have said- it almost turns purple in certain light, but that&#x27;s why I love it! Depending on the lighting, it looks pink, bronze, or purple. It&#x27;s glam and fun, and it catches the light really well. It also stays on my nails really for a long time before chipping (but all glitter polishes tend to do that).   Also, I have very fair skin with pink undertones, and I still think it looks good on me. It would probably look even better on tan or darker skin.</li>
    <li> Unique color, looks nice. thank you</li>
    <li> It depends on the lighting, but this color looks bronzy. To me, it looks like it has a pinkish purple base with lots of tiny gold glitters in it. It looks amazing and it&#x27;s definitely one of my new faves from OPI.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this polish everywhere ever since I got my nails done at a salon. This is definatly my favorite nail color because of how unique it looks. This came to me perfectly brand new and packaged very well.</li>
    <li> The bottle does not do this nail polish justice. When you see it in the bottle, it looks like a dark goldeny- green color, but when you put it on your nails and the light hits it, it looks pink and gold. Very low-key but incredibly pretty and shimmery :) And great application.</li>
    <li> My absolutely favorite color!! Always get lots of compliments on it</li>
    <li> The product is great and the price was nice when I bought it. The price went up quite a bit after though...</li>
    <li> I love this OPI nail polish!  It looks like pink and gold depending on the light.  It goes on nice and last a long time.  It works for summer or winter.</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful. It&#x27;s two toned depending on the lighting. Sometimes is a darker pink and other times its a gold color. This is my new go to color. Blends nicely with my lighter skin tone which I was skeptical of at first. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments as well!</li>
    <li> Lovely, shinny golden pink color. I feel like a princess. It&#x27;s quite light if you apply just one coat. I was happy with three and it doesn&#x27;t look caked at all.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this color when I had it put on at a salon, however when I received this the color is much more sheer than what I had applied. I like the color but you literally have to put on 3 coats to see the beauty of the color</li>
    <li> I really liked this color. It does have a purple shimmer to it in certain light. It is very pretty though.</li>
    <li> This color is gorgeous. It has a lot of gold in it though so if you&#x27;re looking for a pink color, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> The colr is pretty and goes on well when applied. It s a nice summer color. OPI make a good product.</li>
    <li> Great neutral color that is very long lasting...especially on synthetic nails. Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued. Will probably have to stockpile a couple of bottles!</li>
    <li> I bought this polish thinking it was going to be pink with a hint of gold shimmer and it&#x27;s PURPLE with gold shimmer!!! I really am not a purple fan so I don&#x27;t like it. The one thing I will add though is I&#x27;ve had it one for almost 5 days and there&#x27;s hardly any chipping! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the pre-treatment I did to my nails in preparation for the polish, or the polish itself, but I&#x27;m impressed. This is the longest polish has every stayed on my nails.</li>
    <li> This color is a great color and versatile.  If I wear it as a single coat over a lighter color opaque polish, it looks like a semi-transparent coppery wash.  I can also wear it as a second coat for a more dramatic color.  If I don&#x27;t have a an opaque polish and put it over a clear base coat, it is a very pretty color.  Lots of options!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite polishes.  It&#x27;s good for all year around.  It has a pink/purple hue with gold and silver flakes.  It&#x27;s absolutely stunning and is the most dimensional polish I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I get tons and tons of compliments too!</li>
    <li> Such a pretty color, but it is hard to take off because of the glitter, which is to be expected. The color is almost holographic and I have gotten many compliments on my nails when I wore this polish! Definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> This color on nails can go all year round, no matter the season because it picks up what ever color you are wearing day  or night. Amazing multi-color OPI color! You can&#x27;t tell from the photo how amazing this color really is....OMG, time for my 3rd bottle. My clients love this color indeed!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is amazing! I get compliments on it all the time. The duochrome color and sparkle is gorgeous; the photo doesn&#x27;t even do it justice. I only had to apply 2 coats to get the desired color too! If you are on the fence about buy this, do it!!! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I got this nail color in the mail today and I Am In Love! I already own It&#x27;s My Year! and I honestly can&#x27;t tell you which one is better. In my opinion, they are equally beautiful, only this one is more pink. So, if you are more into pink, get this one. If you love purple/lilac more, then you would like It&#x27;s My Year! better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is a light pink with a shimmery gold overtone. This color is more for the Spring or Summer, but I know I will wear this color all year round----whenever I need a pick-me-up. Lovely! A must have!</li>
    <li> Great color, subtle enough for the office. Definitely needs at least 2 coats for full opacity even with short nails.</li>
    <li> My newest and best color!  Everyone raves over this impossible to find color!  The perfect shade to go with nearly any outfit.</li>
    <li> I expected more shiny holo effect, but it only came out as a shimmery gold-red. It&#x27;s still pretty though. It did ship quickly enough too.</li>
    <li> My favorite polish (well, tied with Purple with a Porpoise) from OPI.  It looks beautiful over a purple base and by itself!</li>
    <li> Really pretty color. Great nail polish!</li>
    <li> Love this color!! Couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore.</li>
    <li> Had a pedicure done with this polish and I immediately fell in love with it. Of course the salon was out so I had to find it online. This is by far my favorite nail polish ever.</li>
    <li> Color is awesome, I think it looks better on toes but also nice on fingernails. Looks goldish and purplish depending on the light.</li>
