### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>did this 2 days ago, and my nails still look perfect.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased!!!</li>
      <li>Stays intact and perfectly shiny.</li>
      <li>Awesome product!!!!!</li>
      <li>But when it does, it&#x27;s flawless!</li>
      <li>I was not overly impressed.</li>
      <li>it looks great for one day.</li>
      <li>color which is neutral and looks great.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Love this polish!!</li>
      <li>fabulous-and you can use any polist and do this as a top coat-fabulous!!  </li>
      <li>Sally Hansen gel polish is amazing!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
      <li>Would buy again, Price good.</li>
      <li>Excellent product and it works very well for me.</li>
      <li>A nice collection</li>
      <li>coat--use the Miracle Gel Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
      <li>OK, I&#x27;ve changed this from 2 stars to 1.</li>
      <li>this nail polish is okay.</li>
      <li>Two days is more like it.  </li>
      <li>Will buy more colors.&lt;br /&gt;The top coat does disolve/remove color coats.  </li>
      <li>With the Miracle Gel top coat they made it about 5 days before they started chipping.</li>
      <li>The Gel Top Coat adheres to nails way better than the Insta-Dri.</li>
      <li>I hoped the top coat would make the color stay on longer without chipping.</li>
      <li>But the top coat &#x27;pulls&#x27; the nail polish off.</li>
      <li>In the meantime,  I used Seche Vite top coat, in place of the recommended top coat.</li>
      <li>Better than a salon gel manicure?</li>
      <li>coat--Miracle Gel Top Coat</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll post an update in a couple of weeks after I see whether it made the color more chip-proof.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I am honestly very impressed with how long it has lasted.</li>
      <li>It has 101 on the top of the bottle, and the original has 100 on it.</li>
      <li>It was easy to remove, which is a plus since sometimes the gel polish can be a pain to get off.  </li>
      <li>This is the top coat I&#x27;ve been waiting for my whole life!!</li>
      <li>I used the miracle gel polish with the miracle gel top coat and still chipped right away.</li>
      <li>Originally I was happy with the results, since my manicures typically do not last longer than 24 hours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this polish and really like the fact that I can go so long without a manicure.  </li>
      <li>and it still looks great despite being rough on my hands...</li>
      <li>Healthy nails are more important than an extra 3 days of wear, to me.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad if you&#x27;re in a bind.</li>
      <li>love product super fast delivery - cheaper</li>
      <li>Luckily it comes off with polish remover pretty easily.</li>
      <li>The problem with those, however, is that Insta-Dri chips off so quickly.</li>
      <li>The one they sent also says Miracle Gel 2X Volume Top Coat, which the older version I have does not say.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t care for the opaque colors that much because I really like more of an iridescence like some of the colors in the Insta-Dri line.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>It really does set w/o a light, and it&#x27;s ready to go in about a minute.</li>
      <li>Better than regular nail polish?</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t quite as durable as gel manicures at a salon, but it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>You have to buy $15 bottle of color polish, plus $15 for this top coat, only to find out</li>
      <li>When I spotted this at the store I decided to buy just the gel top coat to apply over a regular nail polish I had at home.</li>
      <li>So, here&#x27;s the solution I&#x27;ve come up with, and it works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Base</li>
      <li>I think I am going to go back to using my Sally Hansen Instadry polish because that is my favorite</li>
      <li>I picked up the top coat and some colors at my local Kmart for $7.99 BOGO 50% off.</li>
      <li>This stuff really does work!</li>
      <li>The gel really strengthenes my nails and it doesn&#x27;t chip unless you work with your hands in hot water for hours and hours.</li>
      <li>Which is actually fine with me as my nails have grown enough by then</li>
      <li>And it was finished and ready to go in about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>It can cause the polish to chip a bit fast though.</li>
      <li>Thanks Mickey</li>
      <li>Once it dried it seemed more durable than just a regular top coat.  </li>
      <li>I have gray, plum, oxblood, red and a light brown.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I have several colors and can only hope that the company expands their collection now that the polish has become so popular.  </li>
      <li>Slow shipping but good product and price.</li>
      <li>I applied 2 coats of normal nail polish, let it dry then applied the gel top coat according to the directions.</li>
      <li>It began chipping the next day, unlike the older version, which was fantastic.</li>
      <li>I tried it several other times making sure my nails were clean of oils</li>
      <li>Does not dry quickly.</li>
      <li>TO BE VERY CLEAR (No pun intended!)</li>
      <li>I bought this with high hopes, but it chips after 2 days.</li>
      <li>Maybe not like a professional gel mani but certainly better than any other topcoat</li>
      <li>For the price, for me, it&#x27;s worth saving the time and extra money of having to go to the salon every two weeks</li>
      <li>It really just reminds me of any other normal nail polish, nothing special.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with plain old-fashion nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Even from a brand new bottle, the color went on streaky.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m looking forward to new seasonal colors.  </li>
      <li>Dried very quickly.</li>
      <li>It lasted through handling and rubbing up against rocks, washing dishes, house cleaning, and (most importantly) daily finger combing of my long hair as well as several showers involving scalp scrubbing.</li>
      <li>It lasted a week and a half for me, used on top of  &#x27;Cumbustealble&#x27; blue, but then I think it was the pealing of my nails at the tip that started to make it chip.</li>
      <li>It did not dry very quickly, and it was mushy for a long time, just like regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>coat--another Insta-Dri clear, maybe two if you want&lt;br /&gt;Top</li>
      <li>Insta-Dri clear</li>
      <li>Only reason to take it off is because too much of nail has grown out.  </li>
      <li>I have used this specific Miracle Gel before, and it works very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near the durability and strength of going to the salon and getting shellac</li>
      <li>I wash my hands like crazy and this top coat keeps the polish on!!</li>
      <li>I have had absolutely NO luck with this product (including the first coat colors).  </li>
      <li>What they sent me was a newer version of this item, apparently.</li>
      <li>I did two coats of the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel polish (color was 510: Game of Chromes) and finished it with one coat of the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Top Coat.</li>
      <li>It is not nearly as good as the original.</li>
      <li>Not worth the high price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this with high hopes, but it chips after 2 days. I keep trying it, too, thinking it will change b/c it looks great for one day. You have to buy $15 bottle of color polish, plus $15 for this top coat, only to find out it&#x27;s not returnable. Regrettable purchases. Luckily it comes off with polish remover pretty easily.</li>
    <li> this price, for just ONE polish?  highway robbery :(</li>
    <li> This is the top coat I&#x27;ve been waiting for my whole life!! Stays intact and perfectly shiny. It also works with other nail polish brands you just have to wait longer for it to dry. But when it does, it&#x27;s flawless! So it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I picked up the top coat and some colors at my local Kmart for $7.99 BOGO 50% off. Not too bad I think. Let&#x27;s see if it lasts two weeks</li>
    <li> When used with the Miracle Gel color, I did not like at all. Even from a brand new bottle, the color went on streaky. So, I tried with a regular nail polish. I hoped the top coat would make the color stay on longer without chipping. But the top coat &#x27;pulls&#x27; the nail polish off. Even with the base color coat dry, it dissolves it to a degree. HOWEVER, with 2 coats of color, careful application over regular polish was still better--it thinned the polish but didn&#x27;t make it streaky.  I&#x27;ll post an update in a couple of weeks after I see whether it made the color more chip-proof. I just cannot recommend the colors of this product--I found no way to avoid ugly streaks.  5-17-2015 UPDATE: OK, I&#x27;ve changed this from 2 stars to 1. This stuff is just awful. No redeeming value whatsoever. Buy regular polish, or spring for the gel nails.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I used this and followed all the instructions. The polish chipped within 2 HOURS! That&#x27;s HOURS, not days or weeks. I tried it several other times making sure my nails were clean of oils but nothing worked. The WORST gel polish ever.</li>
    <li> The gel really strengthenes my nails and it doesn&#x27;t chip unless you work with your hands in hot water for hours and hours. I&#x27;m a bartender so even with the gel my manicure lasts only a day. Two tops. But when I don&#x27;t work it lasts until I remove it.</li>
    <li> I puchased, from Walmart, colors Red Eye #470 and Malibu Peach #380. Originally I was happy with the results, since my manicures typically do not last longer than 24 hours. So I decided to order step 2 from Amazon. In the meantime,  I used Seche Vite top coat, in place of the recommended top coat. My manicure lasted longer, but only like 4 days, which is an improvement. Maybe if I used step 2 my manicure would&#x27;ve lasted longer, I don&#x27;t know. One thing I noticed about color 380 is it was very streaky, compared to my other polishes, even other lines of Sally Hansen.  Unfortunately when the polish chipped, I noticed that the top layer of my nails, at the tips, too started to peel where the polish had chipped away. I do not believe this has anything to do with not using step 2, the polish seems to have a drying effect on my nails. If you decide to purchase this polish, I recommend using a base coat to protect your nails. It&#x27;s a longer lasting polish but it does not compare to salon gel polish, although it&#x27;s a healthier alternative. Can&#x27;t say I would purchase Mircle Gel again. Healthy nails are more important than an extra 3 days of wear, to me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  Used with the gel polish it truly lasts twice as long without a chip as regular polish.  I get about 10 days of wear from this polish.  After that, my cuticles look ragged and a manicure is definitely in order.  But it lasts all that time without a chip.  I do apply the topcoat every few days for shine, just as I do with regular polish.  I have several colors and can only hope that the company expands their collection now that the polish has become so popular.  I have gray, plum, oxblood, red and a light brown.  A nice collection but I&#x27;m looking forward to new seasonal colors.  I&#x27;m impressed with this polish and really like the fact that I can go so long without a manicure.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this polish!! Has lasted two weeks for me.  Only reason to take it off is because too much of nail has grown out.  I&#x27;ve been weeding and do dishes daily and no chips. Dried very quickly. Will buy more colors.&lt;br /&gt;The top coat does disolve/remove color coats.  Don&#x27;t over brush it on.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Will add details as I wear it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and it works very well for me. Thanks</li>
    <li> this nail polish is okay. It can cause the polish to chip a bit fast though.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work! The only manicure that I ever get now is a gel/shellac manicure because regular polish has always lasted only a day or two on my nails before chipping. I bought this polish because I don&#x27;t always have time to get a gel manicure at the salon and don&#x27;t like paying $30 every time. I am honestly very impressed with how long it has lasted. It has been a week and there are no chips and it still looks great despite being rough on my hands...work at a hospital w/ hand sanitizers; cleaned my house and car; dishes; etc. I bought the &amp;#34;birthday suit&amp;#34; color which is neutral and looks great. I definitely recommend this product! I do recommend buffing your nails before applying.</li>
    <li> Better than regular nail polish? Yes. Better than a salon gel manicure? No. I&#x27;m middle of the road hard on my nails, and mine lasted a week. Which is actually fine with me as my nails have grown enough by then that it&#x27;s nearing time for a change anyway. For the price, for me, it&#x27;s worth saving the time and extra money of having to go to the salon every two weeks</li>
    <li> The worst thing ever !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lasted one day.....99 cent polish lasts longer...dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Would buy again, Price good. Thanks Mickey</li>
    <li> I have had absolutely NO luck with this product (including the first coat colors).  It does not perform as advertised; that it lasts up to 14 days without chipping.  Two days is more like it.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with plain old-fashion nail polish.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Miracle Gel set from Target. Don&#x27;t waste your money! It goes on streaky, dries slowly, and definitely doesn&#x27;t worth those $15 for 2 bottles. I used color #160, a beige-pinky shadow.</li>
    <li> Slow shipping but good product and price.</li>
    <li> I painted my nails following the bottle directions. I did two coats of the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel polish (color was 510: Game of Chromes) and finished it with one coat of the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Top Coat. I was not overly impressed. I painted them on Saturday evening and by Sunday afternoon I had chips off the end of a few of my nails and some indents that were not originally there on Sunday morning. It really just reminds me of any other normal nail polish, nothing special. I wasn&#x27;t doing any hard labor or anything particularly harsh on my nails, so I was kind of disappointed in this polish. I think I am going to go back to using my Sally Hansen Instadry polish because that is my favorite and I feel like it lasts longer and gets harder than this nail polish does.</li>
    <li> Does not dry quickly.</li>
    <li> Not worth the high price.</li>
    <li> love product super fast delivery - cheaper then aeverywhere else</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for! Maybe not like a professional gel mani but certainly better than any other topcoat</li>
    <li> When I spotted this at the store I decided to buy just the gel top coat to apply over a regular nail polish I had at home. So,if that idea crossed your mind, then this is the review for you. I applied 2 coats of normal nail polish, let it dry then applied the gel top coat according to the directions. Once it dried it seemed more durable than just a regular top coat.  Typically when I paint my nails, they&#x27;re chipping within a day or 2. With the Miracle Gel top coat they made it about 5 days before they started chipping. It was easy to remove, which is a plus since sometimes the gel polish can be a pain to get off.  It&#x27;s nowhere near the durability and strength of going to the salon and getting shellac but it&#x27;s not bad if you&#x27;re in a bind.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen gel polish is amazing! It definitely does not disappoint! I wash my hands like crazy and this top coat keeps the polish on!! Awesome product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased!!! It lasted a week and a half for me, used on top of  &#x27;Cumbustealble&#x27; blue, but then I think it was the pealing of my nails at the tip that started to make it chip. It lasted through handling and rubbing up against rocks, washing dishes, house cleaning, and (most importantly) daily finger combing of my long hair as well as several showers involving scalp scrubbing. No nail polish has ever stood up to one hair grooming session. I never had to file or prep my nails in any way in order for it to last.</li>
    <li> TO BE VERY CLEAR (No pun intended!) I did not get the item pictured. I have used this specific Miracle Gel before, and it works very well. I would give it five stars. What they sent me was a newer version of this item, apparently. It has 101 on the top of the bottle, and the original has 100 on it. The one they sent also says Miracle Gel 2X Volume Top Coat, which the older version I have does not say. It is not nearly as good as the original. It did not dry very quickly, and it was mushy for a long time, just like regular nail polish. It began chipping the next day, unlike the older version, which was fantastic. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this mail polish and it didn&#x27;t even come with an application brush.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t quite as durable as gel manicures at a salon, but it works pretty well. It really does set w/o a light, and it&#x27;s ready to go in about a minute. Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the opaque colors that much because I really like more of an iridescence like some of the colors in the Insta-Dri line. The problem with those, however, is that Insta-Dri chips off so quickly. Usually by the next day, I feel like I need to do my nails again.  So, here&#x27;s the solution I&#x27;ve come up with, and it works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Base coat--use the Miracle Gel Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;Next coat--Insta-Dri clear&lt;br /&gt;Next coat--Insta-Dri in a shimmery color.  Just one coat.&lt;br /&gt;Next coat--another Insta-Dri clear, maybe two if you want&lt;br /&gt;Top coat--Miracle Gel Top Coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this 2 days ago, and my nails still look perfect. The Gel Top Coat adheres to nails way better than the Insta-Dri. And it was finished and ready to go in about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> fabulous-and you can use any polist and do this as a top coat-fabulous!!  you remove it when your nails have grown out of it, not because it looks bad</li>
    <li> Made my nails weak and split. I used the miracle gel polish with the miracle gel top coat and still chipped right away.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I would recommend.</li>
