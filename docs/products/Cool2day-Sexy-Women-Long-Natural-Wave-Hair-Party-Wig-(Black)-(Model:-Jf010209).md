<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter and she is greatful with it.I recommend anyone to buy this product good quality .</li>
    <li> It is the most beautiful wig I have in my collection, and it just looks great all together! I wore it for 18 hours at a convention and the ware was wonderful! I really would suggest it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The bangs on this wig are funky. I had to cut them and they still look weird. This is the worst quality wig out of the ten that I own, Good maybe for Halloween, but otherwise purchase something else.</li>
    <li> The company was glad to send out the replacement wig along with a courtesy call  &amp; tryed 2 work as much as possible to fix my issues without me trying to contact them @ all. I received it 1/3/14 &amp; it was nice I like the wig looks great on me ; )</li>
    <li> This was the first wig I&#x27;ve ever ordered for cosplay and I was happily surprised. I had no idea what it would look like or feel like but I&#x27;m very impressed. It doesn&#x27;t tangle much and it feels like real hair.</li>
    <li> Was tangled and super glossy and the curls just stick to each other and can&#x27;t be separated without getting worse and only the bangs were soft. Actually, if I could get rid of the rest of it and keep the bangs, I would.</li>
    <li> I really like this wig. It&#x27;s not the sturdiest, but it&#x27;s fine for a month or two of normal wear, and would be great for cosplay. Nice light curl, not cheap feeling.</li>
    <li> The wig is very soft, but also prone to tangling. Most long wigs tend to be in my experience. For the price, it&#x27;s more than worth the money and the shipping time was faster then expected. It looks real, fits well, and all in all was more than worth the money spent. I&#x27;ve worn it a ton, since I&#x27;m growing out a pixie cut, and have received a ton of compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> Saves me money on hair dye</li>
    <li> A little bulky up top but other then that it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> About an inch shorter than shown.  But honestly my best wig, I love it! ! !</li>
    <li> This hair was horrible matted up in the same day!</li>
    <li> The over a wig was amazing but the front is actually a curly bang so you might have to alter it a little</li>
    <li> I really only bought this for my Halloween costume, so frankly I didn&#x27;t care if it looked like crap. I was extremely surprised at how silky and pretty it is, plus it&#x27;s very full so I was able to put it in a ponytail (yeah I know, the point of a wig is so you can wear your hair long without the hassle, but my Halloween character has a ponytail). It got here ahead of schedule, and it really is gorgeous. Plus it was packaged really neatly in a hair net, so it came out of the envelope tangle and frizz free.</li>
    <li> I rate it as five starts.. I Love everything about it the color and length just beautiful! I placed another order! Can&#x27;t wait to see it. But I kno it&#x27;s going to be great!</li>
    <li> My wig came yesterday and I am super excited! I&#x27;m usually wary about buying wigs for this cheap but one of my friends had bought it for her Jade cosplay and she said it was really good and I have to agree! I got this for my Vriska/Aradia/Jade cosplays and I can already tell it&#x27;s going to be perfect for all of them! (I also bought one for one of my friends for her Aradia cosplay but it has yet to arrive) It took a while for it to come but it didn&#x27;t surprise me since it shipped from China. It tangles easily but that&#x27;s what you should expect from a ling (and curly) wig. It&#x27;s really natural looking and soft and overall a great product! 10/10 would recommend</li>
    <li> It searves it&#x27;s purpose. Change your style instantly and it looks good. It&#x27;s a little tangely but good for the price.</li>
    <li> Great wig, looks very realistic and pretty. Excellent wig for the price, great for cosplaying, which is what my granddaughter used it for.</li>
    <li> My daughter really enjoys cosplay, and she has told me she is really impressed with the quality of this wig.</li>
    <li> I like this wig. It looks very good. However, like many long wigs, it has a tendency to become tangled during use(especially where it rubs against your back), so I will have to use conditioner or something to get out the tangles. I wore it to Anime Fest and got complements on it, so overall I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. I love it, it&#x27;s just what I expected, perfect for Homestuck/any cosplay or just for everyday use. Love it. Just be warned it&#x27;ll tangle easily but with the right brush you should be able to handle it.</li>
    <li> I really like this wig. it is well worth getting for the price. I will probably cut a few inches off of it, but it really is a decent wig. If you want a nice wavy black wig at a low price, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had a ruff  start by not getting the wig...but customer servixe was wonderful and sent me out another and I did receive it in a timely manner....I love it...its extremely soft...the only thing is that it desnt have and clips or combs so you would have to use bobby pins to really keep it on...</li>
    <li> I love this wig! the lengh is great, it soft and silk black....the texture is natural and the wig came in a timely manner....the bangs are somewhat long.but, overall, the wig is worth price.</li>
    <li> just as described, nice shipping.&lt;br /&gt;a long, realistic wig. not too thick, but its thick enough. I love it! I wore it for my concert and everyone thought I had dyed my hair</li>
    <li> I like this wig a lot, the curls are great and color is  a nice shade of black, its more like a off black which is even better!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cute one-off cosplay wig this is the wig for you. If you&#x27;re looking for an everyday wig or a durable high quality cosplay wig (say, for a photoshoot), probably not the wig for you.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s higher quality then something you would get at a costume store for sure, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t look like real hair. The waves are bouncy and nice. The length is as shown. The bangs are side swept but need a lot of styling. It&#x27;s not nearly as thick as the photo shows but I expected that and I&#x27;m not disappointed. It sheds. It&#x27;s slightly shiny. You get what you pay for. But it&#x27;s an adorable wig nonetheless and perfect for a Homestuck cosplay (specifically Vriska, Jade or Meulin - not long enough for Feferi and the side part is stubborn so i wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to part it in the middle for Aradia. You could maybe cut it into a Porrim wig but it is really wavy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to know is: it runs small, if you have a bigger than average sized head or a LOT of hair then beware.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. Its full and curly snd it fits perfectly. I was so happy to find this item.</li>
    <li> I gt lots o compliments when I wear this. too cute! ts is perfectly girly and flirty, and so so much fun</li>
    <li> I bought to Skype and surprise my traveling husband.  He loved it.  I was very impressed with quality for the price.  Too much fun!  Will enjoy for a long time to come!  Appreciate the value of this product.</li>
    <li> THIS WIG IS NOT WORTH IT AND ITS NOT TRUE TO COLOR AND IT ALSO TANGLED EASILY AND I DONT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE,VERY DISAPPOINTED......</li>
    <li> This wig arrived very quickly and in excellent condition. It&#x27;s soft, not shiny at all, and is easily one of the best wigs I own. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and it reaches my mid-back. It features a middle part but seems like it would easily be able to be parted from the side, however, I haven&#x27;t tried. The company also threw in a small &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34;, in my case, a pair of socks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> i put the wig on and it was so messy when i got it out of the package that all the hair was so frizzy and messed up that i couldnt even figure out which direction the bangs went into .. the bangs cover half of my face ... not really satisfied.. but its ok</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the softest cosplay wig I&#x27;ve ever bought, but it&#x27;s really pretty and works perfectly for my Shego cosplay. Also, there was no telling whether or not I&#x27;d get it in time for what I needed it for (chances were it was going to get here after), but the sellers were very helpful in their responses and it arrived the day before I needed it, so as you can imagine, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. :)</li>
    <li> Worth the money if you&#x27;re willing to be super tender with it. I dont brush it for fear of pulling out hair, but luckily it looks good still.</li>
    <li> A MESS HAIR WAYYYYYY TO SHINY IM THINKING IM GETTING A NICE WIG BECAUSE I ALWAYS READ MY REVIEWS BUT NEVER AGAIN</li>
    <li> Let me say that this wig looks nothing like the picture! The bangs were unruly. The wig came packaged in a cheap little bag. I was expecting a box. The wig cap had a huge hole in it! The company took a month to deliver this wig to me. The wig is also a lot shorter than it appears in the picture.  I wanted to purchase it because I damaged my hair. So the idea was to wear the wig while I treated my hair and nourished it. Well, the wig took so long to come in the mail that my hair actually grew back.  And that is not an exaggeration.  Also the wig was really nappy.  If you are an African American woman looking to buy a wig that you think you will look natural in, do not buy this wig. The hair was glossy and plastic looking. It looked like Barbie doll hair. The minute I put it on you could tell it was a wig. I tried wearing it down the street and people were looking at me funny.  The bangs were not manageable at all. I tried cutting them but that did not help at all. DO NOT BUT THIS WIG. It is cheap and it looks cheap. And the wig will not last you. In fact I threw the wig out the next day. It wasn&#x27;t even worth it! I will never buy from this vendor again. For $20.00 or $50.00 you can just buy a much better looking wig at the beauty supply store. I read all the reviews on Amazon before I bought this wig; usually the reviews are dead on. But the reviews were not true in this case. People gave this wig good reviews but this wig was horrible.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!I.  Got it a few days ahead of schedule and  when I opened it up I was astound by the sheer beauty and  overall quality. I will be purchasing more wigs from this company  ( I love costumes : X)  Nowhere are you going to find the same quality at a decent price.</li>
    <li> very very nice espcially for the price....and i when i took it out of the box and unwrapped the wig t really looks like the picture</li>
    <li> Received in 3 days. Wig is soft and shiny. I checked for bugs as some other reviews on amazon wigs said they found white bugs in theirs. (Gross!) No problems here though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig came packaged in a ziplock type bag. Opened it up, shook it out and out it on. There are a lot of bangs and it doesn&#x27;t just part to one side or the other. I will have to work on it to find a good style to keep the bangs from overpowering my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig is not as wavy as the picture nor as thick in the length part, but I am still pleased with it. Nice black color, not fake looking at all.</li>
    <li> A Great  Very Well Made and Very Great Texture and It Has A Great Color To The Hair Affordable Wig,</li>
    <li> Lov it , got it Today and its perfect for the price ill tangled but for what u pay it is so worth it</li>
    <li> The wig looks exactly as pictured. The shipping time wasn&#x27;t too long, my only complaint would be cost of shipping but c&#x27;est la vie. It&#x27;s easily styled and looks fabulous~! Perfect for Homestuck cosplayers!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter seemed pleased with wig.  Not for regular use, but for costume and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Amazing for under $10</li>
    <li> This wig is high quality. It was perfect for my vampire costume. I got a lot of compliments on it some said it looked like my real hair. Very natural and comfortable to wear. Will buy from again!</li>
    <li> First impression was that it was rather tangled, but that wasn&#x27;t surprising at all because it had just been shipped from far away. After wearing it for a few hours, it did get pretty tangled again, but there are methods that can be used to keep this from happening, such as washing it with a little bit of fabric softener. (I haven&#x27;t tried this yet.) The look of the wig isn&#x27;t extremely shiny (unless you take pictures with the flash) and some people might believe that it&#x27;s real hair, but there is still a slight plastic look to it. For the price I got it at, I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this wig to a Halloween party a few days after I got it, (I improvised a spotted cat look an hour before I had to leave) and then I straightened it and wore it with my elf costume when I went to The Hobbit: Battle of Fire Armies midnight premiere at a locate theater a few months later. Both times, I was very happy with the wig and almost forgot I was wearing it because it was so comfortable.</li>
    <li> It looks so fake ewww</li>
    <li> It took a while (about a couple days over the schedule date), but I am absolutely in love with this wig so it was worth the wait! It looks beyond natural and shinny! As someone who owns a lot a wigs (due to doing cosplays), I can say this is my new all time favourite! It&#x27;s to take care of, it doesn&#x27;t get tangled easily, and it&#x27;s beautiful and easy to style! Defiantly buying from this company again!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my teen daughter.  It is pretty good quality for such a low price, so far we are impressed.</li>
    <li> It looks so real and its in amazing condition! its so smooth! TOTALLY recommend this!! &amp;#60;3 Very happy with it! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I have had many wigs from multiple wig companies. Most of them run from about $40-$60 so this time I was looking for a cheaper alternative. I was needing a black wig and decided on this one. It came very quickly and the quality is really nice for the price! It&#x27;s very soft and curly. The weight is good too. It&#x27;s not too heavy like some of my other wigs and it feels comfortable. They included a netted wig cap with it. It should be pretty good for photo shoots, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear it out as it is a little bit shiny. I was expecting that though and I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I wear wigs all the time so I can say just by feeling it that it is not the best synthetic quality at all. It was also a bit shiny to me so I added some powder to dull the shine. We will see how long it last though. I will provide an update in a couple weeks... Hopefully the wig will last that long. The great thing was the shipping. The delivery estimate was between September 23-October 9 and I received it today September 8th. If I can find a way to post the pic I will.</li>
    <li> i orderd black and got a dark brown its ok other than it sheds alol but i guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Goodnight Product arrived quickly and well, very seriously recommended the purchase 100%, no detail, and size is the corect perfer</li>
    <li> I ordered this in hopes of getting a very dark black wig, similar to the character Vriska Serket from a popular webcomic called Homestuck, written by Andrew Hussie. I was VERY pleased! I would also suggest using it for a Jane Harley cosplay, as well. The cut if perfect for Jade, but I had to trim a bit of the bangs so that I could get a side fringe thingy. I have no idea what you would call it. I also wore this out in public to test the look, and many people complimented me. I&#x27;m hoping to order from this store again! c:</li>
    <li> I like this wig but you should be able to pick your size and it should come with combs on it i would pay more if it did, it do have enought  hair and the hair is good i put conditioner on it and the curls came back.</li>
    <li> Great wig! Totally works for HOMESTUCK! AMAZING quality for the price.  Holds its shape over and over. No brushing required.</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased this, and was a little skeptical because of the inexpensive price!! I was so wrong!&lt;br /&gt;This is better than my $50+ wig I bought a long time ago! I have also tossed this around a bit (on accident) and it didn&#x27;t tangle up at all! It&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for a Jade, Vriska, Aradia, and Meulin cosplay (works for other characters too!)&lt;br /&gt;It looks amazing with my cosplays! It looks good to even wear out of the house! :)&lt;br /&gt;10 out of 10!</li>
    <li> Love the way the wig looks on me. Not a big fan of the texture, which is the reason I&#x27;m rating it a 4. Must be careful removing wig from package so it won&#x27;t tangle. Once u learn how to manage it, it&#x27;s a great wig. ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> Decent wig, very inexpensive, good service. I definitely feel like I got a good deal, and had no problems what so ever.</li>
    <li> This wig is awesome. Easily styled with heat, very thick. Straightened it for a Jade Harley cosplay, which gave it just the right look. However it is hard to brush (it sheds like crazy), and you should store it carefully, since long wigs can go from beautiful to nasty with improper care. Also, the wig gives off a dull gray shine, which actually looks very nice. It&#x27;s very nicely sized as well.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC quality for the price! It&#x27;s easy to get tangled if you don&#x27;t take care of it, but it comes very neat! I barely had to comb it at all. The curls are adorable! I would definitely recommend this wig. I&#x27;m thinking about wearing it out and about instead of just for cosplay!</li>
    <li> Wow adorable and a good buy my only problem is its a little bit thin but this wig fit any accasion and can be styled as desired and  for the price I would definitely recommend anyone to buy this wig.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig just to have some pictures taken and expecting a rough to the touch yet \\&quot;seemingly\\&quot; nice low quality wig&amp;I was absolutely WRONG!!This wig is the softest synthetic wig that I&#x27;ve ever felt,you can also restyle it meaning applying low heat  will not damage it!Its super long &amp;beautiful and I will be definitely be wearing it for other occasions in the future,the only thing is that its kinda shiny ,but not too much so its ok :) Its definitely worth the price,its a very unexpectedly great product of very good quality...oh yea&amp;its not a thin stringy wig either ;)!!!!</li>
    <li> Took forever to arrive. The hair Quality seems ok but you could see patches of the weave cap underneath. There is a somewhat adjustable strap which did not at all hold wig in place. The wig is brown/black. I am half asian with delicate facial features. The bangs were super thick, stiff and clunky-looking overpowing my face and it would seem to overpower anyones face. Looked so fake and slid around on my head... Its not like i wanted to pass it off as REAL hair, i just wanted it for dressup with my husband. But  was too fake for even dressup.  Sadness</li>
    <li> It was nice. Gets frizzy though. dont wear when it rains!!!</li>
    <li> Can barely tell front from back. Dont buy....too good to be tru!</li>
    <li> I didnt like the texture at all.</li>
    <li> It was as if it were hair that I was born with!  I looked so beautiful--even though I had makeup that was starting to smear and fade!  I only had to pose for a picture three or four times, and all of the pictures were either cute, or incredibly beautiful!  This is quite a big deal to me!  It usually takes lots of pictures, and many frustrating--or harsh--poses to look good in a picture with most other wigs I have modeled--but not with this one!  The title of the wig says it all!  Sexy!</li>
    <li> My item got lost in shipping and no one really noticed it until it was a month overdue. I contacted the seller and they figured it out and got it right to me within two days! Great customer service. And the product was as stated, and it was beautiful! thank you!</li>
    <li> This wig didn&#x27;t even fit at all it was super small and I don&#x27;t even have have a big head at all it fit my kids so I let them have it</li>
    <li> The wig is very natural! I love the hair and that it is curly. It was a perfect disguise for my halloween:)</li>
    <li> Works amazingl and looks great!!! I&#x27;m using this for an Aradia, Feferi, Mewilin, and just about any other character that needs a long black wig.</li>
    <li> The wig came in the first day it said that it would and so I was satisfied with that. I then opened the package and pulled out the wig and it was absolutely gorgeous and better than I was expecting. It was a bit tangled when it came out of the package, but that&#x27;s expected for it being as long of a wig as it is(I&#x27;m 4&#x27;11\\&quot; and when I put it on it went down to my waist). *FYI, I&#x27;d suggest getting a wig cap for it before it comes in, because it does not come with one.* It took me a while to get it brushed out, but I was definitely satisfied with the wig once I got it brushed out. Though not exactly like the picture, It had some nice wavy curls that looked really pretty(If you want even better curls, I would suggest using some mousse to style it). I will say that the bangs are heavier looking than in the picture, so they&#x27;d probably need trimmed up a bit before wearing the wig. Also, I had to trim up the ends of the wig, so that it wouldn&#x27;t look like it had split ends. It really is a gorgeous wig, though, and purrfect for my Meulin cosplay. It would definitely be wonderful for a few other Homestuck cosplays, too. It really looks and feels like real hair and I would say that it is definitely a really good price. I am beyond satisfied with this wig, it&#x27;s so darn pretty!&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten to wear the wig a few times now since I posted this review. It is still a really nice wig, but it does need restyling before wearing it again. Also, I&#x27;d suggest after a time or two of wearing it that you should make sure and wash the wig, especially to ease out the tangles in the wig that will happen. I&#x27;ve found this wig to be quite durable and it has been absolutely wonderful for my Meulin cosplay. I&#x27;ve even had people think that it was my actual hair! I love this wig to death~</li>
    <li> This wig is only a couple dollars more than your average halloween costume shop wig, but FAR superior in quality.  The long black waves/curls are very nice and the fit on the head is great.  I&#x27;m really glad I got this instead of the crummy wigs you usually find sold along with costumes.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the wig was very nicely packaged and shipped-- not mangled or distorted at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig because I wanted to be a vampire for my Halloween party and I have short blonde hair. In the picture it looked better than most of the fake looking wigs in the Halloween stores so I thought, for the price, I&#x27;ll give this a try. When I took it out of box, it was soft, the waves were beautiful, and I couldn&#x27;t believe what great quality this wig has for the price!!! I am a lead vocalist for a successful corporate band and I would literally wear this onstage! It&#x27;s not too shiny like a lot of synthetic wigs, which makes it look even more natural. I posted a photo of me on fb, and everyone thought I actually dyed my hair. Tons of compliments! Totally sexy! I will be ordering more wigs from this company in the future!</li>
    <li> This product smelled bad and shed constantly! Very disppointed and did not bother to return.  Beware before you invest to made a purchase.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing quality for its low price. It&#x27;s great for cosplay or just for fun. I do wish it came with a wig cap. This wig is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> The bangs are a bit long, but give you a gorgeous look when you sweep them to the side like on the model. I choose to sweep 70% of them to one side and the other 30% to the other to give it a more balanced look. The curls look amazing and this one reaches to my lower back ( I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 4&#x27;&#x27; ) If you make sure you darken your eyebrows it looks like real hair. The quality is amazing and it&#x27;s pretty comfortable to wear. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the material this wig is made out of.  The synthetic hair is a low grade of hair.  Nice for one wear.</li>
    <li> Just received today. 1 dayst before scheduled arrival.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is very soft and realistic right out of bag. I&#x27;m a bit worried it will tangle up bad because of length and fiber of hair, but it was a really nice price. Only thing is bangs arnt exactly like in picture (long side swept). They are very nice and thick but more strait across. You can push to side though or spilt down middle.&lt;br /&gt;I def would recommend this and buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Also I will mention its a soft realistic black color for hair.</li>
    <li> I love this wig one of the cuter that I own ! Shipping of course was on time but long. Still its beautifully made an hangs like a dream ! Would recommend to friends an family ! Definitely worth the wait !</li>
    <li> Horrible quality, disgusting smell!&lt;br /&gt;Contacted seller for a return, had me jumping through hoops! Refused to take any action to help! Threw them in the garbage!! Looks nothing like product pictured!! Do not buy!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the costume! It looks great!</li>
    <li> Okay, this wig is aaaaaaaamazing.  It&#x27;s long and full and really pretty.  It took a little while to get here because it was lost in transit.  I contacted the seller, and they took care of it pretty easily!  So if you&#x27;re thinking about buying this, do it!</li>
    <li> I must say that i was originally very upset about my order, first off all I received it 2 months after i originally ordered it then the product I got wasnt the greatest quality.  I told the vendor this, and they sent me an ever BETTER quality wig and i am very pleased with it.  They started out rocky but they really redeemed themselves.  And for this purpose i would definitely order again. They didnt just leave me hanging, they did everything possible until i was happy. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> For this price I can&#x27;t beat it wish there was more hair but it will do the job for a cheap diy halloween costume</li>
    <li> I wore this wig for a Homestuck Meulin cosplay. It&#x27;s not as full as I would like it to be and it did tangle a lot but not too bad,</li>
    <li> i love it  look just like the pic  no more beauty supplies store for me</li>
    <li> I just got my wig in the mail today and  I am so happy with it  I have no complains here.just really good product</li>
</ol>
