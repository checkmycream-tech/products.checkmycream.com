      <li>, what more can I say .</li>
      <li>The shipping was awesome, product arrived sooner then expected which is always a plus.</li>

      <li>I highly recommed this to anyone that needs full sun coverage because it works great.</li>

      <li>Blends in so easily.</li>
      <li>It feels light and not greasy when you put it on.  </li>
      <li>and it seems to help the skin as well as provide its primary purpose as a sun block.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my sixties, and I use Retin-A, so it&#x27;s extremely important that I protect my face and neck from the sun.</li>
      <li>and so far all has been good.</li>
      <li>After reading reviews about this being good with sensitive, acne prone skin, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is good for sensitive skin and never greasy.  </li>
      <li>powerfully sunny days year-round!  </li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen for the following reasons: doesn&#x27;t leave your face white, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it goes under your makeup beautifully!</li>
      <li>I have adult acne and needed a light but effective sunscreen, this is it.</li>
      <li>Back to Olay products for this 30 something, fair, oily and reactive skinned girl.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is better that the Murad vitamin C sunscreen I used to use that cost 3X as much.</li>
      <li>Granted, my skin is fairly oily and I live in a humid climate, but I&#x27;d hoped it would not contribute to oiliness even if it didn&#x27;t really help it.</li>
      <li>This leaves my face a bit shinier than I&#x27;d like, but it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>I am now a loyal customer</li>
      <li>A great smelling and comfortable sunscreen, I use it going out, at the beach, and any other outdoor venue !!!</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to most sunscreens and this one does not cause me to break out and protects me from the sun.  </li>
      <li>Nice and moisturizing but too greasy for my face, so I use it on my neck only.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly absorbed and, while it does not leave the face feeling too - too greasy,</li>
      <li>I love the protection which is vital in Arizona.</li>
      <li>It keeps my foundation looking fresh</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that reacts negatively to many cosmetics but not to this product.</li>
      <li>The product does not leave a white cast, it absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
      <li>It is a powerful sunscreen and can have a white-cast look to it at first but absorbs in pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>You do have to rub it in a little more than most sunscreens, but it does so well at protecting against the sun.    </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the one sunscreen I&#x27;ve been able to use religiously without side effects like clogged pores.</li>
      <li>This product contains many undesirable chemicals such as parabens, octinoxate, and retinyl palmitate.  </li>
      <li>sunscreen is effective, but very heavy and ere are other better options, lighter weight and with better formulas.</li>
      <li>Would certainly purchase it again, although this tube will last me for probably 6 months or more.</li>
      <li>Will certainly buy again.</li>
      <li>Wish they would reformulate and eliminate these chemicals and, if so, would certainly purchase again.</li>
      <li>I live in hot, humid San Antonio, TX...</li>
      <li>This appeared to be everything I was searching for...physical sunscreen (sensitive skin), antioxidants (particularly Vitamin c, which has an excellent reputation for aiding in sun protection and anti-aging), and no obviously pore clogging or irritating ingredients.</li>
      <li>all day.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Does a good job at protecting from the sun, but is a cream, not a lotion, very thick.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great, yes it goes on white, but if you just rub it in a little the white cast goes away.</li>
      <li>it took a couple of days for my skin to return to normal.</li>
      <li>Love it for everyday use and serves well as primer for makeup.</li>
      <li>Not only does it give me fantastic spf coverage, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with white residue like any other zinc oxide products, Fir more mature skin, it leaves your face feeling like you have moisturizer on without the greasy feel.  </li>
      <li>I live in the South</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive and did not have a reaction at all to the lotion.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, I bet this will work for you!</li>
      <li>Just a little bit spreads easily over the face and neck, and you gently rub for about 20 seconds to make it turn from white to clear and soak in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves the face with a white coating, certainly with a greasy look and feel, even clumps up as if looking like your skin is peeling.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need that much on your face, so it&#x27;s been lasting me a while.  </li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and combination.</li>
      <li>My face is completely un-tanned, just the way I like it.</li>
      <li>tube really does seem to last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and it has not irritated it.</li>
      <li>It seemed thicker and whiter than other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used (because it contains zinc oxide), but after I applied it and let it dry for several moments, it gave my skin a nice glow and also served as a great base for applying face powder (seemed to stabilize the powder).</li>
      <li>Product comes out like toothpaste but spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t feel thick after you put it on</li>
      <li>It goes on white and changes to clear in no time.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several broad spectrum products that contain zinc oxide all of them rubbed off on any surface I happened to brush up against.  </li>
      <li>I have large pores and this sunscreen seems to be too heavy for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great for the face.  It&#x27;s mostly absorbed and, while it does not leave the face feeling too - too greasy, beware that it does leave it shiny.  I usually dust my face with powder after applying, but then there&#x27;s no oily feeling or greasiness.  The best part is that there is no sunblock odor!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, yes it goes on white, but if you just rub it in a little the white cast goes away. The price was excellent too for this type of product.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about purchasing another sunscreen product but this one has not is appointed me.  It goes on white and changes to clear in no time.  I usually burn really bad but this has saved my face and chest.</li>
    <li> This leaves my face a bit shinier than I&#x27;d like, but it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> On the advise of my dermatologist I purchased this sunscreen. I love it, the difference in this is that it is micronized zinc oxide! Great delivery system for aging skin! Also, Citrix Antioxidant Sunscreen SPF 40 has green tea in it to calm skin down!</li>
    <li> Remember the life guards who had white cream on their noses? That was zinc oxide which is the most effective sunscreen made. Cirtix has micronized zinc oxide that disappears into your skin and protects you from harmful rays all day long. I use Citrix every day; rain or shine. Don&#x27;t forget to apply Citrix to the tops of your ears. It is the most prevalent place for skin cancer.</li>
    <li> Used a single tube for a 3 week vacation for face and arms. Still using same tube for fishing trips last few weeks too. Worked wonderfully, non greasy feeling. You do have to rub it in a little more than most sunscreens, but it does so well at protecting against the sun.    Will certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> Fast service as well as great prices!</li>
    <li> Needed a sunscreen with antioxidants not for my face  Product comes out like toothpaste but spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t feel thick after you put it on</li>
    <li> I have large pores and this sunscreen seems to be too heavy for me. I always get a clogged pore after using it.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t leave white halo. Love it for everyday use and serves well as primer for makeup. My skin is sensitive and it has not irritated it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my sixties, and I use Retin-A, so it&#x27;s extremely important that I protect my face and neck from the sun. I live in the South and I&#x27;m an outdoorsy type, so zinc oxide is the only way to go. I found this product recommended on a dermatologist&#x27;s website, so I tried it. I love it. Just a little bit spreads easily over the face and neck, and you gently rub for about 20 seconds to make it turn from white to clear and soak in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is moisturizing and thick enough that I use no other product in the daytime. No moisturizer, no makeup. I love the way it evens out my somewhat blotchy pinkish skin to a more even, whiter, tone. But not matte white -- the zinc oxide soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it every day, all day. My face is completely un-tanned, just the way I like it. I use another, cheaper, zinc oxide product on my body.</li>
    <li> I have tried several broad spectrum products that contain zinc oxide all of them rubbed off on any surface I happened to brush up against.  As an avid cyclist I found them all completely useless.  This product is different.  It rubs in such that it doesn&#x27;t rub off and while I haven&#x27;t tested it on a long ride yet it seems to provide excellent protection!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and combination skin (oily t-zone and dry-to-normal on the cheeks), and this is a great sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t add oil to any of my oily skin areas and doesn&#x27;t dry out the drier areas of my face.  It is a powerful sunscreen and can have a white-cast look to it at first but absorbs in pretty quickly.  You don&#x27;t need that much on your face, so it&#x27;s been lasting me a while.  I live in hot, humid San Antonio, TX...powerfully sunny days year-round!  I&#x27;ve worn it working out, to work, on lazier weekends in the sun, etc.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so expensive, but the 3.5-oz. tube really does seem to last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a less expensive Blue Lizard sunscreen on the market that I may try to compare when this tube is finished.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I am very sensitive and did not have a reaction at all to the lotion.  :)</li>
    <li> Blends in so easily. Feels good on skin. Not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> Love Citrix sunscreen.  I am very sensitive to most sunscreens and this one does not cause me to break out and protects me from the sun.  It has very low odor if any at all and does not feel too heavy on the skin.  If you have sensitive skin, I bet this will work for you!</li>
    <li> A great smelling and comfortable sunscreen, I use it going out, at the beach, and any other outdoor venue !!!</li>
    <li> I have used Citrix for over ten years.  It is good for sensitive skin and never greasy.  The zinc in it is a plus.  Diane Singer</li>
    <li> does not work well. Product separates in tube and I still burned!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very good deal for the size.  Does not make my combo skin greasy.  Smell is good and like the additional Vit C.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency to break out easily, but this lotion has not made me break out at all. I bought it to help prevent wrinkles (I am 20) and I love it. I protects against both UVA and UVB rays (the burning,  and bronzing rays of natural and artificial sunlight).  I actually put it on on-top of my regular facial lotion, and it still is not greasy at all. It keeps my foundation looking fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It helped me and it wasn&#x27;t oily at all, which was a very good thing because I have oily skin</li>
    <li> This product contains many undesirable chemicals such as parabens, octinoxate, and retinyl palmitate.  Wish they would reformulate and eliminate these chemicals and, if so, would certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> After having a TCA chemical peel, my Dermatologist recommended Citrix sunscreen.  That was over ten years ago and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Great product, feels light, not greasy and easy to apply. I have sensitive skin that reacts negatively to many cosmetics but not to this product. I have been using it daily for about two weeks and so far all has been good.</li>
    <li> I think this product is wonderful.  Not only does it give me fantastic spf coverage, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with white residue like any other zinc oxide products, Fir more mature skin, it leaves your face feeling like you have moisturizer on without the greasy feel.  I highly recommed this to anyone that needs full sun coverage because it works great.</li>
    <li> I love the protection which is vital in Arizona.</li>
    <li> Works well.  a little slow to absorb.</li>
    <li> Nice nice nice , what more can I say . Product is a bit spendy but performs well. It would be nice if they would make 50spf.</li>
    <li> My face broke out really bad with this stuff.  It is supposed to be non-greasy, but my face was so oily or waxy after use it took a couple of days for my skin to return to normal.</li>
    <li> This is my third tube. I use this for every day and when I exercise. It seems thick but is actually very lightweight and I can put on a little and it spreads well. I know this stuff is more expensive but it&#x27;s the one sunscreen I&#x27;ve been able to use religiously without side effects like clogged pores. My skin is sensitive and combination.</li>
    <li> I returned this. Its a greasy thick white paste totally unusable unless you are a life guard or dont mind this look.</li>
    <li> It seemed thicker and whiter than other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used (because it contains zinc oxide), but after I applied it and let it dry for several moments, it gave my skin a nice glow and also served as a great base for applying face powder (seemed to stabilize the powder). I&#x27;d bought it because dermatologist Cynthia Bailey recommended it and so far I&#x27;m happy with it. In addition to this I&#x27;m using Tretnoin at night (proven to turn back the clock on wrinkles, smoothing the skin and get rid of acne which I have), which I got a prescription for.</li>
    <li> I am so breakout prone at age 44 that I am fearful to ever try a new product. After reading reviews about this being good with sensitive, acne prone skin, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased. I just ordered my second bottle. I use it on my face, neck, chest and back of hands. It soaks in nicely, leaves my skin non greasy yet radiant. It also somehow helps it look flawless. I am now a loyal customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better that the Murad vitamin C sunscreen I used to use that cost 3X as much.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for the following reasons: doesn&#x27;t leave your face white, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it goes under your makeup beautifully! And let&#x27;s not forget that it contains the  ingredients that keeps us from the harmful effects of the sun!!</li>
    <li> Works very well and feels good on the skin.  Very good brand. I purchased because someone recommend it to me.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and excellent protection. A bit on the pricey side.</li>
    <li> This appeared to be everything I was searching for...physical sunscreen (sensitive skin), antioxidants (particularly Vitamin c, which has an excellent reputation for aiding in sun protection and anti-aging), and no obviously pore clogging or irritating ingredients. However, it is quite thick and within minutes, it turned my face into an oil slick. Granted, my skin is fairly oily and I live in a humid climate, but I&#x27;d hoped it would not contribute to oiliness even if it didn&#x27;t really help it. Back to Olay products for this 30 something, fair, oily and reactive skinned girl.</li>
    <li> I use this under my makeup every day.  Very light, feels like a moisturizer. Great sunscreen also. Would certainly purchase it again, although this tube will last me for probably 6 months or more.</li>
    <li> Touts itself to be an antioxidant sunscreen, but the only 2 \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients listed are the usual sunscreen things. How it&#x27;s supposed to be antioxidant is beyond me. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love thus stuff!  Use it daily and it seems to help the skin as well as provide its primary purpose as a sun block. Expensive though.</li>
    <li> This product is great for people that experience acne breakouts. I have adult acne and needed a light but effective sunscreen, this is it. The product does not leave a white cast, it absorbs nicely into the skin. Very nice product. I would recommend this product. The shipping was awesome, product arrived sooner then expected which is always a plus. I will also buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Does a good job at protecting from the sun, but is a cream, not a lotion, very thick. Leaves the face with a white coating, certainly with a greasy look and feel, even clumps up as if looking like your skin is peeling.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for face.&lt;br /&gt;These other reviews are way too kind.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is effective, but very heavy and ere are other better options, lighter weight and with better formulas. The green tea and vitamin c in it have no effect after using for months.</li>
    <li> Nice and moisturizing but too greasy for my face, so I use it on my neck only. and the and</li>
    <li> Great product! Non greasy and doesn&#x27;t break your face out. Went to the beach for a week and no burns. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It feels light and not greasy when you put it on.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Rated three because my issues are probably due to me. Bought this because I have been breaking out in small bumps when in the summer sun, and I wanted a product that didn&#x27;t include unnecessary chemicals that may actually cause the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent two days in sun with no sunscreen or sunblock- no bumps at all but a little red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied this product to hands, arms, and face. Stepped out in the sun and within 10 minutes the bumps began to appear on my skin. Washed it off my hands and opted for SPF gloves. No more bumps, no more redness.</li>
    <li> I love it. I can wear it under makeup.</li>
