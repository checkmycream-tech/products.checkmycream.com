<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I find buying these kind of products very hard.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about this one when I ordered it, but am so glad I did.  The product description fits perfectly.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you use bareMinerals foundation, this primer is the best.  It goes on slick but not sticky.  Your makeup lasts all day!  Nice product and much better than their original formulation years back.</li>
    <li> I am new to primers, and I read reviews and decide to get this one. I am satisfied. My mineral makeup goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product two years.  It makes foundation so easy to apply.</li>
    <li> If you wear mineral make up this stuff is your friend if you are going to be out at night The gel helps fill your fine lines before adding the mineral powder preventing any collection of powder in deep lines. I only use it at night since it is so bright in the daytime to require so much make up.</li>
    <li> This is an all time favorite of mine to wear under bare minerals make-up!  Makes your skin feel silky and smooth!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this primer for the B.E. powder foundation (which is also awesome). It goes on silky smooth and dries instantly. The 1 oz bottle may seem small, but it only takes 1 pump rubbed between hands for the whole face, and a bottle lasts me 4-5 months. Seriously, less is more when applying it.</li>
    <li> A tiny bead of this product smooths over the face and creates a soft matt feel. Of course, it is designed to go under make up, and is great for that, but it is great on those no make up days too. In fact, when I feeling generous, I share a bead with my husband.</li>
    <li> This products flakes on your skin. It looks as if you have dried milk on your face. I don&#x27;t recommend anyone wasting money on this product.</li>
    <li> I miss this product when I am out of it.  It makes a nice smooth base for your mineral foundation.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but I make sure to use it if I am going to have a long day with no opportunity to freshen my makeup.  Prime Time delays \\&quot;shiny nose syndrome\\&quot; so your makeup looks better longer.</li>
    <li> This product will make your skin feel like it never has before. Makeup stays put and you only need a tiny bit to feel great! I love it and will never be without it.</li>
    <li> You only need a small bead to cover your whole face, and it is so smooth too!  Unlike other primers that feel really greasy and heavy, this was light and made my skin extremely soft.    I use this with every kind of foundation; loose powder (which is what I usually use), liquid, even the really thick foundations and they have all stayed.  I also put this on even if I&#x27;m just wearing blush or a bronzer, it seems to light up my face but at the same time there&#x27;s no reflective shine.    If I wear foundation without this, it usually rubs off pretty easily on my clothes and sits in the lines of my face.  The Prime Time Foundation creates a virtually smooth surface to work with.  Even on sweaty areas of my face like my forehead and nose, it keeps my foundation looking fresh all day!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, I always get compliments on my skin when I use it.  Delivery was fast, packing appropriate. I would by from this company again.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 6 years.  It&#x27;s a great foundation for the mineral make up I use.  It makes your skin nice and soft with no residue.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once, but it left my face feeling soft and gave my face a healthy glow all day.</li>
    <li> I love this so much! It makes my make up last all day! Goes flawless in the skin &amp; makes your make up seem brighter &amp; perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about three weeks now , I love it! my skin is soft, feeling healthy and no more break outs! It also has acted as a toner and it just feels good to wake up and put in the morning!  I love it</li>
    <li> I would recommend Prime Time for use under make-up or without make-up. It is an outstanding product.  It leaves your face feeling and looking flawless after make-up is  applied. Without make-up and only a little mascara I can get a similar effect when I&#x27;m in a hurry on weekends.  I have been using Prime Time for five years and hope to continue.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, It makes my skin feel so good and I know it&#x27;s good for my skin, Also a big PLUS is that my skin does not itch after applying my Bare Minerals makeup.</li>
    <li> Keeps makeup in place all day, so it works very well.  Evens out my skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate it.  Works very well with Bare Minerals makeup, and I also like to use the PrimeTime eyelid primer, which keeps my eyeshadow in place all day.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for this one.</li>
    <li> I have really flaky skin that gets worse with make up. I exfoliate and cleanse, and apply this, It does feel smooth but I broke out after I used it, it has alot of un natural ingredients which i do not like, but it seemed to keep my makeup looking fresh</li>
    <li> This primer is really not worth the money. It made the product go on cakey for me, and broke my skin out. I just stick with my Clinique moisturizer, and that seems to work a lot better. I only used this twice, and threw it away. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This primer is great, goes on very smooth, keeps your make-up looking fresh all day and well into the evening.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Escentuals and use many of their products but this one did not work for me.  I have oily skin though I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and this exacerbated my break outs.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for others with similar demographics.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my B.E. foundation stay on longer/better....my skin tends to be more dry in the winter months.  This was a big disappointment.  I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference at all.</li>
    <li> This is a FANTASTIC product! I have combination skin, and love my bare minerals, but it never really stayed on throughout the day until they came out with this product! I&#x27;ve never seen this product for less than $21.00 (regular retail value) so it&#x27;s a steal here. The sellers are great, it got to me quickly and without any problems :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It helps smooth out my skin before i apply my foundation. My skin is oily and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help with that, I even only use a pea sized amount, but it does help my make up look smooth throughout the day. I recommend this for a smoother makeup application...don&#x27;t use too much tho :)</li>
    <li> I have dark circles under my eyes so I need to use concealer.  When using concealer, the delicate under-eye skin can be tugged and stretched causing wrinkles.  To fix this problem, I use Prime Time for under eye prep before I put on the concealer.  Prime Time glides onto my skin and allows the concealer to do the same.  No more tugging at the skin, which means less chance of wrinkles.  I use just a small amount each time so this bottle lasts a long time and is a good value.  I have very sensitive skin and have had no problem at all with itching, redness or irritation with this product.  This is one of my \\&quot;must haves\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> goes on so smooth and makes your mineral powder so that you dont look older</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR NORMAL SKIN. I USE IT WITH A MINERALS FOUNDATION THAT A PURCHASE FROM SALLY BEAUTY AND IT KEEPS THE FOUNDATION DEWY ALL DAY. I HAVE PURCHASED THE BARE ESCENTUALS PRIME TIME FOR OILY SKIN IN THE PAST, BUT I DID NOT LIKE THE FEEL OF IT ON MY COMBO SKIN. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR VERY SENSITIVE SKIN, BUT FOR OTHERS ITS A \\&quot;MUST\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> BareMinerals PrimeTime is the best ever! Don&#x27;t be tempted to use too much...no need to. Less is more with BareMinerals products. Primetime over my moisturizer is like silk and stays that way ALL DAY as does their other makeup for your face. I&#x27;m sold on EVERYTHING they make and the cost is so much less than so many other products. I&#x27;ve found what I want with BareMinerals/Escentuals and am completely sold. Don&#x27;t be surprised if people compliment you on your makeup because you won&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing much at all and you aren&#x27;t. The products stay on fresh all day long and breath. They are great.</li>
    <li> I think people are giving it good reviews because it does make your face very soft when applied. But, people don&#x27;t go around touching my face. I wanted it to make my foundation last longer and it did not. I tried it 3 different times on half of my face. There was no difference in the 2 sides. I even looked for a difference in texture and lines on the face. Nothing. Absolutely no difference at all as far as extending the life of foundation. Like I said it does make your face feel soft.</li>
    <li> Came just as promised. Cheaper than purchasing at Sephora! This product is awesome. Makes your face feel like \\&quot;silk\\&quot;. I tend to have problem skin, and with this I do not experience any of those \\&quot;problems\\&quot;, actually I think that it helps my skin!Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product arrived in good condition on time.</li>
    <li> This is the best primer ever. I love this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy to me and it goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin look as feel great! When I don&#x27;t wear makeup I still wear this primer.</li>
    <li> I use this over the Bare Vitamins and before my Bare Minerals make-up.  My mineral make-up goes on easily and never looks too dry.  This feels like silk - wonderful!  This may seem a little pricey, but a pea-size amount takes care of my entire face.</li>
    <li> I am wondering how a company called \\&quot;Bare Minerals\\&quot; can put out a product that is made with so many chemicals. It&#x27;s no wonder this product has produced so many negative effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> The first time I got this, I wasn&#x27;t really sure if it was doing anything. But once I stopped using it, I noticed that it was. I put on makeup at 6:30 in the morning, and that&#x27;s it. If I&#x27;m going out at night, I touch it up, but I never have to during the day. When I wasn&#x27;t using this, I&#x27;d have to carry my makeup around and reapply throughout the day while I was at work. I&#x27;ve used it with Bare Minerals makeup, department store makeup, and Cover Girl from Walmart. It works great with all of them.</li>
    <li> Why? why I didn&#x27;t come across this product before? I have large pores, scars from acne, and on top of being only, my skin is also peeling at times (go figure..). It instantly and effectively resolves all those problems. One pump is all I need for the whole day. Feels oily at time of application, but this feeling goes away very quickly. Makeup goes on so much better. It is now absolutely essential item in my make up bag.</li>
    <li> If you wear Bare Escentuals makeup, you MUST use primer. My makeup stays put morning till night!</li>
    <li> I love this primer.  I have red undertones and this seems to calm them down before foundation.  Helps make up stay on all day.</li>
    <li> I personally really like this product.  It helps my makeup go on smoother, but it&#x27;s not necessary in order for my makeup to look good.</li>
    <li> I never understood what primer really did until I got this primer. Great cost and it keeps my makeup on all day. I&#x27;ve got really oily skin so this was great.</li>
    <li> I have very porous skin and I always hear the experts say prime, prime, prime for a flawless finish.  I chose this brand because I have use the mineral powders before and because I have sensitive problematic skin. I thought it was safer to go with a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really does not do what it claims other than the fact that the product by itself feels very silky when touched.  But once it&#x27;s applied, I don&#x27;t like how it feels on my face. I feel the layer.  And I agree with a prvious reviewer, that you need MORE to cover the face because this stuff does not spread well at all. And the worse thing about it is that it rubs off when I apply my foundation over it, like you know how some under eye creams rolls right off?  This dries too quicky and has a thickness about it.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS.</li>
    <li> This product is like a miracle in a little white bottle! This is the only primer I&#x27;ve ever used that keeps make up on all day and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use moisturizer first, wait about five minutes then apply Prime Time. I almost always use BE make up, but I&#x27;ve used Prime Time with other foundations and had the same results.  It is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This leaves a super smooth appearance, love it!</li>
    <li> I thought I needed a primer for my foundation, so I bought this one. It&#x27;s extremely awesome!. You only need a little bit and spread it around the face. It actually covers all you little lines. I apply my foundation on top of it and love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now and continue to find it more than satisfactory.  My makeup goes on more smoothly and feels fresh throughout the day.  I hope Bare Escentuals never discontinues Prime Time nor makes any changes to the formula.  It is perfect as it is![[ASIN:B0017U10SI Bare Escentuals Irritant-Free Prime Time Foundation Primer -- 1 fl oz]]</li>
    <li> I love the Bare Escentials line of make up and this primer is no exception. It feels so good on my skin and smooths it out beautifully for the mineral powder to glide on. It does not feel a bit greasy or oily nor does it make my skin break out. I believe this product would work just as well under different types of foundation not just the mineral make up. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Goes on clean and take a little while to dry.  Don&#x27;t see any noticeable difference in my makeup application from using this.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a primer from another skin care company which costs $36.00.  It was great.  However, I wasn&#x27;t willing to continue to pay that much for one.  I always use the Bare Escentuals makeup and thought I would try their primer.  It is absolutely wonderful.  It goes on so smoothly, feels like silk and gives my skin a great palette for the foundation powder, etc, which really makes a difference for me since I am over 60 years old. I have had complements regarding my looks since I&#x27;ve started using it and I think it is a factor in conveying the smooth, younger look. Some may complain about the price but you really only need a little bit and, honestly, it&#x27;s worth every penny. I am so glad that I looked around and found this one.  And the price through Amazon is definitely worth it, especially since it saves me a trip to the (not-so) local mall!</li>
    <li> I didnt know what primers did until a girl at Shoppers showed me. It creates a smooth canvas for my makeup application (i have rough dry patches on my cheeks). Without it my foundation would cake up so it&#x27;s a must for me and my BM matte foundation :) would definitely recommend (but make SURE you leave it on for at least a minute for it to \\&quot;set\\&quot;).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with the Bare Minerals Makeup and I like how it feels after it is applied to my face.  I put this on after I put lotion on.  You only need a small little squirt.</li>
    <li> i really like this stuff. i only need a pea sized amount, and it makes my whole face very smooth. even the tips of my fingers haha. it helps keep my bm makeup on throughout the day. its the only primer i&#x27;ve tried so i can&#x27;t really compare it, but its nice. it isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts to my acne prone skin either. its great.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Smooths out the skin for a perfect makeup application.  Can be used with powder or liquid foundations. Love it.</li>
    <li> Feels like rubbing your face with satin. Not greasy or oily. Clear color, moderately priced, not cheap but not too expensive.</li>
    <li> This primer goes on smooth and soft.  It makes the powder foundation stay on all day.  This is a must for your cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I was a bit skeptical before using it because my skin tends to breakout easily, but after a month of using it, I have had no breakouts. It feels oily when you touch it with your fingers, but when you apply it to your face it is not oily at all and you dont even feel like your putting anything on. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it really makes the skin smooth and sheer and ready for foundation. A little goes a long way and it spreads so nicely and evenly. The product arrived before scheduled date and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great. Put on your moisturizer &amp; let dry, then put on the primer &amp; let dry and then finish with bare mineral makeup &amp; mineral veil to make your face look amazing. If you don&#x27;t want to wear any makeup then just put the primer on after moistuizer and your skin still looks great.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily - a clear silky gel, bottle lasts a long time, leaves no residue; feels natural. The make up looks more flawless, applies smoothly, stays evenly applied all day. Love the product, good value.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and the vendor was amazing!  I received the product within a few days (3 or 4) through regular mail, which means that they must of put it in the mail right away!  I would use them again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m recently trying out makeup for my blog and this was my first one since I had heard great things about it. And for someone that has never used primer before and for someone with acne prone skin, this is not a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought Revlon Photo Ready Primer and the consistency and quality of that primer is so much better but still isn&#x27;t really good for acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would think that Bare Minerals is better for the skin since they claim being more of an organic line and lighter for the skin but even so, I just really think that primer is not a good idea for acne prone skin overall no matter what primer it is. I shall continue looking! Very soon you can watch my results on my blog [...]</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t bought this product sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the primer on a couple minutes before I put on my Bare Escentuals foundation. One pump does wonders. I do recommend that you put the product on with 1 finger though as your fingers will soak up the product. My foundation goes on smooth and evenly now and looks good for longer. I have worn this all day, work day into night, and I don&#x27;t have the creasing (under eyes, crows feet, etc) like I used to. This is a must have product if you use Bare Escentuals foundation.</li>
    <li> Admittedly I don&#x27;t like the price, but in the long run it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  Since this is my 2nd bottle, I will be more careful to use less than I did in the beginning.  It takes VERY LITTLE.  I have very dry skin and am over 50.  This products helps the make up (Bare Minerals) go on smoother so I use less of that as well.  Also makes my skin very soft.  thank you  MEF</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My wifes uses this product and is very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I have tried some very expensive brands, in hopes of finding a great primer. I have oily skin, large pores, and live in Miami. My skin is not sensitive but some were so bad it actually clogged my pores and made me break out. I am so happy to have found this product and have been using it faithfully for 3 years. It helps hide your pores, control oil, and give you a smooth base so your make up lasts longer. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used lots primers but there are only a couple I like and this is one of them. Goes on very smooth and invisible.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  After I put it on my face, I run my fingers through my long hair.  This helps get it off my hands and smooths my hair leaving it feel silky.</li>
    <li> Very confident with these items.</li>
    <li> I had never used foundation primer before and let me say I LOVE this one.  It makes my face look so much better after applying foundation and it last all day.  I will definately buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in a salon after having a makeover... After using it twice at home it was as lost cause. I followed all the instructions but It becomes clumpy and will not come out of the pump dispenser.  it&#x27;s a horrible waste of money when most moisturizers will do the same job as this pruducts intent. It&#x27;s a primer. That means it prepares your skin for the top layer. Use your own Moisturizer! Don&#x27;t pay for overpriced labels when you already have it in your beauty supply.  This product is a waste of money</li>
    <li> This is a great product. As for this specific item, NOTE this is a SMALL size. You can get the bigger bottle (2.5 oz?) for almost the same price. As always with amazon products, remember to check the size. I was surprised at how small it was when it came.</li>
    <li> I have very, very sensitive skin and I have loved using this product for years. It&#x27;s one of the few health and beauty products that doesn&#x27;t contain any of my allergens. I can even wear it to my allergist&#x27;s fragrance-free medical facility.</li>
    <li> I love this primer. A little goes a long way, and it works really well on dry skin. I use mineral foundation, but I won&#x27;t without this primer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for myself after running out of the primer I purchased last year. This works well and dries quickly to save time getting ready. It lasts a long time for such a small bottle almost 7 months from last purchase goes on smooth and I have yet to have a reaction or any irritation from it at all which has happened with other primers in the past.</li>
    <li> Really like how it fills in and smooths out pores. Helps the makeup go on smoother. Really good at controlling oil through the day as well.</li>
    <li> Gives my face a nice smooth feel and holds foundation on well, but I wish it had a sun screen in it.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. It works well.</li>
    <li> The old saying &amp;#34;If the barn door needs painting, paint it.&amp;#34; Unfortunately, as we age the face (barn door) also needs primer. This one does the trick.</li>
    <li> Bottle was half empty and the pump stopped working almost immediately which made it difficult to get anything out. I think it is probably a good product but due to the half full bottle and pump malfunctioning, its hard to determine if the price and the product were worth the purchase</li>
    <li> This is the best primer I&#x27;ve tried so far .... and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried ALL of them! A little goes a long way and you&#x27;re ready to put on your foundation in seconds instead of waiting for it to dry in minutes like most primers out there. My pores are less visible and my skin tone balanced. In my opinion it&#x27;s too expensive and I wish they would reduce the price; however, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it because it really works.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but on the pricy side</li>
    <li> my make up stayed on longer. this is the first primer that i had tried. i was happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve started using it years ago! Love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it can even be used for other foundations or by itself. i recommend it thanks</li>
    <li> It works ad described and helps smooth the skin so your bare minerals makeup can be applied evenly.</li>
    <li> Like all BE items, I just love but it&#x27;s too pricey for my liking. I use the Hard Candy primer which is similar and definitely more economical in both size and price.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to try this product. bareMinerals has an amazing product line and the company prides itself on using natural ingredients, which I love and look forward to in their product line. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction to this product. I developed itchy hives and a rash all over my face and neck. If this product were made using natural ingredients, I would not have had this type of reaction. I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient caused it but I suspect the cyclopentasiloxane was the troublesome ingredient. Cyclopentasiloxane is a silicone used in many beauty products and it acts as a lubricant, shine agent and provides a waterproof barrier in other products. My concern in that the company used a thicker form of the cyclopentasiloxane in this product making it heavy and sticky. If you have very sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll want to steer clear of this one. On a more positive note, Bare Minerals issued a refund immediately and they were very sincere during the process. I will continue to shop the bareMinerals product line but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> I like it...I don&#x27;t know how good it is for my skin....</li>
    <li> Much easier to use than the tube dispenser.</li>
    <li> The best primer! Makes your skin feel smooth, soft and velvety transforming your face into the perfect makeup canvas. Keeps makeup fresh and in place for hours without having to reapply. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love that it takes only a small amount to do the job, and it does make the foundation &amp;#34;cling&amp;#34; much better.  It feels good on your face and it is the best for a primer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this primer with high hopes becasue I use BareMinerals powder every day (and love it). I used one pump and applied all over my face. Within an hour I had broken out with every single pore clogged. I have bad skin, but nothing has ever caused my entire face to breakout until I tried this. I did purchase this at Ulta and was able to return for a full refund. I talked to a many employees there at various times and a couple had the same issue I had and the others just did not like it.</li>
    <li> I use this as my foundation after the moisturizing cream.  My skin becomes very soft and smooth. Very, Very, Pleased</li>
    <li> I have used and loved this product for a long time - it really does help you makeup stay on and look better longer during the day. They have changed the size - it is now only 1 oz when I used to pay about $3 more for a bottle twice the size. I checked at other places and none offered the larger size that I could find.</li>
    <li> I was having a &amp;#34;Prime Time&amp;#34; withdraw when I ran out. I have tried other primers and I did not like it at all. I will stick with it.</li>
    <li> I have heard horror stories of ordering makeup online but I ordered this and it was exactly what I had been using from the store, just slightly cheaper. Overall good buy and is meant to work well with the bare minerals foundation (in case that wasn&#x27;t obvious).</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for a long time. It goes on smooth and silky, and I notice a smoother finish with my makeup. Sure it&#x27;s pricey, but look at any brand name primer and you&#x27;ll pay the same price. You only need one squirt for your make-up, so it really lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Being total tomboy I got to say this is new to me even.I bought the sheercover and needed something to make my make not slide of during summer when is hot so,I got this at my local ulta and it was $20 and $3 of tax I should have checked here before.    so,far I like it I did ONE PUMP and amazing it covers my face and dries real fast if you use your drier on cool setting.I think would work with any brand makeup and so,far it has lasted thru heat and smiling alot.    being a mom I do NOT have time to adjust makeup and reapplying.  The onlly thing I do NOT LIKE it has no spf so,I have to add that later after I set it to dry take total of 5 mins for both without a drier.    so quick tip..want fast time than hit your drier on cool setting about 12 inches from face than run to your freezer to cool it down.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Makeup holds to it nicely.</li>
    <li> I would love to be writing a review of how good or bad this product is but due to the seller BEAUTYSTORE3 sending me an used item!  USED MAKE UP!!!!  in a bottle without any form of safety seal on bottle of box. They tried to say that all their items come this way. Now  after buying make up for my wife for years i can say i have NEVER SEEN MAKE UP COME WITHOUT A SAFETY SEAL OF SOME SORT!!!!  Do Not Buy Anything From Beauty Store 3!!!!!  You have Been WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for some time. We find that ordering from Amazon is so much easier than going to the Department stores as we are both over 80 and find fighting the traffic and crowds can be hard to take.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny!! I recieved it as a gift last year  with a Bare Minerals starter kit from my daughter. She borrowed some of mine  and loved it, so I bought it for her this year as a gift.     It does just what the product says it will do. It makes your face feel like  a living canvas</li>
    <li> Use this as your primer to keep your makeup in place.&lt;br /&gt;great product.  Smooths out the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Use it sparingly all over the face.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t decided if I really like this - it seems to make makeup glide on smoother, but I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in the final look of my skin.  It does feel good.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for about l year.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend it. My make up goes on so smoothly after&lt;br /&gt;applying this product</li>
    <li> This foundation cream became rather watery after I had used it for several weeks, different from that that I had bought in a retail store.  I wonder about its age and storage.</li>
    <li> When I don&#x27;t wear this, it&#x27;s noticeable (to me). My makeup fades and doesn&#x27;t look as clean. I have gotten so many compliments about how soft my skin looks, and it&#x27;s always when I remember to prime! Love this stuff! It lasts forever too, because you need only a LITTLE DAB. :)</li>
    <li> I use it everyday as a base. It goes on easy and quick and maintains a great hold for my make all day.</li>
    <li> I have used prime time for some time.&lt;br /&gt;Your foundation will stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;Bare minerals is a great line of cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;Michelle</li>
    <li> This is the go to primer for me.  I have tried others and find I like the feel and ease of using this one.</li>
    <li> Always has my face looking its best.</li>
    <li> Best Primer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Excellent foundation. Probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Like so many others, I received Prime Time with my first kit. I marveled at the feel of it as it seemed to dissapear as I was moving it across my face. Where I didn&#x27;t put any, my skin felt dry. With PT, my face felt like satin and my make-up spread smoothly across my face. I am 52 and I have no oil problems and have no real dryness problems either. However, I do use a facial cream under my makeup. Recently, I thought I&#x27;d spare the Prime Time and use my regular facial cream. Later in the day I noticed the cream laying WHITE in the creases under my eye. I was horrified that I had walked around all day with my (not Bare Essentials as powder IS too dry a look for my age) Este Lauder $70 per jar foundation separating from the cream. SO.....    I am on Amazon now to order more Prime Time because I don&#x27;t want to look creased again.    Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I use Bare Minerals Powder Foundation and I use this product before the foundation. It makes a HUGE difference with and without it.</li>
    <li> Made my skin incredibly oily, could feel how gross and slippery it made my skin all day. Could not even tell if it worked as a primer because i was so oily and shiney. Never had an oil problem before this. Used it once, never using it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> Great Service!  Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  Will order again from this company!</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product. Amazing Results ! I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure. Worth the try !</li>
    <li> I have used this make up primer for years now; it&#x27;s a must have before brushing on mineral makeup and helps give the face a smooth, clear, soft look.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin feeling super smooth....allows your foundation to just glide right on. Sometimes, after a shower, I will smooth this on my face and forego the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other primers but none go on quite as smoothly as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to all women, regardless of age.</li>
    <li> Love bare minerals.  This goes on so smoothly.  Makes your foundation look so much better. And even, and last longer.  This and the glo one are great.</li>
    <li> primer makes skin soft, but doesnt fill in wrinkles or help dry areas like I expected. Not sure if there is much of a differencethan just putting my MAC foundation on</li>
    <li> I recieved this only a few days after ordering.Impressive!I Used it under my bare minerals foundation ,then topped with tinted mineral veil.Smooth perfection!Without the primer, the other products are still great,however,I will not be without this now.It takes your skin to the next level. Love this product!! The combination of primer first, then foundation , then mineral veil It is  the best!Truly.I get lots of compliments on my complexion when I use these products!Go for it ladies!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel light after applying.  It works great under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this primer it goes on great and absorbs quickly. Your skin feels silly smooth after putting it on with no greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Using this for years.  Great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an issue with the last several bottles I&#x27;ve ordered of the primer - the oil and the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; are separating causing the oil to come out by itself leaving the paste of the primer - keeping the two mixed so the application is smooth and gives the flawless foundation that is so much a part of the bareMinerals experience is critical. I hope this is fixed or being addressed.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great product!</li>
    <li> Another amazing product by Bare Escentuals. I always put it on right before the base. My makeup goes on much better after using foundation primer. I recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It works great on my sensitive skin and makes my skin feel fantastic after application.</li>
    <li> Really does make foundation go on smoother</li>
    <li> This is one of my go to products, so when it ran out I just ordered more with a click of  a button. I love how smooth it feels when I apply it. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a primer for your face. I tried other Primes for the high end to the low end and this primer is still my favorite. It is a gel formal, goes on smooth and feels good on the skin. My make-up goes on so nicely when I where this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes it a lot</li>
    <li> I would never buy bare minerals from any other place than a bare minerals store. This stuff I ordered does not work at all like the prime I&#x27;ve purchased in bare minerals stores. This is much thinner and does not keep the make up matted. My face is oily by the end of the day. I truly believe I got a bad batch or it&#x27;s been manipulated. Prime is typically a thick gel and this is runny. I wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> As you get older your foundation, instead of covering flaws, accentuates them by seeping into your fine lines.  But not if you apply this first!</li>
    <li> This is the first moisturizer I have found that leaves my skin soft and smooth with no stickiness!  I am 76 years old so that is no mean feat!</li>
    <li> I use this under my eyes almost to hide fine lines from smiling all day, helps to fill in the creases. havent tried on the whole face yet since my faces tends to break out but I like it :)</li>
    <li> I like how Prime Time goes on so smoothly and makes my face ready to receive the barest amount of bare minerals makeup. I only need a small amount to do the job so this tiny bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I tried Korres primer because it was less money; but this is much better.  I have used it for&lt;br /&gt;years and recommend with Bare Minerals Makeup.  Has anyone found Mineral Liquid&lt;br /&gt;Makeup anywhere, thought it might be better than the powder????</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it really evens out your skin before you put on your foundation. I will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  Soft as silk, absorbs quickly, and gives a dewey finish to your skin...  Love, love, love!!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best primer I have ever used. I usually have to blot my face 1 to 2 times a day, but with this primer I don&#x27;t even have to blot once. This does a great job of keeping my makeup looking fresh all day long. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to hold up well because it made me feel slick and greasy... but don&#x27;t be deceived. I usually used the green NYX photoready blend, and this primer is comparable to that in staying power. (As to the question of performance under a camera lens, I couldn&#x27;t say.) I&#x27;m a professional wingwoman by trade, and it&#x27;s important for my makeup to stay in place. My job is based upon my appearance, and I trust this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a LOOOOONG way.</li>
    <li> Its a silicone primer use under any makeup for a air brushed look.  Better than all other primers I have tried.</li>
    <li> Works great once you can get it out of the bottle. The pump does not work properly. But it is the same product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this primer for several years and have been very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be more matte.  DHC Velvet Prime Cover works better for me. It covers pores on nose and much better on T zone. It was not as I had hoped for....</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer, NOT GOOD FOR OILY SKIN.  I bought this a few years back, still have it in back of cabinet, and it acts as glue even after dried on skin, it makes make-up look cakey.  YUK!  I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on this - I think I bought it directly from Bare Minerals, one of those places.  The only way my skin looks decent is to fluff on the mineral (Fairly Light Medium for me) and go! Recently I bought two liquids from Amazon, [[ASIN:B00JVVQSFA Bare Minerals BareSkin Pure Serum Foundation Broad Spectrum SPF 20 Bare Satin 06 1.0 oz]] works for me and the other one a darker (or orangier color) [[ASIN:B00JVW837A Bare Minerals BareSkin Pure Serum Foundation Broad Spectrum SPF 20 Bare Ivory 07 1.0 oz]] maybe later in the summer.  Ladies with oily skin, even in their 60s like moi, stay away!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I like the way it makes my skin feel land allows the BareMineral makeup to go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels when I put it on...it&#x27;s not too thick, so you don&#x27;t even feel it once it is on!  I tried a different king before this, but honestly price or not I will not get a primer anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I use it with the id bareminerals foundation and other products,&lt;br /&gt;it helps it smooth out old skin and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> The stuff is FANTASTIC!  it really does close your pores! Gives you that smooth silky sheen looking skin! it also feels good on your skin. Try it ! You will love it!</li>
    <li> B. E ROCKS!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using BE for years. I have tried everything on the market. I have sensitive skin and I have not had any breakouts. A bottle of this primer has lasted me two years, you only need to use a pea size. My makeup stays in place in the summer heat. My skin also looks flawless and healthy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product is rated so high, especially for the price. Worst product I ever used. It peels and flakes off. I had on the primer with foundation and it started peeling off around my mouth when I was making out with my boyfriend. I was horrified.</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals provides the best make-up available. It is good for the skin, minimizes pores, free of preservatives and looks silky shiny on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use the Prime Time, but after hearing so many people proclaim how good it was, I gave it a try. I purchase many of my make-up products from Amazon because of the free shipping and two day delivery, you cannot beat Prime Membership. That said, I wondered how good this product really was. First of all, it takes a very small pump to,provide enough coverage for your face and neck. It seemingly glides on, and it feels good. It does not take any time at all to dry. Applying the Bare Minerals foundation powder was a breeze, that also glides on, and it stays on. My skin looked terrific, less foundation is needed, no pores were visible, imperfections seemed to be non-existent. The foundation seemed as fresh after six hours as it did when applied. I am very pleased with this product, it far surpassed my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. prisrob 09-26-12</li>
    <li> I used to use this primer before my bareMinerals foundation/makeup routine. There&#x27;s no drying time, so I don&#x27;t have to wait five minutes to apply makeup. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily, it feels &#x27;clean&#x27;, and it does make my makeup go on and look smooth. But $21 for a 1oz bottle? I would use one pump a day and it would run out before my foundation. The price is my only complaint about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up hearing recommendations about [[ASIN:B0012ZNSWE Monistat SootTing Care CTafing Relief Powder-Gel, 1.5-Ounce Tube]] as a makeup primer, and recently tried that -- at $6 a tube it&#x27;s more affordable and works just as well as a makeup primer. I doubt I&#x27;ll go back to paying for Prime Time again... it&#x27;s financially not worth it for me.</li>
    <li> I was scared that the order was a scam from what my friends have told me, but I got the package fairly quickly and I have yet to use it. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> love love love this product and seller!!</li>
    <li> nothing beats this stuff.  use this under any foundation and it makes it better.  their brand powder foundation amazing too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I am very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Nice primer and does the job.  Not sure if I really need a primer because I don&#x27;t see that much difference in my skin when I use it and when I don&#x27;t so for me it seems like a waste.</li>
    <li> I am using my husbands account but let me say I live this primer! A little goes a long way and my face is so smoothe and silky. I use liquid foundation and it looks great when I apply it over this primer! I&#x27;ll be buying again!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, wouldn&#x27;t use my BM foundation without it.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes you face feel. I also use it on my hands so they will feel as soft as my face.</li>
    <li> This is a clear foundation with no color. It&#x27;s not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to make my skin soft and smooth and this is it!  Glad I tried it</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time under my mineral makeup. Love it. Feels great and works great. Wouldn&#x27;t  use anything else. Service from provider was great. Shipped fast and packing good. Recommend this product and provider  to others.</li>
    <li> My skin was radiant and glowing once I applied the primer.  My makeup went on with ease.  I received many compliments.</li>
    <li> Perfect, just as promised.  Received quickly too!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff for a long time until I figured out it wasn&#x27;t doing me much good.  I think it would work on a person with a different skin type better.  I have combo skin, and use moisturizer every day.  Using that plus this plus mineral veil plus foundation just ended up a cakey, oily mess on  me.  I like the idea of primer, and it worked fine on my cheeks.  However once I ran out I just went with moisturizer and foundation and that works better for me personally.</li>
    <li> The secret is to not use too much!  I think that it helps your foundation last longer and be smoother than without the primer.</li>
    <li> I will never try any other brand  I did and it was a big mistake  I LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND WON&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It&#x27;s my holy grail primer! Makeup goes on SO SMOOTHLY with it! There&#x27;s no cakeyness whatsoever if I apply this first as a base. It goes great over my Clinique Gel Moisturizer. This leaves my face feeling hydrated and fresh, unlike other primers (like Smashbox - I usually feel dry after using Smashbox Photo Primers). It doesn&#x27;t minimize my pores at all, unfortunately, but I use this in combination with Maybelline&#x27;s Pore Eraser Primer. The two pair together nicely and can be layered. A little of this product goes a long way, so I suspect that I will have this product for a long, long time. It was well worth the price. There&#x27;s no irritation and no zits caused by this product. I love it and can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> I love this product; it helps your foundation go on like satin, its like gold in bottle, I Just wish they had a larger size bottle to order from as I use this product practically every day</li>
    <li> I love bareminerals, period. I recommend Leslie&#x27;s products always.</li>
    <li> I use this before putting on my foundation, blush, and it just give my skin extra moisture , feels so good</li>
    <li> I knew I needed a primer because my foundation was not going on so great, and you could tell sometimes. This primer solved all my problems. I like how it&#x27;s so smooth and glides all over the face so easily. It&#x27;s not heavy at all. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Nice moisture for under makeup</li>
    <li> When I first used this product it seemed to work well.  But as the day went on my makeup started peeling off. Literally peeling. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I have been using prime time primer for several years now. No other primer will do for my bare minerals makeup. I tried a coloured creamy one but. It seperated and wouldn&#x27;t mix , so I returned to prime time. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. 1 squirt applied to face on nose, wrinkles, and areas with large pores or other minor texture imperfections leaves skin looking smooth and soft. Provides the perfect surface for my mineral poweers to glide on even and smooth. Flawless finish every time and nobody has a clue that this man is in makeup.</li>
    <li> Love it have used for years.....and I need to re-order,&lt;br /&gt;Can I do the order here?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Shirley M Knight</li>
    <li> Prime Time Foundation is a great way to start your makeup routing.  It helps the rest of the makeup go on smoothly and evenly.</li>
    <li> The only other primer I have used is the L&#x27;Oreal makeup secrets or whatever it is called, and it doesn&#x27;t even compare to this. This primer glides on like silk and when used under my bb cream, leaves my skin with a flawless, glowing finish. People comment on my complexion when I wear it! I have large pores and mild acne, but with this as my base, my skin looks beautiful. I am still using the small sample size that came with my bare minerals kit from almost a year ago. A little goes a very long way! HG for me!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$ paying full price! It&#x27;s EXACLTY like the Prime Time pruchase a the store but cheaper.  Time your orders properly before you run out and you will save a TON of moolah!!</li>
    <li> This could quite possibly be the best skin primer on the market and I have tried some very expensive and popular department store brands with disappointing results. It smooths on effortlessly. Last all day and night - until I wash it off, and truly makes the BB cream I apply after glow, and look natural and fresh - all day!</li>
    <li> Love at first touch.  This amazing product prepares your skin , hence primer, for other Bare Escentuals products.&lt;br /&gt;The effect is amazing.  Products just glide over a super smooth, super soft, radiant pallet (your face and neck). With the reasonable prices and sizes available through Amazon I have been able to share this product with most of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;The reaction is always the same, &amp;#34;this feels amazing, like silk&amp;#34;.  Dries quickly and leaves that ultra smooth finish. No shine or color at all in the product.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth giving this a try!!</li>
    <li> I have used prime time for about 3 years, makes your skin look flawless. Bare minerals are great , This was the first line of minerals ever used. Still use Bare Mineras</li>
    <li> I would not recommend.  It was manufactured in China not USA as all other Bare Minerals I have purchased in retail stores.</li>
    <li> As a 29 year old woman from Los Angeles, one might expect that I would have my skin care routine down pat. This product was an absolute game changer in every way!! I tend to run naturally very warm which leads to more sweating than the average person. I also like to have my makeup look perfect. This primer makes that possible. I am actually ordering my second bottle right now. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Foundation goes on flawless.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup primer. Goes on smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and a great price.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals Skin Revver Upper is a better primer.</li>
    <li> It did what it said it would do, works like any other primer, nothing too fantastic. I only wear it when I need a more formal looking finish, it&#x27;s a small container but it lasts pretty long.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is all it says it is. feels wonderful on skin and makeup goes on very smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I can&#x27;t be without it. Of all the beauty products I own this is the ONE essential. I use it before I put on my foundation and it makes the base glide evenly. Sometimes if my skin is very dry I will dab a bit over cover up or concealer to smooth out the skin. I have got a lot of compliments on how smooth my skin looks, so ladies IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> it helps keep my make up on all day  .does what I want it too</li>
    <li> I use Bare Escentuals a lot.  Tried this Prime Time and find it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump during the day.  Keeps makeup from gathering in my creases.  I&#x27;m a grandma.  I have creases.  This helps keep foundation smooth all day.</li>
    <li> So far, the best best for a finished look...I&#x27;m middle-aged and we all know what that means.  That&#x27;s years of trying stuff!!</li>
    <li> Worth the price!  It is the best primer I have used under my foundation.  Will purchase again and again and again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and absolutely love it.  It makes the facial skin feel super soft and smooth with no shiny or greasy feel.  I don&#x27;t use foundation at all, haven&#x27;t since I was younger.</li>
    <li> must have if you&#x27;d like your mineral make up last all day. creates a nice smooth surface on your face and your minerals glide on. this makes my &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; looks it&#x27;s best even on the warmest and muggiest days!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It is a great base for makeup, smooths out my face wonderfully and helps my Bare Minerals makeup last all day. The bottle is tiny, but it lasts a long time. One pump is perfectly sufficient (more than that makes my face look and feel kind of greasy.) I am prone to acne, but this does not make me break out like some other products do.</li>
    <li> Love it!! 5 stars *****</li>
    <li> Tried to use several times and every time I had a massive outbreak of pimples.  I would not buy again</li>
    <li> It helps make up go on smoother and lood more natural.  I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t make it oilier or break me out.</li>
    <li> Love this. I have been using it for over one year. It smooths the skin for the foundation to go on beautifully.</li>
    <li> Accidently bought from .overseas China/Japan. The product is not the original product and breaks out my fingers using it.</li>
    <li> Had I had bought this before I purchased E.L.F. Primer, I would have given it 5 stars all the way.  It goes on smooth and soft.  You almost want to stand there and touch your skin instead of moving on to your makeup.  It fact, I use it on days I don&#x27;t wear makeup, just so my skin feels light and airy.  When I do put my face on, imperfections are smoothed out so that foundation and/or powder goes on evenly.  I really do love the stuff.  However, it costs significantly more than E.L.F, and it seems to me to be the exact same thing.</li>
    <li> Pump does not work when product gets low in bottle and it costs too much to waste.</li>
    <li> It has a good texture and made a difference. I think the price is excelent too and would buy it again</li>
    <li> WIFE SAYS IT WORKS AS EXPECTED AND SHE RECOMMENDS IT--W.S.CARTER</li>
    <li> I received it. And it was leaking everywhere. I don&#x27;t feel like it doesn&#x27;t anything special. Maybe makes my makeup last longer. But ehh it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this product. It&#x27;s a bit greasy and I don&#x27;t find that it does what it claims.  It&#x27;s mediocre at best.</li>
    <li> I like this product and have used it for the past 3 years with my Bare Minerals powder. I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it as the primer. My only complaint is that when it gets about 2/3 empty, it&#x27;s hard to pump the primer out- you have to open it up and squeeze it out- and then as it gets lower, I have to add a little water to mix with it because it gets too lumpy to pump out. It&#x27;s hard to get out, but then it&#x27;s smooth going on your face. But it&#x27;s the best primer to go with my powder, so I still purchase it.</li>
    <li> fine. As expected and as stated in the information</li>
    <li> Absolutely love how smooth this leaves my skin feeling before I apply my bare minerals foundation. I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for 8 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A one ounce bottle lasts me for at least 9 months. You only need to apply a pea sized amount. I will never apply make up with out it.</li>
    <li> Glides on. Feels like silk. Makes my skin feel wonderful. Helps foundation go on smoothly and you end up using less. The finished makeup looks very flawless.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this primer. I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it at first because it wasn&#x27;t tinted and it went on very thin. However, it did a great job of keeping my makeup in place all day and wasn&#x27;t greasy or shiny.</li>
    <li> Came early. Awesome product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several bottles of this stuff and I am a fan.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any better than anything else but I like it enough that I am afraid to branch out.  It doesn&#x27;t break me out and makes my skin look smoother and it feels light.  That&#x27;s enough to keep me coming back for more despite the cost.  BM is on the costly side but from what I can tell, it&#x27;s worth it.  I do use a bit more primer than it suggests.</li>
    <li> All writing on the bottle is in Chinese! I threw this in the trash immediately!</li>
    <li> I love bareminerals and I didn&#x27;t have to go all over town to buy this. I received it real fast and I know I saved money.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get to me but its worth it!! Cheaper price than the store but same great quallity!</li>
    <li> When I use the bare minerals primer my makeup lasts for the whole day, but if I don&#x27;t use primer my makeup usually only lasts for up to 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that you only use one pump. I know that it may seem like it&#x27;s too little, but in reality its the perfect amount. If you use too much, it can cause your skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bare Vitamins Prime Time Primer provides the best results when used together with the Bare Minerals Foundation. Personally, I use the Bare Minerals Foundation SPF 15 in Medium Beige, the Bare Vitamins Prime Time Primer and the mineral veil and I have been receiving a lot of compliments from my friends.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feel. It made my face feel greasy faster than normal. It did not enhance the makeup in any way.</li>
    <li> Love it!  In fact, will be ordering more soon.  It helps cover the large pores without making your skin look like a mask.</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals, Bare Minerals is the best make up I have used. The primer makes the foundation go easier and stay in place better.</li>
    <li> Love being able to buy the make-up I love at affordable prices.  I will be buying this one over and over again!</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and tends to break out easily so I only use this product for nights out with the girls or special events.  I wish I could use it everyday because it truly makes my make-up look so much better!!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like the Prime Time, it makes the Foundation go on smoother and makes your face feel smooth.  I have used the Foundation with and without the Prime Time and to be honest it looks good either way.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my IQ mineral makeup. It makes my skin feel so smooth. My makeup glides on and stays on all day. It feels oily when I first put it on, but does not make my skin oily. This surprised me because I have combination skin. It&#x27;s a small container, but I use only a tiny amount. Love it.</li>
