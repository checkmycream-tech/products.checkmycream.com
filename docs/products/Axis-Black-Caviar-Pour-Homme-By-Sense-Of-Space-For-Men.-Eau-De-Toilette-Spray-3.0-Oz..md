<li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the more expensive colognes though</li>
<li> It has matched pretty much every guy that has tired wearing it!!</li>
<li> Shipping was faster than I expected.</li>
<li> My boyfriend has been wearing Axis Black Caviar everyday and was running low.</li>
<li> I would of preferred something that lasts a little longer.</li>
<li> I have bought it quit a few times after my boyfriend runs out.</li>
<li> Longevity is very poor on this cologne and the scent is very forgettable would not reccomend if u need a solid cologne</li>
<li> He got it in a gift show in Miami-Dade airport and needless to say Amazaon came through on this one as well.</li>

    <li> great buy and way cheaper than the department store</li>
    <li> Has a spicy musk without being flowery. definitely my favorite and go to scent for any occasion</li>
    <li> Hands down--one of the best male fragrances on the market today!  Check it out at Macy&#x27;s or Perfume Corner and then buy it for the price savings at Amazon!</li>
    <li> It smells really good, however it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I always try not to overdo it when I apply cologne, but in this case you will have to if you want it to last longer than 30 mins</li>
    <li> great buy cheaper here then at the mall.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been wearing Axis Black Caviar everyday and was running low. He got it in a gift show in Miami-Dade airport and needless to say Amazaon came through on this one as well. We could not find it anywhere in the DC area.</li>
    <li> got this for my dad and he is in love with it! i love the extra stuff the company sent as well. the shipping was on point too.</li>

    <li> My fiance smells so freakin yummy when he puts this on!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sexy, manly scent. Saved about $15 getting on Amazon, vs one of those perfume stores in the mall (which is where I discovered this scent).&lt;br /&gt;Go smell it at one of those stores to make sure you like it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love the perfume! The smell is great and I always get compliments on how great I smell from the ladies! I love it! Plus Longlasting, I expect it to last for 3 -4 months!</li>
