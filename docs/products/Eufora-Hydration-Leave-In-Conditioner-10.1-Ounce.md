      <li>That being said I wasnt as impressed with the results for my own hair as well as my younger daughter</li>
      <li>A bit of this each day keeps my hair looking full, curly and in good order.  </li>
      <li>But it yielded better results with my oldest daughter, so it goes to show somethings</li>
      <li>Hoping Eurora sees this to put my two cents in. : )</li>
      <li>I use this product to reduce frizz in my wavy hair and love leave-in conditioners.</li>
      <li>It is my favorite hair product</li>
      <li>- having used it over many years - on my hairdresser&#x27;s recommendation</li>
      <li>The smell is not my favorite, it&#x27;s not feminine at all</li>
      <li>I love this product too.</li>
      <li>I love all of the products I have used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Eufora products for maybe 10 years or more now?  </li>
      <li>Love this leave-in conditioner.  </li>
      <li>my favorite conditioner.</li>
      <li>My daughter has extremely curly hair and this conditioner works great!  </li>
      <li>so I am looking for something more nutrient rich and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I have stick straight hair except for the very top layer which is frizzy/damaged.</li>
      <li>Illuminate Shine Mist - to finish off a look with a light gloss&lt;br /&gt; 8.</li>
      <li>Smooth &#x27;N</li>
      <li>If you can get the balance right, it is a great product for leaving the hair soft and fuller.</li>
      <li>I am already familiar with Eufora Hydration Leave-in Conditioner</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally fine too and is now really brittle on top of it.</li>
      <li>It is good, kind of heavy, so don&#x27;t use a lot.  </li>
      <li>Urgent Repair - on occasion as special treatment&lt;</li>
      <li>I wash my hair every day and nothing seemed to give it the shine and bounce that my hair used to have except Eufora Hydration Leave-in conditioner - it leaves my hair smooth and silky - worth every penny</li>
      <li>nothing flowery/ sweet smelling but</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good product (especially as I have found it to challenge to find a LIGHT leave-in</li>
      <li>But if they ever decided to get some scented products for this line, I will be the VERY first to buy them all.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
      <li>This is great - doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all.</li>
      <li>Well, Ive got to the end of my first bottle, the bottle I purchased from my hairdresser, and have grown to love this particular product!  </li>
      <li>I love this brand&#x27;s polishing drops and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a good leave-in conditioner, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
      <li>There is a fine line between using the right amount and using too much (leaves it sort of greasy).</li>
      <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>This also has SPF in it, which I think has helped keep my color fresh in the sun.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot</li>
      <li>Not as thick and rich as I had hoped, but smells really good.</li>
      <li>I use it every day on top of my regular condition.</li>
      <li>I first purchased Eufora Leave in conditioner from my hair dressing salon some months ago.  </li>
      <li>The Eufora leaves my hair feeling soft, smooth and shiny, never frizzes after first wash</li>
      <li>/&gt;It reminds me of just a light natural scent you might get if you walked by a flower stand.  </li>
      <li>My extremely dry brittle ends, feel and look much better.</li>
      <li>Pure Polish</li>
      <li>this leave-in beats all the traditional ones i&#x27;ve used and my hair seems so much lighter while still being smooth and manageable.</li>
      <li>I find it a real turn-off -</li>
      <li>Not overwhelming or sweet or musky but just light and fresh.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In fact one of the reasons I got so hooked on trying this stuff was because my hair dresser uses them along with many other products</li>
      <li>Fixation Styling Wax - Tame the baby hairs around the face, the little fly aways with this</li>
      <li>I would much prefer either NO scent or something more food-like such as vanilla or something subtle.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first because salons will always charge you the earth for a &#x27;fu fu&#x27; product which might just make you feel and look better.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair which can be prone to being frizzy or dry, and these products really help.  </li>
      <li>I use the leave in conditioner almost daily because I have pretty dry hair.</li>
      <li>Enjoy if u purchase it, the bottle lasts me at least 3 months</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s not breaking nearly as much and is much shinier than it was in the past.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and have noticed a marked difference in the strength of my hair</li>
      <li>My hair is natural and this is the only leave in</li>
      <li>Seriously, this leave in conditioner smells so good its like a fresh clean minty aloe, since it&#x27;s an aloe organic base.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my mature years and my hair is dry and looks wispy at times.  </li>

    <li> This is great - doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and have noticed a marked difference in the strength of my hair - it&#x27;s not breaking nearly as much and is much shinier than it was in the past. This also has SPF in it, which I think has helped keep my color fresh in the sun. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I recived a product I believe to be something other than Euphora leave in conditioner. It ws aweful and horrible on my hair and i had sued this brand at the salon before</li>
    <li> My hair is shot! fried and falling out from a thyroid medication I&#x27;m on. My hair is naturally fine too and is now really brittle on top of it. My husband&#x27;s sister gave him a bottle of this and I tried it out. The smell is not my favorite, it&#x27;s not feminine at all but the results are worth it. My extremely dry brittle ends, feel and look much better. I just ordered my own bottle. It&#x27;s worth a shot I think. Just try not to use too much - I did that the other day and it was a mess</li>
    <li> My daughter has extremely curly hair and this conditioner works great!  I also love the hydration shampoo!  Wonderful product line and the seller was great!  Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this product too. My hair is natural and this is the only leave in I like to use HOWEVER...the smell :-/ def something undesirable. Because it is a leave in, one would think the smell of it would be more pleasant. But I will deal with the smell for the way it leaves my hair feeling. But if they ever decided to get some scented products for this line, I will be the VERY first to buy them all.</li>
    <li> This one leaves my hair conditioned without weighing it down.  I have used it for a number of years and will continue to use it, especially because it helps to control my sometimes frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Been using this since 2007 it&#x27;s my hair crack...Seriously, this leave in conditioner smells so good its like a fresh clean minty aloe, since it&#x27;s an aloe organic base.  I only use a dime size for my thick long hair.It works wonders I p use it before I go in to the pool and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. My hair salon doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore. Blah! But watch out for other sellers, they tend 2 sell older eufora products that have been on the shelf too long and it smells like rotten eggs.  Enjoy if u purchase it, the bottle lasts me at least 3 months and I wash my hair daily, since I have oily hair. This does not make my hair oily either.</li>
    <li> This product works well on children and adults. Leaves hair soft, manageable and is a very excellent product. Happy with purchase and delivery</li>
    <li> Smells good, worked well</li>
    <li> I received an OPENED, un-sealed bottle of Hydration Leave-in conditioner. Clearly it was used as there was product missing. This is my second experience with a problematic Eufora purchase through Amazon. I have learned my lesson the hard way and will go back to purchasing full-priced Eufora at the salon.</li>
    <li> I use this product to reduce frizz in my wavy hair and love leave-in conditioners. I use a little and just touch it through my hair and at trouble spots. It&#x27;s pretty good product (especially as I have found it to challenge to find a LIGHT leave-in conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with all the Eurora products is the scent. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the fragrance in it but I find it harsh and unpleasant, almost minty but not in a good way. I find it a real turn-off - I hold my breath when I apply it! - but my stylist loves the smell, so it&#x27;s just a personal taste. I would much prefer either NO scent or something more food-like such as vanilla or something subtle. Hoping Eurora sees this to put my two cents in. : )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mature years and my hair is dry and looks wispy at times.  A bit of this each day keeps my hair looking full, curly and in good order.  It is my favorite hair product</li>
    <li> I love this brand&#x27;s polishing drops and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a good leave-in conditioner, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It is good, kind of heavy, so don&#x27;t use a lot.  But no complaints.</li>
    <li> I am already familiar with Eufora Hydration Leave-in Conditioner - having used it over many years - on my hairdresser&#x27;s recommendation</li>
    <li> I will always use this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product bc my daughters stylist swears by it &amp; they didnt have anymore @ the salon. That being said I wasnt as impressed with the results for my own hair as well as my younger daughter it left a film like residue &amp; it left our hair firm after applying and letting it air dry. But it yielded better results with my oldest daughter, so it goes to show somethings are 4 u &amp; somethings are 4 others. As for the smell it wasnt crude it was just a scent nothing flowery/ sweet smelling but nothing medicinal either just in between.[[ASIN:B002HTZ4A8 Eufora Hydration Leave-In Conditioner, 10.1 Ounce]] BTW all the of us have diff. txture of hair I have a relaxer med/soft thick my 8y/o relaxer med/coarse thick my 6y/o natural thick soft. Hope this helps</li>
    <li> Love this leave-in conditioner.  Does not weigh my curl down. I use it every day on top of my regular condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eufora products for maybe 10 years or more now?  I love all of the products I have used. I have naturally curly hair which can be prone to being frizzy or dry, and these products really help.  Some I use regularly and others on occasion.  The scent on this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact one of the reasons I got so hooked on trying this stuff was because my hair dresser uses them along with many other products and I was always going around smelling how good she smelled and wondering what perfum she was wearing.  However this is the type of scent that doesn&#x27;t interfere with regular perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of just a light natural scent you might get if you walked by a flower stand.  Not overwhelming or sweet or musky but just light and fresh.  I get a lot of comments on my hair smelling nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. Moisture solution conditioner - regular conditioner&lt;br /&gt; 2. Moisture cleanse shampoo - regular shampoo&lt;br /&gt; 3. Hydration leave in conditioner - leave-in conditioner&lt;br /&gt; 4. Urgent Repair - on occasion as special treatment&lt;br /&gt; 5. Beautifying serum - to tame frizz and dead ends daily&lt;br /&gt; 6. Sculpture Styling Glaze - when I need some hold on occasion&lt;br /&gt; 7. Illuminate Shine Mist - to finish off a look with a light gloss&lt;br /&gt; 8. Fortifi Strength Spray - daily to enhance strength of hair&lt;br /&gt; 9. Pure Polish Finishing Drops - Works the same as the beautifying serum, except I was say for situations when you have especially course, curly or dry hair.  Beautifying serum is a little lighter.&lt;br /&gt;10. Curl &#x27;N Defining Solution - when I need some hold on occasion&lt;br /&gt;11. Curl Revitalizer and Spray - when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair and just want to plump up and freshen the scent of my curls&lt;br /&gt;12. Smooth &#x27;N Straightening Balm - on the occasions when I want to straighten my hair&lt;br /&gt;13. Fixation Styling Wax - Tame the baby hairs around the face, the little fly aways with this</li>
    <li> my favorite conditioner. this leave-in beats all the traditional ones i&#x27;ve used and my hair seems so much lighter while still being smooth and manageable. seller did a good job too, packaged well, no leaks in transit like i&#x27;ve had before with other vendors.</li>
    <li> I use all Eufora products, and am always happy.  I use the leave in conditioner almost daily because I have pretty dry hair.</li>
    <li> I first purchased Eufora Leave in conditioner from my hair dressing salon some months ago.  I have long, thick hair which often frizzes.  I was skeptical at first because salons will always charge you the earth for a &#x27;fu fu&#x27; product which might just make you feel and look better.  Well, Ive got to the end of my first bottle, the bottle I purchased from my hairdresser, and have grown to love this particular product!  I put it on wet hair which I have to tie back for work to avoid it frizzing everywhere.  The Eufora leaves my hair feeling soft, smooth and shiny, never frizzes after first wash and I believe it smells good too...!  Invariably my hair frizzes again after a couple of days if I do not straighten it with a flat iron and also when I comb it through but thats my hair, not the product!  Ive come to Amazon looking to replace my empty bottle and it is slightly cheaper here than what I paid before ($23 versus $27).  I will definitely miss it if I dont buy a replacement so Im about to hit the &#x27;buy now&#x27; button!</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!! A++++ You will love!</li>
    <li> Not as thick and rich as I had hoped, but smells really good. I have really dry hair so I am looking for something more nutrient rich and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, great company, no harsh chemicals and makes my hair feel great!</li>
    <li> I have stick straight hair except for the very top layer which is frizzy/damaged. I have to be careful about the heaviness of my leave-in  conditioners. There is a fine line between using the right amount and using too much (leaves it sort of greasy). If you can get the balance right, it is a great product for leaving the hair soft and fuller.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair every day and nothing seemed to give it the shine and bounce that my hair used to have except Eufora Hydration Leave-in conditioner - it leaves my hair smooth and silky - worth every penny</li>
