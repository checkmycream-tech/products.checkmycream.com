<li> I think it&#x27;s the CoverGirl Volublast something or other in the orange tube.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried every other Dior mascara, and none of them compare.</li>
<li> Not worth the money-</li>
<li> The only reason it did not get a 5 star rating was because it gets too thick just after a month or so.  </li>
<li> Watch that tearjerker without fear of raccoon eyes or black tear tracks running down your face.</li>
<li> The problem is that other mascaras are heavy on the lashes and they cause me to lose the curl.</li>
<li> Note is is extremely waterproof and hard to get off with a single cotton ball with makeup remover.</li>
<li> But every time by 4 PM I have black smudges under my eyes.</li>
<li> I hate curling my lashes after applying mascara because my lashes break easily and the curler gets gunky.</li>
<li> I wear contacts and this is one of the few that I don&#x27;t have problems with in regards to flaking.</li>
<li> I hate checking on my makeup and this mascara does not give me dusty raccoon eyes by the end of the day like so many of the others.</li>
<li> I found that daily smudges would occur with this expensive mascara, and I remember having no problems with the Loreal &amp;#34;Beauty Tubes&amp;#34; waterproof mascara.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found that scraping off the mascara goo at least once a week prevents that from happening towards the end of its life.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s neither too runny nor thick.</li>
<li> (no i didn&#x27;t randomly buy it, she mentioned it to me and continues to use it.)</li>
<li> I regret buying it , too bad</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.   </li>

    <li> My favorite mascara to date. I hate checking on my makeup and this mascara does not give me dusty raccoon eyes by the end of the day like so many of the others. Note is is extremely waterproof and hard to get off with a single cotton ball with makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing.  I love that it never runs or clumps.  The only reason it did not get a 5 star rating was because it gets too thick just after a month or so.  It&#x27;s expensive and has to be replaced sooner than not, but I am worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my make-up guru, Paula Begoun, gave it high marks but it gives me raccoon eyes by mid-afternoon! I liked the way it makes my lashes look, but it goes on a little wet and uncurls my lashes. So I let the mascara set and then curled them. But every time by 4 PM I have black smudges under my eyes. I have a problem with that happening because I am Asian (so my lower lids and lashes come in contact a lot) and I have oily skin. So I only wear mascara on my upper lashes. However, I have not had smudging with the cheapie replacements I bought (also recommended by Paula): Waterproof CoverGirl LashBlast Length ($8) and LashBlast Volume ($8) (yes, two mascaras for the 2/3 the price of this one). I alternate between the two depending on my mood. When I have a chance to go to Sephora, I am going to go back to my old stand-by, Waterproof Lancome Hypnose mascara ($26). It did not impart the lushness that Diorshow does, but I wore it during my brother&#x27;s wedding and I cried torrents and it didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I&#x27;ve ever found.  Does not flake off under the eye and does not get on my contacts........Luv it</li>
    <li> I love this brand of mascara, but this one arrived clumpy &amp; dried out, will purchase from Nordstrom from now on...</li>
    <li> I love this but I felt like there&#x27;s not enough mascara on it. I have to use 3-4 coast to really see the difference on my eyelashes. It does stay long though. Even if I washed it the night before I still wake up the next day with smudges on my eyes.</li>
    <li> Really lush mascara, very dramatic, love it.</li>
    <li> My very first high end mascara was this one Diorshow waterproof mascara. It&#x27;s been 10+ years, and I can say that after trying so very many mascaras, drugstore and high end, this is still the best one. Relatively speaking, the formula hasn&#x27;t changed much that the quality has faltered. The formula is drier, which lends itself to holding curl incredibly well. I religiously curl my short, straight, Asian lashes prior to applying mascara (I&#x27;ve tried heated curlers, vibrating mascara wands... still the plain old metal curler offers the best control for shaping). The problem is that other mascaras are heavy on the lashes and they cause me to lose the curl. I hate curling my lashes after applying mascara because my lashes break easily and the curler gets gunky. This is the only mascara that I&#x27;ve used in all my years that does not compromise the curl after I&#x27;ve used a curler. Even the nonwaterproof version can NOT do it. I&#x27;ve tried every other Dior mascara, and none of them compare. Of course, it&#x27;s not worth it to shell out $25+ 3 times a year (4 months is the average life span of my mascaras, which I wear every day and should be tossed for hygienic reasons), but I usually use this one in the last third of the year when there tend to be more holidays and celebrations. The curl and the volume are just perfection. I can skip the excessive lashes because they just look so good (and maybe a bit because I&#x27;m lazy)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara does tend to get a bit flaky, but that happens with every drier mascara. I&#x27;ve found that scraping off the mascara goo at least once a week prevents that from happening towards the end of its life. The second best high end mascara, in my opinion, is Tarte&#x27;s Lights, Camera, Splashes! mascara, which is only second because it doesn&#x27;t volumize and its slightly wetter formula lends itself to a tiny bit more clumping. This mascara is second to none, and I would absolutely recommend this high end mascara, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. If you want quality AND affordability, look elsewhere. This is an excellent buy!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rush to call this mascara &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;, nor would I once again pay to own this mascara when looking for waterproof mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;This is considered the best in waterproof, and I wouldn&#x27;t know why. It&#x27;s simply not waterproof. It&#x27;s quite leaky, actually.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not in the market for a waterproof mascara, this might be perfect for you as it doesn&#x27;t clump, it applies beautifully and evenly with ease and gives a great color. However, it&#x27;s so very leaky, at least, I guess, the one that I have — that it runs even if I apply a waterproof topcoat mascara that I bought especially for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, only problem here is that it&#x27;s not waterproof. Other than that, awesome mascara: holds a curl, looks great, gives lashes thick and long look.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at first thinking it&#x27;s price and brand would knock it out of the park with long wondrous eyelashes. I&#x27;ve got to say, my $7 bottle from the drugstore truly gives me the lashes I was looking for, long wear, smear-free, easy to apply. I think it&#x27;s the CoverGirl Volublast something or other in the orange tube. The drugstore mascaras are incredible these days, and for me, Diorshow had nothing extra to offer to make it worth the price. I found that it didn&#x27;t bulk the lashes much unless I spent a lot of time applying layer after layer, and didn&#x27;t hold the curl as well as my drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> A máscara é realmente perfeita....Deixa os cílios bem alongados e nao mancha os olhos, pelo fato de ser a prova dàgua.</li>
    <li> Not in my opinion really waterproof- I found that daily smudges would occur with this expensive mascara, and I remember having no problems with the Loreal &amp;#34;Beauty Tubes&amp;#34; waterproof mascara.  Not worth the money- I don&#x27;t care what other reviewers say, this stuff simply does not stay put.</li>
    <li> I read the rave reviews for this product, so I ordered it back in April. I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the mascara... yep, it made my eyelashes look like I was wearing mascara, but that&#x27;s about it. On top of that, it doesn&#x27;t perform well under pressure. This mascara flaked and ran when subjected to standard Texas heat and humidity. If you had given me just the wand and not told me it was $25 Dior mascara, after putting it on I would have sworn it was a generic $3 drug store mascara. I was very disappointed.   (If you&#x27;re looking for a knockout mascara that can take the heat, I am deeply impressed with Maybelline&#x27;s The Falsies Volum&#x27; Express Waterproof.)</li>
    <li> My go to mascara.  I have tried many waterproof mascaras but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is the best thickest blackest mascara to come out and really water Proof, even freeze proof in Alaska.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and what it does for my lashes. However, it does tend to smudge under the eyes. Even the waterproof one. I wear contacts and this is one of the few that I don&#x27;t have problems with in regards to flaking.</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on clean and black and it stays where you put it until you take it off. Watch that tearjerker without fear of raccoon eyes or black tear tracks running down your face. Your eyes will still look fabulous.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, the only fallback is that it was only available in waterproof. Excellent product! Have used for many years and it never fails me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara not the best I have ever tried. It has a big fat brush which is great. I just wished it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best mascara on the market I think. Thickens and lengthens but doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a present for my SO and she loves the stuff... (no i didn&#x27;t randomly buy it, she mentioned it to me and continues to use it.)</li>
    <li> it goes on a bit thick, color is rich black but it does rub off and stained my eye where ever the lash touched. dont last long. comes off easy to.</li>
    <li> I have board straight Asian eyelashes that will not stayed curled unless I use a waterproof mascara, and this one just happens to be my all time favorite for the past 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... it is OVERPRICED on amazon.  The retail price is NOT $38, it&#x27;s $25 at Sephora, Macys, Nordstrom or where ever you can regularly buy Dior cosmetics.  So basically there&#x27;s no savings by ordering through amazon unless you&#x27;re counting the cost of gas to get to these places.</li>
    <li> I love both the wand and the consistency of this mascara. It&#x27;s neither too runny nor thick. It supports the curl of my lashes, builds volume and adds length. It is the most expensive item in my makeup bag but I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Dior has the best eye products</li>
    <li> Do not spend your money on this , a drugstore mascara is better than this ... I regret buying it , too bad I didn&#x27;t save the box it came on so I can return it ...</li>
