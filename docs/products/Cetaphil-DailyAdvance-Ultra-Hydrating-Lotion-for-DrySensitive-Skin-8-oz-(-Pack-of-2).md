<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best lotion. It absorbs quickly and you need very little to be effective. Light enough to use on your face in a pinch. No scent. I love this stuff, well worth the cost. It lasts me months with daily use.</li>
    <li> This lotion is ok.  While it does the job, it feels a little gooey when putting it on.</li>
    <li> it works great for me ,smooth and hydrates the skin, not greasy so can be used in summer too ,also use them as hand lotion as well .will buy again.</li>
    <li> after working in tallahassee and having it wreck havoc on my skin, the dermatologist recommended cetaphil.  i&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement in just the short time i&#x27;ve been using it</li>
    <li> This is great lotion. It keeps you very moist. It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and works great on my skin. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  As a person with many allergies, I appreciate that there is no scent/perfume, and it does not cause a rash or itching.</li>
    <li> Excellent Seller!!! 100% Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> The label says &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34;, but this was the greasiest lotion I have ever used.  Some may have been absorbed, but most of it was not and got on my clothes and bedding.  It took soap to get this product off my hands and face, which says it all.</li>
    <li> Cost-effective, not enough moisture in winter</li>
    <li> a little oil and useful</li>
    <li> Like the product but the head of the bottle arrived broken and now i have to put it in something else.</li>
    <li> obsessed with this stuff. Since I started using this with the cleanser daily, my skin tone is more even, with fewer breakouts, and less dryness/ random oily patches.</li>
    <li> Perfect, i recommend 100%</li>
    <li> Use it all the time for my dry skin because I have eczema.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter, she has mild form of eczema. Hydrated well and I dont see dryness anymore.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist. My face was always dry and scaly. This lotion does not dry out as some of the other \\&quot;so called\\&quot; wonder lotions.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin.  In the winter my skin gets really dry and I used to get eczema on my arms when I didn&#x27;t use lotion.  I also would develop rashes when I used the cheaper vasoline brand lotions.  My doctor recommended this lotion and my eczema as rashes are gone.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I made this purchase! Price was excellent and the product is great. I have very sensitive skin and I am able to use this product without any burning. I am only on day 3 of using it, but so far so great. No smell either! Perfumed products, no matter how light the scent, tend to trigger migraines for me. This product does not have a scent. Very happy!!</li>
    <li> No. Just no. I love Cetaphil but this product is extremely greasy, makes me look shiny, and just sits on top of my skin and then dries up and doesn&#x27;t moisturize. It&#x27;s more greasy and sticky than Cetaphil Cream (which I love). Now I&#x27;m stuck with a whole bottle of this junk.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for dry sensitive skin. I use it on my 5 month old baby everyday. Not greasy and feels light.</li>
    <li> Even though this is hypoallergenic and came recommended by my allergist, there is a faint &#x27;bug spray&#x27; smell that reminds me of Off mosquito Repellent. It wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if it didn&#x27;t make me slightly congested. The smell dissipates after use, but the nasal stuffiness is unwelcome. I had to get rid of my bottle.</li>
    <li> My son has very dry skin and severe eczema and the lotion has helped. We had tried other daily moisturizers like Aquaphor but only this lotion has given it a silky feel without the greasy feel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great product. My daughter, 28 months old, had been suffered from dry, itchy skin. I tried almost 10 different kinds of baby lotions, oils and ointments for her skin.  But nothing worked for her.    This lotion works for her. Now she doesn&#x27;t scrach any more and sleeps better.    I strongly recommend this one for who has dry, and itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Love Cetaphil products simply the best.</li>
    <li> works well, no scent, gentle</li>
    <li> can put plenty on and soaks in.  doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling slimy!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion at my local Walgreens, I loved the cleanser from this company so much that I figured the lotion would be just as great. NOT TRUE. At the time I was looking for a moisturizer my skin was rather dry. Now, we are all very different and everyone&#x27;s bodies accept and reject different things and unfortunately for me this was not my kind of lotion. Along with some of the other common reviews, I found this lotion to be a little too greasy for me to the point that my skin felt weird and sticky, I even tried using a minimal amount. I&#x27;m not particularly fond of the way this lotion feels on my skin so I will look into another lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Just to point out, I looked at some of the people who had given this lotion a five star and claiming there was no greasiness or some other common problems reviewers found. It appears (quite literally) that all their other reviews for other products are exactly the same comment on 18 other products that the happened to review the same day. So when looking up reviews, just be SENSITIVE in who you believe and what-not.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My sister using this moisturizing excellent for dry skin and sensitive skin. It also, is better than other lotions in that it’s not so viscous that you feel like you have to wash your hands afterward to remove the excess. My sister not disappointed for this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using htis for years; refreshing and moisturizing!</li>
    <li> My husband came home from work one day and mentioned a friend had recommended this lotion for dry hands.  I have to say this is a great lotion for many reasons.  My husbands hands get quite dirty and he found that if he used this lotion before starting work when lunch rolled around and he washed his hands the dirt rinsed right off.  He would then follow with another application.  It also kept his hands hydrated and kept them from drying out and cracking from the harsh chemicals and cleaners they use for his job. For myself, I have always had a problem with the heels of my feet being so dry and this lotion remedied that issue.  This past winter no problem with dry flaky skin.  It kept my skin hydrated. This lotion is not greasy and has no odor. I use it on my face without issue as well but I&#x27;ve always had dry skin.  It&#x27;s become a must have for our family!</li>
    <li> Nothing as good as Cetaphil for super dry skin. We have tried everything under the sun and this is the best product with the least amount of chemicals!</li>
    <li> I have a bad case of psoriasis that tends to flake out in my T-zone, especially during these cold winter months. A good daily moisturizer is essential to keep the redness, rawness, and flakes at bay. Unfortunately, my skin is very sensitive and can not tolerate most lotions. Because of this, I prefer using skin care products that are non-greasy, fragrance-free, and paraben-free when I can find them. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about Cetaphil DailyAdvance Ultra Hydrating Lotion for Dry, Sensitive Skin, so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is thick and creamy, but non-greasy and light-weight enough to spread without needing a spatula. I really liked it at first, so I decided to apply it all over my face and body before happily shuffling off to run errands, hoping I&#x27;d finally found a lotion that worked for me. Then a funny thing happened after an hour of errand running, I started to notice an irritating, persistent itch smack dab in the middle of my T-zone radiating between my eyes and all around my eyebrows. I ignored the itch at first, thinking maybe I just hadn&#x27;t applied enough lotion to that particularly sensitive area, but the irritation continued until I just had to scratch it, and scratch it, and scratch it some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, my skin didn&#x27;t look or feel hydrated. You know that lovely refreshed feeling you get when moisturizer actually absorbs into your skin? Nope. Not with this lotion. Instead of soft, supple skin, I was left with a waxy build-up that became more uncomfortable as the day wore on. It was like someone had mixed petroleum jelly with beeswax then slathered it all over my face and body. My cheeks and under-eye area were shiny and smooth, but in a taut, unnaturally pinched way that made my skin look fake. I assume this is the moisture-lock feature that Cetaphil mentions, but I found it only \\&quot;locked in\\&quot; existing moisture without actually adding to it. Beneath the shiny, waxy film, my cheeks felt as dry as tissue paper. I couldn&#x27;t imagine dealing with that in the middle of a hot summer&#x27;s day when my pores need the ability to breath and sweat. I&#x27;m sorry, but shininess just isn&#x27;t the same thing as a nice, healthy glow. I want to look like a human, not a mannequin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The itchiness got worse. My eyes stung and began to water, which made driving difficult. I finally couldn&#x27;t take it anymore, so I ran home and jumped in the shower to wash off. I guess maybe I was allergic to one of the ingredients? Who knows! So much for Cetaphil being made specifically for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Fragrance-free&lt;br /&gt;* Thick and creamy&lt;br /&gt;* Non-greasy or sticky&lt;br /&gt;* Skin looks shiny and smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Beware the itch!&lt;br /&gt;* Leaves a waxy film on top of skin&lt;br /&gt;* Waxy film locks in existing moisture, but doesn&#x27;t hydrate skin&lt;br /&gt;* Moisture-lock gives skin an unnatural, pinched appearance around cheeks and eyes&lt;br /&gt;* Shiny skin is not the same thing as a healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;* Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this as a facial cream&lt;br /&gt;* Stings eyes and causes them to water&lt;br /&gt;* Not recommended for people with sensitive skin or allergies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone with psoriasis or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Some may argue that this lotion is not meant to be a facial cream and that I only have myself to blame for any negative reactions I experienced to this product by applying it to my face in the first place. However, if you go to Cetaphil&#x27;s official web site and click on MOISTURIZERS &gt; FACIAL MOISTURIZERS, you will see Cetaphil DailyAdvance Ultra Hydrating Lotion for Dry, Sensitive Skin listed under that category.

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, a little goes a long way, and keeps me moisturized all day. I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an everyday moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for my winter dry skin. There is no scent and no oil. You&#x27;ll feel a moisturizer on your body for a bit but this is amazing. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I love to use this lotion in the winter when my skin is extremely dry. I&#x27;ve tried many other lotions and nothing comes close to this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it which is very important to me as I don&#x27;t like my lotions to smell. It&#x27;s very hydrating and I notice a difference in my skin the next day! I have very sensitive skin on my face and this is the only lotion that I&#x27;ll apply to my face.</li>
    <li> I just noticed there are a few Amys here...anyway, this is like an amped up version of the daily. It works as well. Not greasy or heavy when used in moderate amounts, has no scent which works best for me, absorbs, and can be used on your face too. Soothes, moisturizes, doesn&#x27;t cause break-outs. Perfect for winter.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite heavy. It makes my skin look greasy. And what is worst of all - it feels very sticky on my skin. In addition to all that it also has a stale smell which I hate. All this makes me want to wash this lotion off the second I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> all the Cetaphil products are wonderful for dry skin.  If you do not have a water softener it is the solution.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil has always been my first choice for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is light and non-greasy. Even though it does not give the shinning look on your arms and legs but it sure hydrate the skin.</li>
    <li> Best price and great service.</li>
    <li> The Cetaphil was suggested by my therapist, It ARRIVED quickly&lt;br /&gt;It is a very nice lotion but I do prefer what I was using</li>
    <li> Great stuff, cleans really good</li>
    <li> Replenishment good effect, the skin no longer dry</li>
    <li> Great lotion, great price. I use this and my skin feels really nice. It actually moisturizes unlike other lotions. I&#x27;ve been using this for some time now- and finally Costco has started bringing Cetaphil in their stores. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is the absolutely WORST moisturizer I have ever used. I received it as a sample with some Cetaphil Cleanser I just purchased. This &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; goes on smoothly enough, then quickly converts to a dry finish followed by extreme irritation. To get rid of the discomfort I had to wash my face three times during the day just to get that gunk off  - it hung in there with that much stubbornness. To wash my face that many times was really a risk, as my skin is sensitive. When the skin finally got clean, was able to put on a mosturizer that, while not perfect, was about 500% better than This Daily Advance Lotion. How Cetaphil can make a cleanser that is so safe for sensitive skin, and then turn around and come out with a moisturizer that is so awful is completely beyond me.</li>
    <li> This lotion really moisturizers my skin very well. Most important, I have very sensitive skin and this lotion does not cause breakouts on my face. Also it does not stink my eyes when I used it to moisturize my eye lids too.</li>
    <li> This lotion is working.  I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should and it is working anyway.  It feels good and sinks in quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am taking Acutane and my dermatologist recommanded it.  I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s very moisturing and not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Good for sensitive skin, eczema, really dry skin and really just any skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. Love it.</li>
    <li> EXCELENT FOR MOISTURIZING SKIN</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Cetaphil. All the stars for this product.</li>
    <li> Very good and cheaper</li>
    <li> I love it! Great product, excellent service</li>
    <li> I have skin that is prone both to acne and to drying out like a petrified dinosaur turd. This lotion saved my skin! I apply the lotion twice daily (morning and night) after my normal face-washing routine. It&#x27;s lightweight but not so light that you don&#x27;t feel like it is doing anything. My skin is happy and hydrated without getting overly greasy (which happens if you use a lot of heavy, moisturizing lotions). The lotion is also designed to not cause acne which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> I would strongly recommend it. Go for it and its fast shipping. Also it&#x27;s on prime now. go go go</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product, lately I have had peeling on my forehead and on my cheeks after showers, I&#x27;ve tried a few other moisturizers and all have made it worse.  Than I read the reviews for this and I must say it has been a complete turn around for my skin.</li>
    <li> Use on my daughter and is works very. Bought another one from Amazon again!</li>
    <li> Yep that was pretty much the case with my dry, sensitive, blotchy, burned, prune like face filled with dry acne pockmarks. And I have tried just about everything mostly focusing on anti-aging issues as I am 40+. But nothing worked no high end creams and neither organic oils, lotions and potions. In fact things only got worse with my face so finally one day out of desperation when my face was feeling and looking like burned sandpaper I bought this Cetaphil Advance Lotion. I am so glad I did. This truly moisturizes my face and does not make it break out, like so many face creams have done in the past. Forget aging issues I came to the conclusion that the most important thing for your face is MOISTURIZING. Because now that I have used this for 2 months my face looks even toned, clear, fresh, softer and younger. I use this combined with the Cetaphil gentle facial cleaners and during the day I use Cetaphil SPF 50. Thank you Cetaphil for restoring and beautifying my face!</li>
    <li> What more can one say about this product? it is top notch, it works and it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s even better than the regular one, has it all!</li>
    <li> Male. Use it daily on my face, neck and arms, mixed with a little aloe vera gel and a drop of jojoba oil. Tightens and moistens skin and Works all day! Mild smell. Love it.</li>
    <li> With this cream your skin will be great. it has no smell and no oleo. My skin got soft and withour any marks.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that i missed was the sunblock</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 4 years and would not use anything else. It is not the cheapest or the most expensive. But for me it works and is affordable. Only when this is not available would I ever use another product, as long as product quality remains constant.</li>
    <li> I love the branch Cetaphil. I use several products. They are really very good in spite of being a little expensive.</li>
    <li> My doctor has indicated to use every day to my dry skin and the price it is the best one</li>
    <li> The Cetaphil products are wonderful.  Everybody should try them.  The lotions and the soaps are my favorites. Especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. It&#x27;s not fragrance free. The lotion is transparent, which is different with gentle cleanser, but they have almost cleansing result.&lt;br /&gt;It seems this edition didn&#x27;t on sale in the China market.</li>
    <li> I use this Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion for Dry Sensitive Skin on my legs and feet every day and I have been using it now for several months and I really like it.  My legs and feet are always very dry and Cetaphil seems to correct this.  It is a bit thick but it does rub in easily and feels very soft, I do not like silky feeling lotion and this is not silky after using it, my skin looks and feels SOFT after applying it.  Great deal great product.</li>
    <li> Skin still a bit oily</li>
    <li> When you use it for the first time it´s disappointing because it´s a fragance free lotion. But when you apply it every day you can feel your skin soft and hydrated. It really Works. In my case it was recommended by a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Good body lotion ... helps with winter skin in particular!</li>
    <li> I use this daily before heading out, keeps my skin moisturized without feeling oily. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now ever since I read reviews and gave it a shot. I try to use every bottle till the last drop :D</li>
    <li> What can I say?! Cetaphil&#x27;s a great lotion for people like me with psoriasis. I use it every day and night on my elbows and knees and it&#x27;s been very effective at keeping the scaliness to a minimum. And how awesome that it&#x27;s offered in this 16oz size?! And a great price for this large of a bottle! I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I have a minor amount of eczema on my hands , and this product clears it up right away.  I have used it on my body, and I really like the feeling.  I do have to reapply as needed, but I never feel greasy or that it is too heavy.  I am looking forward to using this in the summer months.</li>
    <li> When I moved from the East to West Coast, my normally dry sensitive skin became even MORE sensitive than ever. The doctor recommended Cetaphil and I have never looked back.</li>
    <li> Smooth, easy on the skin. I have extra dry skin due to swimming several times a week and I used to use Eucerene, but I will always end up feeling itchy at the end of the day and having to re-apply before going to bed. However, since I started using Cetaphil Advance Lotion a week ago, I haven&#x27;t had any issues at the end of the day and my skin feels extremely hydrated.</li>
    <li> The best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
    <li> All is good here.No issues.Fast shipping.Packs really well.What more can I ask more.AAAAAAAAAA</li>
    <li> Perfect for every one for cold, both for kids and adults.  This is the only moisturizer which helped my babies (now toddlers) overcome infant eczema.</li>
    <li> nice smell. absorbs easily and helps with dry skin.</li>
    <li> It works and let my skin keep moisturized a day after each use.  Not greasy and easy to be absorbed.</li>
    <li> Worst moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s just an oily, greasy mess. Terrible ingredients, doesn&#x27;t even moisturize. Cetaphil&#x27;s only popular because people haven&#x27;t discovered anything else yet. Avoid - save your money time and skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the face wash for a few years now. Trying to find a lotion I liked. Although I don&#x27;t care for the feel of this when its on my face, it does a great job. No break out or rashes. Hydrates well! Makes my face feel oily. Like I&#x27;ve used too much when I haven&#x27;t hardly used any. I like the results so I&#x27;ll get over it. I don&#x27;t notice a smell.</li>
    <li> My husbands forearms were dry all the time and he has skin problems.  So the doctor suggested this lotion.  It is very good.  Lasts a long time and I put it on my face too.  In this dry weather, you need a lotion that will stay, and this one will.  Smooth, thick and silky.</li>
    <li> I have been using cetaphil for about a year now. I have been using this lotion on and off and its awesome.  It makes my skin super soft and doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it oily.  I would not use it on your face if you do not have really dry skin. I use a separate lotion for my face. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My mom and sister asked me for it because they like it very much.  It is great for sensitive dry skin.  It arrived on time, very well packed. Very please with the product and with the prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for me.  It made my skin break out in a rash and it took forever to get my skin to look half way decent again.</li>
    <li> I needed it for a few different reasons, and this was told to me, but I don&#x27;t see that it helps a whole lot.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist prescribed this. It is unscented.....which was a con at first but now I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. If you have eczema then this is really awesome. It will not irritate.</li>
    <li> This is the same Cetaphil that I have been using for years and it is still amazing. I use it on my face and body and it is one of the few lotions that I can use on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin too.</li>
    <li> One of the best lotions I&#x27;ve tried. I love the fact that it has no scent, so it doesn&#x27;t change the scent of my cologne.</li>
    <li> I have extreme dry skin. If I don&#x27;t use lotion, my skin gets so dry that it cracks and sometimes a little blood comes out. This lotion helps soothes my skin pretty well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was having MAJOR skin problems - especially on my hands. They were cracked, bleeding, and so swollen. I could barely use them. All the moisturizers I used just seemed to make them more tender or stung. Finally I went to a wonderful dermatologist (after 3 other doctors) and was prescribed a cortisone-type cream and did light-therapy that brought the inflammation down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the thing that has kept me better is THIS LOTION! It is the perfect consistency to use over and over without causing greasiness or over-tenderness. It also doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate. I use it every time I wash or my skin feels dry. It&#x27;s even perfect for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use other types if lotion - even those marketed for sensitive skin - my problem begins to return. I now have bottles of Cetaphil by each sink and in my car. I can&#x27;t live without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Amazon&#x27;s price is great!</li>
    <li> I use this daily everywhere on my face and body after showering. It has no scent, fragrance, or dyes (huge plus for me), feels lightweight and non-greasy, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes my skin very well for a lotion. It&#x27;s also easy to spread around, unlike thicker lotions. I&#x27;ve had issues with eczema since I was born. If I don&#x27;t use a high quality lotion on my body every day, I have outbreaks. This stuff really improves the quality of my skin, significantly reducing my issues with eczema. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil has great products this one is a great cream we use all cetaphil soap, creams, they are all good products</li>
    <li> My skin loves this,  I have severe excema since I was a kid and for a normal application of lotion I put this on but for the extra dry spots like my face and arms and legs I use cetaphil restoraderm. Both great and feels better in my opinion than cerave</li>
    <li> good&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion, Ultra Hydrating</li>
    <li> I received samples from my dermatologist of this product. I love it. I used it to help with dry skin that had broken out in a rash and stretchmarks postpartum. So far I&#x27;ve seen drastic improvement in just a few days of use. Looking forward to using the full size long term.</li>
    <li> Works well, non greasy, odorless, great for dry itchy skin.recommend for dry sensitive skin. i will buy again. Great product</li>
    <li> Its volume is large enough for an entire family.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it is so hydrating, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy on my skin at all.  It&#x27;s a little too thick to use on my face, but I use it as a body lotion everyday.  It has a light scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist when I was on Accutane (expect extremely dry skin when on this). It works great, especially on lips. Stay away from lip balms like Chapstick (google something like &amp;#34;Chapstick addiction&amp;#34;). Took me months to break the addiction, but that&#x27;s a whole other story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I need it for my hands as the very hard water here in Vegas dries your skin like you would not believe. I never had this problem before moving here recently.</li>
    <li> I subscrib to this and that alone saves a bundle. This product tends to be higher priced then other but for a very good reason. There arent any irritants and if applied after a shower or bath it obsorbs into the skin incredible fast. On dry skin it simple takes just a litte bit longer. With my overly sensitive skin its taken years for me to find something that works and doesnt make me feel like im wearing glue all day on my skin. You dont need to use a ton of it, nor do you have to use it multiple times a day. The secret is to use it regularly and occationaly an additional time during the day if needed.  Ive had rough areas of skin that have been there for years and figured I just had to live with it. In less than a week these areas were notivably smoother. It is well worth the price</li>
    <li> An aunt of mine reccomanded it however I guess it&#x27;s not for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on at night &amp; it was ok.. But when I would put it on in the morning, it would leave my face oily &amp; not feeling too good. Felt a little sticky. So maybe it&#x27;s for some but I would not be buying this product again because it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. At least not in the day time.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion!!! Suggested by my dermatologist, this has made my dry alligator skin much better!!!</li>
    <li> I get pretty dry skin during the winter and as a kid, grew up having eczema breakouts on my arms, neck and legs. Although my eczema has subdued as a grown up, I have still been using this lotion as my daily moisturizer for over 10 years. I like it right out of the shower and make sure to apply a liberal amount over my body to retain the moister into my skin. I also like that its fragrant free.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is one of very few brands my family and I uses during the dry Winter months.  It does not leave any film after rubbing the lotion on the skin.  Excellent feel and keeps all of us feeling supple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on accutane which makes your skin extremely dry and sensitive, plus it&#x27;s also winter. I&#x27;ve been getting eczema all over my arms, and this really didn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s much waterier than most moisturizers, doesn&#x27;t protect your skin as long, and just doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well. I ended up using curel ultra healing lotion which works way better and fixed my skin problem. This would probably work for people with less severe dryness, but it honestly didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I buy lots of cetaphil products and I love this lotion.  I will keep using it and I use it all over my face and body.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Nice odor. Really Ultra Hydrate</li>
    <li> Great product for Dry skin</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It is great , i am alergic to most of the body lotions and this one works perfectly.  Also the price is great ,cause it lasts for a long time eventhough i use it everyday . I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> been using this for YEARS!  light enough for summer and heavy enough for the winter.  non greasy, soaks into skin and very light scent.  no perfumes or dyes.</li>
    <li> Better moisturizer that a lot of Rx strength products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Gentle lotion and skin cleaner which I have used for years. Originally recommended by a dermatologist for dermatitis.  It aids in the treatment of eczema for me.</li>
    <li> Works well, however I prefer the cream.  The cream is less greasy and more hydrating.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anybody who suffers from eczema.  This product moisturisers my skin all day long and doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling.  Comes in a convenient pump and has the added Shea Butter and Macadamian nut oil. Great value and because I live in New Zealand and we can&#x27;t get this formula here I have to buy it from the States. Thank goodness for Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion for my skin.  Great smell, penetrates deep, has great ingredients and highly recommended by doctors and dermatologists (mine as well).  I have my husband using it on his horribly dry elbows and knees.  I&#x27;d recommend this for everyone with any dry skin especially here in Arizona.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentler than soap and didn&#x27;t dry out my face. Smells unobtrusive. The downside is that I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;ve fully rinsed it off, because it&#x27;s slippery.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin...</li>
    <li> My mom like this lotion a lot, as do I. It is good to just lather on throughout the day if needed. Good pump.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is basically a classic.  I have tried loads of products - expensive department store brands, and the less expensive &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; brands.  Nothing about Cetaphil appears fancy.  It has bland packaging, it&#x27;s unassuming, easy for the eyes to pass over when perusing the beauty product aisle stocked full of flashy marketed products.  I can&#x27;t recall even seeing advertisements for this product to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a mistake it would be to judge this by its cover.  Some products are so good, they don&#x27;t need flashy marketing gimmicks to sell.  This sells itself by just being that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who relies heavily on reviews when looking for new skin care products, one of my pet peeves is when a person tells you positive or negative things about a product without describing their individual traits (be it skin or hair care).  So indulge me for a moment while I tell you about me so you can decide for yourself if your circumstances are similar enough that this product might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 30s.  I have pretty decent skin, always have, and I am still wrinkle free, but my skin has definitely got drier as I have aged.  It does not help that I live in a 4 seasons locale, with cold, dry winters, but my skin (especially my hands) tends to the dry side all year round, and in all types of weather, humid or not.  It helps even less that I am less diligent about my skin care regimen than I ought to be.  I rarely use sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the sun, I often forget to moisturize at night, and I don&#x27;t even necessarily do it every day.  I drink lots of water, but still my skin remains dry (and obviously at least some of that derives from my own negligence).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, I need a rich product designed for dry skin.  Many products leave a film on my skin that almost balls up and/or rubs off when I touch my skin.  This does not.  Yet other products sit on top of my skin like oil, especially those designed for dry skin.  Products designed for normal skin, and even some designed for dry, seem to absorb so quickly it&#x27;s almost like I used nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this product.  I can use this once on my face in the morning and still feel hydrated by the end of the day.  It does not feel greasy, it leaves no film, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off or leave those strange little balls of product that failed to absorb.  I tend to use it more frequently on my hands, since those get drier (especially between the fingers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is inexpensive, lasts a long time, and quite frankly, does a better job of hydrating my skin than products that cost five times as much.  Highly recommended.d for dry skin.

    <li> Excellent lotion for dry skin. Smells great and good for skin. Highly recommend. Well priced. Good ad-on item (better deal than elsewhere)</li>
    <li> This Cetaphil  lotion is really suitable for winter use, for your face or for hands. without any special aroma. I loves it.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is an amazing company. Every product works as describes. Never had an issue with them. When I run out and don&#x27;t have time to go buy more I get very frustrated lol.</li>
    <li> Only one lotion that works since my son is a baby til now he&#x27;s 7 for my sons very dry skin .</li>
    <li> Best lotion at a reasonable price.  Works better than any other brand I have tried.</li>
    <li> Good anti itch cream. Good moisturiser. Use it all over everybody, no bad result so good to go.</li>
    <li> I like all Cetaphil products, the facial cleanser, the soap.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product. I hardly ever make good choices when it comes to skin care products but THIS... THIS was a winner. I&#x27;m a big girl and putting lotion all over my body is such a task sometimes, it makes me not even wanna do it. On top of that it&#x27;s just hard for me to find a lotion that leaves my skin looking and feeling as nice as I want it to. I don&#x27;t know exactly what sensitive skin means but I bought this anyway and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It leaves my skin feeling SO hydrated but without a greasy look. The lotion itself isn&#x27;t greasy or watery either. It&#x27;s just the right consistency to apply. It doesn&#x27;t take long to rub it in or anything. I love it. I use this for my face also and it makes it feel and look nice and soft but I plan on getting the Cetaphil products that are actually for the face. I&#x27;ll probably end up with like every Cetaphil product lol. So glad I found this. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to the frilly dilly smell good lotions I used to use that were really only good for smelling good. I also used to use the Vaseline brand cocoa butter lotion and that stuff does not compare at all to Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I buy this lotion in quantity at costco often with a coupon and have gotten my whole extended family using it for several years now.  We even send it in the mail to our family in china because it is absolutely indispensable to all of us.  Their hands used to crack in the winter, but never again!!  I live in the desert and have to use something.  I have tried many products over the years, but this ended my search.  After a shower and I put a small amount of this all over, I never notice it again and my skin is never ever dry.  I only use it occasionally again on my hands when I&#x27;m washing them too much during the day, and it solves everything.  My husband forgets and develops dry painful elbows over time and I put this on him, problem solved over night, literally.  Im just now experimenting with using it on my face and its fine in very small quantity so far.  So glad for cetaphil!!  I&#x27;ve always used it on my babies, too!  I have had to throw away all other fancy smelly creams and stuff because they just got old and I never touched them anymore!</li>
    <li> I find this lotion to be lovely.  It&#x27;s great on the hands and it works well on the face. It doesn&#x27;t cause an pimples on my face like most other lotions.  I use this anytime when my body feels dry and sometimes that is very often.  Gentle and effective, period.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil body and face lotion is an amazing moisturizing product for all skin types. I tend to have very dry skin in the colder months and love to have a light moisturizer in the hotter months. This moisturizer is both moisturizing and light. Unlike some lotions that take a while to rub in and feel thick on the skin Cetaphil body lotion is easy to rub in and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin. It is a great product that can be used on both the body and the face which is hard for me to find because next to having dry skin I also have sensitive skin. Just like the product claims it is best for all skin types and should definitely be a top item in any skin/face care routine.</li>
    <li> excellent product, i loved</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for those who have eczema to use during summer. It&#x27;s light weight but keeps the skin moisturized. It&#x27;s a wonderful product for the whole family!</li>
    <li> Better than the regular cetaphil, It&#x27;s a tad greasy but perfect for the winter.</li>
    <li> This works very well for my sensitive skin.  I use it before bed and mix it during the day with sunscreen. LOVE IT - no breakouts.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist advised me to use this product for my dry, sensitive skin. And it&#x27;s truly impressive how this product has improved my skin condition. I use it every day after I shower and finally, no more dry, itchy feeling! I started by applying this to my whole body! My body absorbs it really well and after a few minutes, you don&#x27;t even feel that there&#x27;s something there! No sticky feeling! Be careful thou how much you use especially on your arms. At one point my husband complained that my arms felt wet and sticky so I realized that I was using too much on my arms. When I used less on my arms then it became ok. Overall, I think this product is excellent and very effective to hydrate dry skin!</li>
    <li> I use this for my son&#x27;s eczema/dry skin. His pediatrician recommended it and it&#x27;s great. Absorbs quickly and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Have been using forever..good product</li>
    <li> This was recommended for my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  I tried a slew of natural products before this, but they did not work out with her skin.  Cetaphil was the only lotion we tried that helped keep her skin soft and supple.  I use it on my face sometimes and it always leaves my skin feeling soft for hours.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. I used my nephew who has atopic dermatitis and really helps a lot. I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 months and is very useful for the management of this disease</li>
    <li> I am prone to dry skin, especially in the winter. This is by far the best drugstore lotion that I have ever used. It provides lasting hydration and is non-greasy. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> En helt grei ansiktsKrem.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using Cetaphil lotion especially in the warmer weather.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Daily Advance does hydrate the skin very well with effect pretty similar to the Eucerin Plus Intensive Repair and clearly superior to Lubriderm for my hands, feet, and limb extensor surfaces. However, as with the Eucerin I am concerned about some of the ingredients that probably have no business in anyone&#x27;s body (polyisobutene, acrylates, phenoxyethanol,cyclopentasiloxane, etc) Even though externally applied, these compounds surely enter the body (just as drug patches allow chemicals to cross the skin barrier) and into the bloodstream. Perhaps these additives account for the smooth and rapid application to the skin and relatively rapid non-greasy drying of the applied product; is this a deal with the devil? I don&#x27;t know the answer but I am concerned. On a more mundane level: The price at Amazon was good compared to what was available locally or online. The Cetaphil bottle is short and squat so less tippy. On the other hand, the narrow spout is less appealing than the long broad spout of Eucerin, especially for covering large areas of skin. Now if only the Eucerin Plus didn&#x27;t have isohexadecane et al. I wish there was an insistence by drug makers to find more straightforward solutions to compounding issues.</li>
    <li> Odorless. Very smooth. Works great. Dermatologist recommended. Good price for the volume you get.</li>
    <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :) although I will say the product is really greasy and not as thick as I would have hoped for.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Cetaphil moisturizer, I recommend for dry skin, it leaves very soft. great for skin damaged by wind or cold.</li>
    <li> I use this cream long time ago and my dothers (4 and 5 years old) too. They are so alergics and this cream always be perfect for them.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great if you don&#x27;t wear makeup, but if you do wear make up I would not recommend. It doesn&#x27;t remove make up at all, just smudges it around and then you have to wipe it off with your towel (which is bad for your skin). I prefer a cleanser that gets makeup off WHILE I&#x27;m washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t wear makeup, this is great. Doesn&#x27;t try my skin out at all.</li>
    <li> Great product- very easy to absorb; great for my toddler and whole family.</li>
    <li> This absorbs quickly which wasn&#x27;t expected as most creams/lotions for dry sensitive skin don&#x27;t. I use it on my whole body including my face. It took about 2 weeks to start working. I&#x27;m really happy with this product it&#x27;s much better than the cream which was also good but not as moisturising. I have combo facial skin and the lotion didn&#x27;t irritate at all! Very happy with the shipping from amazon products always arrive a little earlier than expected 😊</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry skin, in the winter it&#x27;s even worse, and this stuff is fabulous! I use it all over, even on my face, and it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to breakout at all. And a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for nearly a week to see if it grew on me, but to no avail. For something touted as the opposite, this expensive product actually turned out to be quite a greasy lotion. It makes my hands and face feel sticky and dirty; more often than not I ended up having to wash it off and use something less stifling. I definitely would not recommend using this product before bed as you will find yourself sticking uncomfortably to your linens.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my baby per her pediatrician&#x27;s recommendation. It works great. It has minimal scent and what you can smell is light and non-chemically. I will continue to use this lotion on my child&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema for most of my life and this lotion is the best - it&#x27;s fragrance free and it&#x27;s ultra hydrating which keeps my skin moist so I don&#x27;t dry out and start itching.  I use it right after I get out of the shower for extra moisture and it works like a charm.  This is the only lotion I use and buy.</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry but this is too sticky for me.  I really like the cetaphil cream in the jar.  It is even great for my face. Absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I use this product on a daily basis.. I keep one bottle at home and one at work.&lt;br /&gt;I find Cetaphil extremely gentle and very light on the skin. Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;it for anyone with very sensitive skin like i have. It quickly soothes when required&lt;br /&gt;and as someone who regularly wears gloves at work i recommend applying some&lt;br /&gt;on the hands before putting gloves on and if needed afterwards. A little goes a&lt;br /&gt;long way. It is hard to compare this brand to others as it has no real competitors&lt;br /&gt;in its section of the market. With no fragrance added, excellent moisturising&lt;br /&gt;properties, non-greasy and long protection it is the ideal product for all dry&lt;br /&gt;skinned individuals</li>
    <li> This is a known product that I like it! Its a good lotion for body in a not so high price. The products arrive so fast!!,</li>
    <li> I have no scientific evidence to present, I can only say that this is my all time favorite skin lotion.  It applies well and comfortably with no greasy feeling and no discomfort.  It does leave my skin feeling moisturized and smooth.</li>
    <li> Rich lotion and the skin responded well. I recommend this product for older and problem skin. Clearing up the current problems with the skin.</li>
    <li> There is no better product for those who have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and want to protect yourself, this is the best product there is.&lt;br /&gt;Just apply a small amount of product, spread evenly throughout the skin, the product will actually stay on your skin for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on irritated skin, Cetaphil will bring a great sense of relief and freshness.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Marcelo from Brazil.</li>
    <li> Love it, save my super dry skin.Thank God. I use it after Weleda Sea Buckthorn Body Oil, and the result is good.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Use it all the time/great price/lock and load on any price drops</li>
    <li> I really is what I expected</li>
    <li> moisturizes well enough but leaves the skin very oily, like most of the lotion just sits on the surface, and I have extremely dry skin in the winter months. I tried using less, down to a pea size, and the result is still the same. After 2 days of using, I started getting little whiteheads around the mouth and forehead area. Would not recommend or use again.</li>
    <li> This might be a very good product, but read the ingrediants carefully. The lotion is made with macadamia nut oil, which could cause significant problems for those who are allergic to nuts. Be careful.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I am trying this lotion. I am very impressed with how it works. I read a review that recommended it and I am not disappointed. It makes my skin feel great and is not greasy. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for oily skin out there</li>
    <li> my favourite lotion, keeps my skin moisturised without the greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> A good body lotion, to me, is one that provides the maximum moisturizing without being too greasy or sticky, and that does not sting when applied to dry skin</li>
    <li> Not as good as the regular moisturizing lotion from Cetaphil.  I&#x27;m going back to that one because it feels and works better and lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Does work well.  Just like the Doctor said, and it seems to last longer on the skin too.  It does cost a little more, but  Amazon&#x27;s price is better then the stores.</li>
    <li> Very very excellent product and this size is a great value for money! I recommend this product for everyone...you will not regret.</li>
    <li> The lotion is fine and does the job, but the container is so badly made that the blue dispenser cap broke right away and can&#x27;t be used.  So I have to take off the cape and shake the bottle to get any.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have found so far for sensitive skin. It was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad they did! It does not have any irritating effects that some of the other lotions can cause.</li>
    <li> My mom is going through chemo therapy and her skin is very dry... this is the recommended lotion by her doctor.</li>
    <li> One of the cetaphil lotions I use everyday. Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I love it, thank you!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this during a hospital stay.  Now I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  It is very good for whole body moisture without being thick and sticky and lasts all day unless you wash it off.  I use it on my face as well.  This one is my favorite.  The others for normal, etc are also good though.</li>
    <li> tis lotion use full for me.</li>
    <li> terrific for dry heels</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought this because I thought I was buying the Cetaphil face wash, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. I use this for my two-year-old daughter&#x27;s skin. She gets eczema outbreaks somewhat frequently, and unlike lotions with fragrances that contain alcohol and sting when you rub them on, this lotion is very soothing and does a great job moisturizing her baby skin. It also is better than other lotions in that it&#x27;s not so viscous that you feel like you have to wash your hands afterward to remove the excess from between your fingers. Five stars, and I would recommend this for anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Recommended by M.D. for Edema in my 89 yr. old mother in laws&#x27; legs. Helps keep skin moist and isn&#x27;t greasy (something she really objects to!).  Since this lotion is working so well for her, I&#x27;ve put it on &amp;#34;auto order&amp;#34; so she doesn&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I have severely dry skin on my hands that has lead to peeling and tiny bumps. I have no idea what the cause is. This lotion is nice without being too greasy. I will update to see if the condition has cleared when the bottle is done.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, because is like medicines for me. But is very good for hidrate deeply the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. No smell, washes off with water, not sticky, last a long time and does the job. I use it over a skin transplant and the doctor who checks it yearly (now 5 years), thinks it is better than any other product I was told originally to use. Not the cheapest, just the best.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my teenage son, he has been having problems with acne and dry skin. I couldn&#x27;t find a combo or good cleanser for both this works great and even got the face wash. We even went to a dermatologist and he recommend this!! Works great and come in a two pack!!</li>
    <li> I just realized that I have sensitive skin and therefore came across this product from a dermatologist and so far it&#x27;s a great product, it moisturizes all day and it is to the point all family members have begun using this lotion for daily usage.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Lasts long but I wish it had some fragrance, it&#x27;s hard to get used a cream that has no fragrance.</li>
    <li> I just receive the product. I didtn use it yet but I have very good recommendations about it. I receive it in time and perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for many years and is the only one that works for me. I have always had very dry flaky skin. I&#x27;ve tried numerous other lotions that just don&#x27;t work. I also use this on my face which, again, is the only moisturizer that will keep my skin hydrated. Also helps my acne.</li>
    <li> excellent product for dry skin &amp; sensitive skin. I use it daily &amp; have reordered many times.</li>
    <li> This is the best option for dry skin. It leaves the skin so soft all day, and it doesn&#x27;t leaves greasy sensation!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my first time using Cetaphil products, but it was my first time buying it online. Strangely, when I applied it to my hands and face, it burned and got very red. I stopped using it for a few days after that, and tried it again in small amounts, and it was just okay. I don&#x27;t really use it for my face anymore, but moreso just for my body extremities.</li>
    <li> Ultra necessary on the everyday life</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has really helped me since I moved to a cold city. The weather made my skin look like a cocodrile, no product worked until my doctor recommended this. I love it and now my whole family uses it.</li>
    <li> been using this for many years, and amazon offers a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for my wife and daughters.&lt;br /&gt;They use everyday.</li>
    <li> excelente product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema for years and the winters of Nebraska are especially hard on my skin. I used this lotion on the patchy dry areas around my mid-section for about 7 days and I now feel like a normal person. I have begun using this for everything from my extremely dry feet to my scaly elbows and it has gotten rid of all of the dry itchy areas in as little as a week. I know longer walk around scratching my stomach nor do I feel the burning pain of dry skin. For suffers of eczema and dry skin, buy this now!</li>
    <li> Or it gets the hose again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item as order and received in a good time frame.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really does work as well as they claim.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy the cheap stuff with fancy smells and odd claims.  Get the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Fits in basket nicely and doesn&#x27;t fall out on the way down.</li>
    <li> great price product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, gives extra moisture and no heavy smell ! Excellent!</li>
    <li> هذا أفضل لوشن استخدمته ونفع لجفاف السعودية&lt;br /&gt;مرطب جميل جدا وأنصح بالأدفانس&lt;br /&gt;سعر مغري مع الشحن المباشر&lt;br /&gt;وصلى الله على محمد</li>
    <li> This lotion works really well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use it every day.  Why does my review have to be 20 words?  It&#x27;s lotion.  And I like it.</li>
    <li> Has helped my dry skin better than anything else I used</li>
    <li> creme altamente hidratante para peles secas ou para quem tem dermatite atópica , pode-se passar no local das dermatites ate 3 vezes por dia.</li>
    <li> I really like using this for my body. I DON&#x27;T like using it for my face or over wet skin, it has a flimy suffocating feel if applied too soon after the shower. Dependably doesn&#x27;t make my skin *worse*. If anything, I would say Its annoying how much my thirsty skin needs more reapplications of product. I like it</li>
    <li> MY SISTER SWEARS BY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion daily for about 2 weeks now and I really like it.  I apply it to my back, arms, and legs.  I put it on after my shower, and don&#x27;t apply anymore until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes one smoothy and absorbs quickly, leaving your skin moisturized without being sticky.  It is also fragrance free so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a floral bouquet or medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive dry skin and I have not had any adverse reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like is that the pump does not have long travel, so each pump only puts out a modest amount of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My spouse says this is the same lotion that they use at the hospital where he works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t even have to use the cleanser to use this because it&#x27;s a great moisturizer to use after you wash your face using anything. The shipping came as expected and I&#x27;m soooo happy.</li>
    <li> Recommended brand by our dermatologist.  (He recommends three applications daily for sun-damaged skin.)  I apply it twice daily to my forearms where I have wintertime eruptions due to past sun damage.</li>
    <li> Not as hydrating as I expected. I found it stins my skin slightly. I also get slightly oily with it. Maybe it&#x27;s not good for face? I also used it on my body. It seems to be great as a body lotion.</li>
    <li> good product for very dry skin and better than other products i&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> it serves his purpose, but I have to use it twice a day</li>
    <li> Cetaphil properly moisturizes my extremely dry skin. The lotion has a very good consistency, unlike other similar products, and (very important!) doesn&#x27;t have any perfume.</li>
    <li> I think it works well with people with eczema</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin - this lotion is nice, effective, and gentle</li>
    <li> My baby has eczema this is amazing for her skin definetly recommend if baby has skin sensitivity or other skin issues</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive skin. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> great for the winter for hands</li>
    <li> Unlike some other Cetaphil skin products, there are Parabens AND Masking Fragrance in Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion for Dry Senstive Skin. There are many people who strive to avoid such substances. Cancelled the Daily Advance Lotion from my subscription order in favor of Cetaphil Restoraderm Eczema Calming Body Moisturizer, which contains no Parabens or Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who might find it helpful. I did some research ahead of shopping for a new skin lotion and found this guidance: \\&quot;Check labels for lactic acid, methylparaben, farnesol, and retinyl palmitate. Exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic acid can be irritating and increase UV sensitivity. Some parabens are preservatives that can mimic the effects of estrogen. Research has detected parabens in breast tumors. Farnesol is a fragrance ingredient identified as an allergen by the European Union. It&#x27;s in Cetaphil, which is labeled as fragrance free. A Cetaphil customer-service representative says the chemical acts as a preservative. Retinyl palmitate has been linked to an increased risk of skin cancer in animal studies, and it can convert to retinoids, associated with a risk of birth defects.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY this product. It&#x27;s truly awful. To describe it as \\&quot;extremely greasy\\&quot; is an under-exaggeration. I felt like I had just applied sunscreen lotion after using it. It sits atop your skin and never adsorbs, my skin felt greasy and disgusting until I finally broke down and took a second shower for the day.</li>
    <li> This is one product that can be used all over the body, including the face.  Absorbs nicely and does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Hidrata muy bien la piel de mi hija excelente.&lt;br /&gt;Para piel ultra reseca lo recomiendo.&lt;br /&gt;F&amp;aacute;cil aplicar&lt;br /&gt;Buena presentaci&amp;oacute;n&lt;br /&gt;No queda grasosa la piel.</li>
    <li> Cost-effective, not enough moisture in winter</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because it is very hydrating and it is not greasy at all.  Great to use for dry skin during winter months!</li>
    <li> I tend to suffer from dry skin in the winter, when the heat comes on indoors and dries out the air. I try to make up for the lack of indoor humidity in my apartment with a humidifier, but I&#x27;m not always in my apartment, and somehow, humidifier or not, winter is still the season I get the itchies all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate in moisturizing is to take a very heavy, greasy cream like plain petroleum jelly and apply it just after a hot shower. But that has its problems; it sticks to your clothing, and in areas where I am prone to acne, such as my thighs, upper back, and face, it tends to exacerbate that problem. Better to use a good body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good body lotion, to me, is one that provides the maximum moisturizing without being too greasy or sticky, and that does not sting when applied to dry skin. Also, I prefer for body lotion not to have fancy fragrances; a simple fragrance of one or two essential oils is nice, but I dislike products with complex perfumes in them, and the more ingredients in the perfume, the more likely you might be allergic to one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil has no fragrance whatsoever. It does not sting at all. It&#x27;s rather greasy when it goes on, but it&#x27;s absorbed in the skin extremely quickly. I rub it all over my body, and a minute later it&#x27;s already absorbed so much that I can put on my clothes without them sticking to the lotion anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion works. Obviously, no body lotion is going to relieve dry skin immediately and completely. You have to apply it frequently over some period of time for the skin to regain its natural level of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary: short of the aforementioned heavy occlusive moisturizers, like petroleum jelly, or products that are actually medicated with antipruritics like sulfur, a quality body lotion is the best solution for an itchy, dry skin. And this is a reasonably priced example of a quality body lotion.</li>
    <li> Although the lotion is very moisturizing, I&#x27;ve found it to be very sticky once it&#x27;s on my skin and it remains that way for hours.</li>
    <li> I recommended to everybody to buy it . It is one the best lotion I have ever had.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD, GENTLE AND MOISTURIZING. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.&lt;br /&gt;IN MY SEARCH FOR A PARABENS FREE LOTION, I&#x27;VE TRIED ALMOST ALL DRUGSTORE BRANDS, ORGANIC LOTIONS ETC.&lt;br /&gt;BUT CETAPHIL ULTRA HYDRATING IS THE BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TAKES A LITTLE AND REASONABLE TIME TO ABSORB AND ONE IT IS, IT FEELS VERY LIGHT ON SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;WITH REGULAR USE IT HAS VANISHED MY LEGS \\&quot;SCALES\\&quot; (SOMETHING THAT MANY LOTIONS COULD NOT DO)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular one has parabens, only this line does not.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A KEEPER!!!!</li>
    <li> It feel very nice, and friendy useful.  Sutiable in four seasons apply.  If feel so smooth and moisturing, is the good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff made me break out really bad,I had to go to the doctors because of how bad it was, I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone,</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my skin really soft, it&#x27;s the only lotion I use</li>
    <li> Introduced to this lotion just this past month and ordered it.  My skin has never felt better!  Lanolin free - great for sensitive skin.</li>
</ol>
