<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Im 61 and have been using these for over 15 years people wonder why I look 45!  This is why!</li>
    <li> Wish they could be bought locally again. They went missing a few years ago and this was the only place I can find them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Buf Puf but I can&#x27;t locate them in my area.  I exfoliate almost everyday.  They are strong enough to exfoliate but not too harsh to irritate.</li>
    <li> I have used these for several years.  They are convenient, since they are disposable.  I find that the normal to dry skin variety does NOT dry out my skin, so I would recommend that type for those with dryer skin.  Leaves the skin smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> As always they are excellent! Too bad I have to order online as no stores in my area carry them anymore.</li>
    <li> No motor necessary to get the dead skin off your face.  These work great.</li>
    <li> I bought these singles through amazon because its hard to find them at the local stores and if you do find a store that carries the singles its much more expensive than through amazon.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for Amazon. These single-use pads are convenient and disposable - and not available in stores any more! So order the 6-pack from Amazon, get free shipping and it&#x27;s a good value. They work great!</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon for offering the Buf Pufs!  I am a 68 year old woman with beautiful skin, thanks to Buf Pufs.  I have used them for several decades.  I can&#x27;t believe they can&#x27;t be bought in stores anymore.  I guess the reason is they are inexpensive and the stores would rather sell expensive products and make big profits.   Thans again Amazon!  Pat  Oklahoma USA</li>
    <li> I have used this product over twenty years, I have tried cheaper versions and I always return to this product. I only clean my face with these sponges, My skin is beautiful, I am over sixty  years old with no wrinklesor pimples.I have been asked over the years what products I use to clean my face.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I have beautiful skin because I scrub with these every night before I go to bed.  I have done so for 20+ years.  I&#x27;ve had two doctors and three nurses notice how nice my skin is.  And I&#x27;m 66!</li>
    <li> I have been using these pads for years. Great for exfoliating!  I recommend them to all. Great for a few washing a.</li>
    <li> I used these pads years ago but had forgotten about them.  If you want a product that exfoliates your face this is the one.  My friends are asking me what I&#x27;m doing different.  Makes my skin look so much better.</li>
    <li> These sponges are great!  Best kept beauty secret!  I think after using these a few days my face looks better than if I&#x27;d gotten an expensive facial.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of these disposable exfoliating pads. Use it and throw it away.  No worry about bacterial contamination or build-up.  They are scrubby enough to remove dead skin cells and other surface debris. I use every other day which seems to help prevent acne and provide a smooth surface for makeup or tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The local Walmart and drug stores stopped carrying these, so I order in bulk through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these little cleanser-packed single scrubbers for many years, and I have good skin. They&#x27;re handy to travel with, especially with the liquid limitations for airline travel. They remove makeup and scrub the skin perfectly. I use the normal-to-dry which does a remarkable job. Oddly enough, local stores have stopped carrying them, so Amazon is one of the few places I&#x27;ve been able to find them. I hope they never stop making them!</li>
    <li> These are no longer in stores and their more expensive on other websites. The only minus is you have to spend more up front because it&#x27;s a bulk order, which is fine by me</li>
    <li> I have used these for years. I use some gentle cleanser from neutagena and it appears to do the trick.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t be without these. One can last almost a week if you use your own cleanser. Much better than a wash cloth or just your hands, GENTLY cleans, and exfoliates.</li>
    <li> Easy to carry with me.  Great for a quick face wash and buff.  I always like how my face feels after I use a Buf-Puf. So smooth.</li>
    <li> Got this because I use to use the larger version years ago and loved it.  For some reason the smaller singer use ones are not as great, but my children like them.  On a scale of one to ten, i&#x27;d give it a 5 for buying it again for myself, for my kids I&#x27;d give it a rating of 7.</li>
    <li> Nice exfoliation without the grit to rinse away when you&#x27;re giving your face a quick scrub over the sink. Like&#x27;em</li>
    <li> I love them..have used them for years..I order on line getting 6 box&#x27;s aprox. twice a year. It clenses my face and exfolicates&lt;br /&gt;all in one. I&#x27;m 89 yrs. skin is soft and not many wrinkles.  Exfolicating each day with Buff Puffs is my answer.</li>
    <li> excellent product couldn&#x27;t find online at Ulta anymore</li>
    <li> Because of the price, they really should be a 4 star - but they are so great I couldn&#x27;t deduct for price.  They foam up really well, I can use the normal to oily when feeling oily or it&#x27;s humid or whatever, and I use the normal to dry when my skin is dry or I&#x27;ve been sitting in the sun, or my skin is extra sensitive that day.  I have very sensitive skin as it is and am always hesitant to use new soap products that are not marked \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; etc.  These are always great - especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. They are very quick to use in the shower or before bed.  I have never used them to remove makeup  -but I don&#x27;t think they would be big enough for that, even though they foam up well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and when I ran out of it there weren&#x27;t anymore to be found throughout the stores I have to visited. The only way to buy this product now for me is online and I chose \\&quot;AMAZON\\&quot;. I love the exfoliating cleansing little pads, it keeps your skin looking young. It is best to use it once a week if you do not wear makeup which I don&#x27;t except for a moisturizer. It helps to clear away the dirt that is in air from out doors. I feel that using the product everyday is not good for the skin, you don&#x27;t want to strip away the natural oils on a daily basis. If you do use it everyday always, always use a moisturizer after. This product has no perfume scent which is excellent, because some people skins are sensitive like mine. All in all this product is wonderful and it gets my highest rating.</li>
    <li> I love love my buff puffs. They are an absolute must. Its a shame i cant find them in stores anymore but i can always count on Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these small sponges for years to clean and exfoliate my skin. I have my family using it also. It helps control ache, leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. And, I love that I can use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have been using  buf-pufs for a number of years  and I really love the way it exfoliates without being too harsh</li>
    <li> I used to use buff puffs many years ago but had switched to other products.  I&#x27;m now back to using buff puffs regularly and love the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using these and full-sized Buf-Pufs for decades.  They work as well as expensive dermabrasion creams and don&#x27;t cause allergic reactions on my sensitive skin.  I use these single-use scrubs when traveling.  They work well cleaning and scrubbing my face in the shower.  They are very lightweight and are much easier than bringing separate soap and scrubbers.  Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Use these all the time. great for daily use and easy for traveling.  The singles are nice vs the reusable. This was a great value also.</li>
    <li> These sponges are very small and thin making them hard to grasp.  There is no way to hold them where they won&#x27;t bunch up...very frustrating.  Although difficult to use I found they did cleanse and exfoliate my skin.</li>
    <li> I used these in the past and couldn&#x27;t find them anymore in the stores. When I found them on Amazon I was thrilled! I live in Florida and often have dry skin on my face from sun saltwater, these are perfect to scrub it away and leave soft and clean skin!</li>
    <li> Been using these for over 30 years and I always get compliments on my skin. Instead of discarding after one use, I use it one more time with another foaming cleanser to get more bang for the buck. And purchasing this bulk pack will get you the best price per unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Benn buying these for years at Ultra but they don&#x27;t carry them anymore.  I contacted their main office to ask why, when it was so often sold out at their stores.  Yes, they said, we know, but we can&#x27;t get enough of them on a regular basis.  Oh!  So I bought several boxes at Amazon.  I use these puffs in the shower, first on my face, then my body, especially legs that get dry in the winter.  Love that I can just throw them away after, and they don&#x27;t have those harmful plastic particles.</li>
    <li> I am 45 and used this product throughout my teens to keep my skin clean, clear &amp; blemish free. Cannot find in stores and buy @ Amazon for my 3 teens who also have clean, clear, blemish free skin. Their dad had/has very difficult skin so I worried they would experience problems during the teen years. It seems the Buf Puf has held the worst at bay.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND IT IS A GREAT WAY TO SCRUB YOUR FACE. THEY ARE ALSO SO CONVENIENT TO TRAVEL WITH. I CANNOT FIND THEM IN STORES ANYMORE SO I EXCLUSIVELY ORDER THEM FROM AMAZON. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THAT THEY SOMETIMES LEAVE THE PINK COLOR ON THE BATHTUB.</li>
    <li> Although I do not have sensitive skin at all these buffs really hurt my face.  I&#x27;ve never used anything that actually feels like it&#x27;s scratching my skin. Too bad I bought so many.  But they do work well cleaning my sink.</li>
    <li> I ordered four boxes of these puffs and shared with my daughters and granddaughter.  I am now down to my last box.  We all love these sponges with soap already in them.  Perfect after a long day for a no-fuss cleaning and off to bed.</li>
    <li> received boxes on time and buf puf sponges were not damaged, but box ends were a little crushed.  Had this review posted.  Seller contacted me and asked that if I remove the review, that they would send me two more boxes of the buf pufs.  I removed the review, but the boxes never came.  I sent a message to the seller letting them know the boxes never came, but received no response.  I contacted Amazon and they said that merchants were not supposed to ask people to remove reviews.  They said they would handle it from there.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  I couldn&#x27;t find product locally, I&#x27;m so glad I found it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect for exfoliating daily</li>
    <li> Love these for exfoliating in the shower with facial scrub.  I have been using these for years.</li>
    <li> The sponges are very soft and cleans out my pores very well. The downside is you must use moisturizer but not a lot.</li>
    <li> I use one for a week before getting a new one out of the box.  I simply use them with Dove soap to wash my face every night and rinse out the pad for use the next day.  A box lasts me a very long time.  Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> I just recently started to use them. I run them under water to get the cleanser that comes with it off (only take a few seconds) I add my Clinique liquid soap (step 1) and pat-dry. My skin is so smooth and feels primed for my Clinique clarifying toner (step 2) I love these buf-puf</li>
    <li> Gets rid of dry skin - use them a couple of days per week otherwise would be irritating to your skin. Never had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- get rid of dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Con- irritates your skin if used daily</li>
    <li> I have been using But - Puf products over 30 years to cleanse and exfoliate my face and neck.  It has kept my skin fresh and glowing so much that people always think I&#x27;m in my 40 &#x27; s but I&#x27;m in my middle 50&#x27;s.  I tell everyone at every age to use these (or the larger size with your own favorite cleanser).</li>
    <li> always cleans your face/pores well.  A great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I have used one of these on my face once a week, or so for years. The cleanser is gentle enough for my sensitive skin and the buf-puf part is great for exfoliating. Moisten your skin, not the pad, so the cleanser doesn&#x27;t wash out too soon. Then, use gently all over your skin. I use one on my face, then down my neck and shoulders.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Buf Puf singles for a long time but they are getting harder to find in stores so I ordered them in bulk on line.  I use two pads together and reuse them with Neutrogena products for a week or so at a time.</li>
    <li> I already had these for my body but was reluctant to try them on my extra sensitive skin.  However, they are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought these sponges to use as part of my daily skincare routine in the hopes of clearing up some mild but stubborn acne on my forehead. At first I was happy with them because they left my skin feeling refreshed and didn&#x27;t dry my face out, but within a week I started breaking out all over, even in places where I&#x27;ve never had acne before like my cheeks and chin. Needless to say I will not be continuing to use this product. I can&#x27;t believe I spent over $20 on this!</li>
    <li> They are so good. I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. They exfoliate well and are convenient for travel. Sometimes I wash the soap off first and just use these to exfoliate with a different cleanser.</li>
    <li> Have used for many years.  Makes my skin feel rejuvenated and tingly.  Scrubs off flakley particles of skin and gives me a glow.</li>
    <li> I love Buf-Puf Singles.  I have been using them for over 20 years and can&#x27;t imagine my morning routine without them!.  I get many compliments on how nice my skin is and I believe this is because I use Buf-Puf singles!  They aren&#x27;t available in any of the stores in the small town where I live so I am grateful that I can order them from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Have used these for years and years, but have trouble finding them in local stores anymore. Great product for a quick refresher and easy to carry in my purse anywhere I go.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years.  After I married my husband started to use these also.  This is the only place I can find these.  Please do not stop carrying.</li>
    <li> I had used these for years, but couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anymore. I use them with my own cleanser and they exfoliate and deep clean my face better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I usually use each one 2 or 3  times; and I&#x27;m careful to rub gently and let the sponge do the work (pressing too hard can make tiny abrasions in your skin). I travel a lot, and these are so easy to throw in my bag.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this product daily. I highly recommend this product for all types (oily, normal &amp; dry) of skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing results after just a few uses. She states the skin feels alive and fresh, She use them everyday, or as often as I can and like the results you get.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without these and this is the only place I found them.  Stores in my area just don&#x27;t sell them anymore. Love them!</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for many years and been very satisfied with it so I was disappointed when I was told that the stores were no longer carrying it.  Thank you very much for having it available.</li>
    <li> I am happy they still make these.  I used to use these sponges, and hardly find them on the shelves anymore. (which is sad)... I love these...they are also great for traveling (because they are transported dry)...and great for young teens or pre-teens in my opinion.  I am happy I found them again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I keep it by the shower and quickly cleanse my face while I take my shower.  It could use a bit more cleanser, but even so, it cleans nicely.</li>
    <li> Some years ago I was reading a magazine that did a piece on celebrities&#x27; favorite beauty secrets. A famous female with glorious skin said she couldn&#x27;t do without Buf-Pufs. I tried them and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I am middle-aged and my fair skin is glowing and firm, thanks to Buf-Pufs.  People are always surprised to learn my age and think I&#x27;m much younger. I occasionally use Buf-Pufs on my neck and upper chest area. Success! I even use Buf-Pufs gently on my lips in winter if they get dry and chapped. They instantly get rid of the flakiness, so combined with lip moisturizer, it is a quick repair. I have trouble finding them in stores and I&#x27;m so glad they are available through Amazon. I stock up.</li>
    <li> I love these have used them for years, they became very scarce on the West Coast I was extremely happy when I found amazon carried them I would highly recommend them for any age</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been years since I could find Buf-Puf single facial sponges,&lt;br /&gt;and I remember them as being a little larger and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;These do a decent job, but being smaller and thinner are a&lt;br /&gt;little less easy to use.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Exfoliates just right without hurting your skin.</li>
    <li> Use with a creamy cleanser and exfoliate quickly and easily anywhere n body.v</li>
    <li> Just As Advertised! Super FaSt Delivery!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;d heard of the Clair-sonic thing but didn&#x27;t want to spring for that.&lt;br /&gt;I divided this mutli-pack up between my daughter&#x27;s and my bathroom, and we each use a sponge when we remember.  They work just great and are a great value.</li>
    <li> I have been using these faithfully for probably more than 15 years - Amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> These are great for acne prone skin.  Purchase for granddaughters by 1/2 dozen.  They love them.  Use once week, twice weekly if acne breakout.</li>
    <li> Love these things.  Used them years ago in college and got so many compliments on my skin.  They scrub off all the dirt and makeup along with the dull dead skin cells that make me look wrinkly and old. Don&#x27;t even need to use other soap with them, and they are super sanitary since they&#x27;re disposable.  This is a must-have!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore, happy to get them here in a six pack no less. very good price, and does a great job exfoliating along with my apricot scrub</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m retirement age and have been using them for 15 years.  They keep my skin clean and invigorated.&lt;br /&gt;Try them, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
