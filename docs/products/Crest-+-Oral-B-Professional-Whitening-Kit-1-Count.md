      <li>/&gt;The biggest and most important part of this package is the included Oral-B Professional Precision 4000 Electric Toothbrush ... which I can honestly say is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used ... better than my Sonicare toothbrush that I used to think was the best toothbrush in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This crestless Oral-B professional whitening kit is fantastic!  It comes in a nice little bag with the tag easy for you right at two from if you&#x27;re giving it as a gift;  it comes with a high-end Oral-B professional toothbrush with three different heads as well as crest whitening strips available only from a professional dentist, crest whitening toothpaste and crest whitening mouthwash.  The professional electronic toothbrush is practically worth the money alone... I use this kid with great results not only do my teeth look wider but they also feel cleaner and it was definitely lifting surface stains from my teeth!  Not only does this kit work but I believe it is a good value for the money I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> The Crest + Oral-B Professional Whitening Kit has everything you need to get your teeth their whitest and brightest.  The only thing missing is sunglasses to hand out to people before you smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day, I used the toothbrush for two minutes at the default speed. There are 4 different modes, or or vibrating speeds that you can choose by pushing the button on the front of the brush. Next, I rinsed with the Whitening Glamorous White Rinse for 30 seconds.  Finally, I applied the whitening strips on my upper and lower teeth for one hour, as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I removed the strips and rinsed my mouth with water, my teeth were noticeably whiter!  I was very impressed.  I have since done the described routine 2 more times and each time, my teeth have whitened, although not as much as after the first time.  I have 11 more daily strips left so I am excited to see how white my teeth will get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says to do this routine daily but my teeth are very sensitive so I only do the whitening strips every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $131.20, this is a very inexpensive way to get your teeth whiter.  Whitening performed by a dentist could cost at least $200-$300 and may require more than one visit. The convenience of doing this at home along with the price makes this a 5 star product!</li>
    <li> I give the Whitening Kit four stars because it worked as advertised- my teeth were noticeably whiter after application.  The MSRP of the kit value is also less than the sum of the retail values of the individual parts.  I&#x27;ve deducted one star because it caused tooth pain during usage.  Additionally, only a few elements of the kit are actually needed for whitened teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a few thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Oral-B 4000 took somewhere between 24-48 hours to get a full charge!&lt;br /&gt;  * I liked the brushing feature wherein the toothbrush stops during operation to remind you to switch quadrants.&lt;br /&gt;  * Nice of them to include two extra brushing tips in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The white strips worked noticeably better than the ones I last used.  They&#x27;re a neater affair these days.&lt;br /&gt;  * I no longer foamed at the mouth and took on the appearance of a rabid dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You can probably achieve just as good (and cheaper!) results using only the white strips and the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************************&lt;br /&gt;USAGE LOG:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: I&#x27;m not a heavy coffee or tea drinker, but I did have some yellow stains on the lower portions of my teeth.  Started the kit in earnest, although I decided not to use the white rinse because I didn&#x27;t like the after-taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: My teeth were already one shade whiter!  However, the Oral-B 4000 was causing tooth-root-pain so I switched to manual brushing with the whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days 3 - 12: Used the white strips/manual brushing + whitening toothpaste.  Very pleased with the results.  Mild, but tolerable tooth pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a break for Halloween and consumed candy which may have set back some of my whitening progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days 13 - 14: Teeth look much whiter.  Even the hard-to-reach-side-teeth look brighter as well, due wholly to the whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: I think the entire kit is unnecessary.  It certainly worked as advertised, but you can achieve the same results with just the whitening strips + whitening toothpaste, without the whitening rinse and electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> As a coffee-drinker, I&#x27;m constantly looking for whitening treatments that work, yet don&#x27;t cost too much money. I get free whitening from my dentist that doesn&#x27;t whiten my teeth evenly, and I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s hurting my enamel. This kit claims it&#x27;s safe for your enamel. And it works great. The kit comes in a handy bag that fits all the products. The kit also includes two whitening toothpastes, an electronic toothbrush with 3 different replaceable heads (and a base to hold the extras), and a pack of 14-day whitening strips. I love the whitestrips - they certainly work. Though, as a coffee drinker, it&#x27;s a constant process. So I really appreciated the electric toothbrush and whitening toothpaste. The settings are very handy, and it works extremely well. I&#x27;ll be getting a LOT of use out of this kit.</li>
    <li> I primarily got this product because of the advertised \\&quot;professional\\&quot; grade of this kit. I&#x27;m interested on whitening my teeth as any other coffee drinker, but I&#x27;m most interested on preserving the health of my gums. So a professional kit like this seemed like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, this is what is included:&lt;br /&gt;1. Oral-B Professional Precision 4000 Electric Toothbrush with 3 brush head refills (1 Pro White, 1 Precision Clean and 1 Deep Sweep)&lt;br /&gt;2. Crest 3D White Luxe Glamorous White Vibrant Mint Toothpaste (4.1oz),&lt;br /&gt;3. Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Glamourous White Rinse (237mL) and&lt;br /&gt;4. Crest 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal Professional Supreme (14 count)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these come in a small tote (11.5\\&quot; x 4.5\\&quot; x 10\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Precision 4000 includes a manual, a recharging base with holder for 3 brush head refills and a sturdy travel case which can hold two brush head refills. The travel case is nice but this toothbrush is way too big for traveling already, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last toothbrush was an manual Oral-B CrossAction Pro-Health Toothbrush. I switched to that one from an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush similar to the Oral-B Vitality Pro White, because the health of my teeth were not improving and refills are a bit costly ($30 for 4). I&#x27;m changing back to give this \\&quot;professional quality\\&quot; electric toothbrush a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRECISION 4000, LUXE TOOTHPASTE and WHITE RINSE&lt;br /&gt;Electric toothbrushes pause every 30 seconds, so you know how long have you been brushing per area. However, the Precision 4000 have a few added features that make it nicer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

However, I adjusted my grip and reduced my cleaning to 30 seconds per area (4 areas) and my gums got much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost two weeks of constant use, the Precision 4000 finally ran out of charge.

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the electronic toothbrushes before, but I think that the ones I&#x27;ve reviewed lately have impressed me enough to where I like them more than my water pick that I used. This toothbrush came as a kit, so I had a full line of whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the toothbrush. It came with some extra head pieces so I&#x27;ll have a relatively long time before I have to go out and buy anything to go with this, which I liked. Offhand I&#x27;ll say that this unit didn&#x27;t come charged and it took a long time before the unit could give me an actual two minute brushing rather than just about a minute or so. It takes a super long time to charge, as I left it plugged in for about 8 hours and it still wasn&#x27;t fully charged. That&#x27;s sort of a downfall when it comes to people who want to plug and go as soon as they get this (or take it on a trip right away), but it does mean that when this is fully charged it should last an extremely long time without needing a re-charge. I&#x27;ll have to update more on the life span of the battery. I did like that this felt really good on my teeth and made for a nice clean. One thing I really liked about the newer units was that this toothbrush makes sure that you know when the 30 seconds are up and it&#x27;s time to move to to another spot in your teeth. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste was good and like the previous toothpaste in the other set I reviewed, this looks nice as well as tastes nice and cleans well. Again, I&#x27;m slightly superficial in that I&#x27;d like a toothpaste that looks nice. I&#x27;ll go for quality over style when it comes down to it, but it&#x27;s nice to have something that didn&#x27;t look like mystery gunk. The mouthwash was also nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sort of irritated me were the whitening strips. I&#x27;ll admit that I haven&#x27;t tried any of these since they initially came out over the counter years and years ago, so I was pleased at how these have changed. These strips stay in your mouth very easily and don&#x27;t move unless you plan on doing a lot of talking (they felt slightly loose when I was talking) or unless you don&#x27;t set them properly. I learned that the hard way, but in good news you can fix any loose strips very easily. My only gripe is that these did leave some white spots on my gumline even when I tried to put these on very carefully. They weren&#x27;t permanent, but it was a little irritating. There were also points where I think that the peroxide irritated my gums, but I think that was more of the liner rubbing against them while I talked. It wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker by any means and my gums are a little overly sensitive at times, which I think was the main cause of this. I&#x27;ll probably use these every 2-3 days rather than every day, which will slow down how fast these actually work, but I think it&#x27;d work out better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was pretty impressed by this set. Unlike the other set I reviewed, the cost of everything separately is actually a lot more than what you&#x27;d pay to get this straight out. It&#x27;s still a lot of money, but it&#x27;s worth the investment so far. I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my teeth, but this is really the sort of thing that takes at least a week or two to see any huge differences. I&#x27;ll try to update later on the effectiveness and the battery life.

    <li> I recently received the Crest + Oral-B Professional Whitening Kit for review. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical.  I have done the teeth whitening route at the dentist with the bleaching trays that have to be worn overnight and found them to be not only uncomfortable but of dubious value.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the difference when I used the products supplied in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in this kit:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000&lt;br /&gt;2.  Crest 3D white radiant mint toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;3.  Crest 3D white glamorous white alcohol free multi-care whitening rinse&lt;br /&gt;4.  Crest 3D White Strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to do something a bit unusual here, a detailed review of each product will follow but the bottom line, if you&#x27;re not interested in the details, is that this is a wonderful product and I highly recommend it.  Buy it, try it and you will see (and feel) the amazing results for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush.  I have used an electric toothbrush for years and been happy with it but I didn&#x27;t know how clean my teeth could feel until I used this model. It comes with various heads but I just started with the basic one, the precision clean brush head.  The first time I used it, (with the 3D white toothpaste) I noticed that my teeth felt like I had just had them cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office. Some good features of this toothbrush include: an advanced polishing brush head with indicator bristles that let you know when it&#x27;s time to replace them; a hard brushing alert - a red light flashes; quadrant pacing timer that goes off every 30 seconds, so you can effortlessly get your two minutes of brushing in and 4 brushing modes.  To this basic routine I added the 3D white glamorous white rinse twice a day.  It says to gargle for 60 seconds ( I need to get a little timer). It is pleasant tasting and leaves your mouth feeling very fresh.  I did this routine for two weeks to give these products a fair trial before adding in the whitening strips.  I was very happy with the results. My teeth felt cleaner and looked brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only two days of using the Crest 3D White strips, I noticed a definite whitening of my teeth.  Importantly, you only have to wear them one hour, twice a day, which has been easy to incorporate into my daily routine.  I trimmed the strips slightly on the ends to fit the target area on my teeth. The strips are much easier to tolerate than the bleaching trays and I noticed no stinging sensation at the gumline (as I had with the bleaching trays).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is an excellent product.n the whitening strips.

    <li> This kit was amazing, and I love the white strips. The tooth brush is wonderful and I love the different settings. I use soft mostly because I have horrible gums and don&#x27;t need rough treatment. It brushes nicely and I appreciate how it beeps to let you know to move to another quadrant of your mouth. I have never used an Oral B before, I always had Sonicare and I do like them both. This is lighter and more streamlined than sonicare, not that the other is bad. The one thing I didn&#x27;t like is this has to be plugged directly into a wall outlet. Ugh, I have one in my bathroom but it is not convenient to keep it there. It will not charge through an extension cord. Overall this kit gave you a lot, not just the toothbush so it is a wonderful investment.</li>
    <li> This is a combination pack of top whitening products from Crest and Oral B, in a handy lil’ tote bag like you got something special from your dental health professional. Between the toothpaste and the incredible rechargeable electric toothbrush my teeth have never felt cleaner and smoother. Along with the mouth rinse and the Whitestrips, my teeth have never been whiter and brighter. The Whitestrips  advanced seal technology make them much easier to keep in place for the time you need to make them work properly. Taken all together, this kit is the fastest way to get your whitest, brightest smile, even after years and years of staining your teeth with coffee, tea, and wine, etc.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo27ZTD6IAOR783]]This is a great way to whiten your teeth by a few shades in only two weeks, and it&#x27;s especially good and effective for people who have never whitened their teeth before. It&#x27;s basically these four different products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;Deluxe hydrogen peroxide rinse&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;This was my favorite of all of the products, and I&#x27;m definitely a lifelong customer of this. It&#x27;s the perfect hydrogen peroxide rinse, that foams just the right amount, and it really feels like heaven. It feels like a delightful rainbow of colors on my mouth, cleaning and making everything bright and white. When I opened my eyes after using this, I keep being surprised that this divine liquid is just clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;Bleaching Crest white strips&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never used these before, and these were really cool. These are just two small strips per package, one for the top of your mouth and one for the bottom of your mouth. They&#x27;re very adjustable, so I liked how I could make sure that these got on my teeth, but not my gums, since my teeth are kind of uneven. They&#x27;re really effective at bleaching teeth, too. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that these things really, really stick to your teeth. They&#x27;re almost as bad as biting jolly ranchers. I couldn&#x27;t tell how much teeth whitening was from the bleach in these, and how much teeth whitening was from when I pulled these things off. Maybe it just rips the stains right out of your mouth. Oh, and they only cover about half of my teeth. I guess my front teeth are the most important ones to whiten, but you should know that this won&#x27;t get all of your teeth, and the other products in this pack aren&#x27;t nearly as effective at whitening as these strips are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;Whitening toothpaste&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed like good whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;Super charged, super big electronic toothbrush&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;This is a ginormous electronic toothbrush, that is extremely overpowered. I use it on the gentle setting, and it still brushes way too harshly and vigorously for me. I think I have a drill that has less torque than this toothbrush. For me, it&#x27;s too much, but if you&#x27;ve ever had an electronic toothbrush that you thought was way too weak, then you&#x27;ll probably love this. It comes with three different heads, which are all very cool and technological marvels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I think this is a really good kit, and you&#x27;ll notice a big difference in the whiteness of your teeth. I hope I&#x27;ve given you enough information to know if you should get the kit, or just get some of the components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Toothbrush heads are easy to interchange&lt;br /&gt;+Electronic toothbrush has a lot of power (this might be a con, if you don&#x27;t need this much power)&lt;br /&gt;+Comes with 3 really cool, really deluxe toothbrush heads&lt;br /&gt;+You can easily adjust the white strips so that they hit your teeth and not your gums&lt;br /&gt;+The white strips really work to lighten your teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Electronic toothbrush takes about 24 hours to fully recharge&lt;br /&gt;-The bag is a little flimsy.

    <li> First of all, the kit itself is great. It comes with whitening products as mentioned in the description, all of which are great products. The toothbrush itself is easy to use. The replacement heads pop right on. I really liked the toothbrush head holder as well which is nice if you are using different heads. It&#x27;s easy to put together and clean. What I didn&#x27;t like was the noise the toothbrush made while I was using it. It seemed to rattle my head too much even when I adjusted the settings. It really made me feel dizzy. I have a sonicare toothbrush and that is very quiet with very little rattling. This toothbrush felt like I had a motor in my mouth. Even on the lightest setting, it still bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the rattling, I think the kit is great. It comes in a bag which you can use for other things. It came with several replacement heads. I also really like the toothpaste. The mouthwash is a bit foamy for me, but it does whiten very well. I think if they improved the toothbrush a bit, this would be a 5 star set.</li>
    <li> First off let me say that I got this because my daughter had yellow teeth and she needed something bad!! We got this set and she started useing it as soon as it got here and I must say her teeth look a thousand times better and it was not hard for her to use. She got a new Job at a store and I think it is wonderful at how well it worked here smile is very white and she said the brush does a great job of getting to all the hard spots. this stuff did a great job and she needed lots of help THANKS AMAZON!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect combination to give your image-conscious girl friend that like to keep her teeth as white as those of movie stars.  (But before you give this kit to her make sure she won&#x27;t get offended by thinking that you are judging her yellow teeth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening strips do improve your teeth color within the first few days, but I don&#x27;t see significant improvement after five days of usage.  They are easy to apply, but after three days, my teeth become quite sensitive.  Maybe you can save the other five for future whitening need and use the very convenient white rinse and whitening toothpaste to maintain the whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush (Precision 5000) is great for the entire family.  I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrush for many years and I am glad to see the new models came out better and cheaper.  I also like the smaller charger that takes less space and you can carry with you when traveling, but unless you travel for more than two weeks, you don&#x27;t really need to take your charger with you.  It comes with a convenient travel case also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package is a great deal because it comes with two brush heads, plus my favorite Crest whitening toothpaste, whitening rinse, and, most importantly, whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note:  I accidentally cut the box from the bottom--since it looks similar to the top, except it doesn&#x27;t have the shipping label--with a box cutter, which ended up cutting the bag inside the box.  There is no padding between the bag and the box.  But if you cut the box on the top, you are less likely to touch to bag with your blade.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth care bundle! It has really amazed me. I am a tea drinker, so my teeth are not as white as they could be. Additionally, I have some staining on my front teeth that my doctor told me was the result of medicines I took during my childhood. I did not think these stains would ever be erased.  But since I started using the power tooth brush with Crest&#x27;s whitening toothpaste and mouthwash, my teeth really have gotten several shades whiter.  And the power tooth brush is incredible! My mouth feels like it&#x27;s had a professional cleaning every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I added the whitening strips to my routine I really could see a difference within two days just as it said on the package. I have not yet finished the 14 days but the stains on my teeth are very faint at this point. These products have shown me results beyond my expectations. I received these products through the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review. Honestly this set of products is well worth the money. If nothing else, I would say, do your mouth a favor and buy this power tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Coffee and tea drinkers, this whitening kit&#x27;s for you! In my mid-fifties, and a daily drinker of coffee and tea, my smile had become dingy. I used to be known for having a big, bright smile, but my smiles had grown smaller as my teeth had gotten duller and duller. What a difference the Crest + Oral-B Professional Whitening Kit has made in my appearance. Since I now feel like smiling more, I am getting more smiles in return, and that&#x27;s a great feeling. With the cleaning power of the Oral-B Healthy Clean + Pro White Precision 4000 electronic toothbrush, there&#x27;s no excuse not to have a great smile and healthier teeth and gums. The brush offers 4 cleaning modes: Daily, Deep Clean, Sensitive, and Whitening. There&#x27;s a sensor to let you know if you are brushing too hard, and a timer to let you know when to move to a different section of your mouth. A fully-charged brush should offer up to 10 days of cleaning before it needs a recharge. The Crest 3D White Luxe toothpaste makes your teeth feel so smooth and sparkly-white, and it does contain fluoride. The Crest 3D White \\&quot;Glamorous White\\&quot; Multi-Care Whitening Rinse is alcohol free--YES! It whitens teeth, protects against stains, kills bad-breath germs, and it leaves your mouth feeling minty-fresh. The combination of the awesome electronic brush, the dynamic toothpaste, and the dazzling mouth rinse is a total win-win situation for your smile, your breath, and your personal confidence. The bonus of the 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal, \\&quot;Professional Supreme\\&quot;, is the gold star on top of the tree. After using the brush, the toothpaste, and the rinse, I was feeling pretty good and seeing great results. However, when I tried the strips for just a few days, they amped up the wattage on my smile! I had never used whitening strips before, but these strips were easy and pleasant to use, and they work fast! So now, I have a whiter, brighter, more appealing smile, and my personal confidence has taken a great leap forward. I am encouraged to do more to take care of myself, and to not stop trying to reach out for the brass ring. The fact that all these wonderful products come in a handy tote bag makes it seem like I gave myself a \\&quot;goodie bag\\&quot;, and in reality, I did!ouraged to do more to take care of myself, and to not stop trying to reach out for the brass ring.

    <li> The Crest Oral-B Professional Whitening Kit is a complete package designed to help you with dental hygiene as well as make your teeth look &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; and as white as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest and most important part of this package is the included Oral-B Professional Precision 4000 Electric Toothbrush ... which I can honestly say is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used ... better than my Sonicare toothbrush that I used to think was the best toothbrush in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Precision 4000 brush makes my teeth and gums feel MUCH cleaner than they did with my Sonicare toothbrush and this Oral-B toothbrush also has a pressure sensor that flashes a red light if I&#x27;m pushing too hard when brushing (too much toothbrush pressure can damage your tooth enamel and your gums).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush includes an extra brush head and a travel case so I can bring this awesome toothbrush with me when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also get some great toothpaste, mouthwash, and professional-strength whitening strips to help clean your teeth and gums and make your teeth look extra white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is a great all-in-one solution for keeping your teeth clean and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is like having your personal dentist right there at home. Every brush is now a perfectly clean, mouth-tingling fresh experience. I absolutely love it and probably will never be able to go back to regular brushing. As a side note, I was a very heavy brusher and was inadvertently brushing away my gums from brushing too hard. Now, that is not an issue since simply gliding this brush over my teeth gets them cleaning than my hard brushing ever did. If you want to feel good about your mouth, breath, and smile, definitely consider getting one of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an important aside, the most important thing to consider when buying an electric toothbrush is the cost of replacement heads. Refills for this brush run about $6 apiece.</li>
    <li> The Oral B Crest Complete Whitening Kit is a bundle of decent products designed to get your teeth whiter in as little as two weeks.  Mostly what you are buying is the toothbrush, some extra heads, and whitening strips.  It also has some extras such as a small bottle of mouthwash, some whitening toothpaste, with a small tote bag and a luggage tag? I have a feeling this pack was designed for swag at a dental conference or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;I think the toothbrush is great.  I love that it comes with a travel case where you can also store the extra heads.  I always brush too hard and it has a light I can see in the mirror to notify me when I&#x27;m brushing too hard. The only bad part is that it seems to take awhile to fully charge.  However,  I think you can probably still get several days out of it with regular use before having to recharge, even when only mostly charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening strips:&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Super sticky when applied to dry teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Tough to adhere to moistened teeth.&lt;br /&gt;In short, they will stick well to the upper teeth. With the saliva near your bottom teeth,  you probably want to use cotton in your lower gums while trying to adhere the strips to your lower teeth. My teeth did seem a little whiter after using, but it was hard to discern a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mouthwash:&lt;br /&gt;The peroxide whitening mouthwash left me with a weird aftertaste,  sort of like dried mushrooms.  It was really weird.  It also leaves a slight foaming residue.  Definitely not something I was used to, but not terrible, and the aftertaste went away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;This kit included some whitening toothpaste.  I can&#x27;t really say it made my teeth any whiter by itself,  though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening power:&lt;br /&gt;I think if you were really committed to getting whiter teeth to go to all the hassle of using this entire kit and the strips for two weeks,  you could probably get better results from a professional dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;You are basically buying the toothbrush here with a bunch of extras.  The toothbrush is fantastic though, leaving my teeth feeling super clean.  However,  it was about the same as the other Oral B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 (which I also own).  I like the travel case and the extra brush heads and head holder.  However,  I&#x27;m not sure the kit is worth the extra expense.</li>
    <li> I got this to try the high end electric toothbrush, and to try some of the tooth whitening extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening:  Everything in this kit is designed to whiten.  The toothbrush is a high end Oral B 4000.  It has 4 different brushing speeds, and promises on the package to provide whiter teeth in 2 weeks.  The kit includes a white strips pack with strips for a two week long whitening treatment.  The toothpaste and mouth wash are both Crest whitening products.  The toothpaste promises whiter teeth in 5 days, but all other products promise whiter teeth in 2 weeks.  I think that using this kit got me whiter teeth, but it&#x27;s hard to say.  I didn&#x27;t take photos, and probably should have.  At the same time, whether or not it works, I feel that the brush, toothpaste, and mouthwash are all healthy and that doing 14-day-challenge got me into better habits.  I think that whitestrips are something that are only supposed to be used occasionally, and have heard that the 14 day at a time treatment, rather than continuous use, is because using them all the time could damage enamel.  Having a bunch of other whitening products that can be used continuously makes me more comfortable with using this kit and especially with giving it to some self conscious teenager who might be inspired to better oral hygiene by a desire for whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presentation:  First off, this is a gift bag.  You get the cleaning kit, but you also get it all arranged in a bag, with a tag the says \\&quot;From\\&quot; and \\&quot;To\\&quot;.  I got this by mail.  The bag comes already arranged and packed in a box that is the same size as the gift bag.  A series of paper and cardboard inserts hold items in the gift bag in place to keep them from shifting.  When you first open the box, you will see the toothbrush front and center (the toothbrush comes in a big box that takes up half the bag), and then a bunch of paper.  I was like, \\&quot;Aww, I thought this came with more stuff.\\&quot; and I didn&#x27;t realize the other stuff was in there until the next day, when I set up the brush.  So, if you give this as a gift, open the box it comes in, and take out all the paper and cardboard inserts, so that the recipient will see all the cool tooth stuff at once.  Give it as a bag, with the included \\&quot;From\\&quot; and \\&quot;To\\&quot; tag filled out; don&#x27;t give it still in the box.  A whitening kit, by the way, does make sense as a gift, because people having pretty white teeth is a nice little extra.</li>
    <li> Greatest part of this kit is the brush.  It&#x27;s my first electric brush.  Score me a fan.  The rest of the kit is solid, too.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results in consequence of kit use (not sure whether my teeth are, in fact, any whiter or just strike me -- subjectively, for having invested the time/effort, and on account of the wish-fulfillment impulse that comes with using items like this -- as being a bit whiter than ordinary).  But at least I THINK they&#x27;re whiter and the thought itself is gratifying.  At any rate, they&#x27;re as clean as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got my kit through Amazon Vine.  Not sure I would have spent full price for it, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a go.  Considering making a similar purchase in future...</li>
    <li> I have used Crest Oral-B products for years. Most notably their Whitestrips and electric toothbrushes. However, this electric toothbrush is in a class of it&#x27;s own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My basic Oral-B toothbrush feels like a dinosaur in comparison to this monster. It sounds like it has a V-6 engine in it and also sounds like it is robust and will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not all that important to people. What is important is the cleaning ability of this toothbrush and kit. My teeth feel sparkly clean and plaque free after just a few uses of this electric toothbrush. I am a few days into the 5 day whitening toothpaste and so far it appears to be working well. The mouthwash is… well, mouthwash. It tastes fine and in combination with the toothpaste is making my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say, is that I don&#x27;t buy toothpaste with fluoride in it and I only use it sparingly to whiten my teeth as most tooth whitening products have fluoride in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I would spend this amount of money on a kit as I wouldn&#x27;t buy the toothpaste or mouthwash again, purely because I don&#x27;t like fluoride. I use the Whitestrips when I need to whiten my teeth instead of using fluoride laden toothpaste everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, however, buy this toothbrush again in a heartbeat. It is incredible. There are various modes such as massage, which really does feel like it&#x27;s giving my mouth a massage. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is long between charges, although I haven&#x27;t used it off the charger until dead. I&#x27;ve used it for several days on a business trip and it didn&#x27;t die. I would say 5-7 days of use is possible based on this quick trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with this kit.  The Oral-B Professional 4000 toothbrush is stellar!  You will also see good results from the associated products in the kit - the whitening toothpaste, rinse and strips.  You decide if you want the entire kit and, if not, you can definitely buy just the products you need individually.  But for sure take a chance on the toothbrush.  I used an earlier, cheaper Oral-B electric toothbrush and there&#x27;s quite a difference in the upgrade.  It&#x27;s much more powerful to start with and my teeth feel (and look) cleaner after using this model. Unlike my earlier model I now have multiple modes to choose from (I particularly like the daily clean, deep clean and whitening modes) and I can see the state of my charge vs. just waiting until the power dies while I&#x27;m brushing. It&#x27;s also comfortable in my hand which means my brushing sessions last longer than they did when I used other toothbrushes.  (And the deep cleaning quadrant mode accomplishes the same task - making sure I do a thorough brushing job instead of just a quick pass over my teeth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers say they are sensitive to the whitening toothpaste and if that&#x27;s the case you should skip it.  And if your teeth don&#x27;t need whitening then you really don&#x27;t need this entire kit.  But in that case take the plunge and buy the toothbrush at a minimum.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed at all!</li>
    <li> My teeth always seemed to be naturally white, however, I find there are various levels of white and daily brushing doesn&#x27;t allow my teeth to be the whitest they can be,  The Crest + Oral-B Professional Whitening Kit is easy to use and helps me achieve the level of white I wanted in my teeth.  The best thing is that you don&#x27;t really have to spend a lot of time and effort to get the job done.  I have tried some whiting stripes in the past but they seemed to make my gums sore and didn&#x27;t achieve the desired results before I had to stop the treatments.  This kit contains the complete process to get the job done.  The whitening stripes don&#x27;t come off the teeth like some and when used with the provided mouthwash, toothpaste and exceptional Oral-B toothbrush with the Precision Clean brush head I achieved results in a week.  This is a great package.</li>
    <li> The Crest + Oral B Whitening Kit is nice, but a bit on the costly side, but works well enough for a home system. The power brush works well, producing adequate power and the Crest toothpaste has a nice, fresh flavor.  The mouthwash is also pleasant tasting. Ultimately, you probably achieve no better results using a power brush unless it induces you to use it longer or if the user has limited or impaired mobility which prevents or hinders using a traditional &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is such a cool and convenient way to upgrade a toothbrush.  I am considering it giftable.  This set is a tote packed with the top of the line Oral B 4000. My dentist has actually recommended the Oral B electric toothbrushes to me.  Your teeth feel so clean, you tend to smile more.  This toothbrush also comes with 4 settings, but typically I keep it on whitening.  My teeth do look whiter, and I feel like I am attacking my stains on all fronts.  The genius of this set is that it comes with replacement heads.  This is a huge convenience to me, and the way I want to purchase toothbrushes going forward.  Plus there are other goodies, toothpaste, mouthwash, whitening strips—you feel like you are getting an insane value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only compliant on this brush has always been charge time; the charge lasts for several days but not more.  Be prepared to constantly keep this charging and to take the charging station with you when you travel.</li>
    <li> I used an Oral-B electric toothbrush many years ago, then switched to a Sonicare because it was a gift.  After the first one died, I replaced it with another similar model because I had about six brush heads remaining.  That brush still performs, but I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement with more than basic functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaged in a box that&#x27;s marketed as being available only from a dental professional, the Crest + Oral-B Professional Whitening Kit is a reusable bag with a hang tag for id.  Contained in the bag is a manual, the toothbrush and charger, three brush heads, toothpaste, mouthwash and a box of teeth whiteners.  I&#x27;ve used them all and I&#x27;m thrilled with each and every product.  The toothpaste and mouthwash are fine but for me, the selling points are the brush, brush heads and the whitening strips which really do work.  The strips are packed in a box that&#x27;s much too big for them and are individually packaged.  The instructions are easy to follow -- Remove from the package, peel off the smaller strip for the bottom teeth, apply the unnotched edge to the gum line, press for a couple seconds, then press the notched edge over the teeth to the back of the teeth.  Repeat with the longer strip, applying to the upper teeth.  Go about your business for an hour, then peel them off your teeth and as the days progress, notice your teeth lightening.  Mine have had no white spots but there is a warning that this might occur.  My teeth truly are whiter and I only wish the strips covered all of my teeth, not just the ones in the front and sides to around the canines or premolars.  There is a slight taste of peroxide and I get the sense of slight foaming when the strips are carefully peeled off the teeth.  I would like a peroxide floss to get the areas between the teeth as they aren&#x27;t as whitened as the other surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric toothbrush charges fully over a few hours time and mine hasn&#x27;t come anywhere near losing its charge yet after several days.  There is also a brush holder that can be snapped onto the charging base but I haven&#x27;t used that since my bathroom is small.  The brush heads fit onto the 4000 with ease and I thoroughly clean both after each use, then dry them prior to reassembling.  I&#x27;m finding that the brush heads included with this package all are more comfortable in my mouth than the Sonicare products, so this is another plus.  The variety of modes each work well and I&#x27;ve tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of criticisms for this device but still feel it&#x27;s worthy of a five star review.  Firstly, the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t automatically shut off after the cycle is complete.  I&#x27;d prefer that it stopped after the fourth quadrant was completed.  Secondly, the brush needs to be operational in order to switch the mode making it a problem if I&#x27;ve already applied the toothpaste.  I learned to turn it on, select the mode, then turn it off, apply the toothpaste and start the process with the brush in my mouth.  Thirdly, since I don&#x27;t generally watch myself in front of a mirror while brushing my teeth, the red light isn&#x27;t the best notification for me when I apply too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My criticisms are minor and I&#x27;ve found that my teeth look and feel so much cleaner and smooth with this system than my previous brushing.  It was noticeable with the very first brushing experience.  I&#x27;ve also discovered that I can exercise my head and neck by keeping the brush stationary and moving my head, so that makes brushing even more fun.  I love this system by Oral-B (Braun) and Crest.There is also a brush holder that can be snapped onto the charging base but I haven&#x27;t used that since my bathroom is small.

    <li> I did not expect to get such a complete kit. I&#x27;m a Colgate user and the kit doesn&#x27;t seem as fast acting. But the whitening strips are very effective.and my favorite.</li>
