<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazed you can still get these replacement parts; thanks for good support from Braun and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Immediately refreshes your razor and makes the saves feel like new again.</li>
    <li> I forgotten why I bought a Braun in the first place. after using it for 15 years without changing the cutting blades, because I did not know they were available, and then I found this product and wow it was great I could not believe it, I could get a clean, close shave and I  got it done in about 1/4 the time that I use too. This produce saved me form having to buy another  Braun shaver. and by the way I do intend to replace my cutting blades sooner this next time around.</li>
    <li> OK razor, but does an inadequate job of getting around the nose.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Replacement blade lasts long and works very well.</li>
    <li> By Marjorie&#x27;s husband.  I gave up on my Braun shaver. My shaver was supposed to use the series 5 packs but they weren&#x27;t good at all - ripped and grabbed. For a while (2-3 yrs?) the series 3 packs worked pretty good but not this last one. I tossed the whole shaver, cleaner, cutters and went with another brand.  Disappointed especially considering how expensive these are.</li>
    <li> Even though it is supposed to fit  the 30b model, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> replacement .....works great.  Received early.</li>
    <li> This combination restores my Braun shaver to its first-rate performance level.  Ordinarily I replace these parts about every 30 months when the foil develops a small hole which gives my face a &amp;#34;nip&amp;#34; while shaving.</li>
    <li> on my Braun 360 complete. Cover had to be held on by a rubber band. I bought it based on other reviewers recommendations that it would work well for my model, but it really didn&#x27;t. Not a disaster, though. This one&#x27;s better: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VEK1IU/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</li>
    <li> Everything as expected.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected for 8000 series unit</li>
    <li> Even after 8 years of daily use, my 7526 is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Braun for continuing to make replacement/maintenance parts!</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with his replacement for his Braun shaver. He says it works as good as the original and costs a lot less. It also was delivered very quick, it took 8 days, which is super since we&#x27;re in S. Korea. Thanks AMAZON we won&#x27;t by hardly anything online without you !!!</li>
    <li> Works like a new unit. Braun is the best!</li>
    <li> Made my shaver like new.</li>
    <li> series 3 but does not fit. I opened it and cannot return it. What a paid. Who makes two things they call a series 3.</li>
    <li> works just like it should.</li>
    <li> Even buying from Costco, I need to pay a hundred something dollars for a brand new Braun electric razor.  Instead I only need to pay US$25 dollar to buy a foil and cutter replacement.  I saved well over a hundred dollars for this little maneuver and the service is excellance from Amazon.com.  Thank you, Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> was the wrong replacement pack to fit shaver.needed model #380s-4, so had to order a replacement for a panasonic shaver which has been very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This was definitely an upgrade from the original foil and cutter.  It has lasted me a LOOOONG time and it still cuts nicely.</li>
    <li> Fits my Braun 7250 perfectly.</li>
    <li> I needed replacement blades for my electric razor which is a few years old. It&#x27;s a great razor and if possible I didn&#x27;t want to buy a new one. I found these replacement blades on Amazon, they were delivered quick (thanks Prime). I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old blades were as these new ones played a number on my face until I could adjust to them.</li>
    <li> The Braun shaver foil and cutter replacement parts was excellent - exactly as expected from Braun.</li>
    <li> This combination pack works great on my Braun 7526. I have had this razor for a number of years and am happy with it. The replacement foil and cutter last a long time.</li>
    <li> This actually a review of the razor itself - I can not longer change my original review.  I bought this replacement with the razor with the understanding that I may have to replace it every 18 months.  After 6 months, I am no longer getting a decent shave - especially if I don&#x27;t shave every day.  The cutters will actually pinch and pull the hairs if you didn&#x27;t shave the day before.  You need to go over the beard continuously - even if you shaved the day before.  The previous Braun I had was fantastic - this one will be going in the trash (after only 9 months) as soon as I can find a decent replacement.</li>
    <li> The replacement unit doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the original.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of other replacements, I bought this for my Activator 8585.  It works better than the original!  The shave is much more comfortable than when the razor was brand new.  I highly recommend this as a replacement for this exact model of razor.</li>
    <li> Like having a brand new razor ! Why did I wait so long</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cut as advertised. Works adequately. Fairly decent results.</li>
    <li> Great product, but silly marketing gimmick.  I wanted to buy 2 sets to replace the two identical shavers foil/cutter, and buy a spare set.  But that&#x27;s more expensive than having 4 sets delivered over 4 months.</li>
    <li> I was considering buying a new razor after the 8959 started feeling really rough, despite the replacements I bought.  I decided to try this out, since a couple of the other reviewers seemed really happy with the results. Well I just had my first shave with the new razor, and its simply amazing, it feels just like the first time I used it 6 years ago.  Thanks to the folks out there who took the time to review this item, its much appreciated. cheers</li>
    <li> My razor does not shave as well as when it was new.  It shaves BETTER.  Mark me as both surprised and pleased.  Braun has even improved it&#x27;s already good product.</li>
    <li> Fits my Braun 8985 perfectly.  I was a little nervous but shouldn&#x27;t have been.  Also, as other reviewers note, much better blades compared to the thicker ones Braun is now marketing.  My shaver came with the thick blades and I never realized why I wasn&#x27;t getting a good shave and why it was a little rough on my skin.  That said, these blades are better but I still don&#x27;t get that great \\&quot;Braun shave\\&quot; I used to with their earlier shavers.  I&#x27;ve come to the same conclusion that others have stated here: Braun is no longer a leader in electric shavers and when my current one dies, I&#x27;ll be moving on to another brand.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got a Braun 7000 series shaver, you&#x27;ve got to replace the screen and blade, and this is what you need. It&#x27;s best to change them at least once a year... look for the best price... When I found it on Amazon, it was the best price with free shipping... but check around on the web!</li>
    <li> To get a good beard, you will need to have time, because is necessary to pass much time in the same point to get a good job.</li>
    <li> This replacement pack is identical to the one listed as \\&quot;Braun 7000-Series Syncro Shaver Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter Set\\&quot; that sells for over $24 by other sellers. However, I have ordered and received both packs and they are identical with the exact same packaging too (30B). Don&#x27;t be fooled by the dishonest sellers or the various fancy names. Braun 30B foil and Cutters are all the same...exactly the same. So, save yourself some money by buying the cheaper one. As far as the quality goes they are Braun and work like Braun and last about 20 months before the Foil is damaged. Wish they would sell the Foil only. This is my 3ed times I order this product. Good luck &amp; Happy shopping.</li>
    <li> Not much to say hear really.  I think the price was good, maybe about what you could find on sale at a street level store.  The clamshell package is silly -- they need to stop using these things.</li>
    <li> The right product for the right price.  The only thing that annoyed me was that the listing did not include my shaver model number.  But I took a chance and the item fit my shaver. I am happy.</li>
    <li> better than i expected. design improvements have made the replacement better than the original</li>
    <li> My Bruan electric razor was starting to pinch and pull, quiet uncomfortable.  So I researched and saw this replacement.  Glad I did.  Razor working like new again.</li>
    <li> Bought this hoping that the comments were referring to the 8595 as well...they were. The attachment works far better than the actual replacement part. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Cheaper to purchase the replacement part than to buy another razor.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the dollar.  30 seconds to replace the blade and foil and my 7000 series is like brand new.</li>
    <li> For anyone who bought a Braun 8985 shaver and is getting his face chewed up, I recommend switching to this replacement pack. It is so much smoother and the shave is much closer. Fits onto the 8985. The only difference is that the base of it isn&#x27;t silver like the original replacement pack, but you get use to it. No big deal.</li>
    <li> The product is perfect. Works the way it is supposed to. I wish that Braun sold the foil seperate. I don&#x27;t need a new ctter just because i need a new foil.</li>
    <li> Cuts so much better then my old one.</li>
    <li> Item was as described and arrived in a reasonable time. Packaging could have been better though.</li>
    <li> Been using a 7505 for years and years now. Ordered my annual-ish replacement blade, and it appears that Braun \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; the design. The original blades were very thin (20% blade and 80% open space between blades.) In the new design it&#x27;s more 50-50 of blade and open space. In practical terms, this means there is less space in the cutter opening for your beard to get into to be trimmed off. Where my wonderful shaver used to glide across my face, making it&#x27;s pleasant buzzing noise, and leaving a nice clean smooth shave, with the new blade it now seems to be running slower (more blade mass to move), and it no longer glides but required more force to shave. Additionally, forget getting a smooth shave unless you have a lot of time, what used to take 2 or three passes now takes 10 or 15 to get near the same effect. I say near because, at least for me, it&#x27;s not a smooth shave. I&#x27;ve stayed true to Braun for a very long time, but it appears it may be time to look at alternative brand electric shavers.</li>
    <li> After reading a ton of reviews on both the series 5 and series 3 replacement blade. I decided to go with the series 3 for my 8595 activator, even though it&#x27;s technically not made for it. The blade and cover fit perfectly and it cuts like new again.  I can&#x27;t comment on the series 5 replacement because I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
    <li> The Braun company are constantly innovating, changing their razors and blades and even introducing the over-the-top \\&quot;Clean &amp; Charge\\&quot; system that will scrub down your electric razor and keep it clean and sharp a lot longer.  Unfortunately, not all innovations have been for the best, so if you own a Braun electric razor, you should probably check out my notes here and some of the comments that have followed this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my Braun 7000 series electric razor for a long time now, and I even have the \\&quot;Clean &amp; Charge\\&quot; system that flushes the heads and charges the battery.  I love the thing--it helps me not have to shave with a blade every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, these things wear down so gradually it&#x27;s hard to notice when it gets bad...until you replace it.  I try to replace mine every year and a half, and every time I do I&#x27;m reminded how much better my Braun works when it&#x27;s got a new blade and foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Braun and I&#x27;ve had it for 7 years now.  My first lasted me 16 years.  Although the price can be steep, it&#x27;s worth the effort to pick one up and remind yourself why you bought an electric razor in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  These blades are for my 7000 series, but if you look over the compatibility details (and the alternate listings here at Amazon), you will see that the \\&quot;30B\\&quot; series are compatible with other razors, such as the 8585.  This is important to know because Braun recently changed their blade and foil system for some series to the \\&quot;51S\\&quot;...and are getting customers complaining about having their face chewed off by the bigger-bladed 51S.  If you&#x27;re having problems with your Braun, check the listings here at Amazon to see if your razor is capable of using the 30S head:  it has smaller blades, a finer foil design, and in my opinion provides a smoother shave than even the previous iteration of the 30B.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, product and price</li>
    <li> Great price, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> My razor is back to day one.  This worked great for my Braun Clean and Renew.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but less than local store and not readily available locally. BUT much better than the original head that came with the razor. Clean shaves!</li>
    <li> This restored my Braun shaver to like new performance.  Easy to install and for me it lasts about 500 shaves before it needs replacement.</li>
    <li> Works like a brand new razor.  Nice to have these on autoship for lower shipping cost and no need to reorder.  I do wish I could set the autoship for once every year instead of 6 months.  It takes at least a year, maybe more before they need replacing.</li>
    <li> The correct item arrived a day early. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Better than spending more money at a local store (plus these are getting harder and harder to find).  Works great with my Braun 4775.  \\&quot;Organic pattern\\&quot; mesh is an improvement over the original mesh.</li>
    <li> Just needed replacement blades for my husband&#x27;s razor.  Have bought these from amazon before because they are much cheaper than anywhere else.  No problems, just what he needed.</li>
    <li> I inexplicably purchased the Braun 51s replacement pack for my 7526 shaver last time around, perhaps based on a look-up chart or a vendor recommendation but it was a mistake. Not a big mistake but a mistake tha tmy face paid for, nonetheless. When I installed it, I noticed that the 51s looked different than the cutter block and foil, particularly around the long-hair section in the center, but I attributed that to &#x27;a product redesign&#x27;. The shaves were longer and harsher than before I again attributed it to &#x27;a product redesign&#x27; and the general degrade of everything once good that is now cheapened in the name of profits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came time to reorder, I could not find my previous order so I searched Amazon, et al, for the right part. Once I saw the 30b and the 51s side-by-side and read other users&#x27; reviews, I realised what had changed and ordered the 30b, this time. In the photos below, the 30b is on the left; the 51s is on the right. The 30b has a continuous squiggle in the central longer-hair channel of the foil and thicker cutter blades; the 51s has a gated central channel and thinner, more knife-like cutter blades. I believe that this is what lends a smoother, faster, more comfortable shave with the 30b than the 51s. Whatever the reason, buy the 30b and enjoy shaving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note:  $24.99 for one Braun 30b replacement pack is the list price, here. Buy two of the same in a dual-pack for $91.36 and you pay $45.68 per item, an 83% premium. Pay $129.96 for a three-pack and pay $43.32 a piece. You choose.</li>
    <li> Excellent! works as advertised and outperformed expectations.</li>
    <li> A surprisingly close shave!</li>
    <li> I followed the advice of not buying the standard replacement for my old Braun Series 5 (8995) Men&#x27;s Shaver. 10 mins ago I gave my original foil+cutter set a goodbye by shaving half of my face with it and then I proceeded to switch blades. I could not believe it, it goes so smoothly that it feels like a massage, and it also does a perfect job. I am still rubbing the back of my hand against my face in disbelief  :) its so smooth!</li>
    <li> All my purchases was always on time and to my expectation. So far I have never had any problem nether with the delivery or with the contact of what I purchased</li>
    <li> Exact fit, works as expected. Quick shipping, great price compared to retail (if you can even find it)</li>
    <li> Have had my Braun 7526 electric razor for over 12 years and replacing the Combo Foil &amp; Cutter with the 30B model replacement turns an old razor into a brand new razor everytime I do the replacement - which is about every 12 to 14 months. Easy to remove the old one and install the new one.</li>
    <li> very good for replacement.</li>
    <li> it was fast and easy.these parts were direct replacements for my shaver and work great</li>
    <li> Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It fit the shaver perfectly, it arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition.  5 stars out of 5.</li>
    <li> Big mahalo to previous reviewers recommending this as a replacement for the Activator razors.  I steered clear of the newest Activator replacements based upon poor reviews, and this replacement works well and is considerably cheaper. So much for Braun consumer loyalty!</li>
    <li> I should have bought one of the remaining original replacements. [[ASIN:B000050FDX Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo]] I decided not to get it because these replacements had free prime shipping. These fit my 7526 but are quite loud. Since Gillette has owned the company everything has has taken a step backwards in quality. Add this foil and blade to that growing list of what used to be great. My last foil lasted about 3 years before developing a hole. I&#x27;m hoping I get at least a year from this.</li>
    <li> Fine item price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Fits my husband 7526 Braun system and all is well in the land of the close shave again.[[ASIN:B001VH6F9G Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000)]]</li>
    <li> This replacement foil and cutter fit my Braun 8585 perfectly.  I INSTANTLY noticed a better shave with this replacement and have been kicking myself for not replacing it earlier.  Don&#x27;t believe the one review that says this item won&#x27;t fit the 8585.</li>
    <li> I looked up the razor online and ordered the appropriate Replacement, however it did not work.</li>
    <li> The new design on this cutter foil is much better than the old design.  It cuts better and seems to be faster.</li>
    <li> I have a 360 complete. I heard the new cutters for the 360 were terrible. Well, apparently I already had the new cutters. So now I have the old ones (these).    Can&#x27;t say I see any difference. So I guess these work on a 360 (even though they don&#x27;t look quite right and won&#x27;t fit on the plastic cap for the 360.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the fact that I hadn&#x27;t change the blades in about 2 years or if these really are great blades, but they get the job done. I have a really tough beard and these blades give me a nice, close shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased to replace my old blades and foil which were a year old.  I&#x27;d read the reviews about the blade design changes so made sure I kept the old blades just in case. After the switch there was NO improvement in the cutting, it might have been worse. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 2 months. Out of curiosity I pulled out the old blades (the original design which had a years worth of use) and put them in. They worked much better than the newer blades even though they were older.&lt;br /&gt;To Braun: I hope which ever idiot made the decision for this change is happy and you&#x27;ve made whatever money off of the decision that you thought you would make. You won&#x27;t be getting any more mine.</li>
    <li> They just don&#x27;t last very long, maybe 6 months,  (they don&#x27;t just quit) you will notice it just takes longer to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Happy to get my razor \\&quot;back to new\\&quot; but the price seemed a bit high for a shaver that only cost about $50. The parts did make the shaver back into a useful razor.</li>
    <li> The Braun replacement foil is well constructed and works well. It has prolonged the life of my electric razor which, amazingly enough, has maintained excellent battery function over the years.</li>
    <li> I also used this for the 8985. I had replaced the cutter a few years ago with the suggested replacement for the 8985, but the shaver just wasn&#x27;t working that well, and I assumed the shaver itself was just getting old. I didn&#x27;t want to replace the cutter again, but them it broke and I had to replace it. Glad I found this instead. I put this one on and WOW, big difference.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how dull my other set was until I replaced it with this.  Was easy to change and worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> Good price and delivered as promised.    The foil and cutter were an exact fit for my razor and I&#x27;ve had no problems with this purchase</li>
    <li> Good price for these older style foil/cutters.  They are made in Germany.  Braun products last a long time and work very well.  I have been using my Series 3 shaver for many years.</li>
    <li> My razor says BRAUN and 7526 on the front, and this product fit perfectly.  (note: my purchase date was May 1, 2011)</li>
    <li> I love my Braun shaver and the new heads and blade makes it like new.</li>
    <li> Just received this today and all that was said about it fitting the 8000 series is correct .  So for a lower price - -you get a better replacement than ordering the 8000 series replacement that is made in China .  so the color changed - -looks just as good black as it did silver .  So yes- - get the 30 B replacement series and be \\&quot; Happy &#x27;  Ordered through Amazon - - but came from a company named \\&quot;Hot Spot \\&quot; Arrived in 3 days time .                                        Thank  you  Hot Spot &amp; Amazon</li>
    <li> Other said this already and I agree, it&#x27;s like buying a new razor for a fraction of the cost.  I need to buy this every few years and stop trying to scrap my skin off my face.  Now everything glides like it&#x27;s supposed to and it CUTS the hair on my face!  Good Stuff.</li>
    <li> the new blades and screen made my old Braun work just like new, maybe better than new due to a new screen design.  Price was good, service was too.</li>
    <li> replaced on heads on Dads razor, perfect</li>
    <li> After reading reviews and almost purchasing the 51S cutter/foil (again) I bought this one in the hopes it would help me enjoy shaving again.  I purchased a 51S foil/cutter in February and have never been happy with it.  With the 51S it takes forever to get a good shave and it doesn&#x27;t feel good.  The 30B works on my 8595 (though it isn&#x27;t a pretty silver color) and boy does it work.  I tried it today and kept thinking wow, this rocks!  Yes, I realize it&#x27;s a new cutter head but when I put on my new 51S cutter head I had to check and make sure it was the new one as the shave it gave was such a poor one.  The 30B mows through my beard with ease and sounds like it should too.  Hard to describe but true.  Thanks to the excellent reviewer and info I made the right decision.</li>
    <li> Great piece of original equipment and not those after market refurbished one. Cut and shave cleaner &amp; faster  especially if your cutter &amp; foil are old and over 24 months. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not much to say---a new cutter head and foil basically gives you a brand new razor every time.  As long as your battery hasn&#x27;t died/no longer holds a charge, there&#x27;s no reason to buy a whole new razor; just replace the cutter &amp; foil.  Amazing how much better the shave is, instantly.</li>
    <li> I am always amazed the deals oner can find on Amazon. I looked around a bit and this was the best deal ever and the product is amazingly better than the older series and delivery was fast and clean.  Thank a whole lot!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Had a small hole on my old foil and (yikes!) was getting nicked on my face.&lt;br /&gt;No more with my new Braun Series 3 Combi 30b foil and cuttler replacement.  Works like the Swiss.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect fit and install.  Like brand new (again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought these in the past from Amazon and the kit contained the good cutter (a series of parallel blades), but now they come with the new, atrociously bad cutter (a single curved blade with a series of slits). I understand why Braun now produces cutters that way (much cheaper to manufacture!) but obviously this new cutter doesn&#x27;t work for people with even normal beard thickness and normal sensitive skin -- the Internet is full of these bad reviews for Braun (and some other competitors too, like Panasonic, who also is now producing lousy cutters just like these ones)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I keep using my year-old kit, with a pre-electric shave lotion bought at the local pharmacy. Works well so far, when this stops working I&#x27;ll have to switch to something else. Sad, because I love my Braun 8000+&lt;br /&gt;:-(</li>
    <li> great blade will last 3 years, it pays for it self in 2 weeks what else can you ask for...</li>
    <li> For years I have been using a Braun 8000 Series razor.  I love it but the blade cost is outrageous.  I change my blades every 12 months (instead of 18), and the $40 cost was really getting me down.  I had almost decided to just give up on my Braun when I stumbled upon these babies.  $20 for a new foil and cutter block that reportedly perform better than the OEM blades?  I was skeptical but gave them a try.  WOW!  This set fits perfectly and cuts much better than the OEM blades did when new.  This is a KILLER deal!  Give it a shot.  I seriously doubt you will be disappointed.  I have posted several pictures of my razor head compared to the one sold here...take a look.</li>
    <li> I love my Braun razor.  I have had it for years with no problems.  These replacement blades appear to be of the same quality as those that initially came with the razor.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Everything was great!</li>
    <li> I ordered the 30B foil and cutter replacement for my Braun 8985.  The 30B fits perfectly on the 8985 and seems gentler than the 51S in that the 30B does not yank on the hair with the same force as the 51S.  The only downside is that it takes slightly longer to shave using the 30B than the 51S.  However, I definitely recommend the 30B over the 51S.</li>
    <li> I got 2 of these and saved so much I&#x27;ll probably replace them each year instead of every 18 months as recommended by Braun. With the new foil and fresh cutters my shaving experience is the best I can find.</li>
    <li> Not like previously purchased item. Cutting block have thicker blades - cuts the wiskers but takes longer to shave. Previous cutting block had thinner individual blades along the block.</li>
    <li> Needed new head for 8000 series.  Old one pinched and pulled.  Reviewers said the remade head for this series did not work as well and the 30 series (though not listed as the right blade) worked very good and was cheaper.  That reviewer was right!!!</li>
    <li> Did think Braun was making these anymore since I couldn&#x27;t find them in any stores. Decided to try Amazon and the reviews were very helpful in determining if these would fit my model shaver and they did at a great price.</li>
    <li> Brought my old, semi-decrepit razor back to life... Thanks you! :-)</li>
    <li> Once you find a good razor, stick with it. This thing just won&#x27;t quit. Replaced the foil once or twice now, I think every 18mos. Battery&#x27;s still work great. But my usage is on the low side. Usually every other day.</li>
    <li> Braun continues an excellent legacy.  I&#x27;ve had my shaver about 13 years and I wonder if the rechargeable battery will ever die.  In the meantime, I continue to buy a new Foil and Cutter a couple of times a year, but I could go more months with the old Foil and Cutter and not notice much difference in the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter I was replacing lasted me over 5 years. This product developed a tear in the foil after one week.  I didn&#x27;t drop it or puncture it, seemed to have done it all on its own.</li>
    <li> when companies decide to phase a product out, it is nice to be able to extend the life of use. replacement works fine and saves the cost of an entirely new product</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly with my Braun 8595 electric shaver. Why pay double for the 51S foil? Well priced here on Amazon to. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun Razor for years and it works perfectly. Gotta keep the blade new! I replace it once a year and it hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s edge. Have their electric toothbrush too.</li>
    <li> Meets expectations and more</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy the Braun recommended replacement for the 700 series. Get this one instead. It works like the old, German Braun replacements. No nicks, no pulls. It fits fine on the 700 series, it is just a different color.</li>
    <li> This was a welcome replacement for my old Braun 8595 razor. I read a few other reviews that stated how this replacement also works with the 8595. Mine has worked great for the past few weeks, and it gives a much closer cut than my old dull one.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 8585 series that called for another blade. After reading all the poor reviews on that replacement, I went with this one. It fit perfect and cuts awesome. I highly recommend it to those who need a replacement blade.</li>
    <li> works right every time!</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement part. Razor shaves like new again.</li>
    <li> Bought as replacement item and it works great.  Love a new shaver cutting block, great cut and works as one would desire, happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this model replacement cutter / foil for my Braun Series 7 for years. This is a  high quality German-made foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is also much lower than anywhere else I could find.</li>
    <li> Bravo, Braun!  Those folks don&#x27;t only come out with new model shavers every few years.  They give a care for a customer who owns an older model and isn&#x27;t ready to discard it.  This replacement cutter block shaves noticeably more closely than the older version due to a redesign of the blades.  Gives my old 7 series shaver a new lease on life.</li>
    <li> A perfect replacement with superb service.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with Braun shavers. had one since 1977. Braun replacement parts are always high quality--be sure to order the correct ones for the shaver model.</li>
    <li> My Braun Series 3 340 shaved SO close when it was new, it was amazing.  After a couple of years, it was obvious I needed to replace the blades.  I bought these Braun replacements, now it&#x27;s a horrible, useless electric razor,  does not cut close at all. It shaves, but not close.    I looked thru lots of reviews of Braun and Norelco razors, and saw that too often,  the replacement blades can cause problems.    I&#x27;m going to try a Panasonic electric razor. At least the reviews for  replacement blades were overall not as bad for it.</li>
    <li> This is the third replacement set I&#x27;ve purchased for my Braun razor, and evidently, the quality and technology are still being updated. I was amazed at how quick my shave goes with some new \\&quot;blades\\&quot;. My Braun razor is about 8 years old, and as good as new. Yes, they are expensive, but worth every penny. Excellent fast shipping, packaging, what else could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Great replacement pack of an item that I couldn&#x27;t find in stores! It fits my shaver as needed.It makes my shaver feel like new again, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> If it takes forever to shave with your old blades, it is time to buy this replacement  cuz of its low price of all time!</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned, this works on the Braun 6000 series as well.  The blades are a lot better than the current blades offered for the 6000.  The only difference is the top is a dark grey that does not match the rest of the 6000-series light grey razor.</li>
    <li> Received quickly, items fit perfectly and frankly work as well or better than when razor was new. Screen appears to be stronger than original....</li>
    <li> Over time your cutting head will eventually lose its \\&quot;like new\\&quot; sharpness. Instead of buying a new shaver, get this. It takes less than a minute to restore your Braun shaver to \\&quot;like new\\&quot; cutting conditions.</li>
    <li> yes, this works for your 8985 and it&#x27;s so much better! Don&#x27;t worry it will work. Why Braun would not recommend this blade for your 8985 is beyond me.</li>
    <li> makes a three year ild razor like new, again.&lt;br /&gt;beats buying a new electric razor at the high prices of today.</li>
    <li> Husband has used for years.  Must like it.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for the Braun 4700 series. Best shave i&#x27;ve had in years, no hiccup in performance when comparing the original to this. If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement for your 4700 or 7000 series, look no further.</li>
    <li> The foil supplied in the package did not fit the Braun 7526 shaver. The foil is too short and does not clip to the shaver.  The cutter seems fine.  Contacted Braun directly to see if I had ordered the wrong parts. Braun stated that the 30B is the correct pack and shipped a free replacement pack.  Received the new 30B foil and cutter pack from Braun.  The foil in the new pack was the correct part.  Braun customer service was great.</li>
    <li> This is a reorder, hubby well pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Replaced my Braun 8250 series foil with this one and it works better than the original...best shave I have ever gotten with the razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s also nice that Bruan improves replacement blades, let alone still has them available, for even for my 12+ year old model.</li>
    <li> Most reasonable solution to replacement head for my shaver. It does seem of less quality than original head. Last about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect and has extended the life of the razor a few more years.  This is the second replacement but the razor just keeps going!</li>
    <li> My Braun model 8595 shaver has been restored to new with the series 3 foil and cutter. I think there is a lot of confusion, fueled by Braun&#x27;s inability to publish an easy to find list of which foils are meant for which razors.  The body of the 8595 has this model number printed on it and also has 8000 series printed on it------But, the propper foil is not the one Braun currently designates for 8000 series, but the one that states its for the 7000/4000 series on its packaging.  Confusing? You bet, but rest assured that if you have an 8000 series model 8595, you need the current foil and cutter made for the 7000/4000 series - the series 3 .  It would be nice if you could find the cutter and foil with a chrome finish at as  reasonable a price as the black version, but I guess you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
    <li> Fits my old razor and works perfectly.  Thanks very much for making it easy to find.</li>
    <li> Braun is the best...the replacement items fit and operate and make the razor like new!  $20.45 is far less than the $35 that other sites and stores wanted.  Whatever the price, it&#x27;s worth having a like new razor again!</li>
    <li> Renewed the blades and screen on my Braun. It&#x27;s just like a new shaver now for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this replacement foil and cutter block for my aging Braun 7505 razor. Before you purchase any Braun replacement parts check the \\&quot;Braun Service Website\\&quot; (search for that phrase using Google). I&#x27;d give you the URL but Amazon filters such things out of reviews. There are many razor and replacement part combinations, so choose carefully.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;Series 3 Foil and Cutter Replacement\\&quot; does NOT fit my Series 3 razor, and by the looks of several other reviews, it&#x27;s a pretty common problem.  Double check that yours specifically calls for the 30B before you buy.</li>
    <li> I replaced the original cutter block and foil on my Braun 8585 a couple months ago with the [[ASIN:B001VEK1IU Braun Series 5 Combi 51S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 8000 360 Complete or Activator)]]. Since then I&#x27;ve had numerous &#x27;grabs&#x27; where it would pull at the hair on my chin and generally cause a lot of pain to shave. On top of that, the parts that did shave okay weren&#x27;t getting as close as the original cutter did. After reading the reviews on here about the 30B set, I picked one up today at my local big box retailer for under twenty seven dollars. Just finished the job I started this morning with my 51S cutter, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This morning after I stopped my self from throwing the razor through the mirror after the 5th time it grabbed on my 3-day growth, I was ready to drop a couple bills on a totally new shaving system and try to unload the surplus [[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refills]] I had purchased in advance. But now I don&#x27;t have to. There is a definite difference between the thin-style cutters on the 30B compared to the wider style on the 51S. If you&#x27;ve had this problem with the newer cutter blocks, this is the one for you. Even though it&#x27;s not labeled for the 8595, it fits just fine. I am going to try using the 30B cutter with the 51S foil for a few days and see how it goes. I&#x27;ll keep the 30B foil around in case I need it (In the 20 or so years I&#x27;ve used a Braun electric razor, I seem to ruin foils faster than cutters anyway).</li>
    <li> Work fine just wish they were cheaper and lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace the cutter and foil on an old Syncro 7xxx.  It was the correct part and fit perfectly.  My complaint is with the new foil, which has multiple sized openings.  Ostensibly it is to capture different sized hairs, problem for me is mine are all thick.  It now takes me twice as long to shave as I have to go the same spot 3-4 times to get everything.</li>
    <li> After seeing so many people claim that this replacment pack was a better fit for the older Braun 8585 than what Braun is recommending, I decided I would take a chance and get it.  Well, it&#x27;s true.  It fits great on my 8585 and shaves like new.  As mentioned by some, the only slight issue is that the replacement is black while the 8585 razor is silver.  But who cares!!!  Using this replacement pack will allow you to continue to use your old reliable 8585.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It is like I have a new razor</li>
    <li> purchased a Braun 380s-4 shaver sometime ago so i needed replacement head. this product came up as a suggestion item frequently bought together with the shaver so i placed my order. on receipt of the replacement head, it was the incorrect product being suggested for purchase along with the shaver. false and misleading advertising.</li>
    <li> I almost foolishly bought the correct replacements for my 5 year old 8585 and then I read the reviews here on Amazon. These have made my razor almost better than it was brand new.</li>
    <li> I like the old 7000 replacement head better. It cuts better and lasts longer. The 7000 replacement head is getting harder to find.</li>
    <li> I had to give it 1 star because 0 or negative stars are not available options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this foil and cutter because it says it fits my series 7000 (7750 synchro).....and it does.  fit, that is.  it can be installed.&lt;br /&gt;after installation I was subjected to the WORST SHAVE EVER.&lt;br /&gt;I also have a Series 3 Braun....long story.......it never did shave well.  I thought it was just a bad shaver but now I suspect it is a problem with the series 3 foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;I just found &amp;#34;7000 series synchro&amp;#34; replacement foil and cutters and I am going to try that before I throw both of these Brauns in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;the worst part is, I was SOOOOOO happy with my synchro for all these years.&lt;br /&gt;hoping for the best,&lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
    <li> Quality&lt;br /&gt;This product is as good as the original every time I buy it.  See you in 24 months for my replacement</li>
    <li> The original order wasn&#x27;t for the right razor and wouldn&#x27;t work.  The second attempt works just fine.</li>
    <li> I have an 8985 and it fits perfect. The only difference I can tell is the plastic is black instead of silver. It made my razor like new again.</li>
    <li> My  shaver broke down shortly after I received  the replacement pacs. I bought a new shaver, but the replacement pacs are not useful for the new shaver. I would like to return the pacs and get replcement pacs for the new shaver.</li>
    <li> Replacing the foil &amp; cutting blades has brought my Braun razor back to the original specs and continues to give a close shave.</li>
    <li> It was great! I loved it and it worked just like I expected it to. I would definitely suggest it to others who are looking for a good blade</li>
    <li> This is my fourth and they were all great . I&#x27;m sorry there is only so much I can say about a razor screen.</li>
    <li> Did not have any luck with this shaver. The foil suppose to last for 18 months and that sure was wrong.</li>
    <li> it fit the way it was supposed to and definitely makes a difference in the shave...less pulling of the hairs.  The center portion, i guess for longer hairs, has fewer blades than the original.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good brand, better than most.  A lot of the cheaper brands don&#x27;t work on my tough beard.</li>
    <li> When my electric shaver was not giving me as good a shave, I searched for what was new.  I ran across the Foil/Cutter replacement option that restores the shaver.  The cost was certainly less than buying new and the results were as good as buying new.</li>
    <li> I use a wet shave and keep the Braun for back-up and for travel. The foil was damaged during travel, hence the need to replace it - it was long overdue for replacement anyway. A few computer clicks shewed me what I was looking for and where to get it. The product arrived promptly by regular shipping and, true enough, it was exactly what I was looking for and performs up to specs.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my 8985 Braun shaver after reading the reviews on how bad the Series 5 foil &amp; cutters are.  The Series 3 fits perfectly and cuts great!  It&#x27;s like a new shaver.  The only issue (which doesn&#x27;t matter to me) is that the plastic protector cover for the foil doesn&#x27;t snap on because the groove in the foil molding is missing.  Other than that, this is a great product and cheaper than the Series 5 version.</li>
    <li> Great price, arrived quickly, and in good condition. Works well like these cutters usually do, my razor is probably 15 years old by now.</li>
    <li> This foil was good, but I noticed something that felt like a burr after using it for several months.  My razor eventually died so I did not use the foil &amp; cutter as long as I the previous foil.</li>
    <li> This kit fit perfectly to my Braun 7305! It seems even better than the ones came with the shaver and cost much cheaper than other retailer</li>
    <li> This is a great replacement product. My husband has enjoyed his Braun 7505 Synchro shaver for several years. With an almost-full beard, he shaves much less area than most men. Consequently, his shaving tools last longer. This was the first replacement foil &amp; cutter we purchased. The hole pattern on the foil is different than the original that came with the shaver. His comment: \\&quot;The new part performs twice as well as the old one! Great design.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Needed new head for electric razor its okay but not great.  The original was much better than the replacement head</li>
    <li> Easy to install as the previous product but no real noticeable improvement in shaving quality.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an average product.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of men, I was terribly disappointed with the 51S cutter head replacement for my Braun 8585. Then I learned from other reviews here that the 30B - which is actually intended for the 700 series shavers - fits on the 8585 and works much better. I decided to give it a try, and holy cow was I happy with the results. The 30B doesn&#x27;t look like it will fit on the 8585, but it fits just fine. Now I get a smooth, close shave without all the pulling and tugging I got from the 51S.</li>
    <li> A very close awesome shave every time.And the good thing is you only have to replace them every 18 months.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews on the 8585 and it said to order this combo.    The cutter block fits the 8585, it seems smaller than the original. The foil fits perfectly, though the screen is a different design. The only downside is the external plastic shield will not fit.  Today I shaved a two-day&#x27;s growth without a single pull. In fact, it&#x27;s a Pleasure To Shave :) The foil design seems to completely minimize pull - and a smooth shave.  Wonderful :)</li>
    <li> This not only fits the 8585, but shaves closer and works better than anything else I have tried. I usually do not shave over the weekend and would dread the shave on Monday, as I would have whisker pulling and it would take a long time. No more! The 30B Pack has made my old 8585 like a new razor again.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware the foil housing color is black, not silver, but who cares? Anyway, the razor sits in the charger/cleaner, so the color difference is not visible except for a couple of minutes while you are shaving. The darned thing could be pink for all I care--it works!! I almost ditched the whole razor--not now--it is new again!!</li>
    <li> I really like this braun shaver so I bought this pack although it was a little expensive, but thats how the shaving business works.</li>
    <li> Despite the reviews, I bought this for the 7526.  I wanted to let you guys know that it works.  Clips in perfectly and it works great.</li>
    <li> Did not know you could replace these instead of the whole shaver. Fit perfect, no problems.</li>
    <li> They have changed the design of the cutter.  Now when I shave, my face is on fire.  I complained to Braun.  They sent me a new foil and cutter.  Face still burns.  After many years of using a Braun, I think it is time to try another brand.</li>
    <li> You never realize how much you need a new foil and blades until you buy them.  Good, quick shave with this product.</li>
    <li> I have an 8985 and had been in desperate need of a replacement foil and cutter for some time.  I hesitated spending the $35 or so since I had read so many bad reviews of the listed replacement.  Glad I waited, because I finally ran stumbled on a review under that item that lead me to this. Although it seemed weird to buy the \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; replacement, I bought one a 30B (made in Germany), and my razor now works better than ever.  It whispers quietly as it cuts instead of growling while it rips the hair off my face.  That perception of difference could of course be because I let it get so bad before doing anything about it, but I&#x27;m convinced enough that I just bought two more 30Bs to have on hand.  At $21 each with Prime free shipping, this was awesome advice!</li>
    <li> Although the item description indicated it was the proper one for my model, it was not.  It is very difficult to identify the proper parts for Braun models as they have changed their part/model numbers.</li>
    <li> I have been using these replacement heads since I first bought my Braun razor several years ago. They work just fine. I always keep several around as replacements.</li>
    <li> After 8 years of using the original foil and cutter from a Braun 7680, thought it was now cost effective to get new foil and cutter.  The shaver was still shaving effectively and very close prior to the replacement.    Fit was perfect and easy.      How much better performance I get is hard to tell.  Maybe 10-20% better.  I would say it is back to how it was brand new.  I am not wow&#x27;ed by the replacements, but I am impressed how well these foils and blades hold up for almost a decade.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a 7300 razor, and I was a little nervous that they wouldn&#x27;t be compatible because Braun has relabeled them as Series 3 or something. So, yeah, if anyone else is wondering, they work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, they&#x27;re replacement blades. Work just like your old ones worked when they were new.</li>
    <li> Own Synchro 7000 series. 30B is the replacement foil that I like best. Tried the new foil and it was very painful. This 30B is less expensive and works best. Will stock up on this one.</li>
    <li> Meh.  I can&#x27;t help but feel like the quality of the Braun shaving screens has gone down over the years.  When my razor goes bad, I will have a hard time purchasing another Braun.</li>
    <li> I bought this blade and cutter replacement for my 8595 razor, as its original replacement apparently has been discontinued and the new part (Series 5, 51S)  gets bad reviews for shaving quality and how long the part lasts. Several reviewers mentioned that this replacement, originally for the 7000 series, works as well for the 8000 series shavers as their original cutter and blade. My fiance wanted me to have as clean a shave as I used to have and bought me the 7000 series replacement. I can report that she is very happy with the result and so am I!</li>
    <li> I saw horror stories from people who bought the 51S replacement cutter and screen, and they recommended the 30B.  I am glad I followed that advice.  Before I purchased the 30B I called Braun, and of course the representative never heard of the 51S issues, and cautioned me not to buy the 30B for my 8985 as it could damage the razor.  After having shaved now for over a month with the 30B, it&#x27;s a pleasure every time I shave now...which has always been a chore my whole life.  This cutter and screen combo work better than the original 360 set which I last used specifically designed for the 8985.  The screen surface area is slightly reduced along the sides, but the blades are the real difference.  The blades are thinner and more numerous.  When I shave now I can hear very high-pitched snipping sounds as the hairs are being cut.  The old 360 did not do that, and I could only tell if I was clean shaven by visual inspection or feeling with my hand.  It is an awesome feature to be able to pull your skin taunt with one hand and use the razor with the other hand until all the snipping sounds stop...and I&#x27;m done, baby smooth!  :)  There are only 2 minor drawbacks for me.  The color of the plastic head is black, whereas the 8985 is a silver/blue colored shaver; but it&#x27;s dark blue so unless you look really close it looks like a color match.  And another very minor drawback is the corners of the plastic head leave some very tiny openings when snapped into place.  It snaps securely, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but again you have to look very close to see those imperfections.  The best plus of all is the 30B costs $15 less than the 51S, and yet gives the best shave I ever had from my 8985.  I will not buy the 51S and even if they were to bring back the original 360 replacement cutter/screen for my razor I am going to stick with the 30B!</li>
    <li> Even thfough these are supposed to be for the 7000 series, I followed the recommendation of others on Amazon and bought these for my 8995.  The color of the foil case is black instead of silver, but that is way more than made up with by the performance of these blades.  The blades for the 8000 series are thick and uncomfortable, where these are thin and really cut well.  I will never go back to the 8000 series blades again, these are the best out there for the 8995!  I was thinking about throwing the whole shaver out and buying a different brand because I was so fed up with the quality of the other replacement blades.  I am sure glad I tried these out first.  I am ordering another set now so I have it in stand-by.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and as advertized</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll chime in here and confirm this works fine with my 8595 shaver. Nice close shave again - seems better than the previous cutter/foil I had.</li>
    <li> Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cutter block really breathes new life into an old electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Have had several Braun razors and enjoyed all of them.  I needed the foil and cutter for my razor, found it online and had it in a few days.  Parts fit right on my razor and I am a happy shaver again.  I have had Remington and Norelco razors also and keep coming back to my Braun.  Gives me a great and smooth shave and the online price at Amazon was great.  Will use again when needed.  Part numbers for razor parts can be confusing, so go to Braun&#x27;s web sight to get the correct part number, then order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Finally, a great shave again from my Braun 8985.  For the last two cutter/foil changes I used the recommended replacement part and ended up with lots of pulling and irritation.  I was about to go looking for a replacement shaver when I found the reviews pointing to the Series 3 cutter/foil as a great option.  The Series 3 set is like I remember from my original Braun shaver in that the cutter block has fine \\&quot;blades\\&quot; on it instead of the big, wide plates that the recommended replacement cutter has (absolutely terrible). The nice, fine, SHARP blades actually cut instead of the grinding and pulling I had come to dread.  The Series 3 set glides and gives a very close shave with minimal passes.  I ordered 3 of these sets to have on hand, and I highly recommend these to anyone with an 89xx shaver.  UPDATE 01/14/2012:  The original cutter/foil is still going strong with a great shave, so I&#x27;ll have 2 extras for quite a while at this rate.  I&#x27;m still amazed that the Series 3 replacements are this good!</li>
    <li> I have no problem with the item.  Seems to be working very well.  My objection is that I thought I was purchasing a twenty something dollar version of the Braun foil and cutter, and you sent a seventy something dollar version.  I did not notice the switch until I had installed and used the item and my wife called my attention to the accompanying price statement. Had I known the price, I would have opted for a new shaver.

    <li> I am amazed at how good the 30B foil &amp; cutter is on my 360 Complete (4 years old). The original 8000FC wasn&#x27;t as gentle and clean cutting on my sensitive skin (rosacea as well as dry skin). The original 51s nor the newest 51s Opti-foil would not do as good a job on neck hair as the 30B. I have owned the 790 pulsonic and the 590...both with Opti-foils. For my skin, neither of these foils shaved as smoothly and gently and cleanly as the 30B. I only wish that I had known, when I owned my 590, that this foil probably would have worked on it (since I assume the the 30B will work on any Braun that uses a 51s. I think that would make an outstanding shaving combination (590 with 30B cutter &amp; foil). My gratitude to the original discoverers and posters concerning the versatility of the 30B.</li>
    <li> Not a lot to say when you can an original replacement head from Braun at a great price. It fits and cuts like the original head.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace the part #8000 block for my Braun 8595 shaver. Like other reviewers said, it&#x27;s not as good as the old ones. But given the dire reports, I must say that it&#x27;s not that terrible. I do shave every day, though, so I&#x27;m not putting that much work on it. If you&#x27;re in the same situation, I think you&#x27;ll be fine with this, admittedly, substandard replacement. Hoping Braun goes back to the old style, better parts.</li>
    <li> Beware--the description clearly shows, single, dual and 3 pack; the three pack does not exist; very misleading description of the quantity available.</li>
    <li> After reading MANY reviews, both good and bad, I decided to \\&quot;bite the bullet\\&quot; and order this for hubby as his foil was so warn it had HOLES in it and it was \\&quot;duller than a hoe!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and I decided to put it on and see if it worked.  After throwing up a quick prayer, I cut the package open and was blown away by how EASY it was!  Switched the razor on and I swear I heard angels singing the Hallelujah Chorus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so maybe I&#x27;m exaggerating a bit there but the razor works like new again!  We are both thrilled!</li>
    <li> I sent it back to amazon because it didnt fit my razor. I ended up getting a new razor so I can&#x27;t confirm which model it was.</li>
    <li> I went three years rather than the recommended 1.5 years to replace my foil and cutter pack. I wish that I had done it a year ago. (I think the 18 months is a bit too often, but 24 is about right for me.) New heads do make a new razor.</li>
    <li> The foil portion of this product barely lets anything through, so I&#x27;m using my old foil and the new blade and all is good.</li>
    <li> I trusted the other reviews that said this works with the 8595 and am glad I did.    This works even better that the original.  The cover doesn&#x27;t fit correctly, but for the better shave it doesn&#x27;t matter.    It seems there are two types of cutters that are available.  To tell the difference, look at the cutting blades from the side.    With my original, the blades were about 1mm wide.  With this new one they are just slightly thicker than a piece of paper.  If you get one with the thicker blades, return it.  This one has the smaller blades and it is amazing how big of a difference they make.    My shave is smoother than before, and I have had almost no pulling in the 4 months I have had this.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the other reviewers I bought this for the 8585 model and it works great. It also cost less than the recommended &amp;#34;51s&amp;#34; for the 8585 model.</li>
    <li> for the shaver I keep in my car for touch-ups and I change it about every 3 months.  Good and precise head for a great shaver.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and He loves it, he is using his electric shaver all the time now!</li>
    <li> not Braun fault but....  not all the Series 3 use the same foil... be careful when selecting the model.Mine was 32N/32S and not 30B.&lt;br /&gt;Lift the trimmer and there you will find the model required... (too late for me)</li>
    <li> Made in Germany… and my 8985 is better than when new.  Thanks for the reviews… to know I can use on 8000 series. Will order this the 30b model now at least once a year and why not at this price!</li>
    <li> My old Braun razor is working as it did when it was new.</li>
    <li> Boy am I glad I found this thanks to Amazon&#x27;s product reviews. The center piece on my Braun 8975 foil broke, which meant either a replacement foil for $36 or a new Braun shaver for much more. I&#x27;ve sworn by Braun shavers for years and still believe they give the best shave. Thanks to Amazon shoppers and their product reviews, I found that this foil and blade combination, which cost I think $21 and change, fit my shaver perfectly. Now it&#x27;s as good as new and I&#x27;m thrilled to have years more service from my shaver. BTW, I always use Lectric Shave, especially on my neck, before I shave. Helps the shaver glide over the skin instead of sticking. A closer shave and it saves my neck from getting irritated. Oh, and with Prime, the blade got her days.</li>
    <li> If I had not read some of the reviews of the recommended foil and cutter replacement for my Braun 8995 Model 360 shaver, I would never have known that Braun out-engineered itself and developed an inferior cutter for what was then its latest and highest-end model. I started to order the standard recommended replacement, then paused to read a few of the reviews on Amazon.com. Quite a few people had thoughtfully tried a slightly older replacement set [[ASIN:B001VH6F9G Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000)]] and found it far superior to the \\&quot;current\\&quot; version. Their detailed, knowledgeable comments persuaded me to ignore the manufacturer&#x27;s \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; and try an earlier set. The price was not different enough to be a factor, but the quality of the shave was at issue. I tried the reviewers&#x27; recommendation for the Series 3 Combi (aka 7000 series instead of 8500 series), and I have been delighted with my choice. From the first shave, I realized this was why I switched to Braun shavers years ago. Not only did I get a cleaner shave with fewer strokes and no scratches, but I could actually hear the shaver cutting the whiskers, letting me know where I needed to repeat a stroke or change direction. I usually just rate a product and move on, but this experience prompted me to explain why I&#x27;m glad I listened to the customers, rather than just accept the manufacturer&#x27;s published choice of replacement parts.</li>
    <li> From other reviewers recommendations, I tried this part for my Braun 8985 since they claimed it was better than the normal replacement.  This shaver used to be known as 360 Complete model and is supposed to use the Braun Series 7 Combi 70S foil and cutter which is more expensive and has terrible reviews.  This Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter do indeed fit on my Braun 8985 and are even less expensive.  It&#x27;s shaving like new again.</li>
    <li> This started as a backup razor. When the cutters and screen began to wear, I chose to order a replacement pack. It is performing well. There was no break-in period. Works like the razor did when it was new.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product and also I commend the vendor who sent this. We received the package immediately. Was very pleased with the mailings.  Thank you. I wish all the items I ordered online were sent to me this fast.  I give this a superior grade +++++.</li>
    <li> As others wrote, this item (S3) fits the 8000 series razors, but it is not nearly as good. I compared it to my 6 month old 8000 series replacement and it is about the same. So, it is like buying a used 8000 series cutter and foil. Better than nothing, but that is about it.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the reviewers on this site, my Braun 8975 shaver is better than new. The 30B(made in Germany) foil and cutter pack that others have recommended works great, even though Braun calls for a 51S replacement. The shaver is quieter, less skin irritation, and easier to clean than what came with my original foil and cutter combo. Great price through Amazon, too.</li>
    <li> These work on the newer shavers.  It&#x27;s a dirty little secret of Braun&#x27;s.  They want to you buy new foils, but they can all be swapped in and out (within the product line, anyway).</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, gives me a close comfortable shave.  My 8585 is like new again!</li>
    <li> Better deal than a department store for sure.  Wish they would cut a deal for two at a time or something.</li>
    <li> Followed the advice of an earlier review and bought this cutter for my Braun 360. Glad I did. The shave is smoother and closer than the original . . . and less expensive!</li>
    <li> Braun recommends replacement every 12 months. But I replace mine every 6 months, and my bread is pretty light. Maybe I&#x27;d get better life out of my foil, if I lubricated my face with that shaving oil stuff.</li>
    <li> Works great with Braun 8595, doesn&#x27;t fit the color style, but functions exactly like the old one, I would buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a whole lot of time 2011 to 2014. Every time, this item lasted me between 2 weeks and 4 months. I was very dissapointed. I&#x27;d recommended getting the Philips Norelco, which cost $39.95, the same price as two of this razor, but last so much longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun shaver for over 15 years. It has served me faithfully and still goes strong. I have replaced the head with this several times. Unfortunately they redesigned the foil and cutter. I no longer get the close shave that I used to get and it takes longer to shave now. With the old design I would have little trouble shaving a three or four day old beard. Now, if I don&#x27;t shave at least every two days, I have to use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than cutting the hair it appears to simply beat it into submission. With the previous design, when I would empty out the shaver and clean it, the dust would be gritty thus indicating that it was truly cutting the hair. Because of the larger particles I would only need to occasionally give the shaver a thorough cleaning. Now the dust is a fine powder and the shaver requires a thorough cleaning after every shave. On one occasion a small plastic part fell off the end of cutter head when I opened the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Braun but it was a change for the worse and now I&#x27;m shopping for a new shaver. Rest assured it will not be a Braun.</li>
    <li> I had not realized that the blades of my electric razor needed changing every six months or so. I thought I was needing a new razor but the replacement blades did the trick. Felt like having a new razor.</li>
    <li> This is the original foil and cutter set and it is very good. Great price and very well worth it</li>
    <li> I opted to get the 30B rather than the 51S (for the 8000 series) shaver.  I had replaced the foil and cutter about a year or so ago with the 51s.  I never felt that one worked very well.  WOW, after putting the 30B in, my razor is like new.  No, it&#x27;s better than new!  I don&#x27;t feel the stubble on my cheek after a shave.  Yes, it is very close to a blade shave!  Cool beans!  vs the 51S, the 30B cutter looks thinner - it may not last as long, only time will tell. And, the foil is a different type. It may be that my beard just works better with the 30B.</li>
    <li> I read up on some of the reviews seen on here where other users are avoiding the 51s due to the cutter design and I did check it out in person at the store and can verify that the cutter blades are much further apart than the 30b. I tested it out over the weekend and did find it to cut much easier, but not as close as with the original foil. I remembered another review mentioned that as well, but it is true, a shave that cuts better but not as close is better than super close and ending up with a red face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you do need the closeness, you can always use your old foil and new cutter. I think as long as you cleaned your foils properly it doesn&#x27;t really go bad or get dull.</li>
    <li> for a new cutter this thing is about as good as a butter knife. took way to long to shave and did a poor job of it. I tried it for about a week with the same result.... I&#x27;m putting the whoe shaver in the trash and will go back to an old blade type razor...at least it will cut the hair...and a bit of skin...but oh well.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service by Amazon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have a 7526.  This was exactly what I needed.  It installed quickly without an problems.  I could notice the difference immediately.</li>
    <li> My Braun shaver had become unusable, but the replacement Series 3 Combi Foil and Cutter have my old 8985 shaver working like new.  Great price and fast service; I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> very good replacement cutting blades</li>
    <li> Bought for my Braun 8585 after reading reviews of the intended replacement which are aweful and suggestions to buy this one instead.  It&#x27;s great, works perfectly and my razor works like new again!!!</li>
    <li> Other reviewers&#x27; tips about using the 30b instead of the 51s led me to take a chance for my 8975.  It works!  Fits perfectly, and yeah, the frame of the foil is black, but what do I care?  The 30b has a more complex design in the foil.  Sorry, but I can&#x27;t really compare the shave-- I needed a new foil/cutter, and now that I have a new one, I&#x27;m getting a much better and closer shave, with fewer repeated strokes.</li>
    <li> I exchanged the original with this foil and cutter and started getting really quiet, smooth and close shaves which I had never had before. I own a Braun 8975 and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s better than new! Thanks to Amazon, I had lots of advice from others and picked an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I decided to try and find an inexpensive alternative to my Series 5 Razor and had read a couple of reviews on using the Series 3 30b foil and cutter. I was hesitant and skeptical that it would work as well as some of the people have posted but decided spending $22 or so on a one time purchase would be worth it, especially if it could save me $10-15 each time I ordered a replacement foil and cutter. I am glad I did as not only does it work great with my 8975 but it now gives a much closer and quicker shave. I was normally used to having to go over each area of my face a couple of times and to pull my skin tight in order to get a close enough shave but as this foil and cutter is closer in design to the original that came with my razor it was like my razor was like it was 6-7 years ago when I first purchased it. I&#x27;m not sure why the Series 5 design was changed to how it is currently but I don&#x27;t see myself buying another set of Series 5 foils and cutters again.</li>
    <li> Got this about one month ago and it fits my several years old Braun electric shaver just fine. I had waited beyond two years before I got this replacement set. Made a real difference in the closeness and gentleness of the shave! I believe that it really helps to get a new foil and cutter at least once a year.</li>
    <li> This product is the very best i have used.I would by again from this seller.Shaver was in orifinal packaging also.Cannt wait to make another purchase.</li>
    <li> Watch out for Fakes!  I don&#x27;t know what it is that recently I find a version of this blade that is not even sharp!  I compared it to my original blade that came with shaver and it looks totally different than what I got from Amazon.  I returned it!</li>
    <li> Although this does give an excellent shave I seem to be having some issues with the self cleaning base that my razor came with.  The head seems a little smaller than the one my razor came with so I&#x27;m guessing that might be the issue.  Still like it though and would recommend.</li>
    <li> ... and it&#x27;s five years old... wow.&lt;br /&gt;Go for every 5-6 months to keep it new, and you&#x27;ll enjoy for years.</li>
    <li> Great fit with my 8781.  Just finished my shave and couldn&#x27;t be happier - my razor is back.  Thanks to the other reviewers for the advice.</li>
    <li> The particular foil and cutter replacement is difficult to find and once found, expensive.  Amazon had it at the right price.</li>
    <li> This blade/cutter set performs MUCH better than the 51S designed for the 8xxx series of razors. It fits fine on my 8975 and cuts smoother and faster than the 51S.</li>
    <li> No razor lasts for ever, not even the electric kind. Eventually your razor will just not cut as well as it used to. When this is the case, you end up buying one of these. All I can really say about this product is that it works, lasts a good amount of time and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> The foil is good but the cutter is not exactly like the original of my Braun 7600 series.  Looks cheap as the blades are too tight</li>
    <li> Restored shaver to almost original condition.</li>
    <li> Good slight design change</li>
    <li> This breathed new life into my old shaver. It is very confusing trying to figure out which one to buy. This worked for my 4000 series shaver. It is cheaper than buying a new shaver. I prefer these foil head shavers over the other kind of electric shavers.</li>
    <li> I have the 8985 and this replacement works perfectly on it.  I might even like it better than the recommended replacement, which costs more money, so I think I&#x27;ll be ordering this one from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for the other razors, but if you have a 8985, this foil/cutter should work really well for you.</li>
    <li> Works great with my 8000 series shaver.  The price was pretty good too.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I buy Braun because they work and last.  Also because they can be charged while shaving.  Replaced an old Panasonic razor that had to be off to charge.  Seriously, what happens when it runs out of juice and you&#x27;re not finished shaving?!  Never again, I&#x27;m sticking with Braun from now on!  Anyway, these replacements work just like the original.  What else could you want?</li>
    <li> These fit good, are easy to install and work great.</li>
    <li> My old foil finally developed a hole in it. This fixed that with a click. Popped the old one off and the new one slipped right in. It does fit my braun 8585 so this has multiple uses.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace old cutters for my Braun 7860.  It&#x27;s like having a new razor again.  Installation was pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit. Razor works like new.  Quality product.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Always good to change the head occasionally. Much closer shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor since the mid 1980&#x27;s.  The only thing I have to replace is the foil and cutter.  You can not go wrong with a Braun!</li>
    <li> does not fit razor even though it said it was the same model</li>
    <li> Make sure you get the right head unit. Braun makes a bunch of different incompatible shavers, all labeled \\&quot;Series 3\\&quot;. The Amazon description doesn&#x27;t give you a lot of guidance in finding the right part. Amazon accepted my return, but I had to pay for shipping. The correct part for my shaver was this one (also labeled \\&quot;Series 3\\&quot;): [[ASIN:B003UH1Q3U Braun 32b Series 3 Combi Replacement Pack]]</li>
    <li> Wanted a brand name product&lt;br /&gt;Fit and finish was consistent with original&lt;br /&gt;Snapped on and improved performance immediately&lt;br /&gt;Will buy another in 6 months when its time to replace</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews I bought this to replace the unit on my old \\&quot;Braun 8975 360 Complete Men&#x27;s Shaver (ASIN B000G17862). It fits onto the old shaver perfectly and I&#x27;m happy with the shave. As noted by someone else, the color is different, but I actually think it looks better. One small issue: my shaver came with a little plastic cover to protect the foil. That cover doesn&#x27;t quite fit this new foil, even though the foil fits the main shaver fine. The little plastic cover doesn&#x27;t snap in place and will just fall off. I&#x27;ve taken to keeping the shaver in its hard plastic travel case, so this isn&#x27;t much of an issue for me. Just seemed worth mentioning.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews on Amazon, my husband purchased this foil and cutter replacement set for his Braun series 8000, model 8585 Braun. It fits perfectly and he says it shaves great - just like new. Thanks to other reviewers for the tip!</li>
    <li> Great razor have had for years with no problems. Only needs this foil replacement once or twice a year and it is a great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Braun shavers are good quality, operating them is easy and they do a good job of shaving.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my husband&#x27;s older Braun.  He&#x27;s had it for a long time and it still works great.  I&#x27;m glad we can still find these because they&#x27;re the only things that ever seem to need replacement.</li>
    <li> Braun really messed up when they switched from the blade style cutter to the wide slot cutter.  Not only does the wide blade cutter not cut as well as the thin blade cutter... pulling at hairs and taking longer... I have noticed it makes the shaver motor work much harder, leading to additional wear and less shave time per charge.  The actual RPM the motor runs at is considerably lower with the wide blades.  Here&#x27;s how I &amp;#34;proved&amp;#34; this out.  I used my 7526 shaver until the recharge light came on.  Then I did about 1-2 more shaves, enough that the motor was starting to slow down.  Then I manually cleaned the shaver head, just in case.  I ran the shaver, just holding it in the air in front of me, as well as next to my ear.  I swapped the old style vs new style cutter back to back using the same foil, and repeated.  Just turn it on in the air and note the pitch of the hum of the motor.  The wide blade cutter causes a noticeably lower pitch motor hum!  That extra surface area between the foil and cutters means there is a LOT more friction for the motor to overcome.  I&#x27;ve had this shaver about 13 years and I can&#x27;t complain from the standpoint that I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  These German made Braun shavers are amazing compared to the later Chinese models.  But this is such a  fundamental design mistake that I am left shaking my head.  How could the designers not see this?  How could they think having all that metal rubbing against the foil wouldn&#x27;t have a negative effect?  Does not make me want to buy another Braun.</li>
    <li> Yes, the cutter cover doesn&#x27;t click in anymore, but I had forgotten how wonderful a shaver could feel. I dreaded using my shaver before, but with this new screen and cutter, it is absolutely amazing. I rarely write reviews, but this is the one to have. I am buying another to ensure they don&#x27;t discontinue them before I need a replacement.</li>
    <li> This problem can be shared by both Braun and Amazon.  The foil and blade received does not match the shaver. Braun produces many products and the replacement blades are no exception.  It is very difficult to determine the appropriate replacement foil and cutter given the scan information on the shaver and the lack of detail on the web page.  I really tried to make sure it was the right product. The scant information on the amazon web page matched the scant information on the shaver but nonetheless, it was the wrong replacement pack.  Extremely frustrating.  Great loss of time and money and I still don&#x27;t have a sharp shaver.</li>
    <li> My 90-year-old dad loves his Braun razor, and I buy this replacement pack for him about every 8 months and he is happy as a lark. Sometimes you can find it in stores but it is more expensive.</li>
    <li> The 30b replacement foil and cutter fit my shaver perfectly and gives a smooth clean shave. What more could I expect? Love it!</li>
    <li> My 360 complete has ALWAYS pulled longer hair.  I used the beard trimmer first and then shaved as usual.  With this item I can shave without first using the trimmer.  This was a last effort or I was going to buy a different shaver.  So for those of you with a 360 complete this combo is not only better than the original but much cheaper.  How often does that happen?</li>
    <li> Could be a bit sharper, but maybe it is just my beard1</li>
    <li> I have the 8985 shaver. After purchasing the series5 replacement shaver that states it is for the 8000 360 series, which does not fit shaver well and causes rash and irritation because it pulls on hairs, I read reviews and purchased this one. This is definitely the correct replacement. Fits great and shave is very smooth</li>
    <li> Great replacement head fit and runs just like the original shave head that came with he shaver, I would purchase another one</li>
    <li> I read the negative reviews on this item and have had none of those experiences - there were also negative reviews on the Braun site.  I&#x27;m wondering if these reviewers ordered the correct replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made in Germany (razors made in China).  The factory packaging is strong and will withstand shipping in an envelope. It is simple to install and it works perfectly well on my several years old Series 3.  It isn&#x27;t magic, don&#x27;t expect it to give you a perfect shave in one swipe - of course no electric shaver will.  Bottom line: German quality engineering and mfg., simple installation and smooth, quiet and perfectly effective.  Don&#x27;t expect a blade close shave - no electric razor can do it but it will give a very good shave with no undue effort.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close as in the past.  May have to get a new razor sometime in the near future</li>
    <li> My husband said this made his shaver work like new again. Original Braun quality, gives a nice shave, reasonable price too.</li>
    <li> Series 3 much better than the new head made for my 8000 series shaver</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time that I purchase the replacement and my husband complaimed that it&#x27;ll pull his hair.&lt;br /&gt;We decided to purchase a new shaver since the current one has been using for a number of years already and the replacement not acutully do the good job.</li>
    <li> I could not imagine this is gonna work. actually I was reviewing the 8000 replacement:  [[ASIN:B001VEK1IU Braun Series 5 Combi 51S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 8000 360 Complete or Activator)]]  or  [[ASIN:B000GBMYC0 Braun 8000 360 Complete Foil and Cutter Block for Models 8995, 8985 and 8975]]  and I noticed some left a note that this  [[ASIN:B001VH6F9G Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000)]]  is a better replacement. I took the risk and ordered it and unbelievably found that it was true. It is black but fits perfectly. It even works better than my original one which came on my shaving machine. It is much much more smoother and quieter and works very fast and perfect.   Please don&#x27;t go and buy the 8000 replacements (first 2 links). I did not experience other&#x27;s experiences and I am very happy with that. I am sure you will be happy by this purchase too.</li>
    <li> Black plastic housing leaves black marks on my face and doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  Past orders were much better.  I think this was a lemon.</li>
    <li> According to the site this says it fits all Series 3.  FYI there are TWO series 3 models.  If you have the 350cc-4 you&#x27;ll want to get the 32b or 32s instead of the 30b/30s.</li>
    <li> I have the Braun Model 8975 shaver.I&#x27;ve replaced the blades and foil a couple times already, with the RECOMMENDED BLADES AND FOIL PACK. The last time I replaced the blade and foil,I experienced pulling and noisy operation.I was just about to look for a replacement shaver, when I read a review of the replacement blades and foil ON THE AMAZON SITE. The reviewer said he tried the Combi 30B pack INSTEAD of the recommended replacement pack, and it workls fine.I ordered the Combi 30B , and MY SHAVER WORKS LIKE IT DID WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED IT!!!Quiet, smooth shaving, no pulling!The reviewer was correct.This SHOULD BE THE RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT PACK FOR THE 8975---NOT THE PACK LABELED AS THE CORRECT REPLACEMENT.Thank You reviewer! I DOUBLE and VERIFY that opinion/review!</li>
    <li> Read a few reviews of the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; Braun replacement blade set for the 8585 and couldn&#x27;t believe that the product was junk.  After diving further into the reviews and opinions of others, I purchased the replacement blade set for the 7000 series and it works perfect!  DO NOT hesitate to get this set for the Braun 8000 series</li>
    <li> There are 2 models in Series 3. This does not fit Series 3 340s-4, and is not mentioned clearly. I ended up buying this, and it won&#x27;t fit now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it is worth the hassle returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving this review so that others do not make same mistake again.</li>
    <li> works exactly as advertised!  the parts fit perfectly.  just what you need to keep a nice clean and close shave.</li>
    <li> I ordered a replacemment head for my Braun 340 series 3 razor. I recieved a head labled series 3 30B. The problem is it is 2 sizes to small. The internal working are completely different. I even found my razor on Amazon and clicked on replacement head and it showed me and it was the same head I recieved. the new head is 1/2 and inch shorter. It mounts completely different than the original head. I am not satisfied and would like the correct head sent for replacement.</li>
    <li> Why they were out so fast...?  oh yea we know... $..&lt;br /&gt;all came as excepted ... will be back soon.... I love my razor...!!!</li>
    <li> Searched and found Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000) to have a great write up. Cutters working fine</li>
    <li> Took too long...but good product.</li>
    <li> The foil cover on my razor was snagged in a fall.  I read the reviews and decided this was my best choice.  I installed the kit and my razor is like new again.  If I ever need another replacement, this will be the one I order.</li>
    <li> Braun needs to get there act together on model numbers, as I have made several attempts to buy for my .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this electric razor for years. I replace the foil and cutter about every 18 months and it always works fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun 8595 for at least  7 years now and buying the 8000 series or 51s replacement foil/cutters.  I agree with the other reviews concerning the poor quality of the recent replacement foil/cutters.  It seems like only 1 out of the last 3 I&#x27;ve bought worked properly.  It also seems like they are getting worse and not lasting as long.  It felt like it was only cutting every other hair and It was taking longer and longer to shave.  I did notice that if I just lightly touched my face with the razor it shaved a lot better.  That being said, I think this 30b foil and cutter does a better job but not great.  To get that close smooth shave in a couple areas I still do a quick dry shave with a disposable razor after I&#x27;m done with the electric.  Yeah, I know, but actually its not as bad as it sounds once your face gets used to it.  And it saves a lot of time trying to get that close shave with the electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Watch out when ordering cutter replacements for Braun electric shavers because there are numerous versions of Series 3.  One would think Series 3 would be sufficient, but there are numerous different replacements versions for various Braun Series 3 shavers.  This one, &amp;#34;30b&amp;#34;, is NOT for the Series 3 340s-4 and once you open the package thinking it will fit it&#x27;s YOURS (no return).  I&#x27;m rating it 2 stars only because in trying to find the replacement blade I simply picked the 340s shaver and the amazon note when you order showed this as what you also might want.  So the 30b is what I ordered.  Wrong...  Hopefully the 32b I just ordered is for the 340s-4...Never have had this kind of trouble with my Panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> Apparently I mistakenly ordered 30B instead of 32B, so the product will not work and it could have been my fault.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are for the BEST electric razor on the market. I&#x27;ve had this machine for over 25 years, and it still works as well as the day I bought it! I replace the blade and screen every couple years, but it still functions as a fully portable, rechargeable unit and still has the ORIGINAL internal batteries! AMAZING!</li>
    <li> perfect. came quickly</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! This product will not fit series 3, 800 models regardless of what other comments might say. I&#x27;m sure it works fine on the proper application.</li>
    <li> Swapping out the old blades /guards is a must. Way Overpriced, but worth it to get a nice clean shave! Its just sad when it comes to shavers/razors that manufactures overprice replacement blades this much, the reality is it costs them a couple buck to make it. Oh well!</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace my Braun 7505 razor blade and head cover and was worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit, but it works perfectly.  The only reason for four star&#x27;s is because I was hoping to see a bigger price break by going through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews I decided to get this rather than the series 5 for my 8781. The black plastic on the foil assembly doesn&#x27;t match my razors color but foil and the blades fit fine and the razor shaves like it did when it was new.</li>
    <li> Excellent overall purchase experience!</li>
    <li> Keeps your shaver close to you, and in top condition at recommended change intervals. Easy to replace.</li>
    <li> It is amazing how smooth this foil gets my face.  My wife says it feels smooth as a baby&#x27;s .....</li>
    <li> My husband has had this razor for many years and this saved us from having to buy a new razor system.  Perfect match replacement and easy to swap out.</li>
    <li> Turned my older shaver in to a new shaver. Super replacement product that gives smooth shaves. I highly recommend this replacement pack.</li>
    <li> I know the quality was great. I made a mistake and ordered the part for the wrong series Braun razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting these for a number of years now. They always deliver, and we are very happy with our Braun shaver!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews of people using this on their 5 series and i bought it for my 5 series. Good thing i listened, cuts just like new.</li>
    <li> The open pattern on this foil makes this one of the fastest shaves for my thick beard that I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s faster than a blade and some of the more expensive panasonic and Braun models.</li>
    <li> It is a very good alternative to the Series 5, at a lower price point.  I also believe it delivers a better shave.</li>
    <li> The cutting abilities of this product (this exact listing from Amazon) are terrible.  In looking at the blades, it&#x27;s nothing like my old razor.  I&#x27;m 99% sure I got a counterfeit product.  Watchout!</li>
    <li> Is the old razor just not cutting very well any more?  You need new cutters.  Is your razor cutting or scratching your face, or does your screen (foil) have places where it is worn through?  You need a new foil.  If you have not replaced these parts before, you will be amazed what a difference it makes.  If you have, then you already know; you also know the kind of prices they ask for these at the stores.  Compare the prices here to what they want at the store.  Sure, you don&#x27;t get the immediate gratification of going and getting it right when you want it, but you get a package in the mail.  Who doesn&#x27;t like that?</li>
    <li> Meets my expectations and good value for the money. I would recommend this to others and I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> The best cutter on the market, I have been using the Braun for years and can not find a better electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how you really give ratings to a foil and cutter...but considering how yucky my razor had become over the years, the difference was night and day!  So how could I NOT give it a top rating!?  :)</li>
    <li> I received 32B instead of the 30B listed in the item description.  The 32B foil doesn&#x27;t fit my 4000 series razor at all.  Sending the item back for a refund has been an issue because the item was shipped in a padded envelope that was torn open, so I need to find a box to put it in and I also have to go through the hassle of finding a UPS drop-off to take it to.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my Braun 8985 Total 360 shaver I bought in 2006, 7 years old and still going strong. I read the reviews for the Replacement Pack for the 8985 and more than once it was mentioned that the Braun Series 3 , 30B (7000/4000 Series) would fit my shaver and for over half the price I took the chance and ordered the Replacement Pack 30B for $19.99 and included free shipping also.&lt;br /&gt;Received today 10/31/13 the day it said it would arrived, since my old foil cutter cover had two holes in it I’ve been waiting to shave till it arrived, opened packet and installed it into the shaver and went to shaving, I strongly agree (as others) it was a closer cut than the original 8985 head I had replaced before which has been over two years.&lt;br /&gt;For less than half the original 8000 Series Replacement Pack Price you can’t go wrong, even if I have to reorder in the next year or so I will reorder the 30B Series 3 Pack in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;Only other thing I have to say is the clear plastic travel cover doesn’t fit and lock on like the 8985 foil head, but it does fit over it good enough and will stay on somewhat ok, but to me it isn’t a draw back for not ordering the 30B replacement pack.</li>
    <li> Both the foil and cutter block fit my Braun Shaver 7680 perfectly and produce a very close shave. No problems at all after 3 days, as good as new.  Highly recommended for 7680 model!</li>
    <li> This is what i expected to get with my selection of this product. Please continue to do the same moving forward. It serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for worn out foil and cutter.  Hard to find this replacement locally, so purchased on Amazon for an easy, perfect fit.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ruined the foil on my husbands razor and tried to find the part locally but had no luck.  I was happy to find it on Amazon (the foil came with new blades) and my husband said he hadn&#x27;t realized how much he needed to change the foil and blades because the new ones gave him a much better shave.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t even aware that these blades could be replaced.  the installation was a snap and the razor works great now no problems).</li>
    <li> Brought my razor back to new condition.  Braun razors are one of a few products that are actually worth buying replacement parts.  They last for ever, and a new foil and cutter will bring it back to a like-new shave.</li>
    <li> It actually fit the product it was made for and when I turned on the razor and stuck it to my face, whiskers were cut.  You would have to try it to believe it.</li>
    <li> Right part for my razor and OK price-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why I need to use so many words to complete the review but it&#x27;s done now</li>
    <li> This worked great with my 8585 model. Very smooth and gentle. The recommended replacement from braun was very inconvenient and it would pull the facial hai almost to the point of tears. I was about to buy another shaver but gave this a try and its wonderful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like having a new shaver.</li>
    <li> UnabIe to find this item in the stores, due to the fact that the shaver is a discontinued model, I ordered the replacement head as a gift for my husband for Christmas, not expecting it until after Christmas since I ordered it late.  Wow!!! Was I surprised, happy and impressed with the speed of delivery to have recieved it the day before Christmas. My husband was a happy man, to be able to get a nice smooth shave again and not have to replace his Braun shaver for a newer model.</li>
    <li> It fit his old Braun razor, could not find a replacement here in town.does anyone know if they sell the replacement bath</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old blade was until I got this replacement. Shaving is (almost) a pleasure again.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to make my razor functional with a close shave again. Much cheaper than getting a new razor.</li>
    <li> Reviewers recommended this over original replacement model. Found this model didn&#x27;t pull and catch on my face as much as the original.</li>
    <li> Watch what you buy might not fit</li>
    <li> The foil is very rough on my face the old one I was trying to replace is 15 years old old twice as good.</li>
    <li> completely wrong. your website does not give specific data for blades. my shaver is a 3 series but the foil does not fit. So basically you failed me here amazon. no more purchases from me&lt;br /&gt;bye!</li>
    <li> Fantastic buy.  Enjoy shaving again. Plan on reordering soon. Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This new foil and cutter works much better than my 3 year old foil and cutter! No complaints here.</li>
    <li> its a braun part, easy to buy, works great, price was competitive, no delivery issues. it cuts clean and close. does what its suppose to do!</li>
    <li> Excellent service from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Braun itself should make it easier to be certain which foil and cutter set applies to a specific model.&lt;br /&gt;I have replaced many sets, yet was uncautious enough to think the 7 Series applied to my razor.</li>
    <li> This is my 5th replacement.  I have been using this shaver for about 10 years and a new foil and cutter has always put it back like new.</li>
    <li> It is as described by seller and it perfectly fit my shaver. I received it in original packing and it was delivered very fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for over 20 years. I love their product and buy these new blades once a year.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have liked my Braun Series 3, but it is getting harder to find the replacement foils. These are a bit pricey, but I was glad to get them.</li>
    <li> It does what it is suppose to do.  Provides a good close shave.  Leaves face feeling soft &amp; smooth after each shave.</li>
    <li> I prefer this series 3 on my 8950 rather than the more expensive recommended replacement by Braun. I actually think it gives a better shave.</li>
    <li> As expected, the cutter works well and enables me to keep the shaver, which is perhaps the best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun for about 20 years, and the blades really do last about 18 months. I could tell quite a difference with the new blades, as apposed to the old blades. The price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 4745, and I usually order the 4700 series replacement foil and cutter. This time I tried the Series 3 that says it fits both 7000 and 4000 shavers. Well, it works better than the original foil, especially on older thicker beards. I took a magnifying glass and compared the 2 foils. The holes on the the 4700 are smaller and arranged in a beehive-honeycomb pattern. The series 3 has LARGER holes in a circular-triangular type pattern. Very, very happy.Also I use 2 Remington products with this shaver and they are the shaver saver spray and the face saver short stick powder.Powder goes on the face, and spray the inside of the foil, do both before each shave.Let me know what you think, I think it&#x27;s the best combo yet and beats remington.(Remington foils wear out quicker and develop breaks in my experience and the cutting holes are too small.)</li>
    <li> New blades make a difference. This product does very good job.</li>
    <li> Thanks. very good quality. I received it very fast. This made my older shaver work like new again. It takes seconds to install.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here. Everything went smoothly with this transaction. Attaching the parts is as simple as 1, 2, 3 and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> The foil fits fine and is exactly like the original, but the blade is different in that they&#x27;re flat wide pieces of metal that don&#x27;t give a close shave.  The original blade cut very well.</li>
    <li> I was using the original blade and cutter that came with my Braun 8985 until it recently broke.  Tried to get a replacement blade only to find that it has been discontinued, and Braun was recommending the 51S as the replacement part.  Read a lot of negative reviews on the 51S blade and cutter and decided to go with the Combi 30b unit.  It shaves me very well.  Better than the original blade did!  Very happy with this unit.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my dad. They fit his razor with no problem. Will purchase again. Item as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun since 2002 purchased it at Camp Doha, Kuwait. It has been around the world a few times including a few deployments with the California National Guard and survived. The foil works well with new pattern.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this unit for my 8585.  I switched over to this after the new model specifically for the 8585 starting pulling hairs when shaving.  I noticed that this model now has the wider cutter blades that others indicated caused the pulling and was concerned I would fall to the same fate.  I popped it in and it works just fine.  I would say that it doesn&#x27;t cut quite as closely as the cutter block I just took out but still shaves just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure this makes a difference but when I first got the cutting block, I turned it on without cleaning/lubing for about a minute total.  I was just doing this so that I could trigger my cleaning base to go into clean mode.  It never did and now I&#x27;m wondering if me running it dry allowed the blades to seat better with the foil.</li>
    <li> It seems that the Braun blades wear out very fast compared to a Wahl or Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I Would not reccommend this shaver as the Blades are very expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my Series 5 foil and cutter after reading reviews by many that it is superior to the Series 5 replacement. It fit and works perfectly on my Braun 8975. I think it was a little cheaper too!</li>
    <li> Is an exact replacement.Seems to be slight engineering improvements from the original and the last one I bought</li>
    <li> New foil design gives a closer &amp; better shave then previous verions of replacement foils and blades for the Series 3.</li>
    <li> Product does what I expected it to do. Can recommend it based on my use of it. Gives a good save.</li>
    <li> This is a great foil and blade. I have been using my braun for 8 years now. I will probably buy a couple more replacement sets before they stop making them.</li>
    <li> While this has not been used as the set (shaver and Foil/cutter), I am confident it will be A-1. This combination will leave the user very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> updates shaver without buying new one.  Just what is needed.  Saves the cost of buying new shaver, motor and battery are fine, just need to update parts that wear over time.</li>
    <li> An easy way to rejuvenate the performance of the shaver.  Replacing the foil and cutter block regularly keeps the shaver cutting cleanly and prevents painful tugging and pulling.</li>
    <li> It just fit like the original. Quality of package very good&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping. Like instant gratification.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Will recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> Original manufacturer&#x27;s accessory, so it&#x27;s top of the line quality.  Great price too.  Way cheaper than what it would have cost me at the local drug store.</li>
    <li> Good working replacement. Will definitely buy more in the future. Braun is a high quality brand, and it has never disappointed me.</li>
    <li> this item did not fit sent it back.</li>
    <li> I replace the foil and cutters about once a year and these last well and cut well for that period of time after shaving almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans easily and does the job you would expect. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this combo for my 8985. Fit was perfect and shave was beautiful. Thanks everyone for the heads up on this replacement.</li>
    <li> Makes my shaver work like its new</li>
    <li> This head was perfect and so much cheaper than even the box stores.</li>
    <li> Fellow shavers you can buy these just about anywhere for TWICE the price.  From Amazon you get 2 of them for that money.  They appear to be genuine Braun and so far sharp and smooth.  One Caution...read the small print in order to get the correct replacement for your shaver.  I have a 7500 series that takes a Series 3 replacement.  Perhaps the Braun packaging dudes do not shave.  Look at the subscription deal as well, replacement delivered every 3 months or so, better deal.</li>
    <li> The product is great but I mistakingly ordered 30B instead of 32B.So I am returning it and ordering the correct item instead.</li>
    <li> I hesitated before trusting the other comments here regarding this cutter and foil fitting the 8000 series shavers but I took that chance and am very happy that this does indeed fit my 8995 shaver. I looked closely at the blades as compared to my old 51S 8000 series cutter and honestly they look just about identical. The foils however are different. This foil is black and not aluminum like the 8000 series foils but the foil hole pattern is different as well. I am not sure whether the perceived improvement in shaving performance with this cutter/foil is due to the 7000 series foil differences in hole pattern from the 8000 series foil. The 7000 series foil appears to have a more random or scattered hole pattern than the 8000. IN any case, my shaver does seem to cut slightly better now than it did with a new 8000 series cutter and foil. Strange that it would be so but I am not going to worry about it. Thanks to all for the good advice.</li>
    <li> Finally got my old shaver shaving like new again.  Heck, it cut so close that it irritated my skin... just like when I first started using electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Silly me - I went to the Amazon page for the Braun Series 3 340s shaver that I bought here last year, thinking there would be a link to the correct replacement foil. Sure enough, there were two separate links to this product, stating that the 30B is the correct replacement part for my shaver. WRONG! It ain&#x27;t a thing like the foil/cutter for the 340s. So maybe it&#x27;s my fault for believing Amazon and I really should have done further research. Lesson learned. Just FYI for those who have the Series 3 340s wet &amp; dry shaver, you need item #32S (silver trim) or 32B (black trim). I called Braun. (By the way, the manual for this shaver at the Braun website says the 30B is the correct part! Maybe Amazon isn&#x27;t entirely to blame.)</li>
    <li> I envestigated at BRAUN site and ordered!! It didn´t fit. I should have bouhgt the 32s!! once Iread the manual!!</li>
    <li> I have never been disappointed with any Bruan product I have purchased.</li>
    <li> No problems with it at all. Works like a charm, got foil and cutter. Will buy again when needed, price was too good to pass on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave feels extra smooth like I bought a new shaver</li>
    <li> My current foil had holes &amp; thus sting when I shaved. I had to replace it &amp; found this Series 3 to be compatible with my current Series 7000 shaver but at a better price.</li>
    <li> I considered simply buying a new shaver, and in fact experimented with another brand. But when this replacement came, I was more satisfied with this. It considerably improved the performance of the Braun shaver, 11 years old but still going strong!</li>
    <li> this replaces the cutting head so given the motor is running, you get a new razor for a lot less than say, buying a new razor. A lot less. Don&#x27;t forget to lube. You knew that.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 30b 2 years ago, not knowing that was what I would get. I ordered the following, specifically to get the OEM replacement, but was sent the 30b instead: [[ASIN:B000050FDX Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 years, and this razor is still giving me good shaves. I may order another replacement blade again soon, but when I do it will be another 30b. I&#x27;m pretty pleasantly surprised...clearly not the original equipment replacement, but it&#x27;s worked out great for me (3-4 shaves a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like your Braun 8000 series, don&#x27;t be afraid of this non-standard replacement!</li>
    <li> This is not for the 7000 series.I have the 7680 and it&#x27;s to small.It fits and works but the cutting part is smaller then the last one I had.Will not be buying it again.I wish these people who are selling this would know what the heck they are talking about.I would send it back but it will cost more then it&#x27;s worth.Bad buy!</li>
    <li> This replacement pack Works great with my shaver. I am looking forward to additional years of use from my Braun.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product at a retail store for a little more money and it lasted much longer than the ones that were ordered online. After only about 2 weeks use, it started to get dull. I kept it clean and lubed. After 2 shipments, I realized that this product is possibly a sub-standard factory second that possibly failed their quality control standards, but was good enough for retail after a discount was applied. Braun makes an excellent shaver. But, my overall experience with mail-order parts has been less than satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I have been using shaver with dull cutters and pitted foil for some time now.  I did not realize that replacing these items could return my shaver to like new cutting ability.&lt;br /&gt;It works like new again.  I don&#x27;t have to use blades to pick up what electric shaver missed.  My wife is happier with my closer shaves.</li>
    <li> I had looked for the replacement Braun Series 3 combo 30 B pack and had a hard time finding outlets which handled this product.  So to the internet and found what I was looking for and at a good price, plus they sent some discount coupons for another vendor that I use and I saved even more money which has paid for the shaver heads...</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and worked as described!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Braun 4700 shaver for close to four years and have purchased two of these replacement foil/blade sets.  In the past, I&#x27;ve quickly moved from other electric shavers (Norelco) back to conventional blades.  Braun&#x27;s shaver holds up after years of daily use, and the replacement foil/blades work very well.  As another reviewer points out, generally the replacements don&#x27;t seem to hold up as well as what comes with the shaver; however, I&#x27;ve never owned anything as consistent, or anything I&#x27;d hold up against a conventional razor with hot water, etc.  Not only is the shave quite good, I also feel like I&#x27;m getting a great deal when I compare spending $30 every year to year-and-a-half to spending untold dollars on disposal razors or blades.  It should also be noted that there are several replacements for the 4700 shaver that have slightly different packaging.  This specific one seems more substantial than the last one I purchased.</li>
    <li> Good price for a standard product.  Delivered on time and in good condition.  I change out my cutter block and foil once a year to get back to comfortable shaving.  I have had my Braun for more than 10 years and still get smooth, close comfortable shaves with the replacement pack.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3 Combination 30B Foil &amp; Cutter Replacement Pack, is poor value for the money spent.  Very much like the original product and the razor it fits.  The sharpness doesn&#x27;t last .  The actual razor&#x27;s instructions state to replace the Foil &amp; Cutter within 18 months, well I had to purchase the replacement within 9 months of ownership.  I shave every other day, so if I used it daily it would have lasted only about 5 months.  But I must shave, I guess I&#x27;ll just have to go back to the regular, non-electric, shaving blades.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit to a razor I thought was broken.  Shaves clean and neat.  Came timely and packaged well.</li>
    <li> It will on occasion rip a hair right out of your chin at the most in oportune times.  I never shave backwards with this otherwise hair pulls are brutal.  This is about the third one I&#x27;ve replaced.  I have the #5 braun but I&#x27;ve read that the #3 series pulls beard hair less.  What I can&#x27;t figure out is why did the first, original blades not yang out beard hairs at all.  I suppose it&#x27;s a way to make us re purchase a brand new one. That&#x27;s sadistic if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Wish I had know about this a long time ago; great to finally change my Braun blade after 5 years; great shave</li>
    <li> Bought a Braun 7526 many YEARS ago, and a refurb at that... ( ~$40 as I recall), and it has worked well for me for longer than I can say...I&#x27;d guess 6 years...+ or - 2  years?&lt;br /&gt; When it started taking me a long time to debeard (time is relative!) I thought I was due a new shaver ($$$ these days!).&lt;br /&gt;Plus the batteries gave up recharging, and basically became a corded shaver, but that&#x27;s OK with me because...&lt;br /&gt;This product fits perfectly, and I feel I have a new razor, (still corded) but shaves like new :)</li>
    <li> Used to be able pick these up at Walmart, but no longer at ours.  It&#x27;s always great to have new blades and foil after a year of use.  I also use shaver saver to clean and lubricate every other shave or so.  Good quality and wonderfully sharp.</li>
    <li> My shaver works like new</li>
    <li> Fits my razor perfect.  I&#x27;ve purchased several of these over the years and each one has made the razor like new again.</li>
    <li> Excellent fi on my raszor!!!</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun customer for always, all their products are good, this older model shaver still works great, and I continue replacing head and cutrer, I also have the newer model, also works great, at 80 years, they will outlive me I am sure.</li>
    <li> This was not the right replacement for the razor that I have.  I need to switch it for the right one.</li>
    <li> The new cutter gives me a nice close shave, love it.This is the second one that i bought good deal.</li>
    <li> My shaver is about 8 years old. This is the 3rd replacement cutter I&#x27;ve purchased for it, and it fits perfectly and performs even better than the original. In a world where practically every gadget that is over 3 years old is ancient history, Kudos to Braun for continuing to make parts for older products.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.  This is the best foil shaver I&#x27;ve ever used for wet shaving. Makes the daily drudgery of shaving a lot more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Great job!  Swift delivery</li>
    <li> Some reviews were not very favorable. I have no problem with mine. Of course I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Found this foil/cutter to be a better fit for my 8500 series. The foil is stronger, lasts longer and does not pull your hair, it is also a lot cheaper than the recommended by Braun.</li>
    <li> The labeling is very confusing. Series 3 foil does NOT fit Series 3 shaver? Are you kidding me? It fits Series 4 and 7? Huhhhh? Well, I wasted the money as it cannot be returned after opened. I wonder if that is part of Braun&#x27;s calculation or they are just that stupid.</li>
    <li> This cutter will not give ma as close of a shave as my 2 or 3 year old cutter and foil</li>
    <li> Still working great after at least a year.</li>
    <li> I never changed my shaver head since I&#x27;ve bought it a few years ago and I could feel the burn when the dull blades would require a lot of effort to cut my facial hair. After replacing the head I was amazed how smooth it glides and cuts like butter, and my shave no longer burns after.</li>
    <li> i have the 7526 shaver this is the correct blade &amp;foil for this shaver .I buy 2 and save money</li>
    <li> Refills were a perfect fit for husbands razor. His screen had a knick in it and was cutting his face.</li>
    <li> Fast! Safe! and better prices that the local big box stores and i didn&#x27;t have to pay for the gas to go get it. Doesn&#x27;t it make sense to just &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; buy it? C&#x27;mon go ahead.....Do it.</li>
    <li> I requested a replacement for the braun 380s-4 series and got this product as the correct one on the Amazon search and ...ooopss! It appears that the correct one is 32B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously recommend AMAZON to fix the item description (even if they are not liable) and fix the algorithms of the search engine to the correct product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this replacement foil and cutter for my son via Amazon because we were on the go and had no time to shop around.  It does the trick.</li>
    <li> Circumstances indicated that I change from blade shaving to an electric shaver.  I secured the Braun product.  Most delighted with the shaver as it performs as well, (if not better) than a blade shaver.  I wanted to have a back up Foil and Cutter replacement on hand, as the instructions indicated that it should be changed every 18 months.    This product is carried by Amazon and the item was shipped immediately, well packaged and fairly priced.</li>
    <li> What the FRACK? The new cutter block has wider blades and it DOES NOT cut as well. I&#x27;ve been buying the same replacement cutter and foil for years. I don&#x27;t know why they changed it, but the new one seems rougher on the skin and does not cut as closely. Worse, there is no way you would know this before buying. The picture on the package and the Amazon listing does not show the cuter block at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING BACK THE OLD CUTTER BLOCK AND FOIL!</li>
    <li> I replaced my shaving head, as reccomended, after using my new shaver for a little over a year. The experience of shaving with a new head was like getting a brand new razor. This product meets every one of my expectations and I strongly suggest every Braun owner follow the manufacturer&#x27;s reccomendation for razor head replacement. It is a good value and you will be quite satisfied as I was.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement pack for my husband.  They changed the blade by making each section of the blade quite a bit thicker than it used to be.  This has caused the blade to not cut nearly as well as it used to.  He has went back to using the dull blade that he had before buying the new style.  This was a very costly and disappointing purchase considering he used it 3 or 4 times.</li>
    <li> I buy one of these every year to keep my shaver in tip top condition.  I was especially pleased when this product included the new and improved enhanced foil pattern.</li>
    <li> The Braun cutter and head was exactly as advertised and delivery was very prompt. Thanks</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I ordered and it works great.  I would recommend this to any one who has a need for this item.</li>
    <li> Replaced foil and blades, works like new</li>
    <li> Made my shaver feel like new again.  The shave was excellent with the new blade and foil.</li>
    <li> wrong foil replacements for shaver</li>
    <li> Worked great.  My razor was bought in 2007, this brought it right back to life like it was new.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good price.</li>
    <li> You forget just how good a shave you can get until you slip in a new cutter and foil. A comfortable shave again!</li>
    <li> My husband has had a Braun shaver for years and we just keep replacing the parts. Good as when we bought it.</li>
    <li> I should have bought this years ago. My old shaver got a hole in the screen, so I bought this replacement head. Wow. I had no idea what I was missing. Better than new!</li>
    <li> It was fine and what I expected</li>
    <li> This is a great and simple solution to getting that brand new shaver feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to install.  And once installed, it&#x27;s as if I bought a new shaver at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  I am thinking of stocking up since these replacement heads in my experience are not always around after a while.</li>
    <li> Ordered this replacement pack for my Braun SyncroPro 7505 on Friday and it was delivered on Saturday.  I did a quick clean up (using the little brush that came with the razor), installed the replacement parts and enjoyed a fantastic shave prior to dinner later that evening.  Parts were perfect and service was excellent!  Great Result!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and improved the razor&#x27;s function back to new.  Unfortunately, there are &amp;#34;Series 3&amp;#34; replacement razor heads in multiple types and you need to (evidently) pay very close attention to the picture of the head to make sure you are getting the Series 3 head for your razor.</li>
    <li> Works great! I had to read a number of reviews to make sure I got the righ one gor my razor, but that&#x27;s a problem with the Web site and product model naming not the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is the price or I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;re too thrifty to replace that old worn out foil and cutter that still &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; --- mine was WAY WAY overdue, but I always managed to get the shave done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AHHHHHHHHHH.... nice to have fresh cutter and foil again. Faster cutting, catches hairs better, smoother results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just spend the $20 already..</li>
    <li> Works well but... I wish that there weren&#x27;t so many missed hairs. It takes multiple passes and cleanup with a razor to get everything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun shaver for many years, and  loved it the best of all my shavers.  Thought it&#x27;s usage was over for me.  Bought another Braun &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; shaver.  On a &amp;#34;lark&amp;#34; saw the price for a Replacement pack on Amazon&#x27;s website, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  To my amazement.....it&#x27;s great!  With a cleaner/lubricant, my OLD shaver &amp;#34;runs and performs&amp;#34; like new.</li>
    <li> I only needed the foil but bought the combo foil/cutter and found that my old foil/cutter combo, that has been in use for the last 4 years, actually gives me a closer shave.  There&#x27;s a noticeable difference in the foil regarding how the holes are arranged.  Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the issue, but I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The Braun has a lot of advantages over the competition, but like any machine, parts wear out. Before you suffer cuts or scrapes, inspect screen &amp; cutter after cleaning. Replace as needed.  I received one of each, in a sealed Braun pkg. It seems to be OEM quality, works fine even 6 months later. I will order my replacements this way from now on.</li>
    <li> The quality of Braun is always good. And it lasts for a long time. Would recommend this product to anyone that needs it.</li>
    <li> Fits as advertised.  Much better shave than original foil</li>
    <li> i have an old braun series 7526 and been having trouble finding replacement foil at local stores, usually its sold out &#x3D;(. i found one of these online and fit on my old shaver without problems! the shave was smooth!</li>
    <li> This is not the manufacture&#x27;s recommendation replacement for my model 8975 , but is the one recommended by users.&lt;br /&gt;It works fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun&#x27;s 7500 electric shaver for years. This is the first time I need a replacement Foil/Cutter. The product I bought looks a slightly different from the original one, but fits perfectly and works great. Hopefully, it would last that long.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for about 15 years.  I started with the 7526 and then when the batteries died I switched to an 8985.  When I went to replace the blade on the 8985 I got the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; style blade that would hurt every time I shaved because it would pull my hair and not shave it well.  I then found this \\&quot;older\\&quot; style blade and as soon as I installed it my 8985 was back to normal.  My screen recently got a larger hole in it and the razor started to pull my hair.  So I went to order another of these blade and screen combo&#x27;s only to hear from other users they stopped selling the older style blade and have switched to the newer one that does not work for me.  So I did some research and ended up buying this instead [[ASIN:B005DKKBUG B005DKKBUG]] you can look at my review of the product comparing it directly with the 8985.  Suffice to say, for me, it works great!</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Always lasts a couple of years. Very fast shipping. Always get a great shave with these blades. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These were just what I needed for my Braun shaver.  Very happy to have found them at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I found it as good as the previous one I purchased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the kind. I love this product and how it work.</li>
    <li> Bought this to get off the scruff and the packaging and shipping was great as was the product itself. Clean and easy shave as expected from Braun and comfy. I enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> Fitment was perfect.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> great product good price !!!!</li>
    <li> Good price, good packaging.  Delivered ad promised.  I would have no problem ordering again, or recommending to friends.</li>
    <li> Consistently a good deal price wise and does the job nicely when you replace it about every 18 months.  This is my 4th or 5th replacement and I have never been disappointed with the performance or life of the product.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely manner and was as described! 100% satisfied! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Worked as expected. Makes my Braun feel new again.</li>
    <li> Perfect and almost 1/2 the price walmart was charging for the same thing.  Don&#x27;t know how they do it and don&#x27;t care.  Great value.</li>
    <li> worked perfect in my razor, was a great price and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t fathom what is going on here, but this unit is not even close to fitting my 8585. The cutting block is at least 1/8\\&quot; narrower than mine and I am forced to send it back.</li>
    <li> Update 7 October 2012&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware - my most recent purchase of this replacement pack (June 2012) contained the \\&quot;wide\\&quot; blade cutter.  This is the same type of blade as in the official replacement pack for the 8585 and it is completely ineffective.  I even bought another replacement when I was traveling because it was taking too long to shave...same result.  This picture shows the difference between the two types of blades:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo4AIXSC44WNNE/B001VH6F9G&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get my razor to work better I had to go to the store and look at the cutters myself to find the thin blade cutter.  I found it on a 31s replacement pack.  Note that the 31s foil does not fit the 8585 so I had to use the foil I already had, which is fine since it was only a few months old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why Braun is messing with success but the wide blade cutter works horribly...other reviews note this as well.  If the entire product line moves to the wide cutter I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do...switch razors probably.  I really don&#x27;t want to - I love the cleaning unit.  I&#x27;ve got at least a year to figure it out, though, since I just bought a new cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7 January 2012&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased another one of these and it works as well the one I reviewed over a year ago.  I noticed that it started taking longer and longer to shave - at least twice as long as it took with new blades.  I&#x27;m happy to report that time I spend shaving is again much less and still no whisker pulling.  I still recommend this foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 8 months ago I purchased this replacement cutter for my Braun 8585: [[ASIN:B0002MQ9GK Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock Replacement Parts for Braun&#x27;s Activator Razor Models 8595 and 8585]].  As soon as I replaced the cutter and foil the razor started pulling whiskers when I shaved.  It wasn&#x27;t an every day occurrence, but if I skipped a day of shaving the next time I shaved it would hurt, as the razor pulled whisker after whisker.  I also had more nicks too, something that was rare before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking about replacing my years-old 8585 when I saw reviews that said this cutterblock and foil will end the whisker pulling.  I figured buying this was cheaper than a new razor so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutterblock fit just fine in my 8585 and is the same size as the blade I replaced.  The foil likewise fits perfectly, though the screen is a different design.  The exterior plastic is a different color than my 8585 but I don&#x27;t care about that...I just want a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved a two-day&#x27;s growth without a single pull, for the first time in 8 months.  What a relief!  The shave was closer too.  My old razor cuts like it used to, so I don&#x27;t need to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your 8000 series razor isn&#x27;t cutting like it used to, give this a try.n&#x27;t an every day occurrence, but if I skipped a day of shaving the next time I shaved it would hurt, as the razor pulled whisker after whisker.  I also had more nicks too, something that was rare before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking about replacing my years-old 8585 when I saw reviews that said this cutterblock and foil will end the whisker pulling.  I figured buying this was cheaper than a new razor so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutterblock fit just fine in my 8585 and is the same size as the blade I replaced.

What a relief!  The shave was closer too.  My old razor cuts like it used to, so I don&#x27;t need to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your 8000 series razor isn&#x27;t cutting like it used to, give this a try.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple about a plain and simple product.  It works as expected.  My favorite part about ordering from Amazon, however, is how fast Amazon can ship things.  Call me old fashioned (I&#x27;m still mesmerized by the cell phone and email), but I think they are amazing!</li>
    <li> LIKE A NEW RAZOR NOW.</li>
    <li> I read reviews for the 8000 series replacement foil and cutter and it was recommended to use this one instead. I took their advice and they are right, it DOES fit perfectly. My shaver shaves like it&#x27;s brand new. In fact, it feels like a much smoother and closer shave than the original. The packaging says these are made in Germany. I guess the moral of the story is; if your packaging says it&#x27;s made in China, send it back!    Also, I bought this at Walmart because I needed it right away. They also had the 8000 series replacements that are now made in Germany (I guess Braun had too many complaints about the junk from China) but they are $15 more. If the 7000 series ones fit why pay more?</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 8585 several years ago and enjoyed a great shave every time.  The foil for the 8585 was fine.  Then, I got a  starndard foil replacement and my shaves were horrible.  I thought oh well, the next one will be better.  It wasn&#x27;t.  Thanks to the other reviewers, I realized that Braun had issues, as have been pointed out in their reviews.  Several reviewers suggested this foil even though it isn&#x27;t designed for the 8585.  It works great.  But, the color is black and doesn&#x27;t match the original silver.  If you need a color coordinated foil, then keep looking.  If you want to keep your 8585 and get a great shave, then this foil is for you.</li>
    <li> so glad I bought this my razor cuts like it did the day I bought it.</li>
    <li> Product was received as ordered, it even arrived a day or two before the estimated delivery date.  I took it out of the package plugged the blades into the shaver and put the screen on and shaved my husband.  It worked perfectly it gave a good close shave and we were very happy to have the shaver working as good as new.</li>
    <li> Braun&#x27;s own web site isn&#x27;t very good on this, but yes, the 30B will fit your model 8585.  Popped it on and gave it a quick test shave, worked fine, shaver is good again.</li>
    <li> This foil combo works great.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve shaved without getting a red rash and itch soon after!  Hopefully this series will stay around for a while.</li>
    <li> Makes an older shaver work like it did when it was new! Parts are easily switched out with no tools required.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same Braun razor for 10 years now. I just replace the blades every two years and it just keeps going. I noticed recently that Braun now recommends you replace the foil and cutter every 18 months (they used to say every 2 years) and I can see why. The new ones feel so much better than my dull 2 year old blades. They even sound better. Replacement takes about 8 seconds. It&#x27;s easy and makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to fit my shaver.  My shaver says series 3 but it has a different head than was sent to me.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this replacement.  It is kinder to the skin and costs less.  I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 10 year old series7000 razor.  Cuts great, but the connecting pin is a bit thin and the cutter comes out with the foil when you remove the foil for cleaning.  However, just grab the connecting pin and pull the cutter out of the foil.  No harm done; still the same great shave.</li>
    <li> Restores close shave without nicking face. Best to replace screen and cutter as a unit though screen usually wears out first. Good value.</li>
    <li> Ordered this replacement head because Amazon said it was the correct one for my Braun shaver. Wasn&#x27;t until I opened it up that it was obvious that it was not; Amazon had it listed incorrectly. I sent it back and Amazon only gave me credit for $5 out of the $21 I had paid for it because it was not in re-salable shape. How was I to know it was not the the correct head until I had already opened it? Amazon is usually so good about these things but it definitely dropped the ball on this one!</li>
    <li> I used this on my Braun 7526 and it fits perfectly, a smooth shave has become easier again, love it!</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and cutter works and fits perfectly with my Braun 3 Series shaver.  It saves a heck of a lot of money by just replacing the foil/cutter rather than the entire shaver.  I&#x27;ve now had my shaver for 5 years by replacing the foil/cutter every two years.  One thing is that the brand new foil/cutter leaves some gray lubricant residue on your face.  I haven&#x27;t tried washing the foil/cutter since I wash my face after shaving but for those who wash their face first and then shave, beware the first few times you use the new foil/cutter.</li>
    <li> Exactly like you buy in the store, but less expensive on-line. Braun is top quality.</li>
    <li> thanks to previous reviews i got this product to fit my 8000 series razor and it shaves like it was when it was new.</li>
    <li> Not the recommended replacement for my 8000 series razor but it IS the one that works. Read the other reviews to find out more about that. The head and blades work real well. By the time I replaced mine they were past due, had a small hole in the screen that was cutting into my skin. This replacement pack is very comfortable and faster too than worn parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/10/17:&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered another one and Amazon sent the 30B without the blades. Maybe they stopped making the 30B? Whatever, I now have the hassle of sending it back and paying for the postage for the return. I am afraid to re order because I don&#x27;t know what I will get and also it sounds like the wide blade is what comes with the 30 B now. The 30B is actually not the recommended replacement for my razor but it IS the one that works because it DID have the original blade design. This is just another case of the falling quality of care in business and in manufacturing of goods. A lot of money is spent on moronic practices of R&amp;amp;D to reduce quality in consumer goods. I&#x27;m sure there is a lot of money that goes into testing as well, but for what? to make sure the products do not work as well? At this point I think I am in need of a new razor.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> Delivered sooner than expected , works great . Thanks</li>
    <li> Nice to have a sharp clean blade again!</li>
    <li> This works great in a Series 3 shaver. Don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s been so much negative feedback, but I suspect either people aren&#x27;t used to a new blade yet, or they&#x27;ve bought the wrong blade/foil for their shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Mine fit great, worked great, and the price is fair. I have a second Series 3 in our other home, and won&#x27;t hesitate to order another set for it.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t attest to its longevity yet, but will keep my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> It says it serves for series 3 but it didn&#x27;t. Braun uses the same model designation for different razors. It&#x27;s very confusing when buying replacemt parts. It&#x27;s the second time I buy a new foil and cutter set that does not fit, even of it says &amp;#34;series 3&amp;#34;. Not cool.</li>
    <li> After neglecting my shaver for so long I thought I&#x27;d better replace the foil. All I can say is I should have done it years ago! I can&#x27;t remember it ever performing this well...</li>
    <li> My 10-yr old syncro razor didn&#x27;t work the same with this replacement part.  It&#x27;s designed slightly differently.  This is a Braun issue.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what you&#x27;d expect from Braun. Now my shaver is back to 100% and I don&#x27;t have to throw away a $300 product that I love.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Braun 7000 Series for 12 years now - I buy a new head every year, that&#x27;s how long this thing lasts me. Top quality still...</li>
    <li> This worked fine; no problems, smooth cutter. Recommended without reservations. Just make sure it will fit your razor before purchase!</li>
    <li> Delivered in one day and fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> fit my braun shaver perfectly</li>
    <li> Excellent product - also fits Series 5000 Shavers at lower price.</li>
    <li> Just like a new razor!  Very happy.</li>
    <li> This foil/cutter set was needed to replace a holed-through foil on my older 7505.  It snapped into place easily and securely.  This package does contain a cutter with blades that are somewhat wider than the older ones being replaced but the shave was as good as a new shaver.  There was no noticeable performance difference (for me) between the older &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; blades and the &amp;#34;wider&amp;#34; new ones.  There are some design changes between old and new, but they did not negatively affect performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative reviews did have me wondering if it was better to just buy a new Braun or risk no-fit/poor parts.  This product completely restored the serviceability of the razor until some internal part dies, so I found it a wise investment.  If it were newer, I would consider buying a second spare set to not have to worry about the replacement in a year or so.</li>
    <li> They changed the design of the cutter to save money. The old foil gave me a great shave and I was completely satisfied. The new design is garbage. It pulls the hair out instead of cutting it and even after 20 minutes of shaving it looks like I haven&#x27;t done a thing. I would not recommend this as it is a waste of money. I have owned Braun shavers for almost 15 years now and will be replacing them with something else. The new cutter design took what was a great shaver and made it into a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Great way to save a fully operational shaver</li>
    <li> The product essentially allows me to have a new razor with a much better shave result.  I try to buy one every year.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Have had razor for several years, love it n replace foil etc apprx. Every 18 months. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> As discussed in the Customer reviews. this replacement pack, made in Germany, is a wonderful value for series 7000 razors !&lt;br /&gt;It works great at much less the price and for me it does give a smoother softer shave.</li>
    <li> thank you ill be back to buy again real soon thanks,</li>
    <li> I have a 7680 which I love, and this seemed great in the past.  For some reason, this time was different.  I have been using this for a couple months now and I feel as if I&#x27;m taking longer to shave, and it doesn&#x27;t really appear that I have shaved. Although my face feels pretty smooth, it just doesn&#x27;t look shaven.  If anyone is reviewing reviews, please let me know if I should be using a different replacement.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly and works great! My shaver now feels like new again!! I never believed I would actually look forward to my morning shave - isn&#x27;t it wonderful how we appreciate the small things in life...</li>
    <li> Feb 8, 2011: Fits my Braun 8985 perfectly! Very smooth and close shave. Shaves much better than the 51S/8000 screens that wear out every 6weeks without fail! I was extremely tired of replacing the screen 8 or 9 times a year and paying close to $45 a pop every time (over $360 a year!!). I saw someone else&#x27;s post here that it fit the 8975, took a chance, and am now very pleased at the result. Lets hope this screen lasts much longer than the 51S/8000 screens. I will post again if and when it develops a hole in it or every 6 months, whichever comes first, so we will will all see if it was worth the price and TCO.&lt;br /&gt;April 21,2011: It just developed a small hole in the screen today. So it appears to be no better than the 51S/8000 screens in terms of reliability. Although 1 sample is not an accurate way to gage reliability, I still prefer the much better shave I get with this screen, so I have 2 more on order.&lt;br /&gt;March 26, 2013: Well, my old 8985 finally died a while ago(runs, but doesnt move the cutter back &amp; forth), and so did my ancient Braun 5720 I had kept as an emergency backup so I ordered a new Braun 380S-4 based on the great reviews it got here on Amazon. Looks like my leftover 30b foil may fit the 380S-4, so I&#x27;m good to go on a replacement foil too!</li>
    <li> You can pay more for the same value, but why would you?  You can find these at most any &amp;#34;discount store&amp;#34;  You will have to pay more for it.</li>
    <li> Thanks to other reviewers I decided to give this a try on my 8975 and am getting a better shaves than with the original mfg recommended replacement head.  I am new to electric razors and didn&#x27;t know that hair pulls were not the norm.  I now get smoother painfree shaves with this head and it fits my razor perfectly.  The only difference is the black color vs chrome and the plastic head protecter fits a little looser but no big deal.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with my razor and replacing the head made it work even better.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Changing the foil and cutter head of the Braun shaver every 12 - 18 months is like getting a new shaver every time.  I&#x27;ve had a  Braun shaver for 10 years and it&#x27;s still the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Yes the price is a little high. But I knew that before I bought the shaver. Shipping time was very fast and shipping cost was reasonable. I would have to say I can not complain about this product or the supplier. I am very happy with both. But I did my homework first.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the past reviews of others that have the 8985 Braun. Their reviews were spot on. The 30b is a very good fit and great Foil and Cutter for a very close and comfortable shave at a very reasonable price. Thanks</li>
    <li> They work well with my shaver.</li>
    <li> These replacements don&#x27;t seem to give as good a shave as those I&#x27;ve previously purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still not bad, and much better than most other electrics I&#x27;ve used; just not as good as previous Braun refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s hoping they don&#x27;t continue to lose quality, or I&#x27;ll have to look for a new razer.</li>
    <li> Renews my over 10 year old Braun.  Easy removal for cleaning in water once every 3 months and regular cleaning every 2 weeks.  If you have a n older model Braun and replace the cutting works twice a year there is no telling how long itR will run.</li>
    <li> This is a simple order for replacement cutting block and foil for my Braun Shaver. The product was purchased at a reduced price and is an exact factory replacement. I am very happy with both the purchase and the transaction experience.</li>
    <li> After a bit of confusion since my razor is not the current model decided to order this replacement head and foil. Does an excellent job for anyone using the older Braun 8585 shaver model.</li>
    <li> Says it is for series 3 Braun, I have a newer series 3 Braun shaver and it does not fit.  $20 down the drain.</li>
    <li> have used this product for years and never a complaint.always purchased from amazon.the blades last at least one and one half years</li>
    <li> After reading a few reviews on the net and the first review for this product (Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000)), I bought one for my 8585. I just installed and used it 20 minutes ago and it actually works better than when I first bought it! Smoother, faster shave and smoother skin. I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> Fast speedy delivery and parts fit fine ..great feel after old foil tore.</li>
    <li> Following advice of other reviewers I have bought this for my 8585 - to replace the 51s, and it performed great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 51s has been worse that the original foil, also it has disintegrated after some 6 months of use and a flat steel bar popped out and up - away from the middle where the mid-blade is covered by the blue cover; however the blade somehow kept running after the failure(!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bad side, and as other reviewers have noted: the original 8585 clear cover is not matching this new foil - a groove is missing there...</li>
    <li> This shaver replacement was exactly as advertised and shipped quickly. Brand new in package and no surprises. Only thing is I wish these replacements lasted a little longer. My first one lasted me about 6mo - which is about double the expected time so I guess I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> My husband was extremely happy to be able to order this Braun Series 3, which he can&#x27;t find in stores anymore!!</li>
    <li> The 8k series cutter is horrible! After reading some reviews on the 8k series cutter and how the 7k series fits and works better I decided to get this cutter replacemnt. This cutter is definitely better, and I can now shave without the fear of the cutter pulling out my facial hair. This 7k series cutter is excellent but I only have one annoyance, and that is that the cutter housing is black while my shaver is silver/gray. This is because the 7k series shaver is black down the middle of the shaver. Makes it look kinda ugly but I rather have a good shaver that looks funky than a good looking shaver that doesn&#x27;t shave well.</li>
    <li> Not sure if these are fake counterfeit knock-offs, or they are actually made by Braun in Germany (they say made in Germany on the package), but these things are not like the half dozen previous ones I bought.  The old style cutter block is made from heavy gauge surgical grade steel wire looped in a coil and embedded in the block base.  These were really great and lasted a long time.  The one I just received appears that the cutter is stamped out of a sheet of thin steel folded over and attached to the block by 4 small rivets, one on each corner.  It doe&#x27;s not cut like the old one.  In fact, the brand new one seems to cut about the same as my old worn out one.  This really sucks because I really like the 4700 shaver and I wanted to keep it forever and just keep replacing blades.  I don&#x27;t want one of the shavers with all the bells and whistles and cost $300-$400.  The 4700 was perfect and gave an amazing shave with the old cutter block.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m gonna do going forward.  If this is what Braun has become, I will be disappointed because no other shaver could touch Braun in my opinion and it looks like I&#x27;ll have to look at a different brand now.</li>
    <li> Works like it should.</li>
    <li> Makes my old razor feel like new.</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun shaver for years.  The 30b replacement cutter used to last a year before needing replacement.  Now it needs replacement every six months.  I am convinced Braun is making them inferior so they are replaced more frequently.  The shaver is still a top brand, but the cutter is not the top quality it once was.</li>
    <li> $10 cheaper than Walm%r&amp;. OEM  replacement cutter</li>
    <li> Does not fit the 380s-4 wet/dry shaver. This is found several places on Amazon listed for that razor. It is not a fit for the 380s-4 wet/dry shaver.</li>
    <li> This item was shown with a braun razor that did not use this type of screen and therefore was useless to me.</li>
    <li> This item is difficult to find in my location.  I had to go to several store to find the foil and cutter to fit my shaver.  This was a real time and frustration saver Just make sure it is the right one for your Braum shaver(check the model nmber on the shaver itselft for model no.).</li>
    <li> As noted by others in other reviews, this item is not sold for my 8595 (Series 8000) razor, but it fits &amp; performs perfectly.  No complaints over the first few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This 30b works perfectly on my 7680 - delivers a really smooth, clean shave.</li>
    <li> It a newer version not the single thin blade that cut faster and quicker. Why replace the older and more efficient blade Braun.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the 7000 version and fits the 7526 model I have.  It is not quite as sharp and does not shave as cleanly as the more expensive 7 series cutter that I think, the manufacturer recommends.  This series 3 blade, though, will fit my 7 series shaver.  OK for the lower cost, but I like the cut of the 7 series blade better.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I was a little hesitant to purchase this even though I really didn&#x27;t have a new choice (other than buying a whole new shaver).  However, it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem a little louder when I&#x27;m getting into thicker parts of my beard/areas being shaved), but I&#x27;ve had absolutely NO issues at all.  Some people mentioned that they experienced a lot of hairs being pulled (ouch!).  I only had that happen ONE time since my purchase...which is less frequent than my prior foil/cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a replacement foil and cutter, just buy this and don&#x27;t waste time (like I did) reading all the negative reviews.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement for my Braun 8985 razor.</li>
    <li> It is everything I expected and arrived quickly and was in excellent condition. If i had to choose between good, better and best, I would choose best.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun Activator 8595 and to my dismay read all the terrible reviews about the supposed proper replacement for that razor. I instead purchased this product as many suggested it had the original &amp;#34;sharper&amp;#34; blade as opposed to the newer &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; blade. Well friends I just received my item today and it also has the flat blade. I compared it with the user images for this product (thanks for posting those by the way!) and it even has the identical half circles when viewing it from the side. Not sure what my next move is going to be, but I&#x27;ll probably head to a big box store and sort through their merchandise until I find one with the blade that works. Why Braun changed their formula is beyond me. Maybe I got the only black sheep in the bunch, but you have been warned.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun 8585 for several years and had no idea that the blades had become so dull. The new blades and screen have made the unit like new. This model fits the 8585 perfectly. It&#x27;s black instead of silver and gives the razor a new and improved look.</li>
    <li> All I need to keep the &#x27;ol Braun going!</li>
    <li> All is perfect, thanks</li>
    <li> Shaver is like new now.</li>
    <li> Watch out!  I bought this replacement cutter &amp; foil because its says &amp;#34;Braun Series 3&amp;#34; on the package and assumed it would fit my Braun shaver that says &amp;#34;Series 3&amp;#34; right on the handle.  Its a completely different part that does not fit at all.  The other thing that is confusing is when you are on the Amazon page for the model of shaver I own (340S), at the bottom of the page, it shows this replacement cutter &amp; foil as &amp;#34;Frequently Bought Together&amp;#34;.  That only reinforces that this is the correct replacement part but you will be disappointed when it doesn&#x27;t fit!  I see other comments from customers who were fooled like me. If you have a Series 3 model 340S or 380S, you need the replacement cutter #32S (silver) or 32B (blue).</li>
    <li> Exactly what it claims to be.  No surprises good or bad on this one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! The blades are not thin and sharp, and they don&#x27;t cut my beard...No need to get the foil, just get the blades for the earlier model that fits the same!</li>
    <li> Awesome for those looking for an alternative to use in their 8000 series shaver.  It is actually for the 7000 series, but works great in my Braun 8000 series shaver.  I had trouble finding a good deal with the listings for the 8000 series, and this 7000 series model 30B fits and works great.  The color on the 30B is black, unlike the 8000 series, but this foil and cutter works as good or better than any of the past blade combo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased previously.</li>
    <li> All as expected, fits my shaver and works well.</li>
    <li> Still providing the product for an older device.  All good.&lt;br /&gt;They do not seem to last as long as earlier versions</li>
    <li> I was excited to find these.  I had not been able to find these for my razor in the stores and I really like my electric razor even though it is considered ancient.</li>
    <li> Renew an older shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this razor for years and says it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever owned. His shave is close, no nicks on his skin and the replacement foil/cutter are much less than other razors and only needed about once a year. That&#x27;s with daily shaving.</li>
    <li> works great on my old braun...  I haven&#x27;t used any other shavers and/or replacement foil/cutter so I can&#x27;t compare, but this works well for me.</li>
    <li> Works fine on my series 5 razor. Smooth and comfortable with a 30% savings over the Series 5 direct foil replacement. Since I find myself never really getting 18 months of recommended use, I can now change this foil &amp; cutter on a yearly basis and justify the cost and maximize my comfort!</li>
    <li> Like the other reviews said this fit my 8595 perfectly. I am very pleased with the results. This provides a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Followed the advice from other reviews and this worked great. The fit was right on.  Thanks for saving me $$$.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product obviously an update on my previous foil</li>
    <li> Broke my old one. Great price and fits my 5yo shaver perfectly.</li>
    <li> The foil did not fit on my shaver</li>
    <li> My previous positive review still stands, as the one I bought 2 or 3 years ago is still working well, unlike the far inferior newer one I recently received, and have since returned. I hope the Braun folks get their act together, as this dip in quality is going to cost them a lot of former customers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put &#x27;em in, and have been getting good shaves ever since. The blades and the razor have given me years of dependable service, no complaints...</li>
    <li> makes the shaver like new</li>
    <li> Worked fine in my 8585</li>
    <li> so smooth while shaving</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Got my razor back to working as it should.</li>
    <li> I should have done it sooner.  The new foil and cutter work very well.  It pleasantly surprised me.</li>
    <li> My husband said it works just fine.  He was also glad that I have Amazon Prime as it came in two days and he really needed it.</li>
    <li> Received what I ordered. Arrived per your ETA. No damage to package and contents.</li>
    <li> The original part was silver metalic (which initially caused me to buy a wrong exchange part at Wal-Mart!). The current plastic version looks cheaper but serves well.</li>
    <li> Satisfactory we bought two since cannot find anywhere</li>
    <li> At last. I have found a way to replace the foil and blade for my Braun at a price that is great value. Being tired of paying twice the price and having to use the car to go pick it up from bloody SHAVERSHOP Aust.As a consumer I am truly over being ripped off by companies trying to make a 300% profit on every item they sell..Its just a shame I didn&#x27;t start shopping on the internet until just recently...Retailers in Australia my advice to you is to drop your profit margin or die..</li>
    <li> This replacement foil and cutter fits my husband&#x27;s Braun 8595 perfectly and is $10 cheaper than the \\&quot;proper\\&quot; replacement. While the foil is not identical to the original, it fits and seems to work just as well. The blades appear to be identical. I love saving money- especially when paying so much for a product that probably costs less than $5 to make.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my husband. He has one of the thickest five oclock shadows that I have ever seen and this refill works as well as if the razor was brand new! This is the only one that works for his thick beard. I would recommend this to anyone who shaves.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and very reasonably priced. Ships on time and is at my door shortly thereafter. Excellent quality product. I&#x27;m on the plan where it ships every 6 months. No need to place order. I love this feature.</li>
    <li> The item meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was originally going to purchase the series 5 foil for my series 5 550, but a lot of the reviews said that it wasn&#x27;t as good as the original foil/cutter. Some other reviews said that this one is better, so I bought it. My foil and cutter were many years old, and now the shaver performs so much better! It shaves closer and doesn&#x27;t tug. This fits almost perfectly on my shaver, the only issue is that the clear plastic clip-on cover does not fit anymore... Still a great replacement for the performance.</li>
    <li> First I will point out that I bought this because of other reviews and that it was confirmed to replace my head and cutter block on my 360 Complete Activator. With that, the standard replacement is the 51S which I did not purchase, but rather the 30B instead. There are two noticeable differences: first is the color of the plastic components. They are black as compared to the original which is silver--- makes zero difference of course. The second is the tooth shaped cutter in between the foils-- that is a big difference. The one major complaint is that the original cutting system would grab and yank out facial hair which hurts. It seemed to be related to that tooth shaped cutter, but either way I was ready at this point to buy a Panasonic. It was mentioned that this assembly does not grab hairs.... that I can attest to as I shaved as I always did and it did not grab once. I have a goatee and I usually shave my fave first before trimming it. Definite improvement and of course the 30B cutter is about $15 less than the 51S which is nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4-stars and not 5-stars is that I am still not 100% pleased with the way it cuts overall. I have used Norelco rotary razors and after switching to the Braun, I swore I would never go back as it was a huge improvement. The problem is that there ends up being particular hairs that it will not cut without going at a handful different attempts and angles. With that said, I still give the razor setup a thumbs up. Other than that it brought the razor back to life and no more pulled hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to dispel any myths--- it fits. I popped off my original parts and installed this without any issues. 5-seconds is all it takes to change the cutter and foil. The attachment post and everything were exactly the same and this part is made in Germany. And to reiterate, the only perceptible difference that you will see is the center saw tooth part and the color of the plastic--- otherwise it looks the same. If the rest of my razor is still functional in a year--- then I&#x27;ll buy another one of the 30B&#x27;s to bring it back to life otherwise, I may try a Panasonic to see how I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feb 2016: Just bought my third one and now that I look back, I do need to replace it more often. The last one lasted 2-years and was still going, just not as sharp as it could be. Once again, the price was right and I am happy with the results.zor is still functional in a year--- then I&#x27;ll buy another one of the 30B&#x27;s to bring it back to life otherwise, I may try a Panasonic to see how I like it.

    <li> The foil and cutter arrived quickly. It was the proper fit and it works very well and cuts like new. I would order again.</li>
    <li> From reviews here I purchased this for 8000 series expecting the older/better type blades. The item shipped with the newer blade design. Not a deal breaker, but different from other reviewers of this item.</li>
    <li> Needed replacements for my 8585 and found these.  I was a little worried because they aren&#x27;t marketed for the 8585 but they had reviews that they worked better than the original.  Well sure enough, these are much better.  The originals pulled hair everytime, but these ones are much more user friendly.  For some reason the oddly shaped holes in the foil are the key and haven&#x27;t pulled a hair yet; much better shaving experience!  The plastic is black which doesn&#x27;t match the razor, but the fit and finish are excellent.  If your are looking for 8585 replacements and came across these, BUY THEM, they are better than the originals.</li>
    <li> My old Coil had a hole on it while I only used it for about 6 months.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out why that happened, and don&#x27;t tell me my beard was that hard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the replacement coil, it serve its purpose, and I again can enjoy a clean cut job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, the price is a little high, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> This works well as a replacement for the 8985 foil &amp; cutter. The shave is much less abrasive than the foil &amp; cutter recommended by Braun.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the criticism about \\&quot;wide blade cutter\\&quot; is. The one I received looks like the one I was replacing. Shaving much smoother with new blade/foil</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on reviews instead of the 51s.  This was $12 cheaper and fits perfectly.  Only differences are plastic color on the foil is black instead of silver, the the divider strip on the foil is silver instead of blue.  I don&#x27;t know about large vs small holes, but the holes on the foil match exactly what I replaced on my 4 year old shaver. They seem small to me.</li>
    <li> I read somewhere in the reviews that this model would replace the shiny one my shaver uses. (And, it supposedly works better.)&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaper than the silver version, so I&#x27;m happy to save money.&lt;br /&gt;I think it looks cool to boot.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and thanks to those buyers who passed on the tip.</li>
    <li> One your replace your old ones, you can feel you got a new shaving machine.  Amazing performance now.  A replacement Foil and cutter for Braun 7526</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Thought new blades would allow me to use my razor, but these blades were terrible</li>
    <li> This is the worst cutter set I&#x27;ve ever bought for my shaver. The part is not the same as it was for ten years prior. It fits the shaver, but it cuts abysmally (you shouldn&#x27;t have to apply so much pressure to get a close shave with these shavers), and result is burning sensation on the skin (I shaved hours ago and my skin still feels raw). If you like the raw burning skin sensation, this is the cutter replacement for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference: in the past, the cutter head was a set of circular metal plates. Now those are replaced by a single sheet of metal with gaps in it, which simulates the design of the original cutters but fails to actually work like them. The metal is wider, resulting in fewer cutting edges along the width, and the fit seems less precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the labeled product in the past from this very same listing and didn&#x27;t have trouble, but those cutters were designed properly. Now with this redesign, I don&#x27;t know what else to buy. The other listing I almost bought from went through the same bait and switch on quality and the helpful reviewers directed other buyers to this listing. Now this one is compromised as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the heck, Braun?? These cutters suck! Why would you sell this over the version that was working well for over a decade? If you absolutely must raise the price, do so without giving us inferior product in the place of previously good product! Is this a way to push users of years-old shavers into buying a new shaver??</li>
    <li> Foil and cutters received in perfect condition, installed one set and my shaver is working like new.</li>
    <li> It makes the razor feel like it is brand new</li>
    <li> Makes my shave cut like when it was brand new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for my 8000 series shaver. It fits fine, does the job and the last time I ordered the one for the 8000 series, it lasted only three months before I needed to replace it. This one (my third time buying it) lasts about six months before I need to replace it.</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t seem as good as the original blades and foil.</li>
    <li> Makes shaver like new at 1/3 the price of new! My Braun was expensive new, and this product restored original quality.</li>
    <li> I just keep buying these. With them my Braun 4700 series shaver just keeps going and going. Very satisfied with the quality.</li>
    <li> I was not sure whether or not this would work with my outdated Braun but the 7000 series foil and cutter are a perfect match and it actual seems to work better than when brand new!!!! The shipping was extremely fast as well which makes this all the more amazing.</li>
    <li> very fast ship.&lt;br /&gt;Old braun razor turned new again.  Very easy to take off the old and put on the new...  ALL GOOD</li>
    <li> What more can I say? The unit now gives me fast smooth shaves again without tugging and pulling. A pleasure to shave again.</li>
    <li> My husband had had this razor for over 7 years and it still works like new.  I love that the blades last so long and it&#x27;d way cheaper than throw away razors/blades.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I needed exactly right part right fit works great.</li>
    <li> works great, perfect fit</li>
    <li> The 30b fits and works fine in my 8585.  Much smoother shave than the original and it costs less.</li>
    <li> this item was the wrong one advertised to replace the head on my razor.</li>
    <li> Nice to get a good shave again. I didn&#x27;t realize that the original had gotten so bad.</li>
    <li> Replacement was as good or fractionally better than the original equipment foil and cutter head. Very satisfied with performance so far.</li>
    <li> The foil/cutter kit has made my Braun shaving as close as when new so I&#x27;m delighted with the purchase.  Considering the cost of blades for 12-18 months makes this purchase a real bargain.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and the speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> Based on other recommendations, I tried this replacement pack with my Activator shaver. it is now over a month since the change and the new blades are performing in a extremely satisfying manner.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil and cutter worked perfect in my 7000 series shaver and would recommend to any one needing a replacement for their shaver.</li>
    <li> These new cutters breathe new life into an electric shaver.  This is the third to fifth cutter (I&#x27;m guessing) on a shaver that is over ten years old.  It just keeps chugging along.  The battery charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to, but it still gives a good shave. Money very very well spent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the current Braun 7680 for ~10 years now. An excellent shaver and this current screen cutter replacement performs the best compared to past version replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed is that this new combo would leave a black residue on my face following. It looks like a metal on metal rub residue from the fresh blade being in contact with the screen surface. Past screen blade replacements didn&#x27;t do this. Washes off easily enough so we&#x27;ll see how it wears in with more use.</li>
    <li> I had to return the blades as they did not fit my electric shaver, although all the numbers worked out and I thought I had ordered the correct item. Obviously I will have to take the shaver to a store and have someone knowledgeable about the product determine what I need.</li>
    <li> After receiving this in the mail, realized it was the wrong one, even though it is the first hit when you search on Amazon for replacement heads for model 340. You need the 32B instead.   These parts felt rather cheaply made when I opened the package.</li>
    <li> This product arrived completely destroyed and crushed. Unfortunately, I was deployed to Afghanistan at the time and was not in any location to attempt to return the product or get a replacement. Threw the mangled items in a fire pit and reminded myself not to order something like this while deployed.</li>
    <li> This replacement works fine in my Braun 4700 series razor, I own two Brauns, a newer one and this older one. They both have had their batteries replaced, which is quite easy to do and now both have new foils/cutters. This was a great deal for replacement parts that fit and work fine. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It was confusing to figure out which replacement to buy (how about a simple matrix of what works and what doesn&#x27;t, Braun?) but after reading a lot of these reviews I bought the 30B.  Works great - I&#x27;m shaving today even though it&#x27;s Saturday.</li>
    <li> It works very good. Excellent product. It works perfect and the design is beautiful. I may recommend this item for others.</li>
    <li> I read the previous reviews and was unsure how the transition would work. What a wonderful surprise, it took 2 minutes to install and the shaver works like new. A great idea to renew an older shaver.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to slice through my beard hairs with ease but at most it&#x27;s a little bit quicker than my old dull blades. Fits my Braun 7526. I wouldn&#x27;t rush to replace the blades next time. The old ones still work fine.</li>
    <li> This works well as a replacement for the 7505 foil &amp; cutter.&lt;br /&gt;Razor working like new again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for the best price and fast, free shipping!</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a replacement for the 8000 series that is no longer made.  Worked perfect.  Nice close shave.  Thanks to the one that wrote a previous review and recommended it.</li>
    <li> **EVERYONE, PLEASE WAIT AT LEAST 2 WEEKS BEFORE RATING THIS PRODUCT.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past 2 months, i have bought 3 different replacement cutters for my shaver.  The first 2 were the regular 7000/4000 series-3 and they only lasted a whopping 1 month total. Then i purchased this 30b cutter which was supposedly the newer series and for the first week, it worked great and was as happy as can be until the middle of the 2nd week when it was getting longer and longer to shave everyday.  It has gotten to the point where i now have to shave 2 times per day (only had it for 3 weeks) just so i don&#x27;t spend 15+ minutes in the morning trying to get that close shave i used to get when i first bought the shaver 3 years ago.  Mind you, that original cutter lasted approx 16 months and it&#x27;s replacement another 12 months until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gotten so bad that i&#x27;ve practically given up hope to find a cutter (made by braun) that lasts 6 months and have now cancelled my subscribe and save of the clean &amp; renew shaver refills. I will very soon put away this electric shaver away and start going back to the old fashion way of shaving manually with a razor and cream. At the very least, minimal time would be spent shaving again and replacement blades won&#x27;t cost me as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to get Braun to understand that inferior products will not be tolerated anymore by consumers is to boycott their products which will hurt their profits and i for one will begin. For the $60 i spent on replacement cutters the past couple on months, i could have bought a new electric shaver not named Braun.</li>
    <li> After many trouble-free years of using the BRAUN Shaver, we are experiencing short-lived cutter/comb units.  BRAUN instructions say to renew every 18 months.  This puts us &amp;#34;up a creek&amp;#34; because AMAZON has a 30 day limit on returns and the units are wearing out in 4 months.  To be fair, when we applied to BRAUN directly they responded by sending a new cutter/comb package (after a very long delay).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new unit, supplied to me, was by the Braun Team, under the P &amp; G aegis, so it makes one wonder who is actually manufacturing the units and, where.</li>
    <li> You know how it goes after time, your razor gets old &amp; it doesn&#x27;t shave as well as it should anymore. It&#x27;s kind of expensive to buy a new foil &amp; cutter, but it is worth it. Mine is back to shaving me like it did when I first bought it. Love this replacement  kit!</li>
    <li> I was concerned that it maight be wth wrong model, I didn&#x27;t need to worry it as if I bought a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> I like Braun, this is a refill so I&#x27;m always ordering this product twice a year. Does great, close shave</li>
    <li> Product was received on time, was a good deal and just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;What more can i say? Nothing.</li>
    <li> After browsing those positive reviews, I ordered 2 for my 8585 and 8975. However, after receiving them, I could see clearly through transparent package that cutter blade are the newer version Braun redesigned - wider blade, I tried this type of cutter years ago from 51s with poor result. IMO, with smart foil, this cutter is hopeless; with opti-foil, I was told it might be much better... I had expected it comes with older thinner cutter in 30B combo. Apparently Amazon deliver the latest inventory, that deserve better rate, it is a pity. Anyway, I can still use the foil.</li>
    <li> Braun totally stated the wrong part for this razor and it did not fit at all.  I have spoken to Braun directly and they will not take it back.  My boyfriend had to buy a whole new razor after trying to force this part on.  This is not Amazon&#x27;s fault, but Brauns issue.  We are stuck with the part and a bill for $250 for a new razor.</li>
    <li> received this Braun Series 3 Combi 30b Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack in time. good price. it fitted well.this is for my spare/backup  shaver when my regular shaver is charging or if it breaks. so only using it sparingly &amp; not daily. so far, it has worked well. I guess, I would recommend to all users of this product.</li>
    <li> Love my Braun shaver, and this replacement was a LOT cheaper than a new one--of any brand--online or in stores.</li>
    <li> Every year I buy this packet to replace my foil and blades.  I have forgotten how old it is ... 10 years? .  It still works well.  However, I think will change it out next year.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit with improved shave</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and cutter makes my 8 years old Braun razor shave like new again.</li>
    <li> Fits my 10+ year old 7000 series. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> it fit perfectly on my old Braun shaver. Now it&#x27;s working like a new one. I will recommend it</li>
    <li> no issues works like new</li>
    <li> I had no idea how much I needed one of these. I mean I guess I had some idea, because my shaver had started to catch and pull and it was uncomfortable, but I didn&#x27;t know how much of a difference this would make. Not only was it beautiful, shiny metal, but the sharpness made shaving go from taking 3 or 4 minutes of going over the same spot over and over, to just basically rubbing it lightly all over my face with it and being done in less than a minute. I was suspicious of spending $30 on a new blade and a new screen; and while I still think that&#x27;s about twice as much as it should cost, I&#x27;m glad I did pony up for it.</li>
    <li> amazon listed this as the replacement pack for the shaver I bought (Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver) but when I got the replacement blades etc it was not the right one as listed for my shaver. The amazon listing for the braun shaver should be the one that actually fits that certain shaver...so I had to return it and pay for the shipping to return it. Thus..could not really rate this item since it is the wrong one.</li>
    <li> this is original foild and cutter, since i have bought it  i use it every day and never had any problem and still looks like new one.</li>
    <li> It works very well (as described by previous posters).&lt;br /&gt;When I see the black color it reminds me of the good deal I got.</li>
    <li> worked great with my 8585</li>
    <li> After a long time of poor shaves, once I replaced the foil and cutter, it&#x27;s been heaven. Excellent job, even with a multi day beard growth. The shaver is back to its original reliability.</li>
    <li> great price.&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t changed the cutter &amp; foil in a while, and i can tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;should&#x27;ve done it sooner.</li>
    <li> works much better than the existing one I had in there.  it is a good value for the money I paid</li>
    <li> Fits my 550 like a glove, much better shave than the 5-series foils. Who knows why they don&#x27;t use them for everything</li>
    <li> was a gift for a friend so I&#x27;m not sure how it worked so just rated it as it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Is what it is and at a fair price</li>
    <li> Until it breaks again - but the problem a few times was, that they never call you back when there is a problem.</li>
    <li> Works well on my series 5 Braun razor.  No more torture when shaving with the Series 3 razor head.  Much needed improvement.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 5-year old razor.  The foil is a little different design, and a definitely don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I used to.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem that much sharper than the old one.  Next time I will try and sharpen the old one first.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, Braun&#x27;s own website was out of this product, so I had to order it from Amazon.  When I inputed the Braun Shaver #3612 on the website I was taken to the Braun Series 3 Combi 30b etc replacement pack.  Since I couldn&#x27;t read the packaging,or see the actual parts (they&#x27;re only viewable through the back of the packaging which wasn&#x27;t shown in the above picture).  By the time  my 19 year old college student son &amp; I (who was traveling for business several times the month I ordered this product) were together to swap out his shavers foil/cutter etc ... it was obvious by looking at the parts through the back of the packaging that there was no way they could fit a Braun#3612 shaver!!  Of course when I tried to return it, I was greeted with a stone wall that is Amazon&#x27;s uberefficient website...with no apparent way of actually speaking to a human being to say that this is a special circumstance...Amazon&#x27;s mistake or Braun&#x27;s mistake...and I should be able to return the product &amp; get the correct product...even if the bleeping return policy expiration date has passed!!!!!!!!!!!  ***I&#x27;d love to actually speak with a human being in Amazon&#x27;s Customer Service Dept about this***</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast. Looks like a newer design, than what I have had before. Fit my machine very well, Just snapped right on.</li>
    <li> They changed the cutting head so that the blades are thicker.  It still gives a close shave when your stubble is short, but it has a bit of trouble with longer hairs.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Braum 8985 after reading all the helpful feedback / reviews. My shaver works like new now.</li>
    <li> This made my older shaver work like new again. It takes seconds to install. I couldn&#x27;t find this in any store. It was most convenient to get this from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have not been impressed with my Series 5 Braun (569).  After reading terrible reviews for the Series 5 foil replacements I decided to give a 3 Series a try since customers seemed to like it better.  It does indeed fit.  If you look at the actual middles of the foil you can see the difference.  The 5 series has these spikes sticking out.  I&#x27;m sure this is supposed to make it better, they are more expensive after all.  They really just tug at the hairs though.  What you have to understand, and I used to work at the company that owned Braun, is that they are forced to constantly change things.  If they don&#x27;t the prices just freefall, or even worse generics (grocery store brands) start to creep in so they just start adding whatever sounds good.  A lot of times, and I&#x27;d say this is one, it doesn&#x27;t actually improve anything and could make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st Shave-  I&#x27;m not sure but I think this feels better than my very first shave.  If you have an old series 5 you might want to buy this cheaper foil and give it a whirl.  If I had been using this foil all along maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have been so disappointed with this razor&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this product a full five because it&#x27;s cheaper and better than the Series 5 foil replacements.</li>
    <li> Ürün benim makineme uyumlu bir ürün ve önceki kullandıklarımdan daha gelişmiş özelliklere sahipti.&lt;br /&gt;Ambalajı orjinal ve sağlam haldeydi. Kaliteli ürün. Kullandığım traş makineme gayet güzel uyum sağladı ve çok iyi çalıştı.&lt;br /&gt;Bu ürünü bir arkadaşım bana önermişti. Onun da benzer bir makinesi olduğu için kendisi de bunun gibi bir parça ararken benim makineme uygun bu parçayı bulunca bana önerdi. Bu parçanın Türkiye&#x27;ye sevkiyatı yapılabildiği için ve Türkiye&#x27;deki satılan örneklerinden daha ucuza temin edilebildiği için ben de bunu tercih ettim. Bu durumda karda sayılırım. Ayrıca bu ürünlerin kullanım ömrü 18 ay olarak belirlendiği halde ben 3 ila 4 yıl boyunca kullanabiliyorum.&lt;br /&gt;Teşekkürler...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks...</li>
    <li> New cutter foil rescued my trusty Braun. Had to go back to blade shaving for a few days and that made me appreciate the convenience and ease of electric shaving - way to go Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love my Braun razor and this blade really restored it to like-new condition.</li>
    <li> Dos not fit the Braun 380S-4.  Complete waste of money.  Amazon and the package says it does but they not even close in configuration.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and cutting head make my 10 year old razor cut like new. The only difference from a new razor is that I have to recharge the battery more often than when new, but still only every 1-2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to change shavers, so having replacement packs is great for my everyday shaving needs. Rock em Braub</li>
    <li> Fast and great item,thank you.</li>
    <li> After replacing the blade and foil, the shaver works like brand new.  Thanks to new foils and blades I&#x27;ve been using the same razor for years.</li>
    <li> Right replacement for my shaver, arrived quickly, comfortable shave, just like new, should have done it 2 years ago instead of waiting for it to break.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect replacement for the razor. Very easy to replace the old blades with the new ones. Thanks</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet, just  purchased the Braun Series 3 razor which I am delighted with.</li>
    <li> My son is very picky and he loves this</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always nice to have a fresh blade. Get a new one for a close, clean shave.</li>
    <li> made my old razor like new again.</li>
    <li> good price fast delivery. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> The original foil on my 8585 finally developed holes so i needed a new one. I did a whole lot of research and was brought to the 3 series replacement foil/cutter FROM reading the 5 series foil/cutter reviews. After reading the reviews and looking at the photos provided I was convinced this was the foil to buy even if the black plastic foil would not be compatible with the plastic cover. I do not know if I was wrong since I do not have the 5 series replacement foil/cutter to compare but I can confidently and honestly tell you that the cutter I received is NOT the THIN FULL CIRCLE BLADES which were depicted in customer photos, instead IT IS THE THICK HALF CIRCLE BLADES which people were trying to avoid from the 5 series. I can only compare the cut to the original cutter, and the replacement feels a lot less powerful. I still have to give it a chance but my initial experience is disappointment. I am curious if the 5 series replacement performs any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short, heads up, the BLADES ARE the thick half circle type NOT the thin full circle blades like the original. That was the main reason I chose to purchase the 3 series instead of the 5 series replacement. I wish I knew how the 5 series performed but I am guessing it is similar since they have the same cutter blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped!</li>
    <li> I ordered them for my brother. He needs these for his Braun 7500 series. I don&#x27;t really have a feedback since it&#x27;s being shipped to him in another country.</li>
    <li> Just bought this 30b re-fill and was disappointed to open it and find the half round cutting blade that cuts side to side like that of the 8000 series.  Has anyone else found this to the case.  Even with this drawback it still cuts better than my year plus old blade of the other style.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product twice and will probably order again  the Braun shaver is one of the best as long as you regularly replace the head and cutting blade.  Best price I&#x27;ve found and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews the people were right.&lt;br /&gt;This fit perfect on my 360 with  no problem at all and was over half the price</li>
    <li> Worked fine.  Would have liked to have bought the foil alone because that is what was damaged on my shaver.  But it is difficult to find without the cutter accompanying it.</li>
    <li> This is the second Foil and Cutter that I have purchased.  It does a good job since my old cutter was getting dull.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s factory, what more can I say?</li>
    <li> This foil and cutter was cheaper than the recommended one for my 8000 series shaver, but it works great.  It just doesn&#x27;t have a notch that allows you to put the plastic cover over the foil, but I don&#x27;t care about that.  My shaver works as good as new again.</li>
    <li> The Amazon web page for this product says \\&quot;Fits Braun Series 3, Series 1 and 7000/4000 range of shavers\\&quot;, but it *doesn&#x27;t* fit the Braun 340s-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the \\&quot;Braun Series 3 Combi 32b Replacement Head Pack 1 Count\\&quot; (at [[ASIN:B003UH1Q3U Braun Series Combi Replacement Count]] ) might fit the 340s-4 shaver.</li>
    <li> Great price, quick delivery and the cutters tremendously  improved the performance of my Braun razor. Will reorder again in the recommended 6 months replacement time period.</li>
    <li> Diect replacement which this makes my 3rd set. Work just as good as the original foil that came with my two Brauns.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This foil and cutter replacement brought my Braun 8585 razor back to life. I&#x27;ve owned it since 2005 and it cuts like it&#x27;s 2005 again. Thanks Amazon for the best price and fast, free shipping.</li>
    <li> I have an Activator 8781.  I bought this product based on other reviews saying that this 30B foil and cutter block was far superior to the 51S that Braun says is for my razor.  The 30B fits fine despite not being marketed as for my razor, and my razor works like new.  Buy this, not the 51S, if you have an Activator.</li>
    <li> (Note that even though this review shows being written by April, it is actually being written by her Dad - which explains the a lot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of controversy over which foil &amp; cutter to get for some Braun model razors. And when I search Amazon for a foil &amp; cutter for my 8985, the search returns both the \\&quot;Braun 8000 360 Complete Foil and Cutter Block for Models 8995, 8985 and 8975\\&quot; and \\&quot;Braun Series 5 Combi 51S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 8000 360 Complete or Activator)\\&quot;. The former is apparently a discontinued model and the latter seems to come with many negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviews indicated the Series 3 30B foil &amp; cutter were the best to get (even though Braun specifies the 51S for my 8985 razor) and I now agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after I ordered the 30B I tried my son&#x27;s Braun 7505 which I gave him a few years ago after I bought my 8985. Even though the 7505 foil &amp; cutter are at least a couple of years old, it seemed to shave much smoother and closer than my 8985.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I received my 30B and after putting it into my 8985 it suddenly shaved as close and smooth as my son&#x27;s older 7505. After a close inspection of all three foil &amp; cutters (my 8985, my son&#x27;s 7505 and the new 30B) I could see the difference. All three foils were similar with the same hole pattern. The cutters however were different. When looking at them from the front of the razor, the 30B blades were much thinner (left to right) than my old 8985 blades. Note that these 8985 blades had been replaced before but I actually kept the old foil &amp; blades and packaging from the last time I bought them and Voila! I had previously bought (from Amazon) the 51S foil &amp; cutter which again had the wider (not so great) blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should of course be sure that the 30B will fit your particular razor as one reviewer here indicated they did NOT fit his 7526 shaver but if you can find evidence that they will indeed fit, then go for it! They will result in anamazingly smooth and close shave.</li>
    <li> I own a 10-15 year old Braun 7526 and the 30B replacement pack fit and works perfect. The cutter head is on a little pin and pulls straight out and the new unit pushes right in. A few seconds and the razor is like new again.</li>
    <li> I was in the same boat as everybody else, those new heads they came out with a few years back pulled out more hair than they cut.  So I put my trust in Amazon reviews and bought this for my 8585 series.  Fits great, didn&#x27;t have a single hair pulled, and shaved a lot faster than the last 3 8585 series heads I had bought.</li>
    <li> This product is durable and extremely reliable.  I have had the Braun 7000 series razor for about 9 years and this is my 3rd replacement blade.  The blade lasts longer than the recomended 18 months if you routinely clean the blade and shaver (use the recommended cleaning solution).  With the new blade installed, it&#x27;s like brand new.  I cannot say enough about this product&#x27;s reliability.  Even after 9 years, it still holds the charge for more than a week (I average about 10-11 days).  Strongly recommended if you can use electric shavers.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT. GETTING HARD TO FIND FOR OLD RAZORS.</li>
    <li> Worked great first 2 month, then became dull.  Braun claims to last one year.</li>
    <li> This is my second replacement.  Fits perfectly.  Four stars because I&#x27;m not so happy with Braun.  The shave is not close and the replacement heads are too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  The blades get dull more quickly than I thought they would, however, I am generally happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> works great for my Braun 8585, glad I read the reviews, A + + seller</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, fits my Series 3 340 razor perfectly.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of the Braun Series 3 Combi 30b Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack (7000/4000 Series), because I wanted a spare. They arrived quickly and undamaged. They were well packaged. This is the \\&quot;up-dated\\&quot; version of the original foil and cutter. It works very well, and I believe it cuts better than the \\&quot;original\\&quot; design. The foil and cutter fit perfectly on my older Braun razor which is a member of the Braun \\&quot;7000\\&quot; series. As of this time , I would not hesitate in buying this foil and cutter as a replacement to the \\&quot;original\\&quot; version. I do recomend this replacement foil and cutter.</li>
    <li> About every 6 months I order new blades for my electric razor.  This is now very hard to find in a drug store, since they no longer carry these items - at least in my city.  I can always tell when I need to order another one, when it starts irritating my skin.  It&#x27;s always a welcome time to get new razors for my dependable Braun Electric Razor - they cut very well and my skin is very smooth.  I just can&#x27;t understand why anyone still uses a straight edge razor.  I get a much closer save, with less irritation using an electric.</li>
    <li> Someone posted their experience with using a Series 3 B30 foil &amp; blades on a Series 5 shaver, claiming it worked well. Well, they were absolutely right! I thought, what the heck? let&#x27;s give it a try. It was great! Not only was it smooth &amp; fast, I didn&#x27;t get any pulling &amp; I&#x27;ve got a pretty tough beard. Gave me razor-like shave &amp; I saved money!</li>
    <li> Mine wasn&#x27;t cutting as well anymore so I went to many local stores trying to find a replacement and couldn&#x27;t so got on amazon and there it was....wish I would have done this in the first place. Works great</li>
    <li> top quality at a great price</li>
    <li> I got a part for an older Braun shaver that I can no longer find in the stores. It was a fair price and shipped quickly, getting to my house very quickly considering I did not opt for special shipping and it was the height of the Christmas shipping season.</li>
    <li> I followed the recommendations of other users to get this for my husband&#x27;s 8000 series. Great idea. Works like magic, shaver is like new.</li>
    <li> Works great on my 8585!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband on christmas, and still goin strong. He loves this product. We will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> The blade is now the same for 7000/9000 series razors.  I had 2 other peeps look.&lt;br /&gt;31b is 51s for&lt;br /&gt;10 bucks less.</li>
    <li> The item served its intended purpose. I have used Braun products for many years and they always have served their intended purpose.</li>
    <li> Have bought foil and cutter twice from this company.  Good price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I replace the screen and blade every 18 months.  The shave is so much cleaner and smooth when this is done so don&#x27;t be afraid to do it.  I always find the lowest price here on Amazon too.</li>
    <li> The Braun foil and cutter combo wor fine on my razor. They work the same as when razor was new. Price is rather high.</li>
    <li> Fit my razor perfect. Razor feels like new. Thought I was going to have to buy new razor.</li>
    <li> Fits and works perfectly.  Delivery was timely.</li>
    <li> Better price than anywhere else I seen and works the same.</li>
    <li> Fits the higher Braun model and works just fine. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Is as described. I&#x27;ve ordered this before and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> Ingenious easy-to-open packaging, despite how it looks. This one&#x27;s different.</li>
    <li> WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WE HOPE TO PLACE OTHER ORDERS FOR VARIOUS PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE</li>
    <li> Excellent product excellent price my shave is just like new sham we can&#x27;t buy all replacement parts for other brands from you in Australia</li>
    <li> My husband had me order this replacement pack for his (at least) 10 year old razor.  He says it&#x27;s like having a brand new razor!  He also said his whiskers are cut smoothly on the first swipe, not three or four like before.  He said, &amp;#34;Why did I wait so long?&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> A good product. No problems with it, no problems with delivery. Just like the original.</li>
    <li> This is a Braun updated cutter/foil.  It has a different length and width of cutter than old 7000 series replacements.  I was a little worried when I compared to old cutter/foil, but when in shaver, it worked great !  No complaints!  As long as your older Braun is still running you have a good replacement cutter/foil for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Braun 8585 razor, and it worked perfectly.  Thanks to those who suggested the 3 series for the 8585.</li>
    <li> The foil is different from the original one on my shaver, but it doesn&#x27;t matter.  I&#x27;m pleased with the fit and performance.</li>
    <li> I have a very old brawn electric razor and these work fine.  I&#x27;ve very careful to always check the packaging for the right series.  Mine is a 7680 model.  No problems at all.</li>
    <li> saved so much $$$$$ by using this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent cutters and screen. Would recommend them to Braun users</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut better than my previous cutter.</li>
    <li> Right product, best price, and one day delivery. Very satisfy!</li>
    <li> Braun, apparently changed their cutting block a while ago. There are less blades on the cutter, which translates, it doesn&#x27;t cut as well as before, at least on my face. This is the correct replacement for my razor, but I do not use it any longer, due to the cutter change. Hopefully, Braun will go back to the way things were. I am now using one of their competitors razors, and it cuts the way my Braun used to, just not as powerful, but has worked well.</li>
    <li> Many of the customers who bought this product criticized the quality and the function of this product as it is not like the original. I add my voice to them and I won&#x27;t be buying the replacement again. I would rather buy another brand new machine.</li>
    <li> The other customers were correct, this fits the Braun 8595 perfectly, even though the label does not mention it. Thank you very much for telling us about it.</li>
    <li> Glad I made this purchase - now I can get a close shave again.&lt;br /&gt;That is all I have to say :-)</li>
    <li> Purchased this item to replace cutter and foil on a 7570 razor. This is very different from the original cutter and foil that came with the razor. While it does cut, it take three times longer due to the new design as it misses many hairs on the first and second cuts. I need to go over the same areas three times and even then it appears the cutter gets jammed when attempting to cut my hair so I need to frequently shake the razor to remove the built up cut hairs. From what I can see, the razor only allows a fraction of the hair to be removed at a time as evidenced by the fine hair dust left behind after cutting. I would have expected the razor to cut off large portions of the protruding hair first then possibly a follow up to get that smooth cut. I have not been able to get as smooth of a cut as I do when using a regular straight blade. When I first got the razor with the original design cutter and foil, I was able to get a shave comparable to a straight blade. As I have invested hundreds of dollars into this razor in the initial cost and continual cost of cleaning solution, I will continue to muddle through until the razor final calls it quits then most likely not buy another Braun.</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used these Braun Combi Packs for several years and found them to cut my beard even better than the original.  As stated in another review, this combi is NOT the same as comes on the shaver, but works better (for me).  It has a different foil design that appears to cut closer. (Don&#x27;t know why the engineers thought they needed to break something that was not broke.)  My previous shaver came with this combi and served me quite well.  The only &amp;#34;hitch&amp;#34; is that the plastic foil cover that came with my new shaver does not fit tightly and may have a tendancy to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off when you casually lay the shaver down on a hard surface such as a bathroom counter.  My previous shaver was a Braun 360 Model 8995, the new one is a Braun Series 5 Model 550cc-4.  This combi works best on both.</li>
    <li> Fits my braun shaver and the shave is smmmooooth!  These blades are much more expensive in the store, I will keep buying them!</li>
    <li> Got this replacement based on other peoples&#x27; reviews about it working well with the 8000 series models, and it does indeed.  Feels very smooth, has a nice, close cut, and a much better price than the suggested replacement option (~$50).  This is the one to use for the 8000 series models.</li>
    <li> My local stores wanted double the cost but I double checked the specs and ordered this replacement pack. Fits great, works great and I essentially got 2 for the local price of one.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I expected my razor to be renewed and was a bit disappointed that new cutterbar and blades did not revive it as totally as I had hoped. Probably an unfair comment so far as the cutterbar and blades were concerned, maybe its the memory that dims? Maybe its that one is not as rigorous as one was either way my shaving did not improve to the standard required!</li>
    <li> This works great on my 7680 shaver!&lt;br /&gt;Exactly the same as the one I paid much more for at my local store.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with both the blade and the screen so when they are both replaced the shaver works like new again.</li>
    <li> This is a Braun Series 3 Combi 30b Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack.  You use it to replace the foil and cutter on your razor when they get dirty and dull.  It works.</li>
    <li> The 1st delivery was in a manila bubble wrap envelope, with only the store plastic wrapper as protection.  Amazon shipped me another in the same type of envelope and it made it through unbroken the 2nd time.  I&#x27;ve recommended to Amazon that they use a small box next time for this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 3rd or 4th time that I&#x27;ve replaced the foil &amp; cutter for my old Braun 7505.  Each time it shaves like new.  The first couple of times I got a replacement from the Shaver Shop I purchased it from, then from Target. The shop is gone &amp; Target only carries the latest replacements.  I thought I was stuck, until I looked online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun brand has made a believer out of me.  (I&#x27;ve also got a reliable Braun coffee grinder, working for years of daily use.  I&#x27;ll always look to Braun 1st for small appliances.&lt;br /&gt;You may pay a little more, but well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> The blades and foil were very easy to install. It is like getting a brand new razor when you replace the old blades. Item was delivered in a timely fashion .</li>
    <li> It is a good investment, once replaced the Foil and Cutter the razor likes new. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Works fine with my Braun self cleaning razor. Better than the original foil and cutter. Fits perfectly and shaves smoothly.</li>
    <li> It seems this has been redesigned, at least since my last order in October 2012.  The cutter blades are wider (and darker color).  The result, based on my experience, is an inferior shave -- more missed hairs and stubble, I don&#x27;t hear the sound of cutting hairs at all, a bit more irritation.  Disappointed, and will be returning, since it&#x27;s even worse than my old cutter/foil in need of replacement.</li>
    <li> I got this replacement cutter/foil to use on an 8585 series braun shaver. The replacements Braun sells for those shavers are horrible (so bad it makes you wonder if you should trust the company again when buying your next shaver, a long story but I am not alone with my thoughts). I had used one of the series 3 replacement pack&#x27;s before and as of August the one I purchased still works on my shaver. It works ok, probably not as well as the original cutter/foil the shaver shipped with but you can&#x27;t get those now and the alternative is buying a different shaver which I am trying to avoid now. (I will acknowledge that the fact the 8000 series shaver was a well built device it is still running and I have had it for many years.)</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT A BRAUN 7 YEARS AGO.  I STILL USE IT.  IT&#x27;S FAST AND CONVENIENT.  A STRAIGHT RAZOR IS BEST, BUT BRAUN IS FAST AND CLOSE</li>
    <li> Cutter Replacement Pack fits and works fine on my Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Pricing is not worth it based on a new cost of Electric Shaver</li>
    <li> This shaver head works much better than the series 5 head thats supposed to be used on a series 5 razor. No more  curse inducing whisker pulling .</li>
    <li> I found this pack on Amazon and this a really great replacement.&lt;br /&gt;My BRAUN working very smooth and quiet now!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Piece of junk, the worst quality I&#x27;ve seen in years. Makes my shaving a nightmare. Don&#x27;t buy - change to something else. I bought a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Gives better shaves than the thicker foil and cutter block Braun says to use.  CLEARLY better.</li>
    <li> arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t used it yet, i buy them in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i assume it works as well as my old one.</li>
    <li> Would not fit the one I had.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading that it would work with my Braun 8595 razor and I&#x27;m happy to report that it does -- perfectly. As mentioned in other reviews, it&#x27;s black instead of silver, but that really doesn&#x27;t matter. The foil and cutter both fit perfectly and give a great shave. So, save your money and buy this instead of the more expensive replacement.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I love having them delivered regularly through the subscribe and save program.</li>
    <li> As described and work great!</li>
    <li> I just buy it but I have no idea of it.</li>
    <li> My husband has always used this product and can&#x27;t live without it! He will continue to purchase this Braun Series.</li>
    <li> What a difference a new foil and blade makes on a razor. I have a razor that cleans itself and I thought i was good to go until my foil got a tiny hole in it. Believe me spend the couple bucks and buy a new one your shave will be easier, faster and more comfortable.</li>
    <li> very good; price even better</li>
    <li> It was just as promised. It makes my old shaver shave as close as it did when I first bought it.</li>
    <li> Further update January, 2014:  Today when removing the foil, using ordinary pressure, the foil came apart in my hand.  It&#x27;s hard to believe how far Braun&#x27;s QA has sunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this product is different than several other peoples&#x27;.  I found that it does not work significantly better than the Series 5 Foil/Cutter.  I am currently in the market for a better shaving method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being a Braun customer for about ten years, it&#x27;s my opinion that Braun isn&#x27;t doing its job in meeting customers&#x27; needs.  Whether it&#x27;s the materials, the process or quality control, the overall result is that Braun&#x27;s quality has badly slipped.</li>
    <li> I could not see the actual part so I ordered the wrong one and now I am beign told I cannot return it!!!</li>
    <li> Just adding another data point of successfully being able to use this Braun Series 3 Combi 30b Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack  UPC #: 069055854006 with a Braun 8595 which BTW is nearly 10 years old and still working great.</li>
    <li> In case there&#x27;s anyone else like me who has a Series 5, and saw the bad reviews for the series-5 replacement blades, fear not. This series 3 replacement will fit your series 5 like a charm. My shaver works as good or better than before.</li>
    <li> I have a top-of-the-line Model 7680 at the time I got it.  Works wonderfully, but when I went to get a replacement, the Braun website said get the 30b model #81253253.  I searched for both numbers and it led to this item.  I ordered it and was dismayed to see just by looking at the product on the back side it will NOT fit my razor.  I called Braun customer service (Like another reviewer with this problem did) and also emailed them.  Here is the response I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady on the phone - Oh well that is the ONLY model 30b we sell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email - Sorry it did not work, let us send an M90 shaver as compensation (this is a cheap 20 dollar battery powered razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wrote back asking for either the correct part OR a discount on their new razor.  I must admit this one lasted a long time and I thought the battery would die, but it still holds a charge!  So I like the product, I just think there is a snafu with the replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am going to order http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B008LQZPVO, this appears to be the correct model even if the picture is outdated.  I posted two pictures below of what I was shipped here.  I will write a review at that SKU, hopefully a positive one!</li>
    <li> works better than stock, mine is about 8-10 years old. The  best it&#x27;s ever worked..</li>
    <li> The cutter and foil are fine, but the unit came without a plastic cover and the old one does not fit.  An appropriate cover should be sent with the unit.</li>
    <li> Awesome, this makes my shaver seem like it is brand new. Highly recommended it is a bargain than buying a new shaver</li>
    <li> No problems with installation, slightly new foil design replaced old cutter and foils, shaves like new.  Definitely recommended for anyone.</li>
    <li> In my experience the foil design of the 30b is FAR superior to the foil design of the 51s. The larger hexagon shaped holes in the 51s seem to allow a little &amp;#34;wiggle&#x27; in the hair shaft as the block is cutting it, thereby creating a tugging/pulling force on the hair rather than cleanly shearing it. For me, the foil pattern on the 30b does a MUCH better job holding/stabilizing the hair so the block/blade below can make a clean cut without any tugging/pulling. Of course, this problem becomes more and more noticeable with longer intervals between shaving and/or as the blade edges deteriorate over time. If you&#x27;re a daily shaver and/or change the block/foil frequently there&#x27;s probably no discernible difference between the two but for anyone who, like me, goes a couple days between shaving and/or likes to maximize the life of the blade then the 30b is superior.</li>
    <li> best price I found for this and auto recurring orders every 6 months would deff recommend getting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no better price around.</li>
    <li> I live overseas...ordered replacement pack for my Series 3-390cc-4 razor...this is the wrong pack.  The fact that it is named Series 3 makes you think it would fit ALL series 3, but that is not the case.  The names all sound the same, but the sizes and, thus, replacement foils are all different.  You need to be EXTREMELY careful about ordering this.  Because I live overseas exchanging for the correct item isn&#x27;t an option.  Be careful.</li>
    <li> I was leery about ordering the 30b, when the one I should be ordering was a 51s. But after reading what others said about this one and how it works better, I thought that I would give it a try. It does cost less than the 51s and the reasons given for buying the 30b made since. But my biggest concern was would the 30b fit and work in my Aviator, well it does and it does give a very close shave again. The reason that I bought a new set was because the foil on my shaver had developed a hole in it. So I was trying to look around and find the best price for the correct product and I think that this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip for those of you that have the Braun razors that have the alcohol cleaning system, you can save yourself some money by replacing the alcohol yourself. When you have a new container, put it on a level surface and mark the level of the alcohol in the container with a permanent marker, so that you know how much denatured alcohol to pour in when you go to refill it yourself. You need to use denatured alcohol when you refill the container, because the denatured alcohol has less water in it than rubbing alcohol, you can find denatured alcohol in the painting section of most stores. Do not wash out the old containers with water, just try to get out as much of the old alcohol as you can, you don&#x27;t want any water in the container that you cannot get out. Add one half teaspoon of the lemon oil and one half teaspoon of sewing machine oil to the container and then pour in the denatured alcohol to the mark that you put on it when it was new. Do not over fill the container, the cleaning system has a level sensor in it and if it is overfilled you will have to pour out some of liquid until it will work. Also do not put too much lemon oil in you mixture it will help to take away the finish on the plastic parts. By doing this you can save yourself some money by not having to continually buy the new containers and still have a clean razor.</li>
    <li> My husband remarked today that it only takes five minutes for him to get a really good shave with this new head on his Braun razor.</li>
    <li> WOW, did changing the foil and cutter make a difference!  The shaver had begun to tug and pull hairs, but the replacement eliminated all discomfort and provide a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> Yes you heard that right. It&#x27;s not the \\&quot;old style\\&quot; 30B anymore. I just bought one and the cutter is just like what you&#x27;ll get from any other Braun new-but-nobody-love design. Period.</li>
    <li> apparently there are several different Series 3 models. the package I received actually had a picture on the back of the razor I was trying to get a replacement cutter for, but this replacement WILL NOT WORK FOR THIS MODEL.&lt;br /&gt;BE ON THE SAFE SIDE AND DO NOT ORDER THIS. YOU CAN&#x27;T TELL IT WON&#x27;T WORK UNTIL YOU OPEN THE PACKAGE AND TRY TO INSTALL IT.  THEN OF COURSE, YOU CAN&#x27;T TAKE IT BACK OR ANYTHING.  I HATE BRAUN NOW FOR NOT BEING MORE CLEAR ABOUT WHICH REPLACEMENT WILL FIT WHICH RAZOR.  I WON&#x27;T BE BUYING BRAUN AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I have an older Braun 7526. Personally, I like this replacement better than the original foil and cutter (this is my second replacement). Some reviewers have stated that they are disappointed with the &#x27;new&#x27; design of the foil and cutter, but I personally think that this one shaves faster and closer than the old design. Sorry, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.</li>
    <li> It fits perfectly and works as advertised. No complaints.</li>
    <li> It was the wrong replacement. A waste of time and money. Somebody should have helped me not make this error!</li>
    <li> Since WalMart wouldn&#x27;t honor their price match guarantee because the packageing was different, even though the item# was the same, I bought this one. It was still cheaper with shipping than the WalMart price.  Who can go wrong with new blades?  I love them!  Good product.  Five stars means I had no issues with shipping or the product. It met my expectations and was as listed.</li>
    <li> In spite of the listing indicating it was compatible with series 5 razor, it did not fit. Total waste of time and money!&lt;br /&gt;Sad&lt;br /&gt;Ken</li>
    <li> As advertised and up to snuff.  If you need a replacement for your Braun, this is a good buy.  Mine were delivered promptly in good shape.</li>
    <li> I used to love braun shavers so much. This new blade design does not get me a close shave at all. I find myself using my old worn out blades with the new foil. I wish they would bring back the old blade design instead of this new one. Either that or redesign the new blades. I fell they need to have the spacing between the blades at a greater distance apart. Maybe add the old style thin blades between them. Current design is horrid and does not cut.</li>
    <li> This replacement pack was not the correct one for my husband&#x27;s razor. I had to return it and purchase it elsewhere. I don&#x27;t think the description quite matched the product.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and provides an smooth shaving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure it is the right pack for your shaver checking in braun web page. In my case I was very close to order the wrong one.</li>
    <li> 5 stars because this foil and cutter is a replacement set on a Braun razor I&#x27;ve used for many years. Put a foil and cutter on every 6-9 months and get a shave as close as any new razor. The quality and durability is excellent. The price is very good, and delivery was sooner than I expected&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Based on the mostly positive reviews I purchased this product for my 8995. I cannot stress enough warning if you have an 8995 you should not buy this product. The shaver does cut very close, but it&#x27;s too close. It caused irritation and worse now I have a bald patch. At first I thought it was just irritation from having a new blade, but it has been more than 10 days and the hair has not grown back.</li>
    <li> The head does not fit into my Braun shaver. Please advise. Thanks. PLEASE TAKE CARE OF MY CASE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave too much since I have a beard, but I hadn&#x27;t replaced my foil in about 6 years.  What a huge difference a new foil and cutter made!!  I can&#x27;t even feel it shaving and literally thought it wasn&#x27;t working when I first used it. I felt my smooth skin and then realized how much my old cutter was pulling instead of cutting. I won&#x27;t wait so long next time to replace.</li>
    <li> Works fine as a replacement for my Braun 4700 series shaver.  Wish this were cheaper as it is about a third of what I paid for the shaver itself, and wish they sold the two pieces separately as generally I&#x27;ve had to replace the foil only due to damage (develops holes easily) - cutter is more durable.</li>
    <li> Use this on my 8985 - third time - about 18 mod per buy.  Braun products are great anyway, but this one may not be made for this razor but it is cheaper and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> The cutter blade is a different style, not sure if it&#x27;s better or worse.  It does the job though.  J</li>
    <li> Made a huge difference in the way my old razor shaves, feels like a brand new razor again.  Also made the razor run quieter.</li>
    <li> my Braun foil was worn out and shaving was taking longer.  I should have replaced it months ago because now it takes no time to shave</li>
    <li> I but these replacement foil and cutter for my shaver all the time but this was the first time purchasing it from Amazon.  It was terrible, it irritated my face, which is always a sign that the cutter is no good.  I used it for about a week then went to a local store here and bought another of the same foil and cutter.  Immediately the irritation cause by the cutter was gone.  I will not purchase this item from Amazon again and would not recommend purchasing this from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Braun shaver replacment parts that fit, and are resonable priced.  Have had this razor for 10 plus years; recently found Amazon as a source for parts.  Otherwise and be very expensive.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that this foil wouldn&#x27;t fit my 7526, but it totally did. I&#x27;ve been using the new foil for about 2 months now and it&#x27;s working great. I had to get a new one, because my old foil broke. It&#x27;s nice to replace the cutters too, because they make it feel like a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s 8000 series &amp; it fits perfectly! The packaging does not mention it does, but have no fear. If you have the older 8000 series, this WILL work.</li>
    <li> I have an old 8585 model and the foil and blade heads were well overdue for a replacement.  I read a number of the reviews in advance of ordering and decided to take a leap of faith that I was getting good info about this series being a suitable replacement head.  The replacement foil and cutter were easy to install and I have been very happy with its performance over the first month that I have been using it.  It&#x27;s like my old razor is new again (and at a fraction of the cost to replace the whole thing)!  I am definitely happy with the purchase and I appreciate all the thoughtful feedback that convinced me to order this replacement head.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the Braun product.  It fit like it should.  We have had very good experiences with the Braun brand and this was no exception.</li>
    <li> original cutter foil for my braun shaver ,good price good service, makes my shaver like brand new again.i will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought the 30b for my 8975 instead of the Braun-recommended 51s. Fits the shaver just fine and shaves very well.</li>
    <li> It works but is more cheaply made than the original one.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the 51s unit I purchased from Amazon as it was not&lt;br /&gt;up to the original that came with my 8000 series shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the advice of someone in an Amazon review, I purchased the 30B even though&lt;br /&gt;it is NOT the one recommended for my shaver by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits the shaver perfectly and shaves much closer than the 51s, though I&lt;br /&gt;still question whether it is quite as good as the original.  Still, it is&lt;br /&gt;the best solution available anywhere.</li>
    <li> This replacement part was a less expensive substitute for an 8000 series shaver. It fits the shaver head well and it shaves well too.&lt;br /&gt;The 8000 series head costs about $20.00 more and is made out of metal. It was my call to save $20.00.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 series  foil housing is made out of platic.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that the original 8000 shaver cap does not fit the 3 series shaver head. I presume that the plastic foil housing had to be made a bit thicker than the metal (8000 series).</li>
    <li> I have been using the same razor for about 10 years and have had to replace the blades at least 3 times. I was thinking about getting a different razor but after seeing that this product was updated I thought I&#x27;d get this and try it before getting a new razor. I&#x27;m so happy I did because the new design cuts 10 times better then the old design. I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly I am finished shaving now. I didn&#x27;t just get new blades after installing this product on my razor, I got a whole new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Braun engineers. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Nothing beats the quality of OEM parts for a Braun Razor I have been thru a couple replacement foils and blades and each time it&#x27;s like a new Razor..once your foil wears out you simply must get a replacement foil or risk shredding your face.OEm parts have proven to give the best wear.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Braun 7000 series.  WOW!  I should have got this a long time ago!  Works great.  Just wish it was silver, but not a big deal for me.</li>
    <li> Works great, as advertised!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I read these reviews. I have a Braun 8585 and it was shaving so poorly. I had purchased a new 51s foil and blade kit for it about a year ago. One morning my wife said that it seemed it was taking me forever to shave. I agreed, and then concluded that the overall experience was terrible. A number of these reviews mirrored the same feeling. Then, I read about the 30b being used on the 5 series shaver, such as mine.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it came yesterday and I shaved with it this morning. Now, this shaver is as it was in the beginning-a pleasure. What a difference. Shaves smooth and does it quickly. My jawbone area is no longer a problem spot. Thanks to all of the folks who went with the 30b and reported back. You would think that Braun would monitor a site that sells so much of it&#x27;s product line and has a review process. I&#x27;m sure they would have done something by now in regards to the 51s. Thanks to everyone.</li>
    <li> I own a 360 Complete (8985) which takes an 8000 series 51S cutter. As such, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always purchased up until now. I used the original cutter that came with it for almost 2 years (I did stretch it a bit too long) before replacing it with another 51S. That cutter lasted me about a year. Both the original and replacements always had an issue with pulling hair that got too long though (i.e. more than one day&#x27;s growth). So I decided to read through some of the reviews on the 51S and noticed a couple that suggested trying the 30B instead. The only discernible difference being a slight change in the center comb design and the color (black instead of silver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was my first shave with the 30B. WOW! Just...wow! What a difference! Being a Saturday, it&#x27;s been almost a day and a half since my last shave (what...I ate breakfast, played with the kids, watched a little TV), which would normally be enough to pull some hair. When I started shaving, I actually thought that I&#x27;d put the head on wrong because it didn&#x27;t feel like it was cutting anything. So I stopped shaving and took a look at the shaver to make sure that it was indeed in correctly. I then felt my face and it was perfectly smooth! Unbelievable! Honestly, I&#x27;m dumbfounded by how smooth and painless this shave was. I&#x27;ve NEVER gotten this close and painless of a shave in my life! Can&#x27;t say enough about how awesome this cutter/foil is. It&#x27;s cheaper than the 51S and works infinitely better. What&#x27;s not to love! Hopefully it lasts at least a year, but even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s still about 50% cheaper than the 51S (with S&amp;S), so it would work out to about the same price and still be a better shave. I will update this review if my opinion changes, but for now, I&#x27;m ecstatic!</li>
    <li> Thanks to all of the previous reviewers who tipped me off to the fact that these work better in the 8585 than the new ones that are supposedly designed for it.  I don&#x27;t know all of the details of Braun combining foil and cutter types or what happened.  But, I do know that I previously bought the foil and cutter supposedly designed for the 8585 only to have some of the worst shaving experiences to the point that I was ready to buy a new shaver.  I purchased this foil and cutter after reading the various reviews.  All I can say is my Braun 8585 is back to giving me a great, close, comfortable shave like new again.  Only difference is color and the plastic foil cover protector fits loosely.  Buy these - they work better in the 8585 and they are cheaper.</li>
    <li> Buy the series 3 30b replacement foil and cutter block for the 8985.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading several Amazon reviews I was convinced to buy the Series 3 30b as a replacement for my 8985 shaver.  It fits perfectly and works very well.  In all fairness I never tried the series 5 51s replacement so I cannot speak to the quality of that item but the 30b replacement saved me $13.  That was enough motivation to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving experience was an immediate improvement over the original, 3 yr old, foil and cutter.  I had a smooth, clean shave with no hair pulling.  The foil housing is black compared to the original silver housing but that did not matter to me; certainly not worth the $13 premium.  Another reviewer commented that the big difference between the 30b and 51s was the cutter design.  Braun must have made some design changes because it appears the 30b foil pattern and cutter blade style seem to match those found on my original shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great way to save $13 on Amazon.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on Amazon I decided to purchase this as a replacement for the cutter/foil on my 8585 razor.  Upon arrival I immediately noticed two differences to the current cutter and foil.  For one the overall length is shorter.  I held the two foils next to each other and there is an obvious difference in the coverage length.  Secondly the individual cutter blades on this model are wide where as the blade I had before was a thin style.  That being said it does fit fine on my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the shave.  My previous blade and foil were wearing out and starting to break apart hence the reason I ordered this.  After installing this new blade and foil I have to say that it does not cut as FAST as the factory original replacement.  It did stop the pulling and grabbing of random hairs but I had to make alot of passes to shave all of the hair close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I purchased this is because reviews saying that the actual 8000 series replacement blade and foil weren&#x27;t as good anymore and this was cheaper anyway.  I think I may have made a mistake because this is clearly not as good of a shave as when I first bought the razor or when I first replaced the blade/foil with the recommended product.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my 8 year old 7000 Series electric razor.  Turnaround on the order was quick. Price was fair.</li>
    <li> Started electric shaving 40 years ago, and found them inadequate.  Went back to razor blades for a decent shave.  The Braun series 3 blade works as well (if not better) than a razor, and I am hooked on it! Glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> I went against the carefully worded advice that stated the new blades were thick and horrible because I couldn&#x27;t figure out which new razor to buy after scouring the reviews. I made a few extra passes on my upper lip after changing blades and I felt some sort of razor burn, but I pulled away the razor and it had filleted my upper lip! I guess it&#x27;s back to the thin blades I bought in this package some 2 years ago. It&#x27;s enough to put me off to another shaver, even though the Norelco I bought some 7 years ago was a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid any Braun that uses these, and good luck finding shaving heaven if it truly exists!</li>
    <li> Decided it was time to replace the original foil and cutter for my 5 year old shaver. It still cut okay but required an extra pass. It seemed like $25 was a small price to pay to get back the original performance of my old shaver. When I got this I noticed that the foil had a different pattern and the cutter rings were different also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it out and felt some irritation and even some pulled hairs. Though I had to break it in but after a week I literally pulled my old cutter from the trash and replaced the new one with it. Now I&#x27;m using the old cutter and new foil which is working okay. Read online and it looks like Braun may have moved to this new cutter style for most of their new shavers. If so, I&#x27;m sticking with my old one until it it doesn&#x27;t work then getting a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new foil works about as well as the old one so 3 stars for that. The new cutter gets negative 2 stars so 1 star for this combo pack. If you have an old cutter save your money and just buy the foil.</li>
    <li> works like it should.  Fit my razor and works fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same electric razor for more than 20 years and it still gives me a good, close shave.  It is recommended that you change the foil/cutter assembly every 18 months.  I only shave every other day, so I get a much longer usage time.  I have been using Braun shavers for over 40 years and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are not the same quality as replacement parts that I have purchased in the past.  Now Chinese parts, the razor pinches my face. I cannot see a gap or identify how it happens, perhaps what I feel is a hair being pulled out.  Although I invested in these new parts, after a few months trial I&#x27;ve had to retire a great razor.  You may wish to retire yours BEFORE you spend your money on this replacement kit.</li>
    <li> Very surprised at the improved shave with this low price option. I read others reviews, was a bit hesitant to order this as it was not listed as the &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; foil/cutter by Braun. Totally satisfied! And, IMHO it&#x27;s better than the original parts!</li>
    <li> Make sure you match your razor&#x27;s model number to the correct foil and cutter replacement. I have a Series 3 and ordered what appeared to be the correct foil/cutter; however, there are many Series 3 (at least two) and I received the 30B model, which did not fit my 380s-4 razor. Turns out I need the 32B model (hopefully, replacement hasn&#x27;t arrived yet). And the picture on both the 30B and 32B are exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, what can you say about a replacement foil &amp; cutter from the maker of the razor itself, and not a knock-off?</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 7526 and have been using the original foil and cutter for quite a few years.  The foil/cutter is  the older 3 series design (see picture).  When I got the new foil/cutter 8000 series design i noticed both blade and the foil has been changed.  The foil is now like a snowflake pattern and the blades are are flat as opposed to the older more uniform pattern and tapered blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out for a few weeks and am not happy with the results. I can still feel the stubble on my skin every-time i touch my face.  In fact the cut seems to be worse than my old style foil/blade thats 6+ years old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why this foil/blade is getting great ratings, maybe its cause they never tried the older version?  I just wanted to inform people out there who are use to the old 3 series design.</li>
    <li> Good Price Good quality Beats buying new one</li>
    <li> This replacement pack for my Braun electric razor shaves better than the any foil and cutter I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve had my Braun for several years, and I&#x27;ve never had such close and comfortable shaves. And the price is actually less than previous replacement foils I&#x27;ve used, including the original. I will be definitely be using this replacement part for the remaining life of the shaver.</li>
    <li> Just what we needed and at a great deal. This product is worth the purchase online versus the in-store outrageous pricing.</li>
    <li> It is working very well.  I used it on my cordless shaver and it is working very very well, thanks.</li>
    <li> Very nice and works well.  Had a ver old foil and cutter and this is so much nicer than what I had.  It feels new.</li>
    <li> As usual, this replacement cutter assembly is very good.  I am very pleased with my Braun shaver.  It  is a simple task to change the cutter assembly.</li>
    <li> Everthing as promised.</li>
    <li> I have bought this several times now for my husbands Braun razor and it is the perfect replacement foil and cutter.  Works great and lasts long.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I totally forgot to replace by foil and cutter for my old reliable Braun 7526 shaver a nd got a new Panasonic and another Braun shaver.  Neither are as good as the old 7526 shaver so I was glad to get this to replace my old foil instead of getting a new razor.</li>
    <li> Amazing difference in the closeness of the shave with a new foil and cutter.  Unfortunately they only last about a  year but the cost is similar to disposable razors.</li>
    <li> The shaver head broke after less than a year.  My beard is not that heavy so I am disappointed with the service I have received from this shaver head.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and works well.</li>
    <li> Could not use.  It did not fit my serious 3 razor.  Did not realize this until after I opened the package.  Amazon will not accept returns for opened packaging.  Thus the reason for the low rating.  I chose to look at an ad for my razor, on their website so that I could select the correct replacement head. It showed my razor indicating &amp;#34;the above razor as an item often ordered with this item&amp;#34;. (+or-)  Wrong!</li>
    <li> Did not fit my Braun 7300 razor.</li>
    <li> good quality and as advertised!</li>
    <li> Have always had very good experience with Braun.  Only wished there were US Made alternatives</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on the poor quality of the series 5 foil and cutter, I bought the series 3 as others had suggested, and it worked perfect! Thanks to all who wrote reviews on the replacing the series 5 with the series 3 !!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;Razor shaves like new again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter fit perfectly for my shaver and I noticed an immediate difference in cutting ability once I broke through the bullet proof packaging (How about making the packaging easier to open?) and installed. Worked as designed. Make sure you get the right foil and cutter - do look ups by model number if you are not sure about System 3, 7 etc.</li>
    <li> Well I took the advice from others who wrote reviews using this foil and cutter combo on my Braun 8585 and am very impressed. I had used the recommended 5 series replacement before and the shaver seemed to bog down and not run at full speed, especially toward the end of its life before a hole was worn in the foil. I received shipment from this vendor very promptly and the performance is now returned to the shaver and it doesn&#x27;t take as long to get a great shave that is close and comfortable with no bites. It is black instead of silver and the plastic foil guard does not snap onto the foil sides like before, but no issues with that. Some said it wore out too fast but I guess time will tell.</li>
    <li> No problems all is fitting well.Delivery time was OK</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement head for Braun Model 340s shaver as recommended by Braun and Razor accessory list on Amazon. Unfortunately, this replacement head does not fit this Model as recommended.  Very disappointed and had to return both (2 ordered).</li>
    <li> The price was great and it got my razor cutting just like it did when new. Not sure about different designs and all that. It seems like the original foil and blade that was on my razor.</li>
    <li> Fantastic...No new razor yet!</li>
    <li> Good product, high quality, no complaints</li>
    <li> as good as or better than new. didnt realize how bad the old blade wasnt working! today, smooth, quick, easy fix.</li>
    <li> I needed a new blade and these was here so it just works!  Make sure it will fit your model.</li>
    <li> Perform as expected.  Fit was good.</li>
    <li> Works like new.  Extends overall life of razor.  The razor is beautiful as is the foil and cutter replacement.  Halleluah!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good than stock foil and cutter, works great, I get a really good shave with this new head. I purchased this based on reviews. Well done replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this one instead of omf cutter that was recommended on the web site from other reviews. A much smoother cut then the one I bought prior to this one.</li>
    <li> Only lasted a few months. Very disappointed.  The original lasted years.</li>
    <li> Exellent, good price, good quality.</li>
    <li> I did not realize how dull my old cutter had become until I put on this new foil and cutter. They are of high quality and produced great results. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was searching this replacement all around and found it her.&lt;br /&gt;Just what i wanted a long time ago. Txs</li>
    <li> That is what I need for my Braun shaver, because I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;When the foil will be aat its end, I change</li>
    <li> The blade wears out in only a few months. I used to get 18 months out of them but now I am lucky to get 6 months</li>
    <li> Great product and great service</li>
    <li> Have a Braun 8585. This head works so much better ! Thanks to all of you guys for pointing out the advantages of using this&lt;br /&gt;superior cutting head in an 8585 . Its cheaper too !</li>
    <li> I have had a series 5 Contour pro from Costco with self cleaning base for ~2yrs now. It may not be as good as a series 7 but it works well enough. Now I&#x27;ve always had a small pinching problem with the original foil and cutter which escalated after the foil started to chip. So I look around on amazon for the replacement and saw that ppl were recommending this foil and cutter over the series 5 replacement. It&#x27;s been about a month now and I can say without a doubt that they were right. I have not had any pinching problems at all and my shaving time as dropped significantly. The series 3 foil looks better, and performs on series 5 than it&#x27;s stock foil. The cutter however appears to be same though, the original probably dulled over time.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the 8000 series blades and the screen gives a better shave than the 8000 series replacement parts.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 8985.  After reading negative reviews of the 51s for the 8000 series razors, I decided to try the 30b because I read reviews saying the 30b was a better option.  Anyway, YES the 30b works on the 8985 and I have had great results with it.</li>
    <li> This is legitimate. If you&#x27;ve done any research, you know there are replacement cutter blocks that are either poorly manufactured or the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; style Braun cutter blocks that just don&#x27;t live up to the quality of what they used to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not fall into either category. The only thing wrong with this cutting block is that the 8000 series is not listed in the title or description, misleading many customers (myself included) to purchase the other low quality cutting blocks found on Amazon that are advertised as 8000 series replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cutting block cuts like the first day I bought the shaver. It&#x27;s a close shave (for an electric razor) and there is no tug or pull on the hair follicles. The only difference is the body of the block is colored black. That&#x27;s it. Otherwise it is great.</li>
    <li> This part works well in other models as in my 8595 as was mentioned by  other reviewers.Cuts really well. The only difference is it is black not silver but looks great that way.</li>
    <li> The Braun shaver that I have been using for a few years now is Smartcontrol Type 5746. Recently, its foil just disintegrated. Anyway, it was time to replace it. On the back of the shaver, the inscribed replacement part number is 30s. After a couple of weeks of extensive search, I was unable to find any 30s replacement part any where. Using the following Braun replacement parts finder, it appeared 30b as a possible replacement (matched through the closest available type 5747):&lt;br /&gt;http://www.service.braun.com/home.asp?rg&#x3D;AFRICA&amp;c&#x3D;SD&amp;l&#x3D;GB&amp;typ&#x3D;pf&amp;s&#x3D;&amp;seite&#x3D;&amp;sString&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ordering, this part was scheduled to arrive mid July, but to my pleasant surprise, it arrived a week earlier. And it fits my Braun 5746 perfectly and works like a brand new shaver again!</li>
    <li> I have the 8000 series shaver, so this officially not the correct replacement...however, this is my 2nd one of these, and they work as well as the other &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; foil and cutter at a far less price...but after about 8 mths use they do lose their edge and seem to dull fairly quickly..still good value though, esp. compared to store prices...</li>
    <li> I love my braun shaver and this is an exact fit replacement cutter and foil. Regular replacement will let you enjoy the use of the razor for years.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for my Braun 7505 shaver.  The shaver now performs like new.</li>
    <li> Read the advice written by a previous reviewer specifically about this exact product.  He compares the differences between the series 3 the series 5 products.  They are a must read before you buy!! I believe his name is Paul Gifford and don&#x27;t over look his embedded link to his actual comparisons of the two products. Very subtle but important difference&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> It is the perfect fit for my 8589 Braun shaver. Everyting works and it will hold for 1 1/2 Years.</li>
    <li> After reading numerous reviews of both this part and the one recommended by Braun, this is the replacement I ordered for my 8985. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The parts are a perfect fit, and I just shaved away two days&#x27; worth of stubble that spouted while awaiting delivery. Buttery smooth and a nice close result. This is the one to get for your 8985.</li>
    <li> Workable but I think I would rather have a new and better shaver.</li>
    <li> The approved replacement part for my shaver, and at half the price.  Oh yes, it shaves great!</li>
    <li> Always the same great quality.</li>
    <li> Received the wrong replacement. Would really help to display the actual merchandise (not the packaging) so I can see what I&#x27;m purchasing and also to have easy return mechanism to return the item I mistakenly purchased.</li>
    <li> It comes well packaged, fits the razor it was designed for and works. Nothing fancy but the replacement cutter  and foil does the job it was advertised to do- restores shaving efficiency.</li>
    <li> What a difference.  A new foil micro-screen and blade make all the difference in an electric shaver performance.  Own a 4700 series which worked well with the 4-7K series screen and blade.</li>
    <li> good product and fast shippping</li>
    <li> does fit the older braun series as stated. Wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but ordered anyway. It is just updated so looks a little different.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the clean close shave.  and so do I ..</li>
    <li> This item is listed as &amp;#34;Frequently Bought Together&amp;#34; with the Braun Series 3 340S-4 wet dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work with the 340S-4. The correct replacement part for the 340S-4 is Braun 32B or 32S.&lt;br /&gt;32B is black, 32S is sulver</li>
    <li> This dropped right in and shaving like new again.</li>
    <li> Fit my Braun SyncroPro 7680. Foil a little different mesh and the blades were side cut rather than the old straight vertical blades but the design must be an improvement as they work great. Excellent bargain! :)</li>
    <li> I have always like the ergonomics of my Braun razor.  What I did not like was that It took a long time to get a good shave. Well, that is not a problem any more. I now get a very close shave very quickly.with the new replacement head and cutter.</li>
    <li> I have a Series 3 350-cc4 that I bought about two years ago.  Even though both this product&#x27;s description and the razor&#x27;s description page say this is the correct replacement head, it does not fit!</li>
    <li> Replace every year. Price was about half of what Walmart sell theirs for. Fast shipping. I don&#x27;t think anyone else makes a replacement foil and blade so I can&#x27;t compare it with similar products.</li>
    <li> It works as it should.</li>
    <li> I did not realize how bad my current foil was, until i replaced it with this.  As other I used this foil to go on my model 8585 and it fits like it should.  It has a slightly different design and my original clear plastic cover will not fit, but that is not a defect or complaint, just an fyi if you need that.  I am pleased with the functionality, shipping and the product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how far gone my Foil and Cutter were. The razor performs like new now. Now if I could just get a new battery.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun Shavers since I saw a display booth at the 1984 worlds Fair in New Orleans. One shave and I was hooked. Avoid third party replacement parts and stay with the original.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly on my Braun 8975.  Much smoother than my last replacement. The color of the plastic is black so it doesn&#x27;t match the silver shaver.</li>
    <li> I was delaying my shaving for days - my old one was worn out! Now my wife wants me to shave every day!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it sure feels good!</li>
    <li> Another new set for my Braun arrived and works well. I&#x27;ll be ordering another in a year or so!</li>
    <li> Got with shaver so would have them. They recommend changing every 18 months.  I like changing about every 12 months</li>
    <li> This works perfectly on my 10+ years old 7526.  At first, I am not sure but decide to try.&lt;br /&gt;It work great and nice.  Good fit.</li>
    <li> I added this to my old Braun shaver and it has made it better than new!  I haven&#x27;t replaced my foil or cutter in years and this made my old shaver work better than it did when it was new.  I guess I should replace these items more often!  LOL  I was thinking about getting a new shaver and glad I bought this instead.</li>
    <li> I read through the reviews and decided to go along with the recommendation to buy this as a replacement for my 8595 shaver.  Much to my delight once I tried this new foil and cutter my shave worked the best it ever has.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or leave the occasional razor burn.  I highly recommend buying this replacement for the 8000 series instead of the one braun recommends.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with the new foil and cutter block.  It&#x27;s like have a brand new shaver.  Well worth the price and I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Fit perfectly and cuts well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my braun electric shaver for a while and have gone through about 4 replacements by now. Every time I replace the cutter it&#x27;s like new again.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Needed to replace the original and didn&#x27;t want to pay full retail nor go to the store.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and it still works well.</li>
    <li> Based on some reviews, I ordered  the &amp;#34;Braun Series 3 Combi 30b Foil and Cutter replacement pack (7000/4000 Series)&amp;#34; for my Braun 8585 Activator razor. In my opinion, it works much better then the last Braun 8000 Activator Combi Foil and Cutterblock replacement pack that I purchased. It&#x27;s still not as good as the foil and blades that the razor originally came with brand new, but I&#x27;m not sure if any of the replacements packs that are currently available today are as great as the original foil and blades, or at lease I haven&#x27;t found one yet. I give the &amp;#34;Series 3 Combi 30b replacement pack&amp;#34; a 8 out 10 for shaving performance when use with my 8585 razor. It as worked very well when I shave everyday, and ok when it&#x27;s been a 5-7 days between shaves.</li>
    <li> It seems like this set was redesigned or something, because it is made slightly different than my last one I ordered. It makes a Huge difference! Glides and cuts like a charm. Much faster and smoother shave with it.</li>
    <li> Perfectly fits my series 8000 Braun shaver, works fine.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> It fit my 20 year old razor and was OEM at a decent price.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m done playing Braun&#x27;s game.  Spending that much on a shaver is an investment - and with Braun it doesn&#x27;t pay off. The first time you buy a replacement foil you realize they&#x27;ve changed the design and you&#x27;re yanking out hairs.&lt;br /&gt; Then later I buy this cassette that says it fits my shaver and it&#x27;s completely the wrong one. Their site says it&#x27;s correct. This listing says it&#x27;s correct. It&#x27;s nowhere near to fitting. I did some research to find out which one I really need and that item lists as &#x27;formerly 9000 Pulsonic&#x27;. Why all the changeups? Just let me buy a replacement that&#x27;s the one that came on the expensive shaver. I don&#x27;t know why they make this hard.</li>
    <li> It does everything thing that I need it to do and more it is a great brand you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> This product fits the 7000 Series Braun electric razor. The foil is first removed by pressing the upper sides of the foil holder and the cutter is removed by turning it 90 degrees and pulling it out. The new cutter is installed in reverese fashion and the new foil just snaps into place. The new foil and cutter work very well and the absence of the tugging effect on the beard from an old cutter and foil is quite noticable.</li>
    <li> I replaced my screen and blades with this kit and it was very easy and the shaver worked great afterwards too!</li>
    <li> expensive, but it works and it fits.  I&#x27;ve had the same Braun for at least 10 yrs now I guess. Just change the block every now and then.</li>
    <li> AS promised.  Quick delviery.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun electric razors for a number of years now.  It has always amazed me at how pricey foils and blades can be.  I used to buy them on EBAY, but could never count on quality.  Now that I have found favorable pricing on AMAZON, I can be assured of quality as well.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, as many before me have said, this is a horrible replacement for the old style. I have used my 7680 almost every day for the past 9 years...this new type of cutter is not effective at cutting the hair, but it is effective in creating irritation, including on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cleaning base lock-in button thing broke 2 weeks after my initial purchase, but hoped for the best that it would still clean--and it did, and I was happy, and never even complained to Braun about it and never needed or wanted to get it fixed. I thought my shaver would die a slow death, many years down the road, and I would be prepared after noticing a weakening in power...but this...uncalled-for change by Braun has sprung upon me without warning and my face can take no more. It&#x27;s not often that German engineering fails. I know this change came quite some time ago but I would buy 2 replacements at a time in order to go 3 years without worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely disappointed with Braun and their decision to do this. I don&#x27;t think I will buy a new/different Braun model after this, for who knows when they will make another poor decision. They have lost a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good run. Thank you Syncro 7680, you served me well and did not deserve this.</li>
    <li> I have had a 7105 for about 10 years and just replaced the foil and blade. This new one does not get as close (according to my kids) and feels like I have to try harder. However, since my old one was ripping my hair out, this is a welcome replacement.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly for my 360 complete. It says I need 13 more letters to put this review in so there.</li>
    <li> Slightly different from the original on my 8595 but works perfectly. I should have bought a replacement years ago! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I hated to get rid of the razor as the battery was still strong and it was in otherwise good condition. The only problem was the foil part kept popping off plus the shave was no longer very close as it tended to pull on the whiskers rather than cut them. Putting the new foil and cutter on makes it perform like new.</li>
    <li> Very good quality direct replacement, really made a new razor out of my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; one. Wish I would have bought them a year ago.</li>
    <li> Fits my old 7526 braun razor perfect. The design seems to be better than the original foil. Makes your old razor shave like new again.</li>
    <li> I only end up changing my foil and cutting block every few years, and I&#x27;m always a little afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find the parts for my decade-plus-old razor. I shouldn&#x27;t have worried, though. Every time the parts are readily available and seem to be better refined and higher quality than the ones I&#x27;m replacing. Who says companies don&#x27;t make products that a built to last any more?</li>
    <li> Now that Braun has quit making the previous model screen for a great razor, the 30B fits perfectly and provides like-new performance at a bargain price. Don&#x27;t compromise with the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; style cutter, they aren&#x27;t as good as the original, thin-bladed cutter. The new kind are machined and have wider blades which just don&#x27;t cut as cleanly without pulling, dragging and irritating the skin. I don&#x27;t use the cutter that comes in this set. I have purchased original cutters elsewhere and use them to go with this 30B foil.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s necessary to replace the foil and cutter head now and then. They don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. But if I must replace it, this is a good price and WalMart does not carry it consistently. Would get five stars if its sharpness lasted longer.</li>
    <li> These tiny parts seem a bit pricey but considering the cost of a new razor, the ease of replacing these two small parts and the great results.  If your Braun is a little less friendly than when you bought it give it an attitude adjustment with a new blade and screen.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this model replacement in the past to ensure that I was getting the original style cutter block for my 8585 model Braun.  I ordered another 31b replacement two weeks ago and received the newer style cutter block which I find doesn&#x27;t cut as close and quickly gets very hot.  Not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Braun not read the reviews to see that people want the original style cutter block?  If it&#x27;s a profit thing, just charge more.  I would gladly pay 2x the amount to not have to spend hours researching/ordering/returning blades to get the result that I want and for which I originally purchased the Braun 8585.</li>
    <li> With the new foil and cutter, the shaver is like new again. Work very well and I spend less time shaving.</li>
    <li> My husband has a Braun Series 3 razor.  These are genuine Braun parts as far as we can determine.  Anyway, they fit well and are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Perfect and a good price.</li>
    <li> This foil and cutter made my razor cut like new....I had no idea how much better my razor would work until I replaced the foil/cutter.  Previously I had used the original &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; for several years, finally the old foil got a small hole and so I replaced it....AND MAN OH MAN was my shave sooooo much smoother...Should have done it years ago.</li>
    <li> Fits better than the after market foil and cutters. I usually replace every two years.  Shop around for the best price.</li>
    <li> performs as intended.  minus one star because this design seems to irritate my face more than the previous one.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Worked perfect !</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting. Works perfectly.  Thanks. They even refunded me a small amount when the border fees were less than they predicted.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work like it used to.</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter both fit my 7505 perfectly.  What more can I say.  Haven&#x27;t tried a cut yet but will soon.</li>
    <li> delivered as advertised</li>
    <li> This pack is easy to replace and quick.</li>
    <li> Best price and the change in performance was dramatic!</li>
    <li> Item came as promised in new condition. Swapped out with old parts. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I received my package yesterday. it is OK.</li>
    <li> I got this as a cheaper replacement for my Braun 360 shaver. I&#x27;ve been torn between do I bother to keep using this or switch completely over to my Norelco 2d. this unti fits my 360 shaver, but it doesn&#x27;t improve the shave vs. the OEM foil cutter that came with the unit. I never thought this or the OEM foil cutter did the best shaving job for me anyway.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews I took a chance and ordered this model number instead of the 8585 replacements. They are virtually idential. Fits the razor fine and works flawlessly. If you don&#x27;t mind black plastic instead of the fancy metal on the sides,  THIS is the way to go. It&#x27;s your money. Why not save it?</li>
    <li> The new cutter and foil make my 9 year old Braun like a brand new razor for one tenth the cost.  Great shave faster and easier.</li>
    <li> Shaver is like new again.</li>
    <li> I received the dreaded wide cutter head in this and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my 24 month old cutting head and foil that I replaced. That tells me Braun must be trying to get us all to switch to their newer more expensive shavers by making their old ones garbage. First though we have to spend $25 more to find this out. Maybe they just don&#x27;t care anymore or there&#x27;s new management and they are clueless on running a company properly to keep their customers happy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why they would do this because the minute I took it out of the package common sense said that would happen. Wider blade design means more blocking of holes. They tried to make up for this via the foil with more holes but I just didn&#x27;t see it working better at all since the larger blocking surface moves back and forth so quickly. The shaver is however working much worse especially around my nose and mouth where the shaver is not in full contact with a surface. There it causes a uncomfortable vibrating that I equate to a jackhammer like effect and at times feels like it is even yanking hairs before cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find an old replacement for your shaver go with the old until this manufacturer get a clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/26/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver head is still terrible. It works as poorly as it did when I first got it. The only saving grace is if I shave every day instead of every other day or longer it doesn&#x27;t create the jackhammer like effect as much as when my whiskers have grown longer. The problem is now I get razor bumps on my neck and face. Thanks Braun, nice design change. Maybe you should properly test items before changing them. I&#x27;ll be looking for a new razor and it won&#x27;t be one of yours./</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Series Combi 30b replacement blade and foil for my Series 8000 because of the previous reviews stating that it had the original style blades and not the new flat style blades.  I just received it and can confirm that the Braun has switched the blades on the 30b set to the new flat style blades.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the shave since this is the first time I&#x27;ve changed the blade and foil in over 4yrs or more.  I&#x27;d still be using the original blade and foil if my foil wasn&#x27;t damaged(breaks in the foil making larger openings).  So I guess I&#x27;ve been putting up with some painful shaves for sometime.  So of course just about any shave is better.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that some Target store have a space for the 30b set(out of stock) as well as 30a( usually in stock) for about $29.00.&lt;br /&gt;The foil and blade does fit my old 8000 series razor. But the travel cover does not snap on since the 3 series foil does not have the part on the bottom of the foil that sticks out a bit to hold the cover(not a big problem for me).&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 3 stars because I was expecting the original blade style.  Was delivered by delivery date.</li>
    <li> After ordering from Amazon I check the local walmart and they had it for a couple $ less!  A little disappointed, but the foil and replacement pack made my old shaver new again!  It does not cut as close, but cuts longer couple of day old stubble better than the previous foil.  Hole paterns are different. slightly faster shaves, but not as close.</li>
    <li> I too have struggled to find the best cutter and foil replacement.  Thanks to some reviews, I tried the 30b for my series 8000 shaver, model 8995.  It works really well and I would say I love it at 5 stars, but it is too early yet.  Only a week of shaves and one cleaning.  So far so good, nice clean shave, average beard and you don&#x27;t have to take out a second mortgage at less than $20.00.  It is interesting that I bought it for $18 and now it is up to $21 in 2 weeks time.  Buy now before it creeps into the mid $30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a nine-year old Braun 7526 that has seen a lot of heavy use. The screen developed a small hole in it, which is normal for wear and tear, and I decided to get this Combi kit that included a new cutting head in addition to the screen. After cleaning out the old shaver head area, I popped off the old cutting block and replaced it with the new one. Then I attached the new screen and the shaver was ready to go in less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screen fits perfectly and feels even better while shaving than the original screen did. The new cutting head works very well and has returned my shaver to factory specs. I was playing with the idea of buying a new shaver, but the Combi-kit costs a fraction of the price of a new shaver and has added another few years of life to my Braun 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got an old faithful Braun shaver that you don&#x27;t want to part with, buying this Combi-kit should extend the life of your old Braun.</li>
    <li> My Braun Series 3 shaver is just like new with this replacement. A lot cheaper than buying a new shaver or even buying the replacement in a retail store if you could even find one.</li>
    <li> Great product...Half the price of what is being sold at Walmart.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement head for my 8000 series. I don&#x27;t remember the exact model, but needed a replacement foil. After reading reviews, I tried my luck that this one was compatible. It fit perfectly, gave a great shave, and saved me a few dollars rather than the standard 8000 replacement foil &amp; cutter. I would recommend if you are guessing if your razor is compatible.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, price and product. While it may have taken a few days longer than walking up the road to a shaver shop, it was more than 75% cheaper buying it online.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced my cutter and foil for a long time so this change made a big improvement in performance.  Let me add that the 7000 series Braun that I have is an amazing machine.  It must be 15 years old and the battery still goes two weeks on a charge.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on various Braun replacement foil/cutter sets I elected to try this Series 3 on my 8000 series shaver.  Those who&#x27;ve done the research in previous reviews are right about this being a smoother shaving experience.  I don&#x27;t recall them saying that the plastic shield didn&#x27;t fit very well.  In fact it falls off.  All the same the important thing is the feel of the shaver and how close it shaves and this is a better foil/cutter combination than the one recommended by Braun.</li>
    <li> Following the reviews of other Amazon customers here, I took a leap of faith and wait with the Braun Series 3 Foil and Cutter Replacement pack for my Braun 8995, instead of the manufacturer recommended Series 5 replacement pack I had gotten the first time around that I had needed to change the foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;And so far so good: cheaper, and it seems to work just as well if not *better* than the Series 5 replacement pack for the 8995!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this Replacement Pack for my husband&#x27;s shaving machine. He is very much satisfied with the quality of the replaced part. The product was shipped one day earlier than it was in the shipping note from the seller. I would highly recommend this Replacement Pack to anyone who needs to replace the foil and cutting element in 3 Series Braun shaving machine.</li>
    <li> Completely renewed shaver.</li>
    <li> Nice looking and works very well!</li>
    <li> I have used Braun 8000 series for years.  My wife decided to take a chance on this head because of good reviews and the lower price.  I got the closet, fastest shave I&#x27;ve had for a long time -- my wife could not believe how quickly I finished.  I have a heavy beard and shave twice a day.  At this price I will not try to get extra shaves out of a worn head and we quickly ordered the back-up.</li>
    <li> Note the GREAT reviews for this product are from 2010-11. The 2012-13 reviews are TERRIBLE, and mine is too. I&#x27;ve had a Braun 7000 series for 15+ years and every 18 months I replace cutter and foil. I just replaced three weeks ago and my face is being destroyed, absolutely destroyed. The new blades are wide and flat and HURT and CUT incessantly. This is an awful experience. If anyone knows where to get new \\&quot;old\\&quot; style replacement blades, please let me know. I have an old travel razor - I am switching to it for the time being. My face can&#x27;t take any more abuse.</li>
    <li> Let me clarify, the foil and cutter fit perfectly on my 8995 Braun razor, I just can&#x27;t put the plastic protective cover on it now.  No big deal since I don&#x27;t use it unless I travel.  Still not a problem because I still put the razor in it&#x27;s protective case.  It&#x27;s black rather than the silver of the original/replacement.  No real issue for me since the razor is a combination of black and silver anyway.  The silver of the series 5 is painted on and starts looking bad after multiple cleanings anyway.  As far as shaving with this foil and cutter, feels the same as the series 5 and costs a whole lot less!</li>
    <li> This fit my razor just fine but I did notice the pattern on the screen was slightly difference than the one I was replacing and the cutting head looked a little different too but the shave was awesome, the closest I have ever had from this electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually only replace the cutting head and screen when the later develops a hole in it that scratches my face but I won&#x27;t wait that long this time.</li>
    <li> Great experience; thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a lot less expensive than buying a new shaver. Instead of changing every six months, I replace every couple of years, since I use the electric five days out of seven, the manual razor the other two for a closer shave. Still, my Braun electric is going strong after 8 or 9 years.</li>
    <li> If you own a Braun shaver model 7505, this is NOT a replacement cutter/foil.  Be sure you order a new cutter/foil screen specifically designated for your model shaver.  This unit may fit MOST in the Braun 7000 series, but not the 7505.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed for I had not replaced these parts previously, (about 2 1/2 years.  It made shaving fun again with a good close shave.</li>
    <li> This is a much better foil and cutting block than is recommended..and or the latest incarnation.  My face thanks the other reviewers for steering me this direction..  In fact, I am going to buy 3 more sets in case they discontinue this series entirely.&lt;br /&gt;No BS.....this is a happy face. :)  KC</li>
