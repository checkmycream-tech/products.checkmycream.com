### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I gave it three star because it did a good job conditioning my hair.</li>
      <li>It covers the gray and is a good option for being</li>
      <li>Great product and quick delivery!</li>
      <li>excellent and fast shipping</li>
      <li>The henna product really was not so great.  </li>
      <li>I also did some online research and found videos on YouTube posted by some lovely women who walk us through their processes of dying with henna and indigo.  </li>
      <li>This product is safe but doesn&#x27;t work well, after repeated applies.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a year, love it.   </li>
      <li>However, when used correctly, it&#x27;s also an excellent, long-lasting dye which gives hair natural-looking, multidimensional color (rather than the flat look given by some permanent, boxed dyes).</li>
      <li>not that easy to use henna but pretty good considering.  </li>
      <li>This is a really great product if you&#x27;re looking for all natural hair dye.  </li>
      <li>Good Product, Fast Delivery.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;chemically free.  </li>
      <li>There is a bit of a quality spectrum, but Light Mountain is great for the price and stays as long as any BAQ henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the 1-star reviews on this product come from people who clearly haven&#x27;t done their homework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using the product for 4 years and despite the mess have been really happy with the results.</li>
      <li>It was time consuming, but worth the effort,  </li>
      <li>One tip I found very useful is to make sure you stir each mixture enough.  </li>
      <li>I believe they use good quality hanna and other plant products.</li>
      <li>Based on their information and my previous experience, I left the Step 1 mixture on for 4 1/2 hours and it come out perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Had I realized that I had to put step 1 mixture on my hair for about an hour, wash it off, towel dry my hair, and then put the step 2 mixture on my hair for another hour, and during this time, I had to use a blow dryer ever five minute to keep my hair warm, I might not bother.   </li>
      <li>It is so much work to cover your bathroom to protect it, use the hair dryer to keep the hair warm, etc, but at the end my hair ended exactly of the same color with my gray hair showing.</li>
      <li>, thank you Light Mountain Natural Color the Gray.</li>
      <li>I did exactly as the instructions said.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this product is good and healthy, but it&#x27;s too complicated to apply, and the process very long too.</li>
      <li>My grays are now a beautiful dark brown that blend right into my brownish black hair.  </li>
      <li>The instruction is very tricky.</li>
      <li>This product on its own is simple enough, just very time consuming.</li>
      <li>I used henna years ago and remember it taking much longer.  </li>
      <li>This will make your hair more reddish than the color of your choice so be careful.</li>
      <li>(there is a 3 hour developing time that is supposed to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; the dye making the time you have it in your hair shorter) with extensive clean up, I&#x27;d never attempted it.  </li>
      <li>the instructions start to finish before starting and again mid process and just now a third time to be sure I had followed the directions exactly.  </li>
      <li>As others have said, this is definitely worth the extra effort.  </li>
      <li>After reading reviews, I was ready for it to be a 2 hour long project and a bit messy, but had I known that from start to finish the time would be more like 5 hours</li>
      <li>Your hair looks really natural and not dyed.</li>
      <li>I leave the 1st application on my hair for 40 min to cover gray completely.</li>
      <li>Naturtint is not all natural.</li>
      <li>My mother wanted something all natural so I searched aounrd to find products that do not contain a lot of chemicals.</li>
      <li>I use color black, so the finish is warm brown (my natural hair color is dark brown)   </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair brownish and not black,</li>
      <li>Not easy to clean up, either - I had to scour the tub, sink and counters and mop the floor.  </li>
      <li>After the mess and stench of the product I figured it would be worth the very long process if it worked.</li>
      <li>Barbara: had you searched online for a few minutes for some basic information about henna, you would&#x27;ve found that almost every henna-related website and forum instructs one to do a strand test, first.</li>

<li> Besides, the colour didn&#x27;t last that long (about 3 weeks).      </li>

<li> It&#x27;s very messy, but it&#x27;s natural, final color is dark chestnut, no reddish when applied to pepper and salt hair.</li>
<li> It also nourishes the hair, leaving it full-bodied and shiny for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> As other reviewer said, it starts to wear away a bit after 3-4 weeks b/c</li>
<li> This stuff is like gritty mud, and hard to get out of your hair.  </li>
<li> That way, should you find out you&#x27;re allergic, at least you wouldn&#x27;t burn your entire head.</li>
<li> I ordered black.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t have half the tools they ask you to use when mixing the products.</li>
<li> It clogged the bathtub drain, so I had to use half a bottle of drain-o on that.  </li>
<li> but unfortunately i still have to die my hair every 2 weeks due to growth, and its such a long and tiring process to do it that often.</li>
<li> Just wasted of time and money.</li>
<li> &quot; - this is the worst product of any kind that I have ever used.  </li>
<li> You can minimize the messy by not trying to hurry.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s a long and difficult process as per other reviewer.</li>
<li> Recently I applied it and it gave me a very very bad headache that lasted a whole day.</li>
<li> Very messy.</li>
<li> After finally washing the nasty feeling and smelling product out of my hair it did absolutely nothing.</li>
<li> Hard to cover gray hair.  </li>
<li> I echo the other reviewer and agree that this is way too complicated.</li>
<li> Even though the product isn&#x27;t expensive, all the results and hassle are so not worth it.</li>
<li> Also, the product seems to have given me a really terrible headache even though I washed it out much sooner than they said to wash out.</li>
<li> I have never used a worse product.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe the instructions are this complicated.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m so upset and disappointed that I am not planning to use it again.</li>
<li> This is a very disappointing product.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t write \\&quot;worst HAIR product\\</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> In all of my 50+ years I have never used a worse product.  Notice I didn&#x27;t write \\&quot;worst HAIR product\\&quot; - this is the worst product of any kind that I have ever used.  After reading reviews, I was ready for it to be a 2 hour long project and a bit messy, but had I known that from start to finish the time would be more like 5 hours (there is a 3 hour developing time that is supposed to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; the dye making the time you have it in your hair shorter) with extensive clean up, I&#x27;d never attempted it.  This stuff is like gritty mud, and hard to get out of your hair.  It&#x27;s gross and smelly.  The glops that unavoidably fall onto your skin or surrounding area stain (of course dye stains, but the point I&#x27;m trying to make is that you can&#x27;t help getting it all over yourself and the bathroom).  Unless I had covered myself head to toe in petroleum jelly (and not just around my hairline) and had a spatter tarp covering every surface in my bathroom I could not have avoided the staining.  Not easy to clean up, either - I had to scour the tub, sink and counters and mop the floor.  It clogged the bathtub drain, so I had to use half a bottle of drain-o on that.  I read and re-read the instructions start to finish before starting and again mid process and just now a third time to be sure I had followed the directions exactly.  I did.  AND!  IT DID NOT COLOR MY GRAY!!!!!  UGH!  Let my mistake be your lesson.  Even though the product isn&#x27;t expensive, all the results and hassle are so not worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product if you&#x27;re looking for all natural hair dye.  As other reviewer said, it starts to wear away a bit after 3-4 weeks b/c it&#x27;s not permanent. Your hair looks really natural and not dyed. Don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s a long and difficult process as per other reviewer. Depends on what you&#x27;re looking. Naturtint is not all natural.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year, love it.   I leave the 1st application on my hair for 40 min to cover gray completely. This will make your hair more reddish than the color of your choice so be careful. I use color black, so the finish is warm brown (my natural hair color is dark brown)   you will need disposable gloves and cap, and some plastic sheet to cover your floor.</li>
    <li> I have used this product a total of 3 times, each with different results.  I have searched how to do henna and treat grey hairs and a lot pf people have different methods/recipes.  I for one like thibgs4 to be simple. This product on its own is simple enough, just very time consuming. It will do its job but unfortunately i still have to die my hair every 2 weeks due to growth, and its such a long and tiring process to do it that often. If you dont mind going to that extent then this would be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;Ps. It leaves my hair brownish and not black, oh well</li>
    <li> I echo the other reviewer and agree that this is way too complicated. Had I realized that I had to put step 1 mixture on my hair for about an hour, wash it off, towel dry my hair, and then put the step 2 mixture on my hair for another hour, and during this time, I had to use a blow dryer ever five minute to keep my hair warm, I might not bother.   And the color does fade after each wash. So after about three weeks you have to do something again to color that gray.   I gave it three star because it did a good job conditioning my hair. I believe they use good quality hanna and other plant products.</li>
    <li> My mother wanted something all natural so I searched aounrd to find products that do not contain a lot of chemicals. This product is safe but doesn&#x27;t work well, after repeated applies. What&#x27;s the point of using it if the product does not work?</li>
    <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for about a decade. I&#x27;ve tried both expensive, BAQ varieties and cheap stuff like Colora. There is a bit of a quality spectrum, but Light Mountain is great for the price and stays as long as any BAQ henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the 1-star reviews on this product come from people who clearly haven&#x27;t done their homework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s smelly. Yes, it takes hours. No, don&#x27;t follow the instructions on the packaging. However, when used correctly, it&#x27;s also an excellent, long-lasting dye which gives hair natural-looking, multidimensional color (rather than the flat look given by some permanent, boxed dyes). It also nourishes the hair, leaving it full-bodied and shiny for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Barbara: had you searched online for a few minutes for some basic information about henna, you would&#x27;ve found that almost every henna-related website and forum instructs one to do a strand test, first. That way, should you find out you&#x27;re allergic, at least you wouldn&#x27;t burn your entire head. You know, Chem Lab 101. But yes, let&#x27;s let your mistake be the lesson: do your research.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is good and healthy, but it&#x27;s too complicated to apply, and the process very long too. Besides, the colour didn&#x27;t last that long (about 3 weeks).      It&#x27;s a pity that it&#x27;s so complicated, because I really wanted to use such a natural product.     I turned to Naturtint instead.</li>
    <li> I tried the product today. I followed all the instructions and the suggestions of other reviewers to cover my gray hair (it is only like 10% of my hair). It did not work!! It is so much work to cover your bathroom to protect it, use the hair dryer to keep the hair warm, etc, but at the end my hair ended exactly of the same color with my gray hair showing. Just a little bit of gray strands got a little reddish color but the overall result is very unsatisfactory after all the time and effort.</li>
    <li> The henna product really was not so great.  There are two separate applications and washes, and you have to wait 3-4 hours for the powder mixtures to cure.  Also, the product seems to have given me a really terrible headache even though I washed it out much sooner than they said to wash out.</li>
    <li> I ordered black. Mixed with coffee. Let sit for 8 hours before use. Added eggs and olive oil as I saw in Youtube. Sat on hair for 4-5 hours. Tried a multiple times. Hard to cover gray hair.  Very messy. Had to give up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very messy, but it&#x27;s natural, final color is dark chestnut, no reddish when applied to pepper and salt hair.</li>
    <li> It did not cover my grey.</li>
    <li> As others have said, this is definitely worth the extra effort.  You can minimize the messy by not trying to hurry.  The problem I had is with the directions.  They say to leave the Step 1 (henna) mixture on for 5-15 minutes.  I used henna years ago and remember it taking much longer.  I did a strand test and my grays did not take even a tinge of color after 15 minutes.  I also did some online research and found videos on YouTube posted by some lovely women who walk us through their processes of dying with henna and indigo.  Based on their information and my previous experience, I left the Step 1 mixture on for 4 1/2 hours and it come out perfectly.  I left Step 2 (indigo) on for 1 hour and 45 minutes.  It was time consuming, but worth the effort,  My grays are now a beautiful dark brown that blend right into my brownish black hair.  One tip I found very useful is to make sure you stir each mixture enough.  Stir until it is shiny and creamy, with no lumps.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 4 years and despite the mess have been really happy with the results. Recently I applied it and it gave me a very very bad headache that lasted a whole day. The same thing happened to a friend too. This has never happened to me before and I&#x27;m so upset and disappointed that I am not planning to use it again.</li>
    <li> This is a very disappointing product. The instruction is very tricky. This product shouldn&#x27;t be in the market. Even I tried to follow the instructions for 3 times  the color still couldn&#x27;t hold at all. I discarded all of my 2 boxes of it. Just wasted of time and money.</li>
    <li> not that easy to use henna but pretty good considering.  It covers the gray and is a good option for being&lt;br /&gt;chemically free.  I cannot tolerate any other product so far, thank you Light Mountain Natural Color the Gray.</li>
    <li> I did exactly as the instructions said. After the mess and stench of the product I figured it would be worth the very long process if it worked. After finally washing the nasty feeling and smelling product out of my hair it did absolutely nothing. Zero. So I tried again and left it in longer like some suggested. It turned my hair purple. Stay away from this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the instructions are this complicated. I didn&#x27;t have half the tools they ask you to use when mixing the products. I threw mine out after struggling with it for hours.</li>
    <li> excellent and fast shipping I would buy again &amp; again</li>
