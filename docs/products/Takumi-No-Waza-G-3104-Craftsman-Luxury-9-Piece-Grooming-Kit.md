<li> This kit in my view is a little over priced.&lt;br /&gt;There are several other kits on the maker with the same basic tools &amp; quality but with a much lower price.&lt;br</li>
<li> The instruments are sharp and solid... not cheapy or &amp;#34;tinny&amp;#34; feeling... Have to admit I have no idea or use for the pokey sticks...</li>

    <li> excellent product ..... excellent service .... Thanks</li>
    <li> This was a totally positive experience. I would recommend this kit. Delivery was faster than promised.</li>
    <li> High quality of tools and very good leather case!</li>
    <li> Very good quality.  Not inexpensive, but well worth the premium price!</li>
    <li> what a craftsmanship it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finely built with durable steel. Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Seki kit.  If you have only used cheap kit like you might buy at a big box store then you are in for a treat.  There just isn&#x27;t any comparison between these and everthing else I have ever used.  Just buy them.  You will love yourself for the rest of your life.</li>
    <li> Good product. Well made.</li>
    <li> A quality set of precision instruments. Be warned the are very sharp. I only hope that they maintain that level of sharpness throughout the years</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviewers, I wanted an upgrade from my current drug store special manicure set, to a high quality one.  While this is pricey, the tools have considerable weight and are made well.  They are very sharp so some caution during use is advisable.  I would definitely recommend this set if you are looking for a high quality manicure set.</li>
    <li> I doubted whether to buy a german or a japanese nail kit and I am very happy with this one. I have only used it for two months so I do not know if the sharpness and precision will remain, but I feel that indeed it will because everything is sturdy and clearly built with precision and excellent craftsmanship. The leather case is very nice, small, easy to carry on travels. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these. They are similar to the tools  my foot doctor uses.Quality, sharp</li>
    <li> Great kit. High quality craftsmanship.  I got this and got rid of all the junk I had accumulated over the years for this purpose.  I wish I had just gotten a quality set to start with. Note that the clippers are straight edged (European style) and for us Americans will take a bit of getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got a set of these for my son.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use all the items within but like the quality of both the enclosure and the tools within. The ones that I have used have worked really well. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This kit was purchased for my friend as he didn&#x27;t have a grooming kit. The craftsmanship on this set is very good and I would say it is comparable to the DOVO set that I have for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything that is in the kit feels well crafted and good in the hand. The sharpness of the nail clippers is very sharp and they make short work for nails. The files are of good quality and has both a fine and coarse grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again for others if they were looking for a grooming set!</li>

    <li> I had a set of Tweezermen tools that I had for years  - a very expensive set. At the time I complained about the price... but here I am 15+ years late and just now deciding I might like a new set....  This set is a very nice, quality set. The instruments are sharp and solid... not cheapy or &amp;#34;tinny&amp;#34; feeling... Have to admit I have no idea or use for the pokey sticks... but they are also sturdy and heavy.  I think the scissors are &amp;#34;nose hair&amp;#34; trimmers as they are rounded at the ends... don&#x27;t need those either, but they too are a nice quality.  The case looks and feels like fine black leather and has a very sturdy zipper.  The case itself is about 4&amp;#34; x 5&amp;#34; (guesstimate) and about 1&amp;#34; thick when closed. The instruments are held in place by either and/or both a snap closure and/or an elastic strap.  Everything stays were it&#x27;s supposed to be.  I tiny bit tricky the first time you pull them out, but easy afterwards. They arrived quickly and in excellent condition along with some other items I had ordered (I have prime)&lt;br /&gt;I will update immediately if there are any wear or other issues.  I would consider buying this brand again.</li>
