      <li>The smell is OK.</li>
      <li>I may have noticed a couple more blemishes here and there</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great smell, needed bronzer</li>
    <li> First off, this tanning lotion smells great! I was so happy to leave the tanning salon smelling yummy, and not gross like alot of other lotions leave you.   It goes on smooth, and leaves you feeling silky afterwards.   I am already a frequent tanner, 3-4 times a week. I noticed a darker tan with this lotion after one use. I am in love! Even after 6 hours I noticed my tan getting darker.   I will def use this from now on.     4 star rating because it was shipped to me with a broken cap.</li>
    <li> Left me smelling well.. Sweet and sexy after I tanned! I love the fragrance and the bottle is cute. It was a nice treat while I tanned this season. I would reccomend. I got good and dark without a bronzer.</li>
    <li> I like the way it tans me and it has a very pleasant smell</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for quite a while now and really like it. It has a great smell, and really helps achieve a nice even tan. There is no bronzer in it which I like, and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad after-tan smell. This lotion is very expensive in the salon so buying it on Amazon was a bargain!</li>
    <li> The scent is awesome before you step out of the tanning bed, it has some what of a nasty after smell. Amazon was amazing with the delivery though, but this lotion is personally not my favorite sorry.. :|</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute, does it&#x27;s job, gives me a good tan, and smells like a body lotion. It&#x27;s a larger bottle with a pump, which makes for easy application. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again when I&#x27;ve used mine up!</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion. The scent is light and doesn&#x27;t leave me with any weird after tanning smell. It works well and I noticed myself getting good color after just one use.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good and inexpensive intensifier to add to my rotation and decided on sweet &amp; sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a frequent tanner, about 3 to 4 times a week, and I have noticed a shade difference just 3 hours after my first use..in a lvl 1 bed no less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion  went on very light and smells quite nice.  No ATO.  Great price for the quantity too.  Will definitely keep this in my tanning arsenal from now on.</li>
    <li> I got so excited as I was reading the reviews of this product. Many people said it smells identical to the perfume \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot;. I have been using pink sugar perfume for a long time so I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this lotion in. I also ordered the moisturizing body lotion to go with it. Sadly, upon using both the tanning lotion and the body lotion, I found that neither of them smelled anything like pink sugar. After tanning with the tanning lotion I smelled like pencil lead. The tanner itself did fine, and it made my skin very soft. I wish it had smelled like pink sugar because if so I would be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great for someone starting off in the tanning beds. It doesn&#x27;t contain a bronzer so you build your base without that orange tan that you can get from tanning beds.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t really see where it helped me tan better. the worst part was the intense vanilla smell, which personally turned me off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m taning 3d time with it for 7 min in booth and I can tell difference!I love the smell and love this lotion!Fast shipping! Thank u!</li>
    <li> For a non bronzing lotion this is a nice not too smelly lotion. No after tan smell. Ive only used it one time and I really like the results since I only tanned  for 10 min a lvl 1 bed. Price is great too!</li>
    <li> Overall a nice product. The smell is a lot better than most tanning lotions which is a major plus. The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five was because I don&#x27;t tan as dark as I do with other tanning lotions. I would recommend it though simply due to not having the &amp;#34;gross tanning smell&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I FREEEAAAKKKINNNGG love it!!! I can totally tell a difference! It smells great too. I only used it on my legs (because they refuse to get any darker)and my left arm (I drive with the window down and my right arm is tanner than my left don&#x27;t laugh!) and I can tell a difference already. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Im a girl who luvs to tan.. and I have tried so many tanning lotions. So by far this is good:) feels soft, silky and smells sweet. Is not to thick or sticky like most other lotions.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. For someone who burns easily it was perfect (in small doses of tanning). I never turned orange, which was afraid would happen in a tanning bed. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It is not slippery or too thick. I actually like a pretty thin/light tanning lotion. The smell is OK. It is vanilla as many have said, but I would describe it as a vanilla musk... kind of like that perfume we all wore as kids... the one from Walmart. It&#x27;s a little strong at first but once it was on my whole body, it did not seem overpowering and I barely noticed it. Once I was in the bed tanning, I noticed it did not get slippery or slimy as I was in the bed (which many lotions do). I was able to get out of the bed after 18 mins and not feel like I needed to immediately shower. I barely had to wipe my chest with a towel. The ONLY thing I didn&#x27;t like was that when I went home to shower, I noticed I smelled awful as soon as the water hit me. I don&#x27;t know if it was some freak event (I have only used the lotion once since I just got it) but it almost smelled like dog food in the shower. Weird I know. I mean it washed off quick so I guess it is not a big deal, but it was strange. After tanning and before showering, I couldn&#x27;t smell the vanilla. I didn&#x27;t really smell anything on me actually which is great if you have to go somewhere after tanning. I would recommend this lotion and buy it again. It is a great size bottle. Nice and tall. It has a cap and the pump part twists to lock so even if you lose the cap you can still throw it in your purse or a bag and not risk getting lotion all over. So yes, try this. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I use this product and bought it for the first time at my tanning salon.  When I found it online at half of the price I was elated.  Great shipping and timely arrival.  Would use/order again and again.</li>
    <li> Did not like this lotion at all there has been no difference in my color since using it. But it does smell really good!</li>
    <li> Great smell and works quick for an awesome tan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m your average ginger -- pale skin, red hair, some freckles. I built my &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; tan after a month but needed a boost after hitting my plateau! I went up a level on the bed and started my second round with Sweet &amp; Sexy. I really love it! I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference right after getting out of the bed, but this is a lotion that you have to let &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll be left with a nice golden tone. Like I said, I&#x27;m a ginger so I know I will never get DARK, but out of everything I&#x27;ve tried, this leaves me feeling like I&#x27;ve actually made some progress! Oh, AND it has a yummy vanilla scent that I absolutely love. Score :)</li>
    <li> I normally hate the smell of tanning lotion but this stuff smells great. I get a really nice tan quick too. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion here on amazon months ago, love it, and am back for more! Perfect for my tanning desire.</li>
    <li> Helps boost a tan pretty quickly but doesn&#x27;t do much for everyday tanning or well I dont tan everyday but I can always see a big difference after each time I do tan which is about once a week. The smell is amazing, almost smells like warm vanilla sugar from bath and body works, even smells good after tanning unlike most lotions.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this tanning lotion, not only for its pink vanilla sugar scent (before and after smell)  but for the moisturizing effect! The scent lingers on my,skin and smells like a cupcake, or a crispy creme glazed doughnut..&lt;br /&gt;No bronzers, no orange color.. No hand staining!&lt;br /&gt;Glad I purchaced from Amazon.. Saved 50$ vs purchasing from my salon!&lt;br /&gt;I noticed I dont burn when I,wear this..&lt;br /&gt;And I am freckled with very fair skin!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on,my color saying I,look much healthier!&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomend.&lt;br /&gt;My order was one day late though (hence 4 stars)</li>
    <li> I really liked this product! Smelt great and seemed to get the job done. 👍</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for bronzing, but it&#x27;s moisturizing and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I dont like the smell and it did not bring out a tan as other lotions have. I even upgrade tanning beds and usually have amazing results, but not with this lotion. It smells terrible after tanning and I can hardly stand to wear it afterwards. I have even asked opinions thinking it was just me and no one liked the smell after tanning.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the product. Smells good but doesn&#x27;t seem to work better than a regular moisturizer would for tanning. I did receive my item quickly and in great condition.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t have any bronzers or tingle but it&#x27;s not bad. Supre Sweet &amp; Sexy Legs Bronzer is a product I highly recommend nothing works for my legs except this product brand.  Supre Sweet &amp; Sexy Legs Bronzer highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tanning lotions I&#x27;ve ever used! You really notice a difference after only a couple sessions and it doesn&#x27;t leave you with an awful smell like some lotions do. Would recommend to anybody!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion because I brought a little packet from the tanning salon where I go tanning and loved the color it gave me. Then I purchased the bottle here &amp; the lotion is not the same color  nor smells the same as the one that was in the packet. I&#x27;ve used it 2 times already &amp; really can&#x27;t tell any difference unlike when I used the packet. I will stick to just buying it directly from my tanning salon even if it costs a few bucks more. At least I won&#x27;t have to spend extra money buying a  different bottle.</li>
    <li> The bottle came with the lid off. The lotion has a strange burnt sugar smell after you tan. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this lotion. I will stick to tingle lotions.</li>
    <li> This particular bottle seems a little different than lotions I&#x27;ve bought in the past, but I usually love this lotion.  Very good for sunlight or tanning bed.  Doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor and no streaking appearance from using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion ans ont ised it once, It is very watery, and made me smell like vanilla sugar scrub.. I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something without bronzers and this was it!!! This lotion smells great and is also a great moisturizer</li>
    <li> granted, i was pretty pale when i used this.... but i felt like it helped me get a little more color and smelled great. Cant wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> This specific lotion was 50$ at my tanning salon, they suggested not buying it online because it could be fake. I bought this, was the exact same product in the salon... way cheaper and worked amazing! Tan was nice, not orange, lasted a while. Lotion also smelled great before and after tanning.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product - Supre Sweet &amp; Sexy Maximizer. It smells incredible, works wonderfully, and was shipped to me very quickly. When it arrived it was packaged very well and wrapped in plastic to ensure that it was indeed brand new and not previously opened, used or tested. I am very happy with the purchase and the product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my tanning salon recommended it, but sold it at like a 300% markup (it was 1/3 the price on Amazon).  It&#x27;s a good basic tanning lotion. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell- it&#x27;s really sweet, and I don&#x27;t really like such sweet smells after my skin gets hot, but it does work like a charm without overtanning you.  I&#x27;m really pale and it made me a nice, natural color.  I also used it outdoors and it helped me not burn but still get some color. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on Amazon after reading all the good reviews on it.  It was just \\&quot;ok\\&quot; - nothing great, unfortunately.  I didn&#x27;t notice that it made me any darker, honestly and the scent is what really turned me off.  It wasn&#x27;t bad before tanning, but after I got out it had a nasty smell to it - so much so, that it made me really nauseous.  I finally had to give it to a friend (she actually had used it before &amp; liked it).  It&#x27;s just not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few weeks now and it works great i was at a point where i coundnt get tanner using this helped alot!</li>
    <li> I have never tanned so quickly!  I am about to order another bottle of this amazing stuff!  Plus the scent is pleasant.</li>
    <li> It is a very sweet vanilla smell.  It&#x27;s too sweet for me but my 20 year old daughter likes it.</li>
    <li> It wS okay didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
    <li> As a lotion, it is okay. I guess it feels like it contains silicone, which makes it nice and smooth. But, I didn&#x27;t buy it as a lotion. I was expecting a tanning enhancer. I even upgraded my tanning bed and didn&#x27;t notice ANY results. The lotion smells nice, though like all other lotions it STINKS after you lay in the bed. There was no \\&quot;maximizing\\&quot; of my tanning results. I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> A good product that I would reccommend.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a bad smell on your skin. It also absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> This also came with a packet of a sample of high avocets tanning lotion with hemp! I loved that! This one works great but I really recommend the high society tanning lotion with hemp!</li>
    <li> Been using supre tanning products for years, always pleased</li>
    <li> Awesome! Love this stuff! Smells great! My 2nd bottle! Where I go tanning they also buy from amazon....but I get a much better price here! Thanks amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I suggest swedish beauty girlfriend sexy over this product.  Coming from a very light skinned and nearly impossible tanner. This did smell good though..</li>
    <li> I only lay 1 time a week for fifteen minutes. I get a nice tan quickly with this stuff. It smells nice as well. You definatly don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It smells sweet like vanilla. I don&#x27;t come out of the tanning bed feeling slimy, feeling fried, or smelling fried (which some lotions do).</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage no bronzers keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated and nicely tan without the orange effect. Very satisfied and will purchase again my skin thanks you!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t quite say it smells like B&amp;BW&#x27;s Warm Vanilla Sugar, but it does smell very good and like vanilla. If you just want a good moisturizer then this is a great lotion. Won&#x27;t make you super dark it anything but I believe they make a bronzer in this scent as well. Anyway, I really like it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not a super dark tanner but works great.</li>
    <li> First, I am naturally very pale and picky about the tanning lotion I use as ones with lots of bronzers make me look silly.  This one worked great!  My skin was so soft after use and I could tell after just one time using it that was significantly tanner than tanning without lotion.  The scent is a very light vanilla sugar, and the after tan smell is exactly the same.  I feel like I&#x27;m wearing a hint of perfume instead of tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Smells delicious :)</li>
    <li> Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description. well worth the money, great price.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to buy a tanning lotion, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! It smells amazing before and after. I never got the \\&quot;burnt sugar\\&quot; smell after I was done. I have used it about 4 times already and have noticed a difference. It isn&#x27;t making me SUPER dark, but that is what I wanted. It&#x27;s helping maximize your tan in a very natural looking way. There is no extra bronzer, and that is what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping on this product was amazing. I live in a pretty small town so shipping usually takes a little longer, but it came within 3-4 days of purchase. It was very quick and no problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this lotion! It&#x27;s perfect if you need a natural looking boost for tan that smells great.</li>
    <li> I was pretty impressed with the shipping but even more impressed with the lotion...I read some of the review&#x27;s saying they were pale white &amp; it worked great...it&#x27;s works great even if you have a base color, I really did see the difference a few hours after tanning :)... and the smell really isn&#x27;t that bad &amp; it&#x27;s not even that strong(I&#x27;ve had worst, a lot worst)but I love the color it gave me &amp; the price is amazing :) I recommend this lotion to any one :) I&#x27;m really pleased with what I order....&amp; I also got a sample package :).....looooove it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tanning lotion for 4 years now and refuse to try anything else. It works great but also smells great unlike other tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> if thats the goal, and smells of vanilla which is a pleasant surprise. but, it really stinks fresh from tanning bed, burnt smell, which is why i only put it on hours before i tan, and just as a lotion after shower.  expensive lotion for just that . cerave is a great over the counter body lotion, works much better, sorry.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I first got it well over a month ago, I have got more color since using this product and it lasts longer. As long as you hydrate your skin after tanning with a lotion of your choice you will be pleased with you results. Also this is one of the best smelling indoor tanning lotions I have used.</li>
    <li> Although, I am not a &#x27;professional indoor tanner&#x27; I have tanned indoors many times before.  I personally liked this lotion because it had NO bronzers, NO tingle, NO sizzle, NO shimmer.  It is just a tan maximizer/accelerator lotion.  The scent is very sweet, sugary, vanilla-ish.  I think I read somewhere someone say it reminded them of Warm Vanilla Sugar, that&#x27;s pretty accurate.  I feel like I smell a slight floral undertone in the scent but just barely.  Overall, I personally love the scent before tan.  After tan the scent mixed with my pheromones has a bit of a cooked Warm Vanilla Sugar scent.  For the most part it still smells the same as before but not as sweet and sugary.  If it was a perfect world, the scent would be exactly the same as before, but that just doesn&#x27;t happen, so with that said, I am happy enough with the ATO.  It is definitely better than some other lotions I&#x27;ve tried and unlike some other lotions I do not feel as if I have to hurry home to shower off the after tan scent.  One thing I do love about this lotion is how soft my skin is after I apply it and even after I tan, actually until I shower.  I also notice that it has not made me breakout on my upper chest and back as some other tanning lotions (and normal drugstore brand moisturizing lotions) have.  I have very acne prone skin and some sunblocks even make me breakout with in a day or two, but this lotion has for the most part been good.  I may have noticed a couple more blemishes here and there but NOTHING like what I&#x27;ve experienced before.  The reason I use a lotion when I tan indoors is because I feel that it helps to speed my tanning along (combined with good beds with good bulbs), I am less prone to burn/get pink if I do it&#x27;s for like a day and for the skin firming extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, when I do need another bottle of tanning lotion, this will be the 1st lotion I search for.  And BONUS: it is a steal here on amazon!  My tanning salon has a sticker price for this same bottle2.5-3x&#x27;s higher than amazon&#x27;s price. :)</li>
    <li> Works great ! And smells amazing ! You notice a difference in your tan right away</li>
    <li> Smells nice, spreads well all over, you can see results after a few tanning sessions.</li>
    <li> this lotion is probably the best i have ever had! i am so dark since using this. its light and doesnt smell all nasty afterwards and it WORKS!! id reccomend this every day of the week!</li>
