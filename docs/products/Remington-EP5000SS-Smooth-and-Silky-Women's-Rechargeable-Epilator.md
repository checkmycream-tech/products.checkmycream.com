### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have unwanted hair growth with perfect results!!</li>
      <li>but it is great for legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOL I came across the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stop hair growth altogether, but it&#x27;s a great, low-maintenance, low-impact solution.</li>
      <li>Both are great.</li>
      <li>I like that you can use it cordless or plugged in and it comes with a shaving head (which my hubby uses lol).</li>
      <li>I think its great.</li>
      <li>I am over-joyed to own this epilator!  </li>
      <li>and I agree with others that this was a good place to start.</li>
      <li>Over all, I think this epilator is a good starter.</li>
      <li>My chin hairs had been growing uncontrollably for a couple of weeks, so they were at a good length to try it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking for a model with more tweezing units, but would recommend this one to someone who is looking for an inexpensive introduction to epilating!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>However, it is not so effective and leaves about 20% of the amount of hair.</li>
      <li>Packaged safely and nicely.</li>
      <li>however, this is great (and at a reasonable price) for doing touch-ups in between leg waxing!</li>
      <li>For the price, it is ok.</li>
      <li>it will take me more than 5 minutes to get just one strip.  </li>
      <li>Its more like 8 to 10 per leg.  </li>
      <li>well, ok.</li>
      <li>But it is a twice-daily topical cream and it works best after hair removal.   </li>
      <li>Now I am on the lookout for a better brand.</li>
      <li>The first thing that caught my eye was the color, purple is my FAVORITE!</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to a friend and I am so happy to have the hairless, smooth skin I have desired since my teens.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B002OE5WYO Remington EP5000SS Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Rechargeable Epilator]]</li>
      <li>I looked for a cheap one I could cut my teeth on...or trim my hairs with...</li>
      <li>Having had the originals, which were great, I&#x27;ve tried many since then and this is the only one worth the money.</li>
      <li>The heads are also fully removable making it easy to clean.</li>
      <li>And to be fair it does smart at first</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the sound of success to me!</li>
      <li>so so so worth it!  </li>
      <li>, if you want a good epilator you will definitely need to invest more money, but it will be worth it.</li>
      <li>And it allowed me to get those hard to reach hairs at the crease of my chin and neck, awesome!!!</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t hurt, it actually feels good to me.</li>
      <li>I turned it on and it was kind of loud, but no louder than my boyfriends hair trimmer he uses every week.</li>
      <li>but once you get used to the sensation you can use your Remington Smooth&amp;Silky almost anywhere on your body, the only area that it does not seem to do a good job is on the face</li>
      <li>Luckily there were a couple of reviews of the Remington EP5000SS on there</li>
      <li>The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that the charge does not last very long and you quickly notice the change in speed as the charge runs out, so keep it plugged in for best resukts.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a glittery, aubergine purple, my specific favorite!</li>
      <li>but I can tell you that I used it several times for extended periods for hair removal all over my body and it never hesitated in getting the job done with amazing results.    </li>
      <li>This is a nice basic epilator.</li>
      <li>but I suppose it&#x27;s a nice extra.</li>
      <li>But overall, I am VERY pleased with this product would suggest it to anyone who wants to give epilating a try for the first time.</li>
      <li>I bought this last year for 18 dollars and worked great, now i want another one for my sister and is double priced!</li>
      <li>You can take apart the entire top to clean it and it is easy to put back together.</li>
      <li>Now it just feels good to get rid of the hair and to know that some day I will be hairless from this little contraption.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how much more sparse the hair on my legs is.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I did was look up YouTube videos of how to use this thing.</li>

      <li>The first time I used it on my underarms, the skin got caught in.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a pretty nice little model, but it takes a Looooooong time to do my legs (somewhere around 45 minutes a leg)  </li>
      <li>The first time using the epilator took some time to achieve desired results but I am so glad for taking the time to do it right instead of being an impatient twit like so many people are these days and then complaining that the product didn&#x27;t perform to expected standards.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty high tolerance for pain</li>
      <li>: Doesn&#x27;t really hurt.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve missed the return window &amp; i&#x27;m really upset.  </li>
      <li>, would it hurt me THAT much?  </li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
      <li>Not only that,  but its MUCH more soft and</li>
      <li>This was the first epilator I purchased and was a little nervous about using an epilator, which is why I decided to go with the Remington EP5000SS since it was one of the most inexpensive out of all models out there.</li>
      <li>I also feel like it rips hair much more than my other epilator used to.</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re looking to do your face pick a smaller product designed for use on the face, and if you&#x27;re looking to do your whole leg pick a larger product with more tweezers.  </li>
      <li>Plus I have a high tolerance for pain</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m pretty young in my early 20s.  </li>
      <li>It felt good to me and my skin is so soft and it wasn&#x27;t red like it usually gets when I pluck.</li>
      <li>, I went on a hair removal search and came across the new and improved epilators.   </li>
      <li>Pretty simple as that.</li>
      <li>I really cannot comment on it&#x27;s longevity since I have had mine only 2 weeks</li>
      <li>Completely unsatisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>particular product has several features that I like.</li>
      <li>After reading up quite extensively on the new style epilators and one especially helpful review of the Remington Smooth&amp;Silky I decided to purchase one.</li>
      <li>It is a little intimidating at first but even on the one or two occasions it grabbed my skin</li>
      <li>(my European one doesn&#x27;t work here due to electricity) and didn&#x27;t want to spend much money.</li>
      <li>and I barely have any hair left of my legs.</li>
      <li>I have used my Remington Smooth&amp;Silky on my underarms, arms, full legs, abdomen, bikini area and a few other places</li>

<li> I have used my Remington Smooth&amp;Silky on my underarms, arms, full legs, abdomen, bikini area and a few other places</li>
<li> it&#x27;s definately not for use on the face (too big) and it would take forever to do your whole leg (too small).  </li>
<li> Because it takes so long, the battery lasts only for one leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The hair on my legs was so thick, black and course, the only way for me to get it to soften up and grow more slowly was to wax.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s not a perfect product, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do more or less.  </li>
<li> Two other women I know use epilators regularly on their faces.</li>
<li> The one thing that I agree with other reviewers is that you do have to go  over the same area twice, which makes it longer to finish the job.</li>
<li> I have highly sensitive skin and very coarse, thick hair</li>
<li> It does rip the hairs out faster than my single plucking did...</li>
<li> Due to the same design flaw, a lot of hair gets caught in the same space after use, and it becomes impossible to clean.</li>
<li> It is a design flaw, this never happened to me before, and I am careful and know I have to hold my skin taut.</li>
<li> if you&#x27;re afraid of the pain or do not want to spend a lot of money, this one could be the right one for you!</li>
<li> But I&#x27;m already looking forward to using my other one again.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
<li> I have read some of the other reviews about this product</li>
<li> this one just is not worth it.</li>
<li> I held my skin taut and started in an area with no hair (my cheek) and started working my way down in a circular motion.</li>
<li> I have had it for less then a year</li>
<li> each time I use it I feel less pain.  </li>
<li> You literally just turn it on and run it along your skin in a circular motion and allow the little tweezers to pluck your hair from the root.  </li>
<li> I have had a few epilators before but this one is aweful.</li>
<li> so my first experience wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
<li> It took me some getting used to as its a bit painful at first, but</li>
<li> I felt a pinch here and there, but seriously, I didn&#x27;t feel the pain described by other women.</li>
<li> I get a rush whenever I pull one of those little buggers out, a sense of accomplishment!</li>
<li> I have put this little mean machine to the test</li>
<li> I bought this because it is less expensive than the other brands.</li>
<li> and after a couple of very painful, eye watering attempts to use one I swore I would never use an epilator for as long as I live but having PCOS and severe hirsutism</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I recently tried this to prevent shaving so often.  Okay...I had to get used to tweezing once upon a time and this is no different.  It does rip the hairs out faster than my single plucking did...however, you do not have to do so as often as shaving and you can use it on any part of your body.  You will need a skin soother to soften irritated skin afterward.  But the results work.  I would have to shave every damn day.  But I epi every week or so.  Big difference.</li>
    <li> I used this epilator for no more than 5 times (worked pretty gr8, needed to be charged once after two uses) but it suddenly stopped working. I thought the battery needs to be charged but even after charging it struggled for about a minute and then gave up..my epilator died..its not just the problem with my epilator - my friend&#x27; epilator died too...even after strictly using it as per the manufactures instructions!!   (we did not buy this product from amazon)</li>
    <li> I specifically wanted something for facial hair and this epilator is \\&quot;not recommended for use on the face.\\&quot;  [[ASIN:B002OE5WYO Remington EP5000SS Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Rechargeable Epilator]] Two other women I know use epilators regularly on their faces.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not a perfect product, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do more or less.  it&#x27;s definately not for use on the face (too big) and it would take forever to do your whole leg (too small).  if you&#x27;re looking to do your face pick a smaller product designed for use on the face, and if you&#x27;re looking to do your whole leg pick a larger product with more tweezers.  however, this is great (and at a reasonable price) for doing touch-ups in between leg waxing!</li>
    <li> If I could give it one star, I would. I purchased this at target because it was the cheapest. After months of use, I realized that it cut my hair rather than pulling it leaving me with ingrown hair. Now, I have to look for another one.</li>
    <li> Pretty simple as that. I have used a different model of Remington for years and am now using this model. Both are great. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator at Target hoping to ease the almost constant shaving and or waxing issue.  The hair on my legs was so thick, black and course, the only way for me to get it to soften up and grow more slowly was to wax.  But waxing is to expensive and time consuming.  So I decided to try this remington epilator out.  I think its great. It took me some getting used to as its a bit painful at first, but so so so worth it!  I have had it for less then a year and I barely have any hair left of my legs. Now I only use it once a week.  I have read some of the other reviews about this product and I really don&#x27;t get it.  It doesn&#x27;t take me 45 min. to do one leg.  Its more like 8 to 10 per leg.  I can&#x27;t stress enough how much more sparse the hair on my legs is.  Not only that,  but its MUCH more soft and each time I use it I feel less pain.  Now it just feels good to get rid of the hair and to know that some day I will be hairless from this little contraption.  I wish I would have bought it years ago!! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was inexpensive and I&#x27;m looking for an alternative to shaving.  All in all it&#x27;s a pretty nice little model, but it takes a Looooooong time to do my legs (somewhere around 45 minutes a leg)  I&#x27;m looking for a model with more tweezing units, but would recommend this one to someone who is looking for an inexpensive introduction to epilating!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is less expensive than the other brands. However, it is not so effective and leaves about 20% of the amount of hair. Now I am on the lookout for a better brand. Thus, I did not save any money.</li>
    <li> I have hair on my chinny chin chin. It&#x27;s been a dirty little secret of mine since I hit puberty. I&#x27;ve tried waxing but it pulled off my skin and left the hair. Laser treatments are too expensive and didn&#x27;t work. Shaving causes ingrown hairs and I get a 5&#x27;clock shadow, can you believe it?  Over the years I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to plucking my hairs, either by tweezer or by hand. It&#x27;s become a nervous habit now and I&#x27;ll catch myself feeling for hairs and pulling them out with my fingernails, and it&#x27;s awful I know! But it doesn&#x27;t hurt, it actually feels good to me. I get a rush whenever I pull one of those little buggers out, a sense of accomplishment! You&#x27;ll understand if you do this too!  Earlier this year I began using Vaniqua, or the generic version Eflorinthine Cream. It&#x27;s a hair growth inhibitor that I find makes my chin hair finer and sparser. It doesn&#x27;t stop hair growth altogether, but it&#x27;s a great, low-maintenance, low-impact solution. But it is a twice-daily topical cream and it works best after hair removal.   In comes the epilator! Crazy enough, for someone who struggles with embarrassing hair, I had heard of them but never tried one before. I started reading reviews on Amazon and totally got freaked out by all of the horrible reviews of the pain they cause! I thought nothing could be worse than waxing. Plus I have a high tolerance for pain and I&#x27;m so used to plucking now, would it hurt me THAT much?  I looked for a cheap one I could cut my teeth on...or trim my hairs with...LOL I came across the [[ASIN:B00188A3BO Remington EP-5000 Essentials Epilator]]. The first thing that caught my eye was the color, purple is my FAVORITE! And it&#x27;s a glittery, aubergine purple, my specific favorite! The reviews were favorable so I bought it here from Amazon.  I received it in the mail a couple of days ago. Packaged safely and nicely. It comes with a separate shaving head attachment, which is convenient. And two protective caps, one for the epilator head, one for the shaving head, a cleaning brush, a power cord and instructions.  The first thing I did was look up YouTube videos of how to use this thing. I&#x27;m a visual person so I prefer to watch someone else than read the instructions. Luckily there were a couple of reviews of the Remington EP5000SS on there and they helped me out a lot. You literally just turn it on and run it along your skin in a circular motion and allow the little tweezers to pluck your hair from the root.  I had charged it 24 hours (only asks for 16 hours initially) and I finally got up the nerve last night to use it while watching TV. My chin hairs had been growing uncontrollably for a couple of weeks, so they were at a good length to try it. I turned it on and it was kind of loud, but no louder than my boyfriends hair trimmer he uses every week. I held my skin taut and started in an area with no hair (my cheek) and started working my way down in a circular motion. You can hear the hairs getting plucked before you even feel it. That&#x27;s the sound of success to me! And \\&quot;laaaaaaaaa\\&quot;! No pain! I felt a pinch here and there, but seriously, I didn&#x27;t feel the pain described by other women. It felt good to me and my skin is so soft and it wasn&#x27;t red like it usually gets when I pluck. And it allowed me to get those hard to reach hairs at the crease of my chin and neck, awesome!!! But I haven&#x27;t tried it on my legs or bikini area, so I could have to eat my words about the lack of pain. But overall, I am VERY pleased with this product would suggest it to anyone who wants to give epilating a try for the first time. You can do it!!!</li>
    <li> This came with the epilator head and a regular shaving head and neither one work well at all. Completely unsatisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice basic epilator. I have never used one before and I agree with others that this was a good place to start. It is a little intimidating at first but even on the one or two occasions it grabbed my skin it did not hurt at all. I found it too painful to use for underarms but it is great for legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product has several features that I like. You can take apart the entire top to clean it and it is easy to put back together. It is rechargeable so no changing batteries and it can be used while plugged in. I have not used the shaving attachment but I suppose it&#x27;s a nice extra.</li>
    <li> i regret buying this...  i&#x27;ve missed the return window &amp; i&#x27;m really upset.  i&#x27;ve only used this two times, and it&#x27;s already a disappointment.  i have to run it several times to get one spot.   it will take me more than 5 minutes to get just one strip.  sometimes, it tugs at my skin and it gets stuck and stops working.  &amp; it&#x27;s not like i&#x27;m saggy either... i&#x27;m pretty young in my early 20s.  anyway, i would recommend buying one of the more expensive epilators.  this one just is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Braun epilators before but when I moved to the States I couldn&#x27;t find one in the first supermarket, so went for this one instead. It was the worst idea. The first time I used it on my underarms, the skin got caught in. It is a design flaw, this never happened to me before, and I am careful and know I have to hold my skin taut. Due to the same design flaw, a lot of hair gets caught in the same space after use, and it becomes impossible to clean. I also feel like it rips hair much more than my other epilator used to.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is ok. Got it for my stay in the US for only a couple of months (my European one doesn&#x27;t work here due to electricity) and didn&#x27;t want to spend much money. But I&#x27;m already looking forward to using my other one again.&lt;br /&gt;Good: Doesn&#x27;t really hurt. Bad: That&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t pull out a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, you need a lot of patience and the result is ...well, ok. Because it takes so long, the battery lasts only for one leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want a good epilator you will definitely need to invest more money, but it will be worth it. To try it out/ if you&#x27;re afraid of the pain or do not want to spend a lot of money, this one could be the right one for you!</li>
    <li> I remember the coiled spring epilators of the 80&#x27;s and after a couple of very painful, eye watering attempts to use one I swore I would never use an epilator for as long as I live but having PCOS and severe hirsutism I had to find an alternative to shaving.   I have highly sensitive skin and very coarse, thick hair so waxing rips my skin and leaves the hair, depilatory creams blister and scar and leave the hair, shaving lasts only a few hours and causes ingrown hairs that become infected, very painful and for me have taken months to heal and it also leaves my skin feeling like it has been removed with sand paper and forget laser hair removal it is way too expensive for my budget and I&#x27;m afraid of scarring so, I went on a hair removal search and came across the new and improved epilators.   After reading up quite extensively on the new style epilators and one especially helpful review of the Remington Smooth&amp;Silky I decided to purchase one. I am over-joyed to own this epilator!  I have put this little mean machine to the test and I have to say it was not the excruciatingly painful experience I had as a teen.  The first time using the epilator took some time to achieve desired results but I am so glad for taking the time to do it right instead of being an impatient twit like so many people are these days and then complaining that the product didn&#x27;t perform to expected standards. FOLLOW DIRECTIONS and you will get the results you want! I have used my Remington Smooth&amp;Silky on my underarms, arms, full legs, abdomen, bikini area and a few other places I have unwanted hair growth with perfect results!! And to be fair it does smart at first but once you get used to the sensation you can use your Remington Smooth&amp;Silky almost anywhere on your body, the only area that it does not seem to do a good job is on the face but this product is not recommended for use on the face anyway and I knew that before I purchased it.  I like that you can use it cordless or plugged in and it comes with a shaving head (which my hubby uses lol). The heads are also fully removable making it easy to clean. I really cannot comment on it&#x27;s longevity since I have had mine only 2 weeks but I can tell you that I used it several times for extended periods for hair removal all over my body and it never hesitated in getting the job done with amazing results.    I would definitely recommend this product to a friend and I am so happy to have the hairless, smooth skin I have desired since my teens. Thank you Remington!</li>
    <li> This epilator is the worse epilator I have ever tried. I have had a few epilators before but this one is aweful. It doens&#x27;t take any hair out.. Don&#x27;t buy it..</li>
    <li> this doesnt seem to work as well as the bruan models, but still gets the job done eventually.</li>
    <li> Having had the originals, which were great, I&#x27;ve tried many since then and this is the only one worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this last year for 18 dollars and worked great, now i want another one for my sister and is double priced! i want the same price!</li>
    <li> This was the first epilator I purchased and was a little nervous about using an epilator, which is why I decided to go with the Remington EP5000SS since it was one of the most inexpensive out of all models out there. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain so my first experience wasn&#x27;t that bad, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the epilator pinching my skin as others have pointed out. The one thing that I agree with other reviewers is that you do have to go  over the same area twice, which makes it longer to finish the job. The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that the charge does not last very long and you quickly notice the change in speed as the charge runs out, so keep it plugged in for best resukts. Over all, I think this epilator is a good starter.</li>
