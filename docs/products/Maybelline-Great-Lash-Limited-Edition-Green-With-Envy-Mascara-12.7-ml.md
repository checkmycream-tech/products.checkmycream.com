      <li>Beautiful great green!!</li>
      <li>It enhances my greenish eyes, applies easily and stays put.  </li>
      <li>it was delivered fast, and the prodct is very lovely</li>
      <li>Its suttle,so if your looking for a more bold color this isnt the one.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>Goes on really nicely, smooth, no clumps.</li>
      <li>Love this product, fun color</li>
      <li>Even then, the color is still rich.</li>
      <li>It really shows up better then the others and lasts longer on the lashes then the others.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even know that mascara came in so many colors until my daughter mentioned she could no longer find her favorite BLUE mascara.</li>
      <li>i was looking for dark green mascara and this one is beautiful with a great application.</li>
      <li>It worked great with my eye color green</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great accent for anyone with green eyes.</li>
      <li>I found I need to apply quite a few coats to really get the color, but it&#x27;s beautiful nonetheless.</li>
      <li>I like regular Great Lash, but this is not the same formula.</li>
      <li>All pretty.</li>
      <li>light and surprisingly natural looking</li>
      <li>I mainly wear these colors on the outside corner of my top lashes, and if on the entire lashes I apply it veeerry lightly.</li>
      <li>They were much cheaper here than what I remember at CVS.</li>
      <li>order came fast .</li>
      <li>but it make&#x27;s your lashes a little light eventhough the green is nice</li>
      <li>They are great when we wear green eyeshadow, it compliments the green on our eyelids.</li>
      <li>This woman of a certain age is happy with this product and, it doesn&#x27;t make me look silly !</li>
      <li>a woman of a Certain Age, I find this much easier to apply than a eyeliner - which never really worked for me.</li>
      <li>You need multiple coats, which turns clownish fast.</li>
      <li>Classy.</li>
      <li>gives my greenis a nick classy look.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not that bold, and it&#x27;s not needed for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>But green is my second favorite to black.</li>
      <li>Initially I saw these different colored mascaras selling at CVS Store last year near the Halloween time or at the end of fall</li>
      <li>I layer over black mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t lend as much color as I&#x27;d like.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s unfortunate they only sell it in stores on special occasions</li>
<li> I really don&#x27;t remember, but waited too late to purchase them.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t be reviewing 6 times for six different colors of this Maybelline mascara after this review, I&#x27;ll just give the other five, 5</li>
<li> Really like it&#x27;s subtle teal effect.</li>
<li> A touch on the dry side.&lt;br</li>
<li> very dry, seemed to be old past expiration date.</li>
<li> they have GREEN and purple and blue mascaras.</li>
<li> I actually had on green mascara</li>
<li> Especially if you use it together with a green eye pensil.</li>
<li> I bought all six colors (green, teal, purple, pink, royal blue, and berry).</li>
<li> I usually use the Royal blue .</li>
<li> my eyelashes never really looked green... not worthy of repurchase for the  results I am in search of.</li>
<li> I tell you when the sun hits my eyes, that green mascara is there and it looks as if I have on both an eyeliner and a mascara.</li>
<li> I have green eyes.</li>
<li> Not nice like the pink</li>
<li> have purchased additional Green mascaras for me.</li>
<li> but I was going for a REALLY green effect and even with DOZENS of applications..</li>
<li> My eyes are green so this color works well..</li>
<li> the color is fantastic.it makes my hazel eyes look green.</li>
<li> I am use to wearing very black</li>
<li> Very dull green.</li>
<li> This is not nearly as good as what we had in the &#x27;70&#x27;s.</li>
<li> The mascara is thin and does not add volume or length to lashes.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my daughter. We both love them. They are great when we wear green eyeshadow, it compliments the green on our eyelids. Plus I&#x27;ve had people notice my eye lashes and asked it I actually had on green mascara and I&#x27;ve said yes and told them where to get it. I&#x27;ve found people like color&#x27;d colored mascara a lot. As I have 5 different colors and go about with them on all the time. People notice it often and ask me about it. But green is my second favorite to black. It really shows up better then the others and lasts longer on the lashes then the others. Its a great mascara.</li>
    <li> the mascara goes on great but it make&#x27;s your lashes a little light eventhough the green is nice I am use to wearing very black</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad these are still available somewhere!</li>
    <li> I ordered mascara, not eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even know that mascara came in so many colors until my daughter mentioned she could no longer find her favorite BLUE mascara. AMAZON, here I come ---&amp;#62;  they have GREEN and purple and blue mascaras. GREAT !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman of a Certain Age, I find this much easier to apply than a eyeliner - which never really worked for me. I tell you when the sun hits my eyes, that green mascara is there and it looks as if I have on both an eyeliner and a mascara. Seems to give me just a bit of an updated look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased additional Green mascaras for me. I don&#x27;t know if my daughter has tried hers. Will update when she shares. This woman of a certain age is happy with this product and, it doesn&#x27;t make me look silly !</li>
    <li> This product is good, but doesn&#x27;t make me look like a 90&#x27;s swamp monster like I hoped. It&#x27;s green, but not green ENOUGH. Also, thanks for the great price!</li>
    <li> Very dull green. Not nice like the pink</li>
    <li> Love the color - just what I was hoping for! It&#x27;s a great accent for anyone with green eyes. Classy.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this color as well!</li>
    <li> My eyes are green so this color works well..</li>
    <li> Really like it&#x27;s subtle teal effect. Goes on really nicely, smooth, no clumps. Not too obvious, but there when you look.</li>
    <li> Love this product, fun color</li>
    <li> It enhances my greenish eyes, applies easily and stays put.  What more could I want?</li>
    <li> i was looking for dark green mascara and this one is beautiful with a great application.</li>
    <li> It worked great with my eye color green</li>
    <li> Six different colored mascaras. All pretty. Nice colors. I like. Initially I saw these different colored mascaras selling at CVS Store last year near the Halloween time or at the end of fall I really don&#x27;t remember, but waited too late to purchase them. So as always I checked my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; Amazon, and tadaaah! Here they are! They were much cheaper here than what I remember at CVS. I bought all six colors (green, teal, purple, pink, royal blue, and berry). I mainly wear these colors on the outside corner of my top lashes, and if on the entire lashes I apply it veeerry lightly. Even then, the color is still rich. I&#x27;m not that bold, and it&#x27;s not needed for everyday wear. That would be a different job. I won&#x27;t be reviewing 6 times for six different colors of this Maybelline mascara after this review, I&#x27;ll just give the other five, 5*****.</li>
    <li> the color is fantastic.it makes my hazel eyes look green. also i received it in great time.i would buy from this company again and again</li>
    <li> Beautiful great green!! Wonderful effect!! Especially if you use it together with a green eye pensil. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> light and surprisingly natural looking</li>
    <li> Prompt service from seller; 5 stars for timely shipping. The mascara is thin and does not add volume or length to lashes. I like regular Great Lash, but this is not the same formula. It runs very easily. You need multiple coats, which turns clownish fast. I layer over black mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t lend as much color as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> I have green eyes. I usually use the Royal blue . I saw this and thought well lets see.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. Its suttle,so if your looking for a more bold color this isnt the one.&lt;br /&gt;It gives my greenis a nick classy look. Its also not a mascara for length. I have nice lashes so it works good for me. A touch on the dry side.&lt;br /&gt;My order came fast . I liked that to</li>
    <li> Simply beautiful on my lashes</li>
    <li> Some of my favorite mascara! It&#x27;s unfortunate they only sell it in stores on special occasions</li>
    <li> it was delivered fast, and the prodct is very lovely, it looks great in myhazel eyes¡¡  i will order another 3 in case it gets descontinued lol.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed. This is not nearly as good as what we had in the &#x27;70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Caused eyes to itch and water, and turn red. very dry, seemed to be old past expiration date.</li>
    <li> apllies nicely like all maybelline products..but I was going for a REALLY green effect and even with DOZENS of applications..my eyelashes never really looked green... not worthy of repurchase for the  results I am in search of.</li>
    <li> I found I need to apply quite a few coats to really get the color, but it&#x27;s beautiful nonetheless.</li>
