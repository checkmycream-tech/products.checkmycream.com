    <li> This was my first time using this product. I was skeptical at first, but after reading all the reviews I decided to try it. I was not disappointed. after the third or fourth wash I already felt a huge difference in the texture of my hair. I have used very high-end products including Redken  Paul Mitchell and Purology and this has exceeded those products by far. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;m very happy w/ my purchase and price. Quick delivery. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner did wonders for my hair after I colored it. I have 4a hair and it was fried after the dying process. I tried to stop it from breaking off and this worked in conjunction with the caterpillar deep conditioner. I didn&#x27;t really care for the shampoo though.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s hair looks great.  Excellent product. Noticeably thicker.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I love this product</li>
    <li> Salerm shampoo and conditioner have been the best hair care system yet. I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos expensive and inexpensive ones. My hair looks silky manageable and has helped with taming my frizzing hair. I can&#x27;t wait to use it in the summer when my hair becomes so frizzing due to heat and hummidty. I&#x27;m so happy with this product I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends, my sisters and my mother. Try the hair mask treatment it leaves your hair looking healthy shiny and feeling silky. The best shampoo ever I especially love the balsam conditioner. I purchased the bigger bottles its worth it. Try it you will love it as much as I do. Sooo happy I can finally stop shopping for other hair shampoos and conditioners. I am happy with the results and it smells amazing as well. I highly recommend the product. I won&#x27;t be using anything else in the future. This is the BEST!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product and it seems to be working. The smell is a little funny but reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have been using this combo for the past 4 years now and is the best thing it ever happen to my hair. Try and for sure you will not regret it. My long hair is much easier to manage after is been cared by salerm protein shampoo and conditioner in addition I use the  wheat germ conditioning mascara once a week. Just love it!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing combo you can find for your hair!! I use it for years and I always recommend it, no matter what type of hair you have is perfect for everyone!!!!!</li>

    <li> Love it.. and I love how it&#x27;s leave my daughter  curly hair</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Considerable difference in quality and texture of my hair.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that made my hair feel and look silky and shiny when a friend recommended Salerm and Its been 7 years now that I have faithfully used it.  And to top it off the scent is very nice, I have received many compliments. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what to say...I&#x27;ve purchased both the shampoo and conditioner from my hair stylist before. For some reason this product purchased through Amazon leaves my hair DRY and I&#x27;ve also  developed a lot more SPLIT ENDS.  I purchased through Amazon because of the price, seems I&#x27;m going to have to continue purchasing from my hair stylist and pay the price</li>
    <li> Awesome product, leaves hair feel nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed stylist and love the fact that these 2 products work great together on different types of African American hair. The price is amazing.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended that I use these products. I was a bit skeptical to try something new... Well, I am glad I did listen to her. My hair is shiny, has more volume, and smells great. A little goes a long way. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo ! Received it within the time frame .</li>
    <li> I have fine blond hair and love this product. It smells amazing and makes my hair soooo soft. I do not style my hair so not sure if it is too heavy to hold a style or not. I really only bought it for the smell... The fact that my hair is softer is a bonus!</li>
