      <li>Just perfect.  </li>
      <li>Product works great but</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like most tanning lotions - great product at a great price!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite products for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was exceptional and the time it came through after ordering was impressive.</li>
      <li>I use it on my legs and it gives them good even color.</li>
      <li>Love the glow and the scent!  </li>
      <li>I tried to eliminate it by putting on a nice smelling lotion but the smell has taken over the lotion.</li>
      <li>I chose medium skin tones although I&#x27;m on the lighter side, but it turned out to be the right one for me because it looks great.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>This is the greatest daily self tanner.</li>
      <li>I love this self tanning lotion.  </li>
      <li>but I like this more.</li>

      <li>This product will give you a smooth looking tan which gives you control.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Glow Daily Moisturize on top for a nice shimmer.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite summer lotion.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want to lose my tan  after returning from my Florida vacation.</li>
      <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve never purchased any of the expensive ones, but I have tried all the drugstore kinds, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I was a bit hesitant at first considering it does not market itself as a self tanner</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s also nice is that it&#x27;s a moisturizer too, which I&#x27;ve sacrificed using all other self tanners</li>
      <li>I use it every other day now and it maintains nicely.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not too much at all and leaves a nice slight sheen</li>

      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in any New York city Drugstore</li>
      <li>In just a few days or daily use, I had a nice tan.</li>
      <li>but instead a skin tone enhancer, so I thought it would be too light and not worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using sunless tanning lotions since the early 80&#x27;s, so I consider myself somewhat of an expert.</li>
      <li>The color is natural not orange like you get with some tanners.</li>
      <li>It looks so natural, no other product has worked this well.</li>
      <li>I like the 3 pack 8oz size and usually my orders are filled as requested.  </li>

    <li> This is the greatest daily self tanner.</li>
    <li> Saw results over night with one use. Smell is bearable in the beginning but after about a half hour it&#x27;s nauseating. It&#x27;s a lingering awful smell. I tried to eliminate it by putting on a nice smelling lotion but the smell has taken over the lotion. Product works great but stinky smell needs to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now. It works as advertised. I&#x27;m a very pale person and after the first use I could see the difference. Within 3 days I had a base color that completely eliminated my \\&quot;ghostly\\&quot; white appearance. I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to wear shorts or tank tops at the gym. I use it every other day now and it maintains nicely. Watch out when ordering this size though. My only displeasure is with the shipper. I like the 3 pack 8oz size and usually my orders are filled as requested.  Two times now if they don&#x27;t have the 8 oz size they will send little sample size 2 oz tubes.  So my last order instead of getting 2 of the 3 pack 8oz tubes I received 24 - 2oz sample tubes. They&#x27;re very difficult to store and to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using sunless tanning lotions since the early 80&#x27;s, so I consider myself somewhat of an expert. Granted, I&#x27;ve never purchased any of the expensive ones, but I have tried all the drugstore kinds, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. I was a bit hesitant at first considering it does not market itself as a self tanner but instead a skin tone enhancer, so I thought it would be too light and not worth it. But that has turned out to be its best quality because you really can&#x27;t mess up it&#x27;s so gradual, but not so gradual that it takes too long to produce a tan. In just a few days or daily use, I had a nice tan. It looks so natural, no other product has worked this well. What&#x27;s also nice is that it&#x27;s a moisturizer too, which I&#x27;ve sacrificed using all other self tanners and I don&#x27;t like to go without a moisturizer. I chose medium skin tones although I&#x27;m on the lighter side, but it turned out to be the right one for me because it looks great. I especially like the tiny flecks of sparkle that&#x27;s left on your skin, it&#x27;s not too much at all and leaves a nice slight sheen (and I&#x27;m 50 so the sparkles are not at all teeny bopper sparkles). Overall, I don&#x27;t see myself using anything else. I just hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years.  Just like the other reviewer I ordered 3 large tubes of the product and received a dozen little 2 oz tubes.  As he stated, these are hard to store and very inconvenient.  The shipper claims that it states that if they are out of the larger tube they will send the smaller ones.  I re-read the ad and could not find that description.  If they had contacted me and said they were out of the larger tubes, I would have cancelled the order.  They will re-fund if you pay shipping back and then pay a re-stocking fee.  I would not do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was exceptional and the time it came through after ordering was impressive.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite summer lotion.  Love the glow and the scent!  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any New York city Drugstore so feared it had been discontinued.  Thankfully it hasn&#x27;t been.</li>
    <li> I love this self tanning lotion.  Amazon is the only place I can find it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. I usually start with Banana Boat Summer Color self tanner in Dark and then put on L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Glow Daily Moisturize on top for a nice shimmer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 8 years.  I first purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want to lose my tan  after returning from my Florida vacation. My tan lasted almost a month.  After that I was hooked.  I looks like the real deal.  No nasty orange streaks like some of the expensive department store brands. It also gives me a youthful glow; I am 38.  Just perfect.  I love it.  Summer is coming and I gotta &#x27;Glow!&#x27;</li>
    <li> This product will give you a smooth looking tan which gives you control. The only thing I did not like is the smell was a little over powering for me, but I like the product so I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Tooo expensive for what you get! There is no translation to Canadian dollars so this ended up costing almost $30 per tube!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to apply. I use it on my legs and it gives them good even color. I tried the cream for fair skin and it hardly made a difference. I apply this about twice a week.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunless tanner.  I have used Jergens but I like this more. The smell is not as strong as some I have used but it still has a smell. The color is natural not orange like you get with some tanners. I would recommend this tanner.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like most tanning lotions - great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Love the way it moisturizers my skin while gradually adding color.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use; no streaking.  I use it almost daily three fourths of the year in Oregon.</li>
    <li> I use this product every single day when I get out of the shower. I have a lovely, natural looking tan, even though I am hardly ever in the sun :-)</li>
