      <li>Loved them and easy to apply to the nail.</li>

      <li>But they came in a bag and a very cheap bag at that.</li>

      <li>My nails got like 300% more fancy with the addition of these studs.  </li>
      <li>They are so cute for nail art</li>
      <li>so make sure you get the size you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Beware the gold pieces must be top coated when finished to prevent the gold of coming off the stud.</li>
      <li>So many designs can be done if you have the imagination.  </li>
      <li>No complaints for this product except it doesn&#x27;t appear to be 300 pieces, maybe more along the lines of 150</li>
      <li>If you can get them to stay on for more than a couple days</li>
      <li>These are so cute.</li>
      <li>this item i love it.</li>
      <li>300 piece is more like 50 but otherthan</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very excited and can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
      <li>I was very excited when I got these in the mail.</li>
      <li>Some are bent and don&#x27;t lay flat on my nail, but the ones that aren&#x27;t, are perfect!</li>
      <li>I sure they will work just fine.</li>
      <li>and they fall off easy.</li>
      <li>The gems r easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly and just as advertised.</li>
      <li>so it was fine.</li>
      <li>So i got this and was super geeked!</li>
      <li>Overall they are great quality for what I paid for.</li>
      <li>So far so good &amp; they seem to stay in place longer.</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful, truly gold and silver(not yellowish and grey like some others).</li>
      <li>I may not have received a Hello Kitty item as the first reviewer of this item did, but I am still exceedingly PLEASED with this purchase.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I ever glued anything to my nails, so I probably could have done a much better job.</li>
      <li>I bought them originally to do my nails.</li>
      <li>I was originally going to use these for DIY faux plugs</li>
      <li>They may have been better had I touched them up with the clear top coat on day 2, or if I had used super glue-</li>
      <li>Still, I feel additionally hardcore, which is cool.</li>
      <li>They arrived undamaged and quickly.</li>
      <li>To fix that problem I secure them with a dab of nail glue instead of using the clear coat on top.</li>
      <li>I wish I got more gold as they give you mainly silver.</li>
      <li>They look exactly like the pic!</li>
      <li>So far they have proven to remain on the nail for a good amount of time, just by applying a clear coat they stayed in place.</li>
      <li>just what I was looking for to complete all  my nail projects my customers love it</li>
      <li>but it was well worth it.</li>
      <li>Shipment took a while but worth the wait</li>
      <li>I highly doubt there are 300 pieces in this tiny bag, but for the price, its a good amount.</li>
      <li>She is very much into nail designs and being creative with natural nails.</li>
      <li>The studs were definitely worth the price and look exactly as they do in the photo.</li>
      <li>Good price but not worth it.</li>
      <li>I waited for them for so long and honestly dint recieve  </li>
      <li>They even threw in a little hello kitty, which i don&#x27;t like, but hey it was free and a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>It looked very cheap, seemed different than the picture.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought these on a whim just to add to my nail art arsenal. They came in separated in little bags that have the self adhesive fold over top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these to match my nails to my shoes (also bought on a whim) for Halloween. This was the first time I ever glued anything to my nails, so I probably could have done a much better job. They only lasted a couple hours, but I didn&#x27;t seal them with a top coat. I think this would have made a huge difference because the edges stick out a little on the curved nail and catch on things. The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like is that they stick to each other and it was hard to get them apart. I had to dump them all out and pick the ones that weren&#x27;t stuck together so I wouldn&#x27;t ruin my nails trying to get them apart. They&#x27;re really hard to handle because they&#x27;re so small, but that&#x27;s unavoidable.</li>
    <li> Best quality studs for the price. Nail art is already being done!  I would definitely repurchase from this site! Edgy look and quality sold this customer!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to receive the studs. They are beautiful. Overall they are great quality for what I paid for.</li>
    <li> If you can get them to stay on for more than a couple days then they are amazing for nail art.</li>
    <li> I have tons of nail polish and this will be a great addition to my collection💅 I did notice they can be recycled-reuse. Easy to remove nail polish off them!! I just had to find a container to place them in.</li>
    <li> They look so pretty I haven&#x27;t used it yet but they look so cute I&#x27;m going to the nail place this weekend so my nail lady can use them on my nails</li>
    <li> These are great. I&#x27;m very excited and can&#x27;t wait to use them. There&#x27;s a lot of pieces. They can a littler later then I had anticipated but I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry to get them so it was fine. They look exactly like the pic!</li>
    <li> Decent product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are large 3mm metal-colored plastic domes (unlike the smaller looking ones in the picture) but the size is stated so make sure you get the size you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked for the pieces to be separated by color since it&#x27;s time consuming to sort through all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of them had black specks stuck on them but there were enough of the normal looking ones that I didn&#x27;t mind and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> my studs came in sooner than the estimated date (:  was a little worried because it didn&#x27;t really have reviews but the description doesn&#x27;t lie (:  the studs are the perfect color and size!&lt;br /&gt;another good thing is that the colors are separated  silver/gold in small&lt;br /&gt;Ziplock bags&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;loved loved loved!! Stayed perfect on my nails with some nail glue.&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing again [: thank you!</li>
    <li> Love these make good for designing nails. It takes a while for delivery tho only part I hate about it. So I will give it three stars for that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for my product.  Ebay has these sam studs for only a dollar free shipping and for 1000 pieces</li>
    <li> Product came just as described and although I have not used them yet, I sure they will work just fine.</li>
    <li> I highly doubt there are 300 pieces in this tiny bag, but for the price, its a good amount. The pieces are a good size. You should practice a little bit on how to glue them on because they are so small, but after that you should be fine. Very cute,</li>
    <li> I waited for them for so long and honestly dint recieve  300 piece is more like 50 but otherthan that i like them.you get wt you payfor :(</li>
    <li> Great amount of both silver and gold studs.&lt;br /&gt;They are small enough that they don&#x27;t take up&lt;br /&gt;all of your nail space.</li>
    <li> My nails got like 300% more fancy with the addition of these studs.  Since I have short nails and not giant comedy fake nails I can fit about 4 of these from base to tip, so it&#x27;s a little less graceful than some of the product pictures.  Still, I feel additionally hardcore, which is cool.</li>
    <li> I did not get this item delivered. I was so excited to get this item but only got the triangle studs. Good price but not worth it.</li>
    <li> These look exactly like the photo &amp; are the perfect size. I like that the colors were separated. The only problem noticed was that the gold ones turn silver when a top coat is applied. To fix that problem I secure them with a dab of nail glue instead of using the clear coat on top. So far so good &amp; they seem to stay in place longer.</li>
    <li> Got them wayyyyy before the estimated delivery and they are great. I already have them on my nails. There were even a few more in the bag than what it said.</li>
    <li> Product as described,  I  will order again. I&#x27;m very pleaded with product. Can&#x27;t wait to use them on my projects.</li>
    <li> I bought them originally to do my nails. However, in the need of studs, when studs were falling off a pair of my boots, these matched perfectly.</li>
    <li> They arrived undamaged and quickly. But they came in a bag and a very cheap bag at that. Good thing I had something to put them in. Eye balling the bag it don&#x27;t look like 300. Again I was not about to count 300 circle studs lol. The studs look good and useable, for the price would buy them again.</li>
    <li> well i wanted to send these back but i was told i couldnt- theyre still really good though. basically i dont really need them anymore once theyd arrived but still good to have around</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and just as advertised. Very easy to work with, and look great on the nail. These will last a while too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure these are great for somebody, I just don&#x27;t like the look of them very much. The gold coloring comes off with nail polish remover. If you use acrylic nail glue, these stay on for a while. If you like the shape, go for it, but I just don&#x27;t find them very nice-looking on my nails.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for to complete all  my nail projects my customers love it I always use  thank you</li>
    <li> the quality on this are puzzle , they look fake will have to see what they look like on the nail.</li>
    <li> Got to me about a month before the last day of the estimated shipping. The packaging is a bubble envelope and then a little tiny baggie with the silver and the gold mixed together. Only complaint is that the silver and the gold are mixed. Very pleased, otherwise!</li>
    <li> I ordered from cheeky-beauty and the studs came 11 days earlier than the last day they could arrive. I did count them and they gave me 3 extra of the silver and 12 extra of the gold. The studs came in separate baggies and they were placed into one big baggie. I am very satisfied with my purchase, and if i need more studs I would repurchase from this seller.</li>
    <li> These are so cute. The gems r easy to apply. I used as instructed but was somewhat disappointed on day 2 or 3 with fingernails as gems started falling off. These were frustrating when styling hair as they would get caught or snagged. They also get snagged on clothing or other fabrics. I was surprised because they r round &amp; mostly flat, &amp; small enough to flow with the contour of your fingernaills. They may have been better had I touched them up with the clear top coat on day 2, or if I had used super glue- but no thanks. I don&#x27;t have long nails, so if you&#x27;re used to this type of thing then you may have better luck. However, I do think they r great for toenails. They last almost 2 weeks on my toenails!</li>
    <li> I was not  very impressed . It looked very cheap, seemed different than the picture. It was for my girls and they were not impressed.</li>
    <li> The studs were definitely worth the price and look exactly as they do in the photo. They came in sooner than the estimated date but they did take a while to arrive and the silver and gold studs weren&#x27;t even separated. Could have saved me a lot of time but hey, for free shipping and less than a dollar cost I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> i like it but the only thing is that the gold turns silver its not pure gold metal studs but its workable.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I got these in the mail. Unfortunately some did not stay on the nail as long as I thought they would. Maybe I need to start using glue. But I&#x27;ve never had to with any of the other nail art pieces.</li>
    <li> not really satisfied with your purchase the little tarnished in faded not very bright really small to handle not worth my purchase</li>
    <li> these are perfect for nails!  So many designs can be done if you have the imagination.  I will be back for more of these.</li>
    <li> Would&#x27;ve given them zero stars but a rating was needed. DO NOT PURCHASE! I never received what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Arrived a bit early, but they&#x27;re was not 300 pieces. Maybe half of that. I wish I got more gold as they give you mainly silver. Probably won&#x27;t order again but for the price it&#x27;s still good.</li>
    <li> I wish i would have known that before i started putting them on my nails. but still they are nice. although it would be nice if they were flat on the back too.</li>
    <li> These worked out so well. I had some Christmas nails to do, and used these to look like Christmas decorations! Loved them and easy to apply to the nail.</li>
    <li> Some are bent and don&#x27;t lay flat on my nail, but the ones that aren&#x27;t, are perfect!</li>
    <li> I received exactly what was ordered and it came within the timeframe given. I love it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
    <li> I really liked this item the circles were nicely made and I received a great quantity, I wished they had came on the round separators but for the price I can&#x27;t complain (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> These are really nice! The colors are beautiful, truly gold and silver(not yellowish and grey like some others). I have very small nails and this size worked for me. I even got a gift, a set of french manicure stencils.</li>
    <li> Shiny, funky and awesome. Just what I was looking for. Shipping took long, but I wasn&#x27;t in a huge rush to get them. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> These things look so cute in a nail when I saw them but in real life the are annoying! They are hard to make stick to the nail and they fall off easy. I don&#x27;t know it I was doing something wrong but I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on them again.</li>
    <li> They stayed on my nail all week and never came off once. I used the gold an eventually some of the color was rubbed off.</li>
    <li> love these...great accent for nail art.  very edgy...great price, nice variety...love the gold and silver because it goes with anything.  highly recommend these...</li>
    <li> It came with both gold and silver.  They are very tiny and 300 pieces is not alot.  I used these on my nails they worked well with a top coat because they are very thin.  I suggest getting a good pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the pictures show. I was originally going to use these for DIY faux plugs but I decided not to order the polymer clay so I guess I will just wait to use these or I may just try these out on my fake nails :)</li>
    <li> this is what is shown in the picture, i even got them a little early and they are absolutely adorable ! they even come in separate tiny little baggies for the silver and gold. will definitely buy again soon ! :&#x27;)</li>
    <li> Bought these and many other designs for my teenager. She is very much into nail designs and being creative with natural nails. She loves them all.</li>
    <li> I really like this studs they r really pretty. Which can be used in many things not only with nails</li>
    <li> love these studs so cute great deal</li>
    <li> Arrived a few days before estimated delivery. Beware the gold pieces must be top coated when finished to prevent the gold of coming off the stud.</li>
    <li> I would have paid the extra 10 cents to have them use two baggies. It&#x27;s really annoying sorting the two colors apart.</li>
    <li> Bigger than you&#x27;d expect but still usable</li>
    <li> I regretted buying the product.  It&#x27;s just ugly.</li>
    <li> 5 stars because I do love them!!  They are so cute for nail art I use them all the time. And really make the nails look so ccuteeee</li>
    <li> i just received this little metal studs today they are good for whats made for and i will  be trying them on my naills</li>
    <li> I decided to use these as soon as they came in the mail. They are very easy to place on the nails. So far they have proven to remain on the nail for a good amount of time, just by applying a clear coat they stayed in place. I am extremely please with the quality and durability.</li>
    <li> I received the studs earlier than the ship date and they affix on the nails quite well. I would have liked if they came in a carry case, but at the price, these are a steal!</li>
    <li> idk i guess you get what you pay for not sure what i was hoping for, doesnt seem even half of 300 but i didnt count them. def going to stop buying nail art products online, as well as makeup. bad luck in both areas via amazon sellers. lesson learned.</li>
    <li> No complaints for this product except it doesn&#x27;t appear to be 300 pieces, maybe more along the lines of 150 but they work just great!</li>
    <li> I may not have received a Hello Kitty item as the first reviewer of this item did, but I am still exceedingly PLEASED with this purchase. I counted - yes COUNTED - these studs after a previously disappointing \\&quot;300 piece\\&quot; nail square pyramid studs purchase to make sure I wasn&#x27;t being duped. Happily, I counted 300 pieces with many more pieces to spare (151). These round studs are very thin and the backside of all of them, even the gold ones, are silver but it is easy to tell which side is the top since they have a somewhat dome shape and the silver backing is a bit lighter silver than the silver dome tops. Anyways, WONDERFUL purchase from Best Deal Store (USA Seller)!</li>
    <li> Never have enough of nail art this item i love it. The size is wonderful. Shipment took a while but worth the wait</li>
    <li> So i got this and was super geeked! Loved them! Perfect size to fit on a nail. to small for say a cellphone case, i think. It took really long to get here which had me anxious but it was well worth it. They even threw in a little hello kitty, which i don&#x27;t like, but hey it was free and a nice surprise.</li>
