      <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Some spots were smoother than others but my hubby was pleased.</li>
      <li>Used on my armpits did not remove most hair and irritated</li>
      <li>Nothing burned afterwards and it got most of the hair.</li>
      <li>I love love</li>
      <li>I could of just shaved and got a better outcome.</li>
      <li>I now love Veet.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t find the smell overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I tried Veet one day and found it smelled way better than Nair (any variety).</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I ever thought it was a good idea in the first place frankly.</li>
      <li>I leave this on for 7 minutes and it removes all hair and best of all absolutely no bumps!</li>
      <li>I felt a light tingling.</li>
      <li>But hey, my legs were pretty smooth!</li>
      <li>By far this amazing product takes the cake.</li>
      <li>and doesnt take the full 5 mins it states.</li>
      <li>After wiping it off I noticed my arms were feeling kind of sensitive.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true but it did steer me away from this.</li>
      <li>I have tried this cream several times and my cheap disposable razor does a better job!</li>
      <li>this gel makes me feel fresh and clean</li>
      <li>Tried using while in the shower and avoided the water, which worked, but still... the razor is so much more appealing, and the time between shaves is just the same.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product with success after 5 minutes of using.</li>
      <li>I used vaseline to cover the most sensitive areas then applied the cream everywhere</li>
      <li>Then I realised that when I scrubbed my arms with a loofah the rest came right off.</li>
      <li>(pain numbing if you prefer) and then a light, fast absorbing lotion.</li>
      <li>thank you very much</li>
      <li>which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It resembles something similar to a used cat litter box and it&#x27;s a overwhelming smell.</li>
      <li>Works way better than Nair, which I tried earlier.</li>
      <li>When I first put it on my arms</li>
      <li>i just tried it for the first time today on my bikini area</li>
      <li>I left it on for 7 minutes and my legs were fine</li>
      <li>It help me i really  like it...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get all the hair off and my legs still felt really stubbly after use.</li>
      <li>hahahaha</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>Much better than I expected</li>
      <li>It really work on removing my underarm hair</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
      <li>Seems to work better and smell less.  </li>
      <li>It did not irritate my skin, it actually left it feeling soft and really smooth.</li>
      <li>Has a strong smell but thats to be expected.</li>
      <li>Smells highly chemical.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s say I will never go back to anything else right now.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin that breaks out in rashes over nothing</li>
      <li>Also I haven&#x27;t noticed this, but I&#x27;ve been looking online to see if their was a way to use this longer safer to see if it would give better results, and the only things I found were complaints about this product starting the wrinkling process faster for users of this product for multiple years</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>It immediately stopped feeling sensitive, I had no breakout like I normally do, and my arm hair was thinned out and natural looking</li>
      <li>I do recommend after care, if you have sensitive skin, with Neosporin</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, even razors hurt me a lot.</li>
      <li>I found it to have very little fumes and it actually got rid of more hair than Nair does.</li>
      <li>This smells like pure a$$ and eggs, and no matter how long I keep it on</li>
      <li>I give it 3 stars because the first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough so it didn&#x27;t take out a lot of the hair.</li>
      <li>I plan on doing it again today to see if I can get it even smoother now that there&#x27;s barely any hair there.</li>
      <li>Too messy to bother with since you have to wait around before removing the cream (that has a distinct chemical smell...).</li>
      <li>First off, I&#x27;m a 19 year old female, with really pale skin and blond hair.</li>

<li> First off, I&#x27;m a 19 year old female, with really pale skin and blond hair.</li>
<li> This is going to sound dramatic, but this stuff is life changing.</li>
<li> I used Gigi post epilating lotion after my skin was dry so as to avoid any possible irritation afterward.</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs it gets maybe half do not waste your money</li>
<li> If you leave it on too long it may burn.</li>
<li> I have burned myself before by accidentally leaving it on too long, but as long as you are cautious it shouldn&#x27;t cause any problems.</li>
<li> It also really means lay it on thick.</li>
<li> I had tried other chemical hair removal products before and they would break me out and not actually remove any hair.</li>
<li> It really does mean 5 minutes!</li>
<li> Whilst this cream does remove your hair really fast unfortunately it results ingrown hair for some reason and hair grows back thicker and coarser.</li>
<li> The smell is as expected with depilating creams, but</li>
<li> You end up with quite a few patches of hair left over.</li>
<li> This particular formula is soothing and non irritating, however, I expected a gel form.</li>
<li> I had always used Nair when i wanted to use something other than razors to remove my leg hair.</li>
<li> I have tried other creams, waxing, and Nair.</li>
<li> Not worth the money</li>
<li> I would recommend just shaving and using gel if you want to shave down there</li>
<li> New razors, soaking skin before shaving, expensive shaving gels, neosporin, and even stuff for diaper rash.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few years now</li>
<li> (just a few hairs here and there).</li>
<li> First off let me say that this stuff smells bad.</li>
<li> It removed some hair but hardly any, and I tried it a few times.</li>

    <li> work but will grow within two weeks</li>
    <li> i just tried it for the first time today on my bikini area and i usually dont write reveiws for anything but i just had to for this product it is fricking amazing but if you have thicker hair keep it on for about 9 minutes instead of 5</li>
    <li> I have tried this cream several times and my cheap disposable razor does a better job!</li>
    <li> Somewhat gets all the hair.</li>
    <li> Not only did it not work at all, it smelled terrible!</li>
    <li> Works way better than Nair, which I tried earlier. Not itchy and removes all the hair within specified time. I still feel the odor which is not Soo pleasant.</li>
    <li> Used on my armpits did not remove most hair and irritated my skin would not buy again</li>
    <li> I liked using the product a lot. Let&#x27;s say I will never go back to anything else right now.</li>
    <li> This smells like pure a$$ and eggs, and no matter how long I keep it on it doesn&#x27;t work for me. En</li>
    <li> I liked this product better than Nair.  Seems to work better and smell less.  I gave it 4 stars because it still smells bad.</li>
    <li> It smells awful. I give it 3 stars because the first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough so it didn&#x27;t take out a lot of the hair. I tried it again for the 5+ minutes and then removed. The hair came off but it was no different than when I shaved.</li>
    <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member. I would not recommend this product if I did not like it. It works great. It did not irritate my skin, it actually left it feeling soft and really smooth. It works really quickly and smells really great.</li>
    <li> Used to be stronger not anymore</li>
    <li> I love love this gel makes me feel fresh and clean</li>
    <li> Came in faster than it said it was supposed to! excellent. Haven&#x27;t quite used it yet but i heard it works well.</li>
    <li> This is going to sound dramatic, but this stuff is life changing. I&#x27;ve been using it a few years now and I LOVE it. I have always struggled with shaving bumps. No matter what I did, I would always get them especially on my bikini line. I tried all the tricks in the book. New razors, soaking skin before shaving, expensive shaving gels, neosporin, and even stuff for diaper rash. Nothing would stop those bumps. I had tried other chemical hair removal products before and they would break me out and not actually remove any hair. I bought this product on a whim not expecting it to work. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I leave this on for 7 minutes and it removes all hair and best of all absolutely no bumps! I have burned myself before by accidentally leaving it on too long, but as long as you are cautious it shouldn&#x27;t cause any problems. I have very sensitive skin that breaks out in rashes over nothing and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it. I also don&#x27;t find the smell overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Works well, and good price!</li>
    <li> I love this. It doesnt need an applicator which is great. and doesnt take the full 5 mins it states. Actually it started to tingle a bit around 4 mins. Has a strong smell but thats to be expected.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Too messy to bother with since you have to wait around before removing the cream (that has a distinct chemical smell...). Tried using while in the shower and avoided the water, which worked, but still... the razor is so much more appealing, and the time between shaves is just the same.</li>
    <li> Works great!!! Much better than I expected</li>
    <li> Best Ever!  I have sensitive skin, even razors hurt me a lot. I have tried other creams, waxing, and Nair. By far this amazing product takes the cake. The smell is as expected with depilating creams, but WOW! It didn&#x27;t even sting, did not make skin red, and did not burn or welt my skin. Why ever shave again? I had to use it for 6 minutes! But seriously that is nothing. No pain ! I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Veet! It is so cheep, and does not cause those annoying little grow back pumps in the bikini area!</li>
    <li> It help me i really  like it...i  didn&#x27;t get a skin  reaction  read  direction  before  using</li>
    <li> 5 start for effectiveness, -1 star for pain level. It really does mean 5 minutes! It also really means lay it on thick. And if you don&#x27;t get it thick enough and some stays behind, DO NOT APPLY AGAIN! It will burn like really bad sunburn! If you missed some, wait a day before putting it on again. Remember, this stuff is basically weed-killer for your hair.</li>
    <li> It works great takes every bit of hair off and leaves your skin nice &amp; smooth I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this. It removed some hair but hardly any, and I tried it a few times. It also left terrible red burns. Not worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Nair to remove hair and never chose to use Veet. This particular formula is soothing and non irritating, however, I expected a gel form. It&#x27;s a cream based application. Not fully unsatisfied, but disappointed in the false headline. But overall the product works well and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I actually used this to take off every bit of hair around my lady parts. I used vaseline to cover the most sensitive areas then applied the cream everywhere I had hair. I left it on for the 6 minutes then hopped into the shower and used a wash cloth to wipe it all off. It wasn&#x27;t too bad. Nothing burned afterwards and it got most of the hair. Some spots were smoother than others but my hubby was pleased. It has been four days and I don&#x27;t have any ingrown hairs. I exfoliate with my shower scrubby glove daily. I plan on doing it again today to see if I can get it even smoother now that there&#x27;s barely any hair there.</li>
    <li> Whilst this cream does remove your hair really fast unfortunately it results ingrown hair for some reason and hair grows back thicker and coarser. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I first put it on my arms I felt a light tingling. After wiping it off I noticed my arms were feeling kind of sensitive. I also noticed that there were clumps of hair still attached. I originally hated it. Then I realised that when I scrubbed my arms with a loofah the rest came right off. I do recommend after care, if you have sensitive skin, with Neosporin (pain numbing if you prefer) and then a light, fast absorbing lotion. It immediately stopped feeling sensitive, I had no breakout like I normally do, and my arm hair was thinned out and natural looking which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s feedback: It doesn&#x27;t come with a scraper.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even use it. I took one smell and knew there was no way I was putting something that smelled like that on my body. Smells highly chemical. I don&#x27;t know why I ever thought it was a good idea in the first place frankly. I&#x27;ll stick to my beautiful hairy legs thank you very much</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this. First off, I&#x27;m a 19 year old female, with really pale skin and blond hair. It doesn&#x27;t get all the hair off and my legs still felt really stubbly after use. Also with the time took to do this I could of just shaved and got a better outcome. And this bottle maybe gave me 3 uses on just my legs alone, and the hair doesn&#x27;t even come all the way off and the hair that does leave comes back the next day or 2. It would just be cheaper to shave. Also I haven&#x27;t noticed this, but I&#x27;ve been looking online to see if their was a way to use this longer safer to see if it would give better results, and the only things I found were complaints about this product starting the wrinkling process faster for users of this product for multiple years, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true but it did steer me away from this.</li>
    <li> I am a man and I have been using it for years for my chest and underarms, works perfect everytime. No itchy hard hair caused by shaving.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to get it for a year and now I can hardly wait to get rid of all of the body hair.  I&#x27;ve used this in the States and found it to be a great product.</li>
    <li> Works too good. If you leave it on too long it may burn. Follow the directions and you should be good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product with success after 5 minutes of using.</li>
    <li> Stinky stinky stinky bleh I want to puke there is no smell worse than this and bad part it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs it gets maybe half do not waste your money I would recommend just shaving and using gel if you want to shave down there and you get bumps use deodorant it helps just like under your arms! But I&#x27;m serious I would not buy this. To get rid of the smell I have to use my toothpaste its sad haha and now I have a headache from the smell</li>
    <li> I had always used Nair when i wanted to use something other than razors to remove my leg hair. I tried Veet one day and found it smelled way better than Nair (any variety). I found it to have very little fumes and it actually got rid of more hair than Nair does. I left it on for 7 minutes and my legs were fine (just a few hairs here and there). Veet is also way less irritating to any ingrown hairs or scrapes i may have on my legs (Nair would always sting and irritate broken skin). I didn&#x27;t test my legs as instructed by the package but im not that patient. I now love Veet. I use gloves for application so as to not damage the skin on my hands or fingernails. I also use a washcloth in the shower to rub off the cream. I used Gigi post epilating lotion after my skin was dry so as to avoid any possible irritation afterward.</li>
    <li> Excellent and fast-acting product!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work very well for me. I still had hairs left after using it for the recommended period of time. Disappointing. But hey, my legs were pretty smooth!</li>
    <li> Very good my girl like this</li>
    <li> First off let me say that this stuff smells bad. It resembles something similar to a used cat litter box and it&#x27;s a overwhelming smell. Secondly after the ten minutes of this smell you can finally remove it and not all of the hair is removed. You end up with quite a few patches of hair left over.</li>
    <li> It really work on removing my underarm hair hahahaha i love it. Hope it wont turn my underRm into darker skin.</li>
</ol>
