      <li>but that is because I didn&#x27;t have to do my daughters natural hair in over 6 years,  when she was 7.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s  relaxed and this product allows me to go natural without drying out, tangling.</li>
      <li>This product works wonders on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t have the soft, sproingy curls I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>but right now it doesn&#x27;t seem to make it soft and curly but rather just like I have another product in my hair that makes it a little heavier or crunchier.</li>
      <li>I have tried different product lines and my natural hair seems to go gaga over Mizani.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great to loosen my curls and cut down on frizz. Pleasant fragrance-not parfumy.</li>
    <li> Will not buy again!  Did not like feel of my hair after using</li>
    <li> I have 4C hair and it requires moisturization. The good thing about this product that it is light weight and not heavy. In addition, the fragrance is very light and not overwhelming. Unfortunately, it did very little to moisturize my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost as though my hair thirsts for this leave-in creme. I have tried different product lines and my natural hair seems to go gaga over Mizani. Nothing else leaves my hair feeling soft and well-fed. It&#x27;s purely personal preference but my preferred way to use this product is to apply it to still-wet, just-washed hair. I then braid my hair and leave it air-dry overnight.</li>
    <li> I love Mizani, this product its good enough for my girls , hair become soft and the smell is great. I would recommended for curly hair it works Thanks</li>
    <li> Best hair product for my frizzy, wavy, thick, huge hair!  It keeps my natural curls without feeling like a product is on my hair.  The price is amazing considering it is $19 at ulta!</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of products in this line, this and the h2o intense are the most useful.  I use them in my daughter&#x27;s 4C hair. She likes to wear twist out. I didn&#x27;t like the way the back of her has always looked frizzy.  Against my better judgment,  I reverted back to what I knew and used brown gel in the back. Her hair held its shape,  but it looked dirty by the end of the day.  We came to the conclusion that the back of her hair would always look frizzy and never curly and that that was ok.  That night I decided to use this product instead of the Mizani curl set, that is also from this line and we were surprised by how curly her hair was in the morning. There are some flakes in the morning,  but we use oil to get rid of them.  At this stage I am a product junkie,  but that is because I didn&#x27;t have to do my daughters natural hair in over 6 years,  when she was 7. I hope to find the right products and stick with those.  This will definitely be a staple in her haircare regimen.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have been searching for something that work control the frizz for my daughter and this is it!</li>
    <li> I always give new hair and skin products a couple of weeks at least to see any effect.  It smells nice but right now it doesn&#x27;t seem to make it soft and curly but rather just like I have another product in my hair that makes it a little heavier or crunchier. it may also be the effect of the water on my hair working against the product but I don&#x27;t have the soft, sproingy curls I was hoping for. my hair is average black woman&#x27;s corkscrew curls, medium thick. works well on my son&#x27;s hair though</li>
    <li> No freezing,  curles look great, no dryiness.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the product when a friend had it used on her at Hair Cuttery.  Her hair was soft, non -greasy , curly and  groomed.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and got similar results.</li>
    <li> Product was well wrapped and arrived on time. I used it and have been very satisfied with the texture of my hair following use.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday. I love the way my hair feels and looks when using this product. Definitely a must have!!!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on my natural hair. It has definitely been a journey looking for a moisturizer that puts and keeps moisture in my hair all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a journey with my hair. Trying many products to get to a combination that suits my hair. This is one product that I keep buying over and over. It seems to work with my type of hair and my hair is definitely benefitting from using this. I love it.</li>
    <li> It works well if you use the shampoo and the conditioner before using his product. I thought it did a good job and would buy again</li>
    <li> This product is the best curl definition Ever!</li>
    <li> Love it, it leaves my hair soft and curly.  It dries quickly with no residue.  I highly recommend it for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I finally found something that makes my curls super soft.  I love the fact that I can wash and go.  No extra conditioning.  Love it.  My hair is coarse, so I need to get products that won&#x27;t make my hair dry.  This product leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I like this product; it leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  The squeeze tube makes it easy to use and mess free.</li>
    <li> Make my hair soft and a little goes a long way. Plus it smells very good. But try and get it when it is on sale.</li>
    <li> I have thick kinky sometimes coarse hair. This works well to soften texture and keep moisterized, its light and smells really good. It can go on top of a light leave in conditioner. Section hair and add small dime size amount to each section. Too much and it might flake (but very little) even though it says no flaking on the tube.  Might have to spritz with water the next day and reapply a little to palms and work in the hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  works very well on dry dry hair. My hair is not naturally curly  it&#x27;s  relaxed and this product allows me to go natural without drying out, tangling. It works very well with mizani stretch which leaves your hair soft shinny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> This product works very well when I want to wear my hair curly after washing. It leaved it conditioned.</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best hair cream I have come across. I have wavy hair that tends to be dry and often frizzy. This cream helps to keep my hair moisturized and lasts all day :)</li>
    <li> I have been wearing my hair in it&#x27;s natural state for the last two years now and I must say this is the best leave-in conditioner that I have come across thus far. I used it for the first time yesterday and as began to put the product in my hair immediately my hair started to soften. I let my hair air dry overnight and this is the softest my hair has been after a wash. I am waiting on Mizani to produce a salon size of this product. It works really well on my hair type (3c, 4a range).</li>
