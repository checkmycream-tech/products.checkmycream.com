    <li> Our old scissors were getting dull and wouldn&#x27;t sharpen very well so I ordered these after reading the nice reviews. They do a very nice job and seem to be well made.</li>
    <li> These are a good pair of clippers for nose and ear grooming.</li>
    <li> They do protect your nostrils but trim slowly and carefully.  Good in conjunction with battery powered nose trimmers.</li>
    <li> These scissors appear to be very well made and likely to last forever. I am a very happy buyer of this product.</li>
    <li> These rusted almost immediately and are now stuck together. I got to use them once.</li>
    <li> I got tired of putting batteries in my nose clipper. This one works fine with no batteries.</li>
    <li> Great product for the value, well constructed and shaped. Scissors are sharp so be careful.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but a very tight cut!  Well made!</li>
    <li> It seems every new nose scissors just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut close. The metal is too thick and the safety tip too large. I had a nose scissors from 20 yrs ago and it was very thin and cut very close. Lost it at a hotel stay last year and I can&#x27;t find one that compares.</li>
    <li> Short nose hairs without the blood.</li>
    <li> Not up to Mehaz quality. Not smooth cutting or very sharp. I bought another longer pair of Mehaz scissors for trimming my hair and they are great. This is no better than fair, might be able to do as well at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Having only used very cheap grooming scissors I was surprised at the price (~$11). But after a couple months of these scissors seem to be worth it. These look longer than other similar scissors, and they are, I think. That hasn&#x27;t been a problem, though.</li>
    <li> My son had lost the little baby safety scissors that I had my entire life. So, I bought a whole bunch of different brands to try to replace the ones that were perfect. While not as delicate and precise as the one that was lost, this brand/model is the best of the bunch. It&#x27;s well made, sharp, accurate and comfortable.

    <li> Fine products, delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> I carry these in my purse and they are great. They cut nicely and are very safe with the rounded tips.</li>
    <li> Kind of stiff to use, making it awkward to use with one hand or two. Some discoloration after use that I can&#x27;t get out. Otherwise, works fine and does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> I trim my Yorkie dog and these are perfect for paws, ears, (his private area...oops, can I say that? grin). The rounded tips and length make them perfect for this application True they make dog grooming scissors, but you will have trouble beating the price and quality of these scissors. (No, I do not work for the scissor company, the seller on Amazon, and they were not provided to me for testing and a review...I actually bought them and love them...and my Yorkie does too!  Grin).  I received these from the seller very quickly. 5 stars for the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> When I got this product it seemed to be opened before.&lt;br /&gt;But what&#x27;s really surprised me is that there is black hair on the tip of the scissor and kind of watery on the blade.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like somebody just returned it and they shipped to me without checking beforehand....</li>
    <li> If I had not lost my last pair of similar scissors I would have a better opinion.  The cutting action of these scissors iis not nearly as smooth as my other pair.  All else is very good..</li>
    <li> Love it!  Very sharp and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Good product. I bought them for my husband and is worried about me cutting his ear and nose hair.  With these scissors I can get all of his ear and nose hair without injury.  I would recommend them and buy them again.  Good value for your money.</li>
    <li> Love these - bought 2 of them.</li>
    <li> Scissor are very sharp and cut hair very well.  The scissors seem to made of high quality steel and are compact.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very small. not for trimming ghair</li>
    <li> Use for nose and mustache. Sharp and reach tight sensitive places without inflicting pokes and possible blood.</li>
    <li> Ah, they cut my nose hairs just great!</li>
    <li> fine product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I am changing my 4 star review to 1 Star because I tried to use the &amp;#34;LIFETIMEM GUARANTEE&amp;#34; (because the insides began to rust) and called the # (888-225-6342) to start a claim or whatever... The woman asks for the part number (#370) and puts me on hold.. 1 min later she comes back and says my rusting issue is not covered because these are nickel plated and aren&#x27;t designed to last or something like that.  So I ask, what does the guarantee cover? She says manufacturer defects.    I will attach a picture.   I purchased them in May 2014 and they started rusting December 2014. I only spent over $12 on a little pair of scissors because they had the lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> Sharp &amp; precise. This pair of scissors are solidly built with blunted tips for safety reasons. Pass everything else and get these once. They&#x27;ll last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> They are not quite as sharp as I thought they should have been, and the finger rings could be larger.</li>
    <li> I purchased these scissors for a friend to use to trim her little dogs ears and around the face and mouth area. She said they worked really well for that purpose. Thank You</li>
