      <li>This is one of many great products made by Exuviance.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m happy that it works in keeping my skin moist and irritation free.</li>
      <li>This lotion has a light, pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves a powdery film after it dries, and if you touch your face it sheds and peels off very easy.</li>
      <li>Of the three products, I liked the way the skin rise felt and left my skin the best.</li>
      <li>GOes on very lightly.</li>
      <li>as I do NOT like the SPF factor in most of the day moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be happy with any improvement in any area really.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to try this moisturizer since I love Exuviance foundation.</li>
      <li>I was told it was rosacea and tried many many things that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I was hoping I&#x27;d also fall in love with this skin treatment.</li>
      <li>I have relied on this night cream for many years.  </li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love this Exuviance evening product and its a core part of my skin care.</li>
      <li>Your face will love it.</li>
      <li>I love how this product makes my face feel.  </li>
      <li>Love this night moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am in my 40th and have very good skin in general.  </li>
      <li>I am now making my own serums with much more success than this over priced lotion.</li>
      <li>The pump is awesome and actually gets every last drop in the bottle (I tore it apart to make sure, lol).</li>
      <li>With the easy availability of Olay, I think I&#x27;ll return to that family of skin care products.</li>
      <li>I bought this thinking that it would help even out my skin and reduce fine lines, but I did not see any beneficial effects from it.</li>
      <li>I get it from Butystore when they have super discount :-)    </li>
      <li>and I would recommend to anyone looking for a boost to more natural, healthy skin!</li>
      <li>I also used their Performance Peel (1 box/period) which also made a huge difference in the reduction of my noticeable scars</li>
      <li>After using this for a year now, I have noticed a huge difference in my skins complexion and feel.  </li>
      <li>It works great to keep my skin moisturized at night &amp; exfoliated at the same time.  </li>
      <li>Primary reason?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight</li>
      <li>I am delighted to be able to buy it in larger quantities through Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>My fair sensitive skin did not improve at all with this product, and I certainly would not say my skin felt smoother or more velvety.</li>
      <li>I had a super oily T zone, that has been reduced significantly.  </li>
      <li>This is perfect for keeping my extremely dry and sensitive skin moisturized until morning</li>
      <li>I love Exuviance products but on the high end of the price point.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so good that my fiance who barely uses anything on his face started using it and is hooked - now I have to buy twice as much.</li>
      <li>I love they have SPF in the face lotion for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>and I just have sensitive skin in general, really fair.  </li>
      <li>generally lasts about 6 months or more because it doesn&#x27;t take very much to cover your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very gentle and leaves my face looking and feeling healthier in the morning.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t criticize anything specific, but I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>I used it many years ago came back to it.</li>
      <li>For me it has such a strong smell, kind of minty , makes my face tingle slightly</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>The texture is smooth and has an instant effect on the skin.</li>
      <li>I gave it three stars, as I really could not say if it works or not.</li>
      <li>It keeps my face from becoming dry and it smooths my face out.</li>
      <li>Using it this way makes my foundation application much smoother and looks better than with any other type of lotion</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin, and it makes it really nice and smooth without being heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this line and always wear SPF in your face and lip products.</li>
      <li>I have been using the night, day and eye cream for sensitive skin for the past 7 yrs - love it!  </li>
      <li>Normally it takes my skin a while to get used to a new lotion, but not this one.</li>
      <li>I started with a free sample that based on other moisturizers would have lasted 2-3 days - it lasted 2-3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>but the cream is exactly the same...</li>
      <li>At first I was hesitant to purchase it because of the price, originally saw it at Ulta for about twice as much and then found on Amazon for a decent price, or at least decent enough to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>If I have a dry patch of skin this knocks it right out.</li>
      <li>and he is only 5 yrs older than me!  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>and I look so young - I am 49 and people would never in a million years think I am that old.  </li>
      <li>, I tried to find it online in the old tub container.  </li>
      <li>I randomly got a sample of this moisturizer and loved it immediately.</li>
      <li>The container changed recently and I don&#x27;t like the new style so rather than buy it in the store as I normally do</li>
      <li>I had to be very careful about how much of the restorative complex lotion I used as it was easy to get too much and end up feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>I use only Exuviance products and highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>It does have a lovely, soft pleasing scent, but it&#x27;s really just an expensive moisturizer, not an antiaging creme.</li>
      <li>Works really well on my extremely dry skin without causing it to break out.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft the next morning - not oily at all - just soft and supple.</li>
      <li>Some days my skin is very oily and other days</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 65 years of age and it really has made my skin nicer, less deep creases</li>
      <li>that I decided for the high price it was not worth</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Definitely see an improvement in face skin.  I use only Exuviance products and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in my skin after just a few weeks of using the product.  I really am happy with the results!  My skin looks smoother and the few lines I have seem to be less noticable.</li>
    <li> This is a great product; I have been using it for years and love it.  The container changed recently and I don&#x27;t like the new style so rather than buy it in the store as I normally do, I tried to find it online in the old tub container.  I didn&#x27;t read the reviews because I had no questions about the product itself, but I guess I should have because I would have seen that it came in a different structure than pictured and known not to purchase it here.</li>
    <li> Some days my skin is very oily and other days it is dry. I use this a few nights each week to even out troubled-looking areas. It is very gentle and leaves my face looking and feeling healthier in the morning.</li>
    <li> I am in my 40th and have very good skin in general.  Over the years I tried many different creams (both expensive &amp; inexpensive brands) and keeps coming back to this one.  It&#x27;s light weight and it does not feel greasy at all. It works great to keep my skin moisturized at night &amp; exfoliated at the same time.  It&#x27;s a great cream and the price is great-I get it from Butystore when they have super discount :-)    NeoStrata makes very good functional products. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have never used a line of this product yet that I haven&#x27;t seen results............ Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried this along with the Exuviance purifying cleanser and the Exuviance skin rise. Of the three products, I liked the way the skin rise felt and left my skin the best. I had to be very careful about how much of the restorative complex lotion I used as it was easy to get too much and end up feeling greasy. My fair sensitive skin did not improve at all with this product, and I certainly would not say my skin felt smoother or more velvety.</li>
    <li> Have been using Exuviance products for many years they are the best. Its too bad they are not widely known. Everyone would look a lot younger!!! Exuviance should be advertising their products.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I begin use this evening creme, about a month ago and i can already see some subtle improvements on my skin.</li>
    <li> As a self-professed beauty product junkie, I must admit that this really is a great night cream! I have used many of Exuviance&#x27;s products and find this to be one of the best. The texture is smooth and has an instant effect on the skin. It&#x27;s so good that my fiance who barely uses anything on his face started using it and is hooked - now I have to buy twice as much.</li>
    <li> This is the best night creme I have ever used. I can see the difference. My face is smoother and the lines are less visible. I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this moisturizer since I love Exuviance foundation. I was hoping I&#x27;d also fall in love with this skin treatment. I can&#x27;t criticize anything specific, but I didn&#x27;t love it. It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way. It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn&#x27;t too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason? I did have a few small break-outs after using Exuviance Restorative Complex for a couple of weeks. Did the Exuviance cause this? I&#x27;m not sure. With the easy availability of Olay, I think I&#x27;ll return to that family of skin care products.</li>
    <li> Great product for all skin types. Works really well on my extremely dry skin without causing it to break out.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommeded this cream to me about two years ago and I use it every day on my face and neck. I don&#x27;t know about it making a difference to wrinkles but I always get people telling me that I look like I&#x27;m 25 when I&#x27;m actually 36.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of using it at night I use it in the morning under my foundation. Using it this way makes my foundation application much smoother and looks better than with any other type of lotion I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;This cream does not feel at all greasy or heavy and has a subtle scent. I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s typical T-zone (dry on cheeks and oilier on forehead, nose, chin) and I&#x27;ve been very happy with Exuviance.&lt;br /&gt;1.75 ounces generally lasts about 6 months or more because it doesn&#x27;t take very much to cover your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I ordered the product on this page from Prestige-Beautica and received a different type of container - which is a dispenser like the white one on this product page: http://www.amazon.com/Exuviance-Evening-Restorative-Complex/dp/B000CR4HYG/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_13 (and this product page shows both types of containers making it a bit confusing)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I like the container it came in but the cream is exactly the same...</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and smells amazing. I look forward to washing my face at night just to put this on when I&#x27;m finished. It feels great on the skin.</li>
    <li> Hi have used this for a couple years now on the recommendation of a esthetician.  I&#x27;m 65 years of age and it really has made my skin nicer, less deep creases and I wear it day and night (not just at night) as I do NOT like the SPF factor in most of the day moisturizers.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> wife loves this stuff !</li>
    <li> I love this Exuviance evening product and its a core part of my skin care. Delivery was on time and in great condition.  I recommend this for women who feel the need for the next level of skin care.</li>
    <li> I started using this about a year ago.  At first I was hesitant to purchase it because of the price, originally saw it at Ulta for about twice as much and then found on Amazon for a decent price, or at least decent enough to give it a try.  I must say, I loved this from the get go.  You can immediately tell that this is a quality product by rubbing the cream in your fingers.  There is no oily residue whatsoever and as soon as you apply it to your face, I swear it starts glowing.  I also like that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot at all, 1 pump every evening does the trick.  After using this for a year now, I have noticed a huge difference in my skins complexion and feel.  I used to get dry patches around my mouth and chin, those are gone.  I had a super oily T zone, that has been reduced significantly.  I have a lot of scaring from when I was younger and had bad acne, now because of my complexion and tone, I barely wear any makeup.  I also used their Performance Peel (1 box/period) which also made a huge difference in the reduction of my noticeable scars (anyway that&#x27;s another product that I need to review, lol).  The pump is awesome and actually gets every last drop in the bottle (I tore it apart to make sure, lol). This is a great cream and I would recommend to anyone looking for a boost to more natural, healthy skin!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I used it many years ago came back to it. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Exuviance for years and it&#x27;s worked great. I hate the pump for the night cream.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would come in a jar, like it did decades ago. I find the pump annoying.</li>
    <li> This is one of many great products made by Exuviance.  I notice a difference in the feel of my skin from using their products. Have been using for two months and can not imagine not using these products. This one is no exception.  I recommend to my friends who compliment my skin (at least once a day). People say my skin is radiant.</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about,.... I am now making my own serums with much more success than this over priced lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this night moisturizer. If I have a dry patch of skin this knocks it right out. I have acne prone skin and none of the excuvience products I&#x27;ve used irritate me. Only thing I hate is the container. Would give 5 stars if they would change it.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a light, pleasant scent.  It leaves my skin feeling so soft the next morning - not oily at all - just soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It keeps my face from becoming dry and it smooths my face out.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for keeping my extremely dry and sensitive skin moisturized until morning and then I use the Bionic Tonic.  Can&#x27;t tell a big difference in reduction of wrinkles or pore size but I&#x27;m happy that it works in keeping my skin moist and irritation free.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have very dry skin, and it makes it really nice and smooth without being heavy or greasy. After my girls were born, I had some weird patches on my face that wouldn&#x27;t go away. I was told it was rosacea and tried many many things that didn&#x27;t work. I randomly got a sample of this moisturizer and loved it immediately. Normally it takes my skin a while to get used to a new lotion, but not this one. This one is for me!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Tried everything.  Always switching brands?  This is the one deal you can&#x27;t pass up on.  This one is a keeper.  Your face will love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it would help even out my skin and reduce fine lines, but I did not see any beneficial effects from it. It also leaves a powdery film after it dries, and if you touch your face it sheds and peels off very easy. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Great Texture. No perfumes. GOes on very lightly.I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and  I have not yet noticed improvement but hopefully will in the next couple of weeks. I love Exuviance products but on the high end of the price point. Not sure if I will purchase again. I like th No.7 products and they are not as expensive.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price and delivered to your door!!</li>
    <li> I gave it three stars, as I really could not say if it works or not. For me it has such a strong smell, kind of minty , makes my face tingle slightly that I decided for the high price it was not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did hear a lot of great things about exuviance products and will try out some others, their toner I know is really good, I got to try a bit of it, it definitely removed all remaining make up after you wash your face, it has a bit of a orangy smell, but the smell goes away within less then a min. and it might just be the way how I preceive the smell.</li>
    <li> I have relied on this night cream for many years.  It is unbelievably soothing and moisturizing with a silky feel and a lovely faint aroma.  Nothing else compares!  I am delighted to be able to buy it in larger quantities through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting to the age where I could use some skin tightening, wrinkle reduction, spot reduction, smoother complexion...I&#x27;d be happy with any improvement in any area really.  This did NOTHING...It does have a lovely, soft pleasing scent, but it&#x27;s really just an expensive moisturizer, not an antiaging creme.</li>
    <li> Used this for years....love this product.  Keeps my skin looking much younger than I am.</li>
    <li> I love how this product makes my face feel.  I started with a free sample that based on other moisturizers would have lasted 2-3 days - it lasted 2-3 weeks.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using the night, day and eye cream for sensitive skin for the past 7 yrs - love it!  I have a little Rosecea and I just have sensitive skin in general, really fair.  I love they have SPF in the face lotion for sensitive skin.  People always compliment me on my skin and I look so young - I am 49 and people would never in a million years think I am that old.  they thought I was &amp;#34;jail bait&amp;#34; with my husband and he is only 5 yrs older than me!  I highly recommend this line and always wear SPF in your face and lip products.</li>
