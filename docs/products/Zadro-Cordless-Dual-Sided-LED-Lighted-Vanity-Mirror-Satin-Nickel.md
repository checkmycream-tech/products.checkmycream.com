<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this mirror for my wife in January, by April it was falling apart. The screw that holds the mirror on the swivel came out and is within the glass area making it impossible to repair. Amazon allows you to return the mirror within 30 days. This is a mirror that is not abused just used to place makeup. I can&#x27;t believe it falls apart within months of use. I would never buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved it....at first.  After about two weeks, the lights dimmed and now it is pretty useless.  So much for bulbs that never need replaced.  I will search for those bulbs because I like the mirror other than that, one of the most important features.  Why buy a lighted make-up mirror if you aren&#x27;t going to use the light??</li>
    <li> Loved the mirror but when I put in new batteries, the light would not come on.  I had to return it.  I plan on ordering another one to see if there was just a problem with the one I got.  If the light will work it will be perfect for me.</li>
    <li> You will like this. My Mother was thrilled !</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. I can see my face clearly.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a battery powered make up mirror for Christmas.  I purchased this one after a little research and she is quite happy with it.  It isn&#x27;t the brightest I&#x27;ve ever seen, but it emits a medium cool pleasing light.  In conjunction with over-the-sink or overhead lighting, it does a fine job.      The finish is quite good, matching our antiqued nickel bathroom hardware pretty closely, and the mirrors are of good quality as well.  While not exactly a high end product, it is of good quality and compliments our master bathroom&#x27;s decor.  The mirror base is nice and weighty, but you may want to put some thin pads on the bottom to keep from scratching your marble countertops - granite, composites and formica should fare well without pads.      We are picky about our home&#x27;s appearance and careful about what we place in it.  This product looks good and performs quite well.  The fact that it&#x27;s cordless is a bonus, even a little Zen, as it reduces the clutter of power cords that can haunt the bathroom.  That said, I recommend it without reservation.     Since we were happy with the product, we&#x27;ve had no interaction with the vendor&#x27;s customer service as referenced in another review.  On that topic I have nothing to add.     AW</li>
    <li> It was a great deal  i like it</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago and it was great for a month. Then I noticed the light kept getting dimmer. So I changed out the batteries and they didn&#x27;t last long, so I changed them again. Eventually it stopped working all together; won&#x27;t turn on at all! This is not a cheap mirror and it&#x27;s upsetting.</li>
    <li> Love it, don&#x27;t need to plug it in a plus</li>
    <li> The magnification is nice, the light is dim but handy in DARK light.....the batteries exploded in an unusual amout of time to replace? I  probably would by a different mirror with hind sight.  However, if you have natural light and light a contemporary look, ,goo for it, I did.....</li>
    <li> Gift recipient is very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love that it is cordless!!! No cords on my vanity. However, I do with it were a little bigger in size.</li>
    <li> The magnification/mirror itself is just great, but the light is so dim as to be superfluous. The company selling this lighted makeup mirror handily doesn&#x27;t tell the brightness of the bulb. It&#x27;s NOT the circular 100-watt bulb that Zadro sells in their other mirrors - it&#x27;s very dim. Because the language used in the product description, \\&quot;Next Generation LED Lighted,\\&quot; is the language used in the description of other Zadro lighted mirrors, I assumed this one to be at least similar in strength - it would have been very nice to have a more accurate product description than is listed here (at least at the time of this writing; hopefully someone will change that).    So I paid the shipping fee and received the mirror, which bore a strong resemblance to the one pictured on this page - but with a less-attractive finish - and inserted brand-new, tested batteries. The light is so dim that one would need additional lighting to be able to see properly. It&#x27;s useless to me without a decent light. I went through the return process, which cost me even more money: another $9.50 for shipping, and then TechnologyLK&#x27;s 15% restocking fee! Man, oh man. So I got bupkis, but I managed to spend a little over $25 to find out that this isn&#x27;t the product for me. And with a return policy like that, TechnologyLK, the seller, is not the company for me.    I phoned the company, but they just said they&#x27;re sorry I&#x27;m so dissatisfied (!), and they did nothing to let me know that customers are valuable to them. I will never do business with them again, that&#x27;s a certainty. They claimed on the phone that TechnologyLK had sold \\&quot;lots and lots of these mirrors\\&quot; via Amazon&#x27;s site, and I&#x27;m the first to have complained.  Really?  Of all the myriad customers purchasing this item, I&#x27;m the first to complain that I didn&#x27;t even receive the same mirror as THE ONE SHOWN IN THE AD?! I also find it odd that this is the very first Amazon review if so many have been sold. If everyone else is so dang happy with this product,how come no one&#x27;s talkin&#x27;? Bleh. Finished with this seller, though I may purchase a better Zadro mirror at a later date; for now I have a pretty bad taste in my mouth, thank you TechnologyLK.</li>
    <li> Love my mirror.  Perfect magnification . Love that it&#x27;s cordless</li>
    <li> This was one of the only lit make-up mirrors I could find that used batteries. I didn&#x27;t want any more cords in the bathroom. The light is very nice looking and made well, however I wish the magnification was greater. The light has a tendency to go dim and then brighten up. At first I thought the new batteries were already dying, but one was loose, so after pushing that back in, it was fine for a day. Now it is doing the same thing again, but I accidentally left it on for over 12 hours, so the batteries may actually be going now. Overall, satisfied.</li>
    <li> After trying the 10x magnification mirror, which I gave to a friend ... I purchased the 5x mirror. It is perfect. Made well with good workmanship and good finish. LED&#x27;s are nice and bright.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror.  It is very convenient and very practical.  I would give this product as a gift.</li>
    <li> lighting is good and it has the right magnification for me . These are hard to find battery operated. Very useful and portable</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror! I was a little unsure because it is battery operated but I was pleasantly surprised.  Very good quality,  light is bright and crisp. Would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Great product and great quality.  I love the simplicity of the design and efficiency of portability with it operating on batteries and being cordless.  It worked wonders at the last wedding I was in and all the girls were fighting over it!  A real gem!  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look fabulous, at any place and any time.  Also, it is very bright and the LED lighting really helps the effectiveness of applying make up just right.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror because mine wouldn&#x27;t turn it on.  In the time waiting for it to be delivered, I was able to find the problem with mine so I returned this. Never opened it so I can&#x27;t comment at all about the product.</li>
    <li> Lighting is good and the dual-sided mirror provides enough amplification to catch make-up goofs.  The battery power enables it to be used anywhere.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> i love it!! it the only negative thing is i wish the mirror was bigger however it&#x27;s ok.  i love that its battery operated. i was worried there would not be&lt;br /&gt;enough lighting by the other reviews but not the case. lighting is good! shipping was fast and it was well packaged!</li>
    <li> Broke in one day want refund</li>
    <li> I hate it. The light is too dim. I kept trying to get accustomed to it and finally gave up. Then check on Amazon return policy and the website said the 30 days had passed. I am very unhappy. I will think twice before ordering from a company with a 30 day return requirement.</li>
    <li> This mirror is bright, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about plugging/unplugging it if I move it from room to room. Love it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had ours for some 5 weeks now. It has held up fine. Batteries are not drained by use and it&#x27;s rather bright.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It is small enough to even be portable and no plug wire makes it so much better.</li>
    <li> This is great for the money. No cords so can be picked up and moved, very light. Runs off of basic batteries. Works just like a regular expensive plug in mirror.</li>
    <li> I just opened the box and  the lightning is not working. I will need to fix it!! DON&#x27;T BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> This lighted cordless mirror is absolutely the most amazing mirror I have ever owned.  I really like the LED light.  Truly fantastic and I recommend this item!  Love it. Sheri</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She likes the height and the magnification.  She also likes that it is not too heavy, so she carries it from room to room without any difficulty.  She agrees with other reviewers that the LED could be much brighter.</li>
    <li> The lights are white and glary, making my face appear unnaturally whitish.  I can&#x27;t tell if my makeup is on straight and even, too colorful, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to send it back and get a different style.</li>
    <li> I needed a mirror that didn&#x27;t require an electric outlet and this one fit the bill.  Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> WAS NOT CORDLESS.  I AM RETURNING ITEM.</li>
    <li> She tried to beat the crap out of this thing and it took a licking.  I would highly recommend this for any parent that has kids that are rough on their mirrors.</li>
    <li> Mirror was attractive and worked as advertised. However the magnification was very uncomfortable for me and seemed distorted beyond a few inches probably because of my own vision problems. Returned the mirror.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. But some times the LED light is not turning on and we have to shake it to fix it.</li>
    <li> I was worried when I ordered this that the light wasn&#x27;t going to be bright enough, but it absolutely is. And the mirror itself is big which i really like about it also. Before I just had a regular vanity mirror with no light, and now I will never go back.</li>
    <li> Great look, light level, and height/size. For stars only because we had to return the first one ordered due to a faulty on/off button.</li>
    <li> Gift for the wife. She loves it, so i love it. Brushed Nickel finish matches perfectly our decor. The unit is nice and hefty, wont tip over. LED and should yield long battery life.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Works well with batteries, which did not need to be replaced for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Product light does not work. It turns on bright then after 5 seconds, it goes dull and you can&#x27;t see anything. Its like not even having a light. I used the batteries the company provided and I just bought it, so I haven&#x27;t even used it that much.</li>
    <li> No issue with the switch, the mirror is the right magnification for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;The weight is light, so it is portable.&lt;br /&gt;The LED is okay, could it be brighter... Yep.&lt;br /&gt;So make sure your bathroom lights are on too.&lt;br /&gt;Cool that it uses AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;But for the cost, we think it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;If the LED was brighter, the rating would be a 5-stars.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Lighting is good. I like the extra magnification. The fact that there are no cords is great. Haven&#x27;t replaced a battery yet and it&#x27;s been several months.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Does just what I wanted and takes up minimal space. My previous mirror was corded and a real pain.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the mirror.  Was reluctant after reading some other reviews.  Some thought the light was not bright enough.  It is a very bright light.  I wouldn&#x27;t be able to look into anything brighter.  The mirror  seems to be a well built, quality product.  The fact that it is cordless makes is so handy.  I have only had it 3-4 weeks but could not be more pleased.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars versus 5 is that I would prefer that it be several inches shorter.</li>
    <li> This mirror was too short for my purposes. For that reason, I returned it. The light was nice and bright. In fact it was one of the brighter lighted vanity mirrors that I tried. The mirror itself was also a good size and a really clear reflection. If it were taller (and even better, cordless), it would have been perfect.</li>
    <li> The led lights are worthless and the actual mirror is too small. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the light feature; it really doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> The mirror quality is good and the packing was OK but the product was broken electrically.  If it had ever been tested with batteries, it would not have lit.  Zadro makes a quality product but there was no &amp;#34;inspected by&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; or any indication that the product had been inspected.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfiend and she just thought it &amp;#34;was the best!&amp;#34; It is extremely sturdy and has a very classic look .&lt;br /&gt;Illumination is top notch....and with the magnification option, every facial detail comes in crystal clear. You may or may not be disappointed based upon how you think you REALLY look vs what this mirror reflects!</li>
    <li> Super bright lights !! Excellent.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> My wife loves the fact that you don&#x27;t have to find an outlet to plug it in to make it work!. You can use it anywhere in the house! Wonderfully well made mirror! Thank you:-)</li>
    <li> for traveling is nice</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for granddaughter who lives in a foreign country. She was thrilled with the battery.of the Zadro Surround light.</li>
    <li> ...expensive competition.&lt;br /&gt;Very utilitarian!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  Flips between &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;magnified.&amp;#34;  It says LED in the titled, so I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised, but it is definitely that white/bluish LED color.  So it&#x27;s fine, but the light is definitely a little harsh.  Requires 4 AA batteries, and it&#x27;s really awesome that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
    <li> This is a great little mirror for a vanity top.  Very slim compared to some other lighted mirrors.  I don&#x27;t like using batteries, but this works out great for me.  No cords on the countertop and you can move it wherever you want.  The light is good, especially if you have other lighting in the room.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I can see my face in this mirror.  It is a disappointment,  I am getting old and I don&#x27;t like seeing that close-up.</li>
    <li> Nice but not what I expected</li>
    <li> love this mirror... its well lit and i can really see how ugly my skin is up close...:-) but seriously this is a nice mirror for the price and it arrive fast!. looks nice on my vanity. i really like it  ca use its no cords.... battery operated</li>
    <li> Great mirror....I can finally see my eyes whiling putting on make-up.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Kind of smaller than it looks but worth the value.</li>
    <li> Very limited usefulness</li>
    <li> very good price fast delivery works great</li>
    <li> I love it.  It works great and I love the fact that it is portable and I don&#x27;t have to find a plug to plug it</li>
