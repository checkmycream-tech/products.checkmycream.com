<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought for my wife, it had worked fine for about 3 year, then vibration level becomes very weak even with highest level.</li>
    <li> Died after 2.5 years.  Luckily, it has a 3 year warranty.</li>
    <li> So my mom wanted me to buy her this for Christmas and she made me use it. At first, I used it just to make her happy but now I am considering buying one myself. I had problems with acne in the past and used accutane. While my pimples went away, my face was left with red marks and little grooves from where the acne use to be. I also have really big pores. Using clarisonic has helped with all of this. My face feels so smooth and my pores seem so insignificant now! I love this product.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before purchasing.  I do think the product is good at keeping skin surface smoother - fewer dry flakes.  It feels very nice while using. However, it is very expensive and I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase for the price if I could have tested it out first.  It has not improved my acne, but I think my acne is primarily hormonal and doesn&#x27;t have any easy fix.  If you need something to motivate you to stay in the daily routine of face cleansing, this may be the thing for you.  It is a great product, just question the cost-to-value ratio.</li>
    <li> I heard so many times that I had, had, to have the 4 speed clarisonic pro. I thought almost $200 was a bit much to wash my face but everyone assured me that it was an investment. I can honestly say that my skin has looked amazing since I&#x27;ve used it and I feel more confident walking around with no make up on :) I&#x27;m a nurse and I without a doubt know that this product will continue to improve skin for generations to come.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my daughter, who loves this product.  She says it is now a must have for her grooming routine,</li>
    <li> This is truly a fantastic product and great for everyone, regardless of skin type.  I have oily, acne prone skin and I only wish I had purchased it sooner.   It really does get your skin VERY clean.  As a result, I feel like my other skin-care products are able to penetrate deeper into my skin making them more effective.  It&#x27;s definitely an investment, but definitely worth it!  I chose not to use the cleanser and other products that came with it, as I prefer my own, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well they work.</li>
    <li> Just as described with several speed settings.  I really like it and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned about the price, but now that I&#x27;ve been using this for a month, I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  My skin is clear, has better color, and feels soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Clarisonic Pro Deluxe(white) turned out to be a product I enjoy using about 3 times a week.  I, like many, thought I could get the same result wth a wash cloth or face brush but you really can&#x27;t.  Think of it as a regular toothbrush vs an electric toothbrush - the electric always leaves your teeth  smoother and cleaner.  The Clarisonic leaves my face really clean because it lifts off the fine layer of  dead skin I shed everyday.  Afterwards my skin is very clear and smooth (that pinkish/polished look).  It also helps my creams/treatments to work better because the skin layer is \\&quot;new.\\&quot;    Since it is Summer right now and the sun is full blast where I live, I do not use it more than  3 times a week.  Sunscreen is a must because the freshly-scrubbed skin is extra vulnerable to sun damage.    My skin is on the oily side with a tendency towards blemishes and the Clarisonic has caused no problems.  Lastly, although it has performed no miracles, I can honestly tell you that, upon use, it smooths and softens  the look of fine lines (by removing the dead skin that makes the wrinkle appear deeper).      I was hesistant because of the price but am glad I finally bought it.  Price paid: $159 +free ship</li>
    <li> It did say it came with 2 brushes and I only received 1.  That is my only disappointment.  It works so well my husband keeps steeling it.  He noticed a difference and now wants to make a difference in his skin.  Get your own buster.  Watch the verbiage carefully, I thought it came with two brushes.</li>
    <li> This is one product that lives up to all its expectations.  My skin has never looked or felt better!</li>
    <li> I love this product!     My husband gave me this for my birthday at the end of November and I&#x27;ve been using it 2 times a day since then using Dermologica products. People who saw me at Christmas who hadn&#x27;t seen me for a while could not believe how awesome my skin looked. Much fresher, fewer wrinkles, a lovely glow. I&#x27;m a few months shy of 50 and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since my 30&#x27;s.    Careful that you don&#x27;t use any products with exfolliants in them and use it twice a day and you should be pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 35 now, and have suffered from relentless, itchy, painful, embarrassing acne breakouts since age 28.  I always seem to have at least a few zits on my face.  Often in the same day, one would heal &amp; 2 or 3 more would emerge.  Every. Single. Day.  But because my skin is aging, using acne products formulated for greasy teenagers would strip &amp; over-dry the skin, causing a rebound breakout, and irritating the drier parts of my face, like the temples &amp; upper cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone seems to agree that it&#x27;s probably due to hormone shifts &amp; a few food allergies, so even my dermatologist discouraged me from buying the Clarisonic.  However, my mother-in-law (who still has acne in her 50s) has one, and swears by it.  So I decided, based on all the positive reviews &amp; generous return policy, to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away I noticed that my face hadn&#x27;t felt so clean in I don&#x27;t know how long.  Even using the gentler cleansers, my face was soft &amp; smooth, but not oily!  Perfectly clean!  I&#x27;ve been wasting money on $40 cleanser I can only get online, that doesn&#x27;t even seem that effective.  I did an experiment buying the new ($6) L&#x27;Oreal 360 deep cleanser for sensitive skin from the grocery store (smells &amp; feels a lot like the Clarisonic Hydrating cleanser).  Even that does wonders for my skin, when I use it with the Clarisonic.  Also, love that the machine is waterproof &amp; I can take it in the shower with no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on average twice a day, for about six weeks.  I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture, although my fine lines aren&#x27;t going away, as other people raved.  When I do have a pimple, it seems to heal faster &amp; not become as infected.  I also did an experiment after wearing liquid foundation.  I washed my face as well as I could without the Clarisonic...Then I used the Clarisonic on the Low setting right after, with a little gentle cleanser, and I saw a *bunch* of makeup coming up from the brush:  makeup that would&#x27;ve otherwise just clogged my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to convince myself to spend $200 on a face scrubber.  But it really is cost-effective, considering it&#x27;s cheaper than 2 spa facials with extractions.  And the results are far better than after a facial, without the rebound breakout I usually get afterwards.  Do yourself a favor &amp; don&#x27;t skimp on this essential tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, just had to say, I was a little intimidated by people&#x27;s comments about the complicated timers &amp; settings.  If you read the directions fully before using (they&#x27;re not long at all), it is explained in very clear terms.  I usually have a bit of a learning curve with new devices, but this one was easy to use right away.  Remember to charge it for 24 hours, immediately when you get it.  Enjoy!just clogged my pores.

    <li> I love it! I have noticed a huge difference in my skin, and its timer makes it a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Clarisonic on the recommendation of a friend.  It has worked out wonderfully.  I have rosacea so was concerned about my sensitive skin and it has not been a problem.  It cleans so well that I use less of my skin care products.  I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought for myself... It does exactly what it says: cleans your skin better than you ever thought you could, mildly exfoliates, and just makes your skin look fabulous.  I can also tell it is softening my fine lines on my forehead (which are just starting).  Once you use a clarisonic, you&#x27;ll never go back to washing your face the regular way.  I really like the Pro better than the one my friend bought awhile ago, b/c I changed it to a two minute timer b/c I have very oily skin, and I also like to be able to customize the speed (high after the gym, normal on a regular day). A FANTASTIC buy... a must for anyone who is looking for a boost to their facial skin.  Plus, if you buy the spot attachment, you can use it on rough places like your upper chest, elbows, and knees (it has a special speed built in for body areas).</li>
    <li> This hair blower is wonderful.  It directs the heat just where you want it making it easy for hair styling</li>
    <li> I read lots of reviews for this product and ordered it hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones to have this product work for my skin. I have seen a great improvement (I&#x27;m also using cold-pressed argan oil) and have far fewer breakouts. I decided that after spending $140 on facials every 8 weeks or so, that this would pay for itself sooner than later. I only wish I had bought this sooner!</li>
    <li> The clarisonic has made my skin so soft and it is also a really enjoyable experience. I have sensitive skin and the brush is so thorough, I have to make sure I use a very gentle cleanser, or I&#x27;ll break out.    I recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I was sold a defective product and received no response from the company. A decent company would investigate a defective product. I spent two days wages to buy this product and it does not even work.</li>
    <li> This product has really help diminish my acne about 95% and keep my skin glowing and bright.  Combined with good glycolic pads and retinol products you&#x27;ll be looking about 5 years younger in no time.  A must have product in your arsenal if you are serious about good skin.  I do recommend using it in the shower, as with the vibrations, water tends to fly everywhere.  If I use it at the sink i feel like it makes too much of a mess.  But no problem, just use it in the shower while you are conditioning your hair.</li>
    <li> When I became convinced I wanted to go for the Clarisonic I decided to go BIG -- and I bought the Clarisonic Pro, because the variable speeds and the body brush appealed to me. I did love the Clarisonic Pro and used it regularly. However, I soon grew tired of the timing feature and didn&#x27;t really see the need for a special body brush, and only used one speed. I ended up selling it on ebay and replacing it with the Clarisonic Mia.  The Mia does everything I need it to do and is lighter, takes up less room and is just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m posting this review in case others are on the fence about the different models. For me, bigger was not better and I could have saved myself some serious cash by going with the mia, which, by the way, I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still gave this 5 stars because I felt I made the wrong choice, but the product is fine.</li>
    <li> nice seller, great product, i use it everyday right now, and it  really works as it is described. thank you ,,I will purchase from the seller again.</li>
    <li> While I was recently travelling, I rewarded myself with a spa package including a massage and a facial.  The Clarisonic was included in the facial and was the best facial that I have ever had.  Immediately, when I returned home, I purchased one for my home and use it everynight and most mornings.  Not to mention the clean factor, my skin is radiant, spots are smoothing out and my girlfriends are saying, \\&quot;WOW you look great\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> The clarisonic pro deluxe professional has been wonderful!  I have struggled with acne for years.  I had just about resigned myself to always having acne.  This brush works like a motorized toothbrush.  The cleaning ability of this brush is outstanding.  After using for roughly 3 weeks my skin is smoother, softer and with little to no acne. I highly recommend it!  It is worth the investment.  [[ASIN:B001QOGXO6 Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System, White]]</li>
    <li> Wonderful product  better than expected and can actually see improvement in skin.. Did not expect this to be anything more than cleansing tool so I am pleasently surprised.</li>
    <li> I received the Clarisonic Professional 4 speed Skin Care System on December 29th and after using this things for approximately a week I can see a major difference in the appearance of my skin. I have always suffered from acne and the scars that come with it, including the disgusting grime of blackheads and skin roughness in addition to hyper-pigmentation. However, when I bought the Clarisonic Pro, all of my awful skin problems that have destroyed my skin and self esteem for years have drastically diminished within one week. My family and friends have noticed that my hyper-pigmentation has gone away almost completely, I do not seem to get the acne I did before and my skin went from rough and bumpy to smooth and soft within one week. I know that this seems very cliche that something can fix someones face within one week, but it is true. I have never been so happy to wake up to clear beautiful skin. And this thing makes you actually want to wash your face twice daily like everyone should who suffers with skin problems. I notice that the brush works the way that the Clarisonic website says it does. It removes more makeup than manual washing does. I use makeup every day, I am close to becoming a professional makeup artist so with that I have to use a full face of makeup every day. And with this my skin stays acts the way every girl wants it to when applying makeup and it stays clear even without makeup. My lotions, toners, and serums, soak in better after using this instead of staying on the outside of my skin like they used to making my skin seem like it was very oily when I woke up or under my makeup. All in all the Clarisonic system has made my skin the way it want to and I cannot wait until a month to see better results then they actually are.   The Clarisonic is not an essential item however if I was to go back to manual washing I would have continued to suffer with all of the embarrassing problems my skin had prior to finding the Clarisonic Pro. I know for the price this skin care item seems a little pricey but if you have suffered with acne or facial problems for years and want them gone within a matter of days how could you ever put a price on your skin or on confidence. I understand that there are dupes such as the Nutrasonic that have attempted to take the place of the Clarisonic, however, depending on how your skin is you can choose which one is better for you. I will list the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s of both systems.   Clarisonic Pro&#x27;s:   1) Includes Four Speed Settings Low Medium High and Problem area Mode   2) Has the option of 4 different brush heads depending on skin sensitivity including a body brush (delicate, sensitive, normal, deep cleansing, body brush)  3) vibrates and rotates 300 times per second   4) includes a timer for the skin one or two minutes depending on how you set it  5) made of better material and heavier than the Nutrasonic facial cleansing system   6) includes a two year warranty wherever you purchase it from   7) Includes a charger and it lights up letting you know when you should charge it again  8) Waterproof can use it in the shower and bath without destroying device  9) Brushes and device come in a variety of colors   Clarisonic Con&#x27;s:   1) Price of 150 to 250 dollars depending on where you purchase it (cheaper on Amazon.com)   2) doesn&#x27;t vibrate and rotate as much as the Nutrasonic   3) could dry out your skin if you are using the wrong facial brush for your skin or the cleanser irritates your skin  4) Replacement brush heads are pricier than the Nutrasonic   5) Timer doesn&#x27;t beep loud enough when water is running in shower so you could lose track of time in one specific spot if you aren&#x27;t paying attention  6) You cannot use exfoliating cleansers when using this (why would you need to though since the Clarisonic is exfoliating while cleansing your skin already)  Nutrasonic Pro&#x27;s:   1) Includes Four Speed Settings Low High Jitter and Body Mode  2) Includes three brushes Sensitive Normal and Body Brush   3) Vibrates and rotates 400 times per second   4) Includes all brushes and charger when first purchase set compared to Clarisonic which only includes charger, one brush, and trial size cleansers  5) Includes a two year warranty   6) Lets you know when you should charge device   7) You are allowed to use scrubbing cleansers compatible with Jitter mode only (In my opinion this will result in scaring of the face for if you are exfoliating to much it could destroy layers of the skin)  8) completely waterproof can use this in the shower and bathtub without it getting ruined  9) Cheaper price 80-130 which is about 50 dollars cheaper than the Clarisonic Machine  10) Machine comes in a variety of colors   Nutrasonic Con&#x27;s:   1) Doesn&#x27;t include a timer   2) lighter than the Clarisonic in weight because it doesn&#x27;t include a built in timer  3) Only has two face brushes to choose from which is horrible for those with sensitive skin (which is the only reason someone would buy an oscillation machine)  4) made with cheaper material   5) could dry out skin if you are using it with the wrong brush for your skin or wrong cleanser   6) brushes aren&#x27;t as soft or full as the Clarisonic brushes  7) brush was made more for use on the body than on the face because it did not pay as much attention to those with sensitive skin  8) Brush seems to be made of cheaper material compared to the Clarisonic    All in all I chose the Clarisonic Pro as my device of choice due to the fact that it had better reviews and included more for the price than the Nutrasonic Pro. I think any oscillation machine is beneficial to the skin but I think the Clarisonic Pro is better because it pays more attention to those of us that have sensitive or problem skin. Either one you choose will be better for your skin than manual washing. Happy Shopping and I wish everyone beautiful skin if they decide to buy either one of these products. :)</li>
    <li> I immediately started to notice the difference in the appearance of my skin after using it.  You won&#x27;t regret purchasing the Clarisonic cleaning system!</li>
    <li> Age:23  Race:Pacific Islander  Skin Type:Dry/Oily in most areas/Sensitive/Prone to Breakouts  Hair:Black        I had received this product less than a week ordered from Amazon which I was very happy with because I was excited to try it. The reason I decided to buy this product was because I was looking to get off the harsh medicines my dermatologist had prescribed for my face, I felt that in the long run going as close to natural with my face products will benefit my skin. My pores get clogged very easily &amp; nothing was working to stop small breakouts from occurring. I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic for almost 2 weeks now (only at night on the lowest setting because I&#x27;m afraid it will strip my skin too much of its natural oils) &amp; I love it!I use it along side with Origins face wash Checks and Balances (2x/day) &amp; still use my prescribed Epiduo at night. I&#x27;ve also switched my press powder to Physicians Formula Mineral Face Powder Talc Free &amp; use Alba Hawaiian Oil Free Aloe &amp; Green Tea moisturizer both are non-comedogenic which means non pore clogging, for my SPF I use a powder by Peter Thomas Roth bought from Sephora because after experimenting with moisturizers with SPF&#x27;s I&#x27;ve realized my face couldn&#x27;t handle the liquid version &amp; would make me break out.To summarize this review, I&#x27;d have to say Clarisonic helps greatly with cleaning my skin and ridding it from excess make up and whatever build up occurs on your face daily.I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s the only reason my skin has cleared up tremendously though.The key to beautiful skin is a solid regimen that works for each individual person.The products I&#x27;ve listed above are made from quality ingredients &amp; some also organic which have contributed to my clearer skin.I&#x27;ll definitely continue using this brush &amp; would recommend buying.</li>
    <li> Can not believe how much more makeup comes off !!!  I&#x27;ve watched the reviews for a while.  I&#x27;ve heard that your skin may break out more. I did have a few more pimples in the first week or two. However, since then my skin has cleared up and is smoother. My skin care products feel they are absorbed more. My makeup goes on more smoothly!  I LOVE the Spot Body Brush too. It&#x27;s been great for the back of my arms especially.  So glad I went forward and bought one!!</li>
    <li> I love the Clarisonic Pro.  It arrived much sooner than estimated.  I bought this one for a friend and she loves it too.  My skin was breaking out a lot during pregnancy so I decided to try it.  My skin cleared up and hasn&#x27;t had any break outs during my current pregnancy.  My skin feels smoother and looks cleaner and younger.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of ordering this but it was cheaper then buying it on the shelf, I ordered it on a Sunday and it came that Tuesday!! I was thrilled of how fast of a delivery it was. This product has made a difference my skin does feel softer, and I plan of buying the body attachment to exfoliate my body.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. I love that it has four speeds. I like using the 3rd speed (next to highest) speed at night to get my makeup off, and the 2nd speed in the morning. I even use this on my lips, and it makes them super soft! You can take it in the shower, too, which was great. I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic changes dealing with my breakouts yet, but I have been only using it a week. It definately does make your face softer after the first use! I also noticed that it does help with fine lines. The shipping was absolutely incredible. I ordered it on a Tuesday in the late morning/early afternoon, and it arrived that Thursday. Talk about quick!!! I love this. I actually get excited to wash my face now.    I used one of the face washes it came with (the one in the blue bottle that is for normal/oily skin) and it worked pretty well. Just knbow that it DOES NOT come with a body brush. For some reason, I thought that it did, but it does not.    I completely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love my new clarisonic pro skin care system, best gift my husband has ever bought me.  Removes make up, build up and I&#x27;m a tennis player who uses a lot of sunscreen it&#x27;s great for a deep cleansing after being out in the sun for a while.  Can&#x27;t wait to get the body brush attachments next.</li>
    <li> Spent close to two years debating if I should spend good money on a Clarisonic Pro and finally treated myself this past Christmas. Hands down the best investment I&#x27;ve made in my skin. I use the Clarisonic every other day, mostly to get my skin acclimated. I didn&#x27;t experience the purging that other reviewers experienced. My combination, acne-prone skin has been on a dermatologist&#x27;s regimen (Retin-A Micro) for the last two years and I&#x27;ve used everything from Murad and ProActiv over the last decade to keep it in check. Clarisonic seriously takes the place of any weekly mask/peel that I used to use religiously and I&#x27;ve noticed that breakouts are fewer and far between and my skin tone and texture is much more even and smooth. This will definitely enhance your daily cleansing regimen but I never went into it thinking Clarisonic would be some miracle worker. For some, maybe. For me, it&#x27;s just a really, really, really good product. I&#x27;m glad  I finally bought it -- wish I did it sooner cause it would&#x27;ve saved me a ton of money on all those fancy cleansers and masks.</li>
    <li> I love this gadget! I use it every day and my skin has never looked so good. I used to have dry patches around my nose and they&#x27;ve gone. my makeup goes on more evenly now and my skin feels more hydrated. highly recommend you get one!</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Pro stopped charging after 2 months.  Clarisonic refused to warranty it because this model is not suppose to be sold online.  Amazon has refused to stand by this product and has not returned emails or phone calls.   Do not purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month my skin looks really nice and clean!!! Love it, will buy my sister one!!! I bought the 2011 pro model, can&#x27;t be without it now!</li>
    <li> Bought after daughter raved about how smooth her skin was.  It does a great job of deep cleaning.  I wish this was around when I was a teen. Acne seems to run in the family. This would have made a difference. I use my regular cleaning products.  Haven&#x27;t tried the ones that came with the unit. It holds a charge for a long time.  took on vacation for a week without running out of  power.</li>
    <li> A lot of people would think I&#x27;m crazy to spend so much on a gadget that washes your face. But I have to say, that even after a week of using the device, my skin was noticeably clearer and smoother.    For years I have battled with redness, break outs, skin irritation and more, and for this to help with all of the above, makes it a miracle product for me.    Couldn&#x27;t recommend more!</li>
    <li> W*O*W what a Godsend!  Finally a sonic, professional grade system that exfoliates, polishes and brightens your skin! You&#x27;ll feel, as well as see, a difference with the very first use.  As a 44-year-young, athletic women with an olive complexion that I expose to the elements on a daily basis, my skin is in good shape but blemishes, acne and blackheads are the result of sweaty workouts, heat, cold, you name it!  This system makes my skin look GREAT - radiant, soft, dewey and youthful-with diminished fine lines, smaller pores and noticably improved even tone! All of the issues I had with my skin prior are finally at bay. The micro-pulsing action cleanses and improves circulation to the face in a way no other method can, bar none.  You&#x27;ll also find yourself saving $ by using less of your chosen essential cleansers (the best are paraben-free: Any by Clarisonic, Derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub and Olay Age defying Renewal Daily Cleanser with Microbeads)and moisturizers (I use an intensive all the time with SPF 30). The key - truly clean skin, free of dead cells, absorbs and retains hydration best.  Be smart and invest in a Clarisonic Pro. If you don&#x27;t believe what you&#x27;re seeing, the added proof will be the compliments you&#x27;ll receive.  Every review I&#x27;ve read on the Clarisonic Pro is 5-stars!  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> My 2nd clarisonic. My 1st one lasted 4 years and well worth it. It cleans my face better than anything. Have not seen an improvemt in brown spots or wrinkles. Just love how clean it gets my face clean.</li>
    <li> I bought the Clarisonic Pro because I have extremely oily skin with some imperfections and dry patches.  I was hoping that this product would remove more dirt and make up than my cleanser alone and help to even out the dry patches. I have used the Clarisonic once a day, everyday for the past 3 weeks.  I&#x27;ve used it with the supplied sample cleansing gel for oily skin as well as my own foaming cleanser. Both are very effective at removing make up and excess oil without drying my skin out.  The Clarisonic also helps to exfoliate my dry areas gently.  It is gentle enough not to irritate any blemishes I get, which seem to be less than before I was using the Clarisonic.  My dry patches have not cleared up completely but they do seem to have improved.</li>
    <li> I love my clarisonic.......one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.  I use it religiously every night and it has made an incredibly visible difference in the appearance of my skin.  My skin is more evenly toned now and the size of the pores has been visibily reduced.  I get a professional facial every six weeks and my aesthetician has even remarked that she has noticed the difference.      I love it so much that I now will order the body brush attachments and use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> After some hesitation but, following rave reviews from friends who have used this product, I bit the bullet and invested in it! I only wish I had done so sooner. I&#x27;m hooked! I have used it twice a day since I bought it and the difference in my skin is definitely noticeable; not just by me but by friends as well. My skin texture is incredibly smooth after using this poduct and I&#x27;ve even noticed an improvement in the appearance of fine lines. I use the gentle cleansing head and set it for the default time setting (one minute). I have to admit, I&#x27;ve been blessed with relatively problem-free skin and, as a result, I&#x27;ve been a bit lax when it comes to 2x a day cleansing; especially before bed. Now, I look forward to cleaning the day away from my face! I am being treated for mild roseacia and my aesthetician felt that the Clarisonic would be a good investment and would probably NOT cause a flair up; she was right! What is even better is that the Clarisonic is such an effective cleansing tool that I probably use about 1/2 of the gentle roseacia cleaner with it; definitely a cost savings. The Clarisonic also makes your skin such a smooth, clean canvas for the application of your make-up, you&#x27;ll find yourself using even less of that; as well as preparing it to absorb sunscreen even more effectively. I can&#x27;t wait for my daughter&#x27;s next visit home so that I can have her test this out; I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll be hooked. I&#x27;d love to purchase one for her, but want her to try it out first. This is truly a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in March of 2011.  My skin feels smoother and I don&#x27;t have the acne breakouts I once did.  In addition, the scars from old acne breakouts are diminishing due to the faster exfoliation of dead skin cells.  When I fist received the product I tried using the Clarisonic face scrubs and the sensitive skin brush head, but didn&#x27;t receive any benefits from using them.  Once I purchased the normal skin brush head and used my regular facial cleanser (AcneFree Sport 3-1) I immediately started seeing results both on my face and back.  This is a wonderful product, but whatever you do, DO NOT ORDER FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN CLARISONIC, or reputable spas!!!!  YOU WILL GET SCREWED!  The product will malfunction and you will not be able to get a warranty replacement from Clarisonic or the online seller.  In fact the only seller WILL NOT respond to any e-mails or phone calls.  I started having problems with mine in Nov. 2011.  a whole 8 months after buying it.</li>
    <li> Terrific invention.  I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct clarifying, smoothing trend.  Upper lip wrinkles have diminished.  This brings  hope to those who are enduring the cruel and relentless aging process.     God, I love science..........     Don&#x27;t mess around.  Buy the pro model.  There&#x27;s a reason it costs more.  It works better.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic reminds me of the brush cleaner that comes with the electrical machines used for facials, only it does not rotate.  Those tend to be a bit softer, and I thought this one would be a little softer than it is, but still ok, just have to watch it around the sensitive areas that tend to become red.  I like it!  Hoping it will be as effective in the long term as my Sonicare toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before purchasing this product and was hoping that it would help me get rid of my acne and blocked pores.  However, not only did this product not help my acne or unblock my pores, it also dried out my face and made it wrinkly.  I had deep lines in my forehead after three weeks of use (day and night) and my face felt extremely tight.  I tried using it with all kinds of cleansers - the three cleansers that came with the product, a tea tree cleanser from Evan Healy, a cleanser from Avon.  After almost a month of use, I finally decided to stop using it and my acne is now starting to heal with benzyl peroxide.  My wrinkles are also fading and my face is not as tight.  I think I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I first purchased a nutrasonic face brush.  It cleans well, and the sonic action works.  It is definitely a good budget option.  However, it only stayed charged for one short use, and then I had to re-charge it.  Many reviewers reported the same battery problem out of the box, or after a few short months.  I returned my nutrasonic and bought a clarisonic.  Despite what all the reviewers say, I found the clarisonic to be a superior product.  The motor seems tighter, and the product seemed better built and more solid.  They both seemed to clean my face equally well, but the clarisonic seems higher quality to me and isn&#x27;t riddled with quality control issues.</li>
    <li> Amei o clrisonic, ele realmente faz oq promete! Chegou antes q eu imaginei, o rastreio do correio dos us n funcionou, nem o daqui do br, mais chegou inteiro, funcionando, gostei muitoooooo! Vale apena, agora eu quero comprar a escovinha de corpo.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical spending so much for a beauty item but am completely hooked on my Clairsonic. I am middle-aged and had bad rosacea on my nose which just flared up last year. I have tried everything to no avail. Go figure: this works! I use it on the gentle setting with Cera-Ve cleanser and noticed results right away. It also works well on my body. I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> I really like this face brush. My face feels so soft afterwards. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the preprogrammed timing.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin which changed from dry to normal and oily in the t-zone after I moved climates.  I bought the Clarisonic one year ago hoping that it would reduce the blackheads, clogged pores, and texture of my skin.  It did just that in addition to stimulating the lymphatic system as opposed to dry brushing which is a little too harsh for my skin.  I&#x27;m in my late twenties and I can&#x27;t comment on how this works on wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have that problem yet.  The battery life on the Clarisonic is also great.  My Regime:  I use the Clarisonic twice a day and I use Yonka skin care products.  I wear MAC make up every day and I use an eye make up remover then wash my face with Yonka cleanser to make sure I get most of the make up off, then I use the Clarisonic with my facial cleanser followed by my moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This product is truly the greatest investment I&#x27;ve made for my skincare. For the cost of around two facials at the spa, I&#x27;m able to get the quality of a facial everyday. After just two weeks my skin was noticeable different - smoother, stronger and less irritated. I have sensitive skin, borderline rosacea, and this system has reduced my redness dramatically. It&#x27;s worth the investment - after all, it is your face!</li>
    <li> I purchased this device, used it for a couple of weeks and then put it at the back of my cabinet as even with the sensitive brush, it seemed a bit much for me &amp; I didn&#x27;t see any benefits on my skin.  Recently I went for a facial and the aesthetician asked if i had one and recommended I use it on my nose and chin only.  I pulled it out from the back of my cabinet. It&#x27;s still like brand new, in box, event the twist is still on the cord. I plugged it in to charge and nothing happened. I switched plugs, still no charge.  Tried again, still no lighting up, no charge. So I reached out to the Customer Service # and after waiting 20 min for a person(I had to call twice because the first time I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; wait after 15 min) , I had a truly disappointing experience. The agent Raphael was like talking to a robot.  I discovered I&#x27;m no longer covered under warranty(less than a year though from warranty) which is a bummer since I barely used the device and it was never submerged in the shower or anything. I asked if this was a common problem, if the battery only had a set lifespan, if there were any solutions that could be offered and they had the same answer for all my questions &amp;#34; I don&#x27;t have that information&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have that detail&amp;#34;...&amp;#34;the only thing I can offer is a 25% off coupon to use on Clarsonic.com.&lt;br /&gt;So I asked, if I barely used this device and it&#x27;s not charging why would I purchase another $150-200 on another one?  And last week the company was offering 15% on it&#x27;s FB page, so I&#x27;m guessing if I hunted around the internet or waited, that I could find a 25% coupon to buy another one, so doesn&#x27;t really seem like that&#x27;s a great offer.&lt;br /&gt;They then had a supervisor call me  today and she had very little additional information to offer.  She said she would report my complaints to the sr team.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get a brush unit, I would look at other manufacturers.</li>
    <li> It works well. I can feel and see a difference after even the first use. I would not recommend using everyday as it will over exfoliate your face. However, I would strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had a bad reaction to something and as a result had a severe breakout on both of my cheeks. My face was red, irritated, itchy and swollen. The doctor prescribed an antibiotic and topical cream for me, but also advised that I invest in a Clarisonic Pro Skincare System. The prescription medications helped, but it wasn&#x27;t until I started using my clarisonic pro that everyone, including myself, noticed an improvement in my skin condition. My breakout gradually began to decrease, the itchiness and irritation stopped, and my skin began to look and feel clearer, smoother and refreshed. I still have marks from the breakout that will take a while to completely fade, but the breakout itself is gone. The clarisonic pro definitely played a big role in helping to improve my condition. I&#x27;m very pleased with it and am happy I took my doctor&#x27;s advice and purchased it. It was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic is something I imagined years ago.  I asked myself,&#x27;why can&#x27;t anyone invent a facial brush to clear all the dead skin from the face?&#x27; Clarisonic does that and beyond.  I don&#x27;t want to sound repetitive from all the other positive feedback from other reviewers.  I do suggest you go to Clarisonic&#x27;s website and do a search on utube.com for Clarisonic.  You will find tons of good videos that will push you over the edge to buy it.  My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear since the last time I dropped [...] bucks for a facial.  I haven&#x27;t had a facial since I bought the Clarisonic. Warning:  watch out for companies that sell this product who will not honor the manufacturer&#x27;s 60 day trial/satisfaction warranty.</li>
    <li> After many recommendations from friends, facialists, and all these amazon reviews...I finally got a Clarisonic Pro.  I have fallen in love like everyone else and use it almost daily.  It sits in my shower and has become a regular part of my routine.  It is waterproof, and the charge lasts for weeks.  I have not been one bit disappointed... and I have very high expectations after all those recommendations!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She LOVES it!  And I love that I made her happy this Christmas. She says her skin feels and looks amazing, and she does not even have to wear makeup foundation anymore!</li>
    <li> this may sound crazy.I do like the clarisonic, but I wonder to myself would I ever have thought to use&lt;br /&gt;a scrub brush on my face? it does make my face feel good, and when I apply my makeup I can feel the difference, But, maybe a light scrub brush would have done the same.&lt;br /&gt;You might feel like I am crazy, I always take care of my teeth, 6 month checkups etc, but I have had 2 crowns fall off in the last month! I was wondering if the motion works them loose? crazy I know but I am kind of getting that feeling.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the improvement in the appearance of my skin after years of continued use.  purchasing the refill creams, however, can get costly, but overall it&#x27;s worth it to me Please let me know if you found this review helpful.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin care tool! The product descriptions tell you of removing more dirt than just washing alone, however, you can see that it does after each use. It also offers a gentle exfoliation. This was delivered to me quickly!</li>
    <li> Spendy, but worth the money!  My skin is smoother and lotions absorb so much better after using the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Great product-- removes traces of makeup even after my former cleansing routine.  Has reduced blackheads and improved my skin--  I am 6o and it seems to help other products absorb into the skin better.</li>
    <li> I already knew what to expect in this purchase. I was a little skeptical about the buyer, but was very, very pleased! So happy I decided to purchase online instead of paying full price from a doctor&#x27;s office or even the department stores!</li>
    <li> The product arrived fairly quick. The only issue I have is, for the price of this one, I would have thought it came with a couple of different brush heads which is not the case. I bought the high end version which only came with 1 brush and 3 sample cleansers.  Dont get sold on the free cleansers, they are small samples and not very good, however the unit works well with any of your favorite cleansers.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product with a couple of caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic appears to have figured out what other manufacturers of similar products missed... the magic lies in good quality, replaceable brushes. On the other hand, Clarisonic made a huge design mistake by hiding mode/status behind audible beeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When switching modes, the handset gives a series of beeps that you, the user, are expected to pay attention to and understand. How hard would it be to provide complementary visual indicators similar to that found on the Philips Sonicare toothbrush? [[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not seem like that big of a deal until you find yourself trying to make sense of which mode you&#x27;re in, and whether that&#x27;s the mode you want. Wait... Was that 1 long beep and 2 shorts, or was it 1 long and 1 short? Or was it...? See what I mean? And what about customers with impaired hearing? For such users this device is a non-starter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, the included instructions err on the side of brevity (e.g., fails to adequately explain the LED charging indicators). The online information at the Clarisonic website does not offer additional depth to help customers get the most out of the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is a fine device, and one that I plan to get great use out of, 0n the practical side it appears that Clarisonic cut some corners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a beauty gadget person... I&#x27;m lucky enough to have pretty good skin, so I don&#x27;t typically do much for a cleansing routine, either.  I&#x27;m also pretty skeptical of the sales pitches that aestheticians give when they&#x27;re giving you treatments.  No, I&#x27;m not buying the special moisturizer; no, I don&#x27;t need a $30 bottle of cucumber toner; no, I don&#x27;t need some sort of vibrating brush that they used during a facial (even though my face felt amazing afterwards).    But two other people in the beauty biz who weren&#x27;t selling anything raved about the Clarisonic brush... and I turned 40, so I decided to up my skincare game.  And as it turns out, I shouldn&#x27;t have doubted!  This really does accomplish what it claims...  my skin has never felt better.  It&#x27;s much softer than normal:  it feels just as soft and smooth as it did after that facial.  Even better, my mild case of rosacea hasn&#x27;t flared up once since I bought this brush, and the fine lines on my forehead seem to be much softer.  I have also gotten more compliments on my skin than I ever have before, and when I mention my age, people are pretty shocked.      I bought the pro version because I wanted to have four speeds and to have the option to use the body brush attachment.  I typically use the default 1-minute setting, but I like the ability to switch things up if my skin needs a little more exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Thanks to my Clarisonic, I can count on a professional facial every day!  I&#x27;ve owned mine for two years and absolutely can say I still love it as much as the first time I experienced this wonderful cleansing product.    I have very dry, delicate skin on my face, and after my esthetician used a Clarisonic at a spa, I knew I really wanted one.  I did a lot of research and determined that the amount of money I was spending on different cleansers each year was more than I&#x27;d spend on this product.      I now use less cleanser, clean my face more delicately more often, and I love the invigorating, yet relaxing feeling I experience each time I use it.  I am often outside and at the barn with my horse, and nothing cleans my face as well and as gently as the Clarisonic.  I occasionally use it in the shower on rough spots (knees &amp; elbows) and love the smoothness I experience afterward.    I consider this product an investment. While the price may be difficult to accept at first, the results will make you glad you bought it!  Enjoy your beautiful, naturally glowing face again!</li>
    <li> I had looked at the Clarisonic Pro for several months and read many reviews.  I have been very pleased with the product.  It holds a charge and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers who said that this product does exactly what it says it will do.  I noticed a difference after the first time I used it!  And in fact, both my sister and bf noticed a difference after one use as well.  The fine lines around my eyes are definitely less noticeable and my skin feels much smoother.  Wish I would have bought one of these 10 years ago!</li>
    <li> It works great, now I&#x27;m addicted and could never live without it. Love how my skin feels after using it!</li>
    <li> Love the product, however, it does not hold a charge well. Also takes a very long time to charge.</li>
    <li> Feels great and indulgent to use. Kind of like a facial massage. My skin is smoother and my moisture products and lotions soak in better. I have found no difference between the Clarisonic cleansers and the other products I&#x27;ve used so I just use what I have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an 8 year old with sensory issues who has a hard time finding things that help calm her. She loves this. She also tends to get into a lot of messes so the fact that her face is cleaner as she heads for puberty is not a bad thing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey but I find that the good quality has not left me fretting about that. It seems very sturdy and being able to use it in the shower is a plus.  Price on Amazon was much better than any of the local shops and certainly better than the Aesthetica shop where I had a professional dermabrasion (they only sell and use this scrubber). Scrubbing Heads last a long time. Very pleasing and quality product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the Clarisonic Pro.  I&#x27;m very picky about my skin.  I use pharmacy grade products (Obagi) and it is true the cleaning is amazing.  My skin is not only cleaner and softer, but it absorbs the product better.  In the end it costs less for great skin.  Obagi is expensive and is one, actually the only treat I give myself.  Yes, I really am picky about my skin.  I&#x27;ve told several of my close friends about the Clarisonic Pro and they too love it.    As a note, I had a fabulous facial by Nordstrom&#x27;s beauty bar and she used the Clarisonic Pro on me.  She uses it on almost all of her clients.  The estitision at Nordstrom knows her stuff and to book an appointment it&#x27;s at least three months out.  Yes, that good.</li>
    <li> I  purchased this unit after seeing the results from my facial. It has given me immediate Results.  My breakouts are non existent, my-skin glows with even skin tone and texture.  I wish I had invested in this unit earlier.&lt;br /&gt;I use the body brush on my knees and elbows for smoother even toned skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got my fiancé curious about using it.</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic.  After using it, my skin glows, I get fewer breakouts and I know my skin is clean.&lt;br /&gt;I realize there are now many more skin care brushes available that cost considerably less, but as long as my Clarisonic is working I am going to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Overall, I LOVE my Clarisonic.  My skin has never looked better.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the longevity of the unit.  I purchased my first Clarisonic in May 2010.  By November 2011, it was acting up; the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; comes with a body brush mode and even though I had the face brush on it, it was in body brush mode and wouldn&#x27;t come out.  I called Clarisonic customer service and, they determined that my unit needed to be replaced.  They shipped a new one out to me at no charge!  When I got it in the mail, I went to the Clarisonic website and promptly registered it.  Jump forward to November 2012, I took it on vacation with me and by the time I got to my hotel room, the unit had no charge.  The literature states it should hold a charge for at least 4 days.  So, when I got home, I fully charged it and then took it off the charger and 8 hours later, it was dead.  Since it usually sits in the charger, I didn&#x27;t call Clarisonic at that point.  This week (January 2013), it went into body brush mode! I called Clarisonic and they are sending me another one!  A friend of mine who also has a Pro had hers go into body brush mode after about 17 months and Clarisonic sent her a new one.  So on average, they seem to last about 14 months.  Thankfully, Clarisonic has a 3-year warranty on these things and are willing to replace them with not too many questions.  I guess it is better that it dies in 14-17 months versus dying after the warranty is up.  These units aren&#x27;t cheap - even after the issues I&#x27;ve had, I think they are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in 2010.  It suddenly quit taking a charge recently and I contacted Clarisonic about repair.  They informed me that I had a counterfeit product b/c it didn&#x27;t have a number on the handle of the unit and that they could not repair it.  The Clarisonic Pro version is only available according to Clarisonic by an authorized spa and is not available online, even through the Clarisonic website.  So buyer beware!  Mine worked for 2 years and suddenly quit without warning.  I am contacting Amazon directly to see if I can get a refund.  They should not be selling products that are not authorized by the manufacturer if they are sold as new.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and the Clarisonic has made a  big difference for my complexion. I no longer have patches of dry skin or flaking by the evening--as this product gently exfoliates and deep cleans every time you use it. You can use any facewash with the Clarisonic, which is nice (the mini&#x27;s that come with it are great for travel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for sure whether a less expensive \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; of the Clarisonic wouldn&#x27;t work as well, as I&#x27;ve only used this one. But, I can say that I do use all the different settings this model has...and to me, the charging base makes it worth the money because it looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter. Think of it as an investment!</li>
    <li> I love love love my Clarisonic skin care system, it is such a wonderful product as it stimulates my skin so it is ready to receive the moisturizers or chemical peels I&#x27;m about to use.  It&#x27;s a great gift too.</li>
    <li> I love this product! MIne just stopped working after approx 5 yrs of continuous use. I&#x27;m trying desperately to recharge it before resigning myself to the fact that I have to buy another. I have middle-aged, oily, acne prone skin &amp; nothing compares to this for cleaning it. It really makes a difference in smoothness &amp; exfoliation. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> What I thought was a authorized dealer since it it came from AMAZON is not.  I purchase the Pro  and it lasted less than 2 years and was to have a 3 year warranty that neither Clarisonic or Payless Beauty will honor because Payless is not an authorized dealer.  So I&#x27;m out the $166, the product and all the brushes I purchased.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I am also glad I shopped around and got the best price for this on Amazon.  Although ($180+) was still out of my comfort zone, it was much better than $220 and up at other retailers.  Buying replacement brush heads every few months is annoying but feeling of deep cleaning Clarisonic provides is worth it!</li>
    <li> Clarisonic Pro Professional gives me the cleanest skin imaginable. It feels wonderful and works well with regular cleaners, just not scrubs.  This isn&#x27;t just a brush that rubs across your skin, the brushes go deep to clean your pores. It&#x27;s an amazing feeling and my skin is so soft afterwards. It would be a five star product but I had issues with the battery not recharging after only six month of use. I was still under warranty and the company quickly replaced but the second also had a bad battery. The third replacement was the charm but I don&#x27;t think that should have happened in the first place. I hope the newer models have  sticker quality control in place.</li>
    <li> The benefits of this product can be seen immediately.  You will experience softer, smoother skin after the first use and your face will really look and feel squeaky clean.  My pimples don&#x27;t last as long (sometimes disappear in less than 24 hours which never happened before), and my expensive skin care products are more effective.  The real reason for the purchase was a bunch of blackheads on my chin and they are diminishing in quantity.  Also they are more brown now than black which I could see after using a Biore strip.  Hopefully they will eventually disappear.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This item stopped working less than 2 years from date of purchase. The warranty on the item is for 3 years but Clarisonic will not honor the warranty when purchased through Amazon. This information is not presented with the item on the website.</li>
    <li> Sephora wanted $225 for the 3 Speed Model and so does the Clarisonic website? Since I was able to get this at a discount from Payless thru Amazon the Clarisonic warranty is null and void.  That is taking a lotta risk, but it was worth it to me to get the discount.  It is Heavier than the Mia 2, naturally. The 4th speed cuts out quickly and makes a loud sound:(  I got this because i wanna use it in the shower for my body.  I thought it was gonna come with a body brush head, but it doesn&#x27;t:(  It came with a sensitive brush, but I ordered a pack of (3) deep pore cleansing brushes from EZ4 Shoppings at $49.88, which is $16.63 each.  The unit came partially charged, so I was pleased to be able to do Luis, my husband&#x27;s face, but I had to plug it in overnight to do my face.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for great skin care. My face feels so clean &amp; firm. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I expected higher quality than some cheap versions. I was wrong, it didn&#x27;t last long. After a year of use it stopped charging.</li>
    <li> Had for over 5 years and works brilliantly. I really notice it when I dont; use it. I have oily, flakey, sensitive skin and this helps with build up of skin cells without being to agressive on my sensitive skin. Everyone should own one!</li>
    <li> Buyers Beware that Payless is not an authorized dealer. Mine broke before the two years warranty from Clarisonic expired, but since they are not an authorized dealer you cannot get a replacement from Clairsonic. I used it maybe 20 times during the less than two years I owed it so not a reliable product.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and as advertised. The charger is a little large for travel, but charge lasts several days at least.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend fully. Buy the extra heads while you are at it, the replacements at local malls are more expensive.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it! Perfect tool for problem skin, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it before. It works with every cleanser (I even use it with face scrub for gentle exfoliation). Easy to charge and it lasts for a long time. Nothing cleans my skin better. It also makes my skin absorb creams and lotions better after the wash. The cons is the price. The professional series are expensive, but Clarisonic also not so long ago added Mia which is more affordable alternative. My friends love theirs. I love mine and highly recommend it for every woman.</li>
    <li> I read quite a few reviews on this specific Clarisonic and was sure this product was good... and it is, aside from a few hiccups. Firstly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge for very long and I am always concerned that I will overcharge it by accident since i&#x27;m constantly having to put in back on the charger, ugh. Secondly, after about 4 months when pushing the button to start a cycle it turned on but did not actually &amp;#34;Oscillating back and forth at a sonic frequency of more than 300 movements per second&amp;#34; as it claims. It would simply make a strange electronic sound but not oscillate. I have to turn it off and on again to get it to work properly. Other than that, the product is good. Cleans my skin effectively, only okay at removing makeup and removes dead skin. I noticed with regular use, less breakouts (pimples and blackheads). iI&#x27;d purchase another one when/if this dies.... hopefully not anytime soon -_-</li>
    <li> I bought this items years ago on amazon. This is a great item, works as described, and when it broke Clarisonic did honor the warranty and gave me a replacement unit. The warranty period is longer than most products like this so it&#x27;s worth the extra money. Very satisfied!!! The replacement unit is still working great. It definitely exfoliates the face... the more gentle brushes seem to keep my face from breaking out. Strangely enough the acne brush is too harsh and breaks out my face the most. The key is finding the right brush for your face before judging the effectiveness of this product.</li>
    <li> it feels great on my skin. gives me a glow. never harsh just good and clean. i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> What a great product , They should give one of each head type or or choice of one or two ,&lt;br /&gt; Dont think you/I needed the buy the 4 speed , Should have spent less and got the regular one . ................. The change in my complexion  has been amazing ,Its a must for  anyone with oily skin .This will put a end to it !!!!!!!!!!!!Try the deep pore brush .</li>
    <li> Functioned well, but expensive considering it died exactly when the warranty expired. Possibly the batteries, can they be replaced? Don&#x27;t know, we tried many times to talk with a representative only to hear that they are all busy helping other customers. Tried morning and night for a week with no success. Poor customer service for a $180 brush.</li>
    <li> Great Product, works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a couple of years ago.  Love love love it! Great for your skin. I bought one for my son at his dermatologist but it cost a lot more than the one I ordered from Amazon.com. They were exactly the same item. Great price, great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my wife for her birthday, and she loves it, its like havine a facial every day right in the convience of your own home.</li>
