<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil is wonderful. The smell is amazing and works well for many things. Especially headaches.</li>
    <li> Love. Lasts very long</li>
    <li> This item met my expections.</li>
    <li> Having tried a lot of essential oils I have to say this Peppermint oil is really nice.  It mixes well with other oils and adds a nice component to mixtures.  Very good service as I received several orders from Plant Therapy quickly which was also good.</li>
    <li> Great oil and a decent quantity for the price.  Nice that it is organic which means that it is food grade.  Very powerful and pepperminty as it should be.</li>
    <li> great  - works as suggested</li>
    <li> smells like fish oil mixed with it. yuck.</li>
    <li> Excellent healing oil! Helps tremendously with hot flashes!</li>
    <li> Love using this peppermint oil! Works extremely well for non-migraine headaches and stuffy noses! Recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I work in a daycare and I diffuse this every day to make my classroom not smell like dirty diapers. It works.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 84 year old mother.  She uses it everyday in her morning tea.  Helps to give her more pep for her day.</li>
    <li> Fantastic peppermint! I noticed the vibrant fragrance the second I opened the bottle, much more than with any other peppermint.  Stronger and more pleasant.  Definitely my favorite.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! Peppermint is a tried &amp; true favorite EO. Just a few drops in my homemade sugar scrubs make them smell so yummy! This one is organic which means I Love it!</li>
    <li> This Organic Peppermint Essential Oil is exactly what I wanted for the Do It Yourself  mouthwash.  Super fast delivery and quality product.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it! One drop in my diffuser on the intermittent setting will last the day and make the house smell amazing.  Plus it seems to help with my headaches, which was my original hope when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I always look to Plant Therapy for my peppermint oil. The first one I ever ordered was the smallest size. The second one I ordered was the same, but the dropper didn&#x27;t work very well and it was frustrating. I saw that others had made the same comment. I finally finished that bottle and decided to order the 30 ml size, and it&#x27;s just perrr-fect.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one of these who feel that the only Essential Oil companies to order from happen to be one of the MLM names. I think those are fine, and I have, and WILL order from them here and there, also. But, when you find a company who offers products as good or even better, and for a far better price, plus great customer service, well, you just have to scratch your head and say it&#x27;s a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;The Peppermint oil is the only EO that I&#x27;ve ordered so far, but will likely try others from them as well.</li>
    <li> this is a very good quality oil. would recomend to anyone that likes working with essential oils! dont know what else to tell you</li>
    <li> I put a few drops in a spray bottle of water and spray around windows and doorways to keep the bugs away.  I use it when we sit outside and it seems to work.  It is supposed to keep mice away too. The bottle is larger then most essential oils that you get.  It should last awhile. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the quality of this oil. I did a side by side comparison with Young Living&#x27;s peppermint oil that I happened to have on hand and could not tell a difference in aroma or taste. Peppermint oil is one of my favorite oils, I use it almost every day. It smells great in a diffuser, a drop under the tongue for heartburn (works almost instantly), and when my kids have coughs I put a few drops on their feet at night (usually takes 5-10 min to calm their coughs). For my baby and toddler I put socks on afterward to keep them from touching their feet and possibly rubbing it in their eyes. If you happen to get it in your eyes or anywhere else you don&#x27;t want, just use anothe oil to rub it out like olive oil or vegetable oil. I have also used Plant Therapy&#x27;s lemongrass oil and was very impressed with the quality of it as well.</li>
    <li> Going on suggestions from pop up portal I purchased this and soaked 6 - 8 cotton balls with this oil.  Placed it in any area where I felt the mice could penetrate the pop up and it kept the pop up free from rodents from November - March.</li>
    <li> I received this very fast and was happy with the large size of the bottle. I already added it to water to spray around my windows and floors and the ants were not there this morning! Plus diffusing this aroma is very soothing while I sleep and I don&#x27;t wake up stuffy and congested.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing a television program on Natural Solutions for pests.  I put it on cotton balls as instructed and put&lt;br /&gt;where the mice come in.  So Far, So Good.  We will see when weather gets colder, if it really works.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works great for aromatherapy.  Very high quality</li>
    <li> I have used two other peppermint essential oils, one was very good but the other one seemed adulterated with some other essential oil. Warily, I bought Plant Therapy&#x27;s Organic Peppermint Essential Oil. It has proven to be strong and have a full, well rounded scent of peppermint (unlike one of my other oils). I feel the quality rivals the first oil I had, which was way more expensive. To me, this is a high quality oil for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To stave off a migraine or sinus headache, I dilute it about 1:3 with a carrier oil and rub my forehead, temples and base of skull....sometimes I even put it on the back of my head for sinus headache and it helps the sinuses to drain. I make my own &amp;#34;anti-itch&amp;#34; cream by mixing Cetaphil, Noxema, jojoba oil and peppermint. It works just as well as Gold Bond anti-itch cream for me and it&#x27;s sooo much cheaper! I also use it in my homemade toothpaste made from clay, xylitol, coconut oil, nutmeg essential oil and peppermint essential oil. I use it for a &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34; if I&#x27;m feeling a little weak and hungry but can&#x27;t eat yet...such as in church or out shopping...just a tiny bit on my finger and dap it under my nose. I keep a roller bottle of diluted peppermint oil in my purse for just such occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, there are too many uses of this wonderful oil to mention! I even read that using peppermint oil will turn a breech baby into proper position. How I wish I&#x27;d have known that 8 months ago when we discovered during my daughter&#x27;s labor that her baby was breech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re acquainted with quality peppermint essential oil, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed with this oil.</li>
    <li> This organic peppermint oil smells amazing. Very high quality. A little goes a long way. So far I have used the peppermint oil in my homemade toothpaste and to make junior mints. Both came out awesome! I am very happy with this product and will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Nice strong peppermint.  I use this in my essential oil blends for muscle pain.  I have also used this in my homemade toothpaste, tastes great</li>
    <li> I use peppermint oil for headaches.  It even works great when I have a migraine.</li>
    <li> use this essential oil when teaching yoga...relieves tension...also use it personally to relieve headaches...place 2 - 3 drops on palm...rub palms together, 3 inhales, take palms to the back of the neck, forehead and temples (avoiding getting too close to the eyes...as it will make the eyes water)...great alternative to meds</li>
    <li> It is useable but not the best I have ever used. I decided to try it because it was a better price than the peppermint essential oil I usually use.  I would describe the smell of it as cheap peppermint schnapps. There is a strong alcohol odor to it . The bad smell over-powers the good peppermint smell. I will not order it again.</li>
    <li> Product met my expectations. Very pleased! Only improvement would be if it came with an eyedropper, but I was able to order those from the company, and they fit the threads on the bottle perfectly!</li>
    <li> I use this in homemade toothpaste and it is absolutely delicious. I also use it in lotions if I want a cooling effect. Great product. would recommend.</li>
    <li> Quality peppermint oil for diffusing or ingesting.  Nice large size and very reasonable in price..which is wonderful…also good for congestion to breath in.</li>
    <li> I use this organic peppermint in a spray bottle with water and spray around my doors and on the patio area three--four times a week to keep spiders and mosquitoes away.  Smells great and insects hate it!</li>
    <li> I use to be a member of young living and these oils are every bit as potent and pure as their&#x27;s. With Plant Therapy oils you pay less AND get more. I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Received all my oils ordered but have not use them yet.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil is great for so many things...it helps with allergies, bugs, fatigue...the list goes on. I dilute it with water and lavender and spray it anywhere bugs like to gather, which also clears up the allergens in the air! This bottle has lasted me quite a while considering how much I use it for on a daily basis. I keep it in my purse at all times.</li>
    <li> Decent oil.  I dont know the difference between this and the super priced ones but they seem to smell just fine to me.</li>
    <li> Love these oils. They are perfect for making potpourri.  I love to make different fragrances&lt;br /&gt;to place around the house.  I usually make a large bowl full, and putting this in a large&lt;br /&gt;2 gallon zip lock bag.  When friends come by and ask for some, I tell them to help&lt;br /&gt;theirselves.&lt;br /&gt;You can make the potpourri from flowers that have dried. (Dead head all of the&lt;br /&gt;flowers and save them). Dried Cerpe Myrtle berries add a different dimension.&lt;br /&gt;Tossing all of these together make a very attractive bowl of potpourri.&lt;br /&gt;Have fun!  and thanks.</li>
    <li> Very clean, fresh and invigorating!  I use this in my Deneve River Rock oil diffuser and need only a few drops for the aroma to fill the room.  Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> My husband loves peppermint in his baths. This is a wonderful essential oil, with a great peppermint smell. What a great value compared to so many other essential oils, and being organic, you cannot beat this.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy peppermint essential oil does not disappoint! The smell is pure, clean peppermint. I&#x27;ll be using this oil in personal care items, as well as in a spray bottle to keep spiders away! It smells snd works great!</li>
    <li> I love your peppermint oil. I&#x27; ve used it to help lift my mood just by inhaling straight from the bottle or putting a dap of oil on my wrist. I&#x27; ve used a drop or two in my tea or water to sooth my stomach.</li>
    <li> Great for scenting room air, non-diluted. But dilute with a base oil or lotion for any skin application, or water for a spray. High quality, good price.</li>
    <li> I cant compere to anything, but this oil smells like I thought it would be. Works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this and only used it one time,  it came at the time it was expected.</li>
    <li> We use peppermint oil soaked cotton balls to repel rodents. This product is a good buy when you need a lot of oil.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time and safely. I was excited to get organic peppermint oil for a great price!  I used it as mouth drops,  great for fresh breath and helps with digestive issues!</li>
    <li> Peppermint is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; oil for almost everything!  I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the Organic Peppermint Essential Oil.  Good size, packed VERY well, arrived promptly.  Will definitely order again from Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> This 30 ml bottle is a great price.  The mint scent is not as strong as some of the others I&#x27;ve used, but you can afford to use more and get the same outcome.  I use peppermint a lot for diffusers, headaches, keep critters away, perk-up when drowsy, etc.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I read on Pinterest (my first clue) that Peppermint Oil stops ants. They just don&#x27;t like the scent. So I bought this awesome stuff, diluted it with water, cleaned my little heart out and scrubbed down my counters and sink (the apparent point of entry) with the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t stop the ants. They seemed unaffected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my kitchen smelled delightful! Product arrived on time and was as advertised. Very happy! Five stars for the peppermint oil! One star for following Pinterest advice.</li>
    <li> Great price for organic peppermint oil.  I love Plant Therapy&#x27;s oils.  Unfortunately my body does not like this peppermint oil, I got a bad rash when I did a skin test with it, even with it properly diluted.  Hoping I can still find a use for it.  I seem to be sensative to peppermint oil.</li>
    <li> I got this product and thought at first that it had frozen due to sitting on the front step for a couple of hours.  However, it wasn&#x27;t below freezing outside, not even within a few degrees.  The product sat on the counter overnight and still had crystals in it.  I have had it sitting at room temp now for a few days and it is still just as crystallized.  It is basically unusable for the purpose intended.  I ordered 2 bottles and they are both being returned today.  Won&#x27;t be ordering from them again.  Just going to stick with Bramble Berry, where I usually get all of my essential oils.  Cheaper and better quality.</li>
    <li> Product is organic, smells great and the price was very reasonable compared to other essential oil dealers. Recommended product to those that love peppermint.</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil is high quality and really works very well. So far we have tried it to relieve headaches.</li>
    <li> Happy to use this and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it. Great deal! Will keep buying for sure. It was helpful in keeping bugs away.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Perfect for digestive issues and/or maintaining digestive health. I recommend putting one drop (no more) into a cup of your favorite tea. Add honey to cut the bitterness. I use chai or ginger tea.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, strong peppermint scent! This is the 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve ordered. It is great for a aroma therapy spray (mix with eucalyptus oil &amp; distilled water) &amp;, being organic, can be mixed with other oils (like baby oil) &amp; used on the skin. I also smell it directly from the bottle for a mental pick-me-up or to open my sinuses. I&#x27;ve tried other brands that did not smell right to me. I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> highest quality and affordable</li>
    <li> My baby sister has a really bad cough at night so I bought her this ! Worked great! She slept through the night perfectly !</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this oil! I use it to prevent spider bites and in toothpastes. It has a pleasant scent and the price was reasonable!</li>
    <li> Enjoying it.  Adding some to ice water on a hot day... mmmm!</li>
    <li> My favorite go to oil for migraines, sinus pressure, muscle aches or just for a little pick me up! I absolutely love this organic peppermint!</li>
    <li> Very clear and potent scent.  I have applied the peppermint oil mostly for sinus headaches, and it is amazing.</li>
    <li> Use this almost every day, either to ease sore muscles or just to clear my sinuses.  I love the smell and use it my hot oil diffuser almost daily.  I did a test for purity, which is to put some on a white piece of paper, let it dissipate and see if there is any discoloration, there was none.  I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and price.</li>
    <li> Was told oil of peppermint would keep spiders away.  Has not helped with keeping them off my front porch and I&#x27;ve used the whole  bottle and spiders are still building webs :(</li>
    <li> I had a stomach virus and thought the doctor would tell me to take some prescription medicine.  She told me to try some peppermint oil.  I couldn&#x27;t find organic peppermint oil from my usual online sources and was really happy when I found this.  Wonderful travel medicine and you don&#x27;t need more than a few drops to soothe your tummy troubles.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I can&#x27;t believe the price for such a great quality product!  This one is &amp;#34;mentha arvensis&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;mentha piperita&amp;#34;....both ARE Peppermint but the plant it is from is different.  Therefore, Arvensis is a little more cool smelling and piperita is a little sweeter smelling.  This peppermint smells amazing!  I am a licensed massage therapist and use it for my practice....my clients love it!  I will definitely be ordering other Plant Therapy Essential Oils!</li>
    <li> It is a STRONG peppermint oil and that is what I wanted. I mix it with alcohol and spray it in spider prone areas and they do not like it. It seems to be working very well. I did not have a &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; so I am winging it. I make sure it seems strong to me and so far the spiders agree.</li>
    <li> Loved the peppermint.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil it smells great and pure.  A few drops last for almost a week before it starts to dissipate.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Every morning I get up and dab a drop of peppermint oil under my nose. It clears my breathing and just gives me that pick me up.</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil is simply amazing. For a little pick me put a drop  underneath your nose and breathe. It will refreshing your mind and clear your bronchial tubes. To spice up your water add one or two drops. If you have sore achy muscles you can add a drop two on your finger tip and rub in for a relief. For headache relief simply put a drop or two on your fingertips and rub into the affected area and within minutes your headache will disappear. Excellent product excellent quality excellent service thank you</li>
    <li> For some reason this is the only company who doesn&#x27;t sell the peppermint oil, latin name, &amp;#34;mentha piperita.&amp;#34;  It did NOT help me with my headaches or migraines.  This one is, &amp;#34;Mentha arvensis,&amp;#34; and I have no idea what part of the plant it comes from or if it is from a peppermint source, but it did nothing to help me with headaches.  At the health food stores all of their brands of peppermint oil are mentha piperita so I figured this one would be too.  Never, ever would I have thought there would be a difference in effectiveness of peppermint oil.  I&#x27;m saving it to put on weeds next spring but was really disappointed it didn&#x27;t help me in my time of need.</li>
    <li> I basically made this into a Peppermint sprayer / cologne, mixed with vodka and also with baking-soda for tooth paste, this is way cool!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful price and exceptional product. Crisp clean and fresh peppermint oil!</li>
    <li> Great product, very strong. Built-in dropper is a little clumsy but works with no issues.</li>
    <li> It seems fine for use internally - though I haven&#x27;t used it enough to report benefits, but I don&#x27;t like using it topically - it actually makes me really cold and chilly and I have not had that issue with other peppermint EOs.  I am still grateful to have this and will continue to buy for internal purposes; there are so few brands that are organic and truly pure. Aromatherapy grade by law is permitted to say &amp;#34;100% pure&amp;#34; while still using solvents and additives.</li>
    <li> Love trying more natural remedies over meds</li>
    <li> Love this Peppermint.</li>
    <li> Fabulous scalp oil for a do it yourself massage before you was your hair. You may want to dilute the concentrated strength with 1/4 cup water and few drops of peppermint oil. Leaves scalp refreshed!!</li>
    <li> I really like putting a few drops of this along with some glycerin in my bath at night.  It is very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I needed peppermint oil for...squirrels.  Yup they moved into my ceiling and Google told me to soak cotton balls in peppermint oil and toss them up there.  Worked like a charm &amp; between a talk radio up there 24/7 and the peppermint oil the critters vacated almost immediately!  My daughter took the bottle and is making homemade sugar scrub and uses the peppermint oil - I got the first batch &amp; I love it!  Very useful product from homemade bath products...to squirrels!</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil may even be better than YL.  It&#x27;s cooling effect seems to last longer than YL peppermint.  And has a great peppermint scent.</li>
    <li> cant complain getting that much organic essential oil for that price! i used it in my garden, diluted, to control some bug issues and it worked great!</li>
    <li> I use this as an insect repellant for the home.  It leaves the home smelling of peppermint</li>
    <li> Top quality essential oil (smells DELICIOUS) for a great price. I usually order directly from Plant Therapy (they are a great company and I trust them, and they throw some great sales) but I just needed to order enough through Amazon to get free shipping. I think I shall go diffuse some peppermint oil now.</li>
    <li> This item came just as I expected. It was wrapped up snugly in bubble wrap and a cushioned green envelope, and it arrived much earlier than I originally expected, which was a nice bonus! It&#x27;s VERY fragrant, and I take that as a good sign because it means it isn&#x27;t weak or diluted. I mixed it in with some castille soap and jojoba oil for a nice, morning face wash, and it seems to be doing the trick so far!</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil really clears the sinuses. I am currently using it as part of my homemade all-natural toothpaste. I plan on buying other products for homemade natural cleaners, etc.</li>
    <li> This oil has a funny smell when it is put in a vaporizer.  I use peppermint oil in my basement to deter spiders and I&#x27;m very familiar with its scent.  This was a new brand I was trying and the smell was not desired.</li>
    <li> The smell heavenly is pure peppermint. I prefer to only use organic oils if I am going to take an oil by mouth. I take two drops of this oil in a half glass of water when I have indigestion and get instant relief. I also use it to make mint chocolate brownies.</li>
    <li> This is organic therapeutic grade, and it is great. I love the smell and the power it has, you don&#x27;t need to hesitate before ordering, it&#x27;s a perfect batch.</li>
    <li> Great product. Using for homemade toothpaste. Put a drop in bottle of water, refreshing.. Smells ooooh so gooood.</li>
    <li> Very good peppermint oil. Great price.</li>
    <li> great smell. Works good for what I need.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, protected in bubble wrap.  Mixed it with water and sprayed our houseboat railings and under the deck awnings.  No spiders for the past week!  Will probably have to re-spray after we get a heavy rain, but that&#x27;s a lot better than the twice a day broom sweeping we did before.</li>
    <li> Lovely potent peppermint!  One of my favorite over all oils.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like a good peppermint oil to take down swelling and alleviate stiff, hurting muscles.  I have had a knee issue that may be calcium deposits breaking up or it may be gout.  In any case, the peppermint oil is what brings relief and promotes healing since it brings a blood supply to the area.  And it smells great too :-)</li>
    <li> very good pure oil.  love it!</li>
    <li> Addicting fragrance.  Not sure if it really helps, but it eases my daughter&#x27;s mind when her tummy is hurting!</li>
    <li> Definitely helps with headaches.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and was as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like peppermint as a stress reliever. I just rub it behind my neck and on my temples and I put a dab on my tongue and in my nostrils. It does wonders for me but the feeling doesn&#x27;t last so I purchased an oil diffuser so I can do both. I love natural remedies for stress relief. Glad I found out about the benefits of this oil. I love it for so many other uses . Just google it and you will see all it&#x27;s uses. This brand is great.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this on her temples when she gets a bad headache.  And she says it makes the pain go away.</li>
    <li> I use one drop of this on my toothbrush now for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works better for my teeth than everything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve used Good Gums, I&#x27;ve used Baking Soda, I&#x27;ve used various &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes, including ones that had essential oils in them. Now I&#x27;m finally just using the straight stuff, and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my teeth clean without being abrasive, unnatural, or anything bad at all. Efficient, easy, and naturally antibacterial. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh all day after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll need to update my past articles and radio show episode that talks about dental care with this excellent revelation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Raederle</li>
    <li> I use this EO in several ways: in my essential oil aromatherapy diffuser and absolutely love the peppermint smell.  It makes my house smell nice but I have to make sure to only use about 5 drops otherwise the scent can be overpowering.  I also make a peppermint oil/sugar foot scrub.  It makes your feet feel very refreshed!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love the smell for headaches on my temples (mix in oil)</li>
    <li> This peppermint is great.  I add it to my sinus blend to help with my sinus headaches.  Love Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I bought this product because I had read that spiders hate the scent of peppermint and that I could make an \\&quot;at home repellant\\&quot; with essential oils! I picked this one because it was organic (important to me if I&#x27;m going to be spraying it around my home as I have a baby and a toddler) and also because it was one of the largest amounts for a very good price! I am very happy with this purchase! And for those who care...it really does work! 40 drops into a half cup of water in a spray bottle and viola! Spray around windows, doors and cracks!</li>
    <li> I use this for my migraines and it works wonders! Plus you smell great and at a great price :)</li>
    <li> not as good as the regular peppermint though......</li>
    <li> A good essential oil.....bought twice and I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Love essential oils and have become a huge fan of Plant Therapy oils. In addition, I appreciate that they offer organic. Hands-down, I consistently find their oils to be superior to the other brands that I have used in the past. And, you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s pricing and free shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  I dab it behind my ears for a quick pick me up and add it to my vinegar and water solution cleaner to lessen the smell of vinegar.</li>
    <li> Perfect and I expected a much smaller bottle but what a great value. Thank you for a great bargain and prompt attention!!!</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil smells very bad. I&#x27;ve used other oils that smell good, like a peppermint candy, but this oil just stinks. But I use it when I have aches and pains, and it does a good job of relieving the aches. It just doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
    <li> Great price, exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I may be using this in a unique way from the usual uses, but it is working so far in keeping mice out of my car!  I live in a wooded area, so there are a lot of mice that run around looking for places to nest.  My car&#x27;s engine is not a cool place!  I was told about peppermint oil keeping them away from garages, so I thought I would try it in my car.  So far, it is working.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with spiders in my house mixed a few drops with water sprayed it around base boards no more spiders or even any kind of bugs.  My sister sprayed some on her dog and it killed the fleas and it smells good.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Does not drip out..very frustrating.  Had to take the little white thing out.  It is too bad because I do like the product, but, I don&#x27;t like the hassel.</li>
    <li> My wife hates the smell</li>
    <li> I was previously using another brand, but Plant Therapy&#x27;s organic peppermint oil is stronger.  It makes the whole place smell lovely.  This is the brand I will purchase from now on.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Delivered on time!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality; five stars!</li>
    <li> I usually use Young Living Oils, but get tired of the prices. An online review encouraged me to purchase this brand of oil. I was hopeful, but was saddened; the peppermint oil wasn&#x27;t at all what I was used to or had hoped for. It had a bad &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; flavor/smell,, I guess I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy&#x27;s Oranic Peppermint Esential Oil is an excellent product.  The disounted price was appreciated.  I would be happy to do business with Plant Therapy again.</li>
    <li> excellent product worked for my sons headaches.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, but it did not flip my breech baby.  If it had worked in that regard, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars and call an neighbor.</li>
    <li> took too long to arrive and smaller than advertised but it serves it purpose.</li>
    <li> The bottle was larger than I expected which I was happy about. I use the oil for headaches and the product is excellent quality and works well.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet. But I bought because I read This will  help keep spiders away. Hopefully it works. I hate spiders.</li>
    <li> Potent peppermint fragrance, very nice.  I purchased it before I had surgery to sniff afterward for nausea, and it worked great.  I recommend this essential oil.</li>
    <li> Great for headache pain.</li>
    <li> A wonderfu healing oil.  I enjoy it a lot.</li>
    <li> Very high quality and much cheaper than other brands.  I use this for ants, out on the golf course diluted with water for Knats!  Love it because it is natural and will not harm you.</li>
    <li> All I know is that I had a splitting headache with sinus infection setting in and I smeared my temples, neck, and cheeks with this oil and it pretty much cleared up that day. I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase and the delivery time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this is. It claims it is mentha arvensis, or the stronger Japanese peppermint. It makes my eyes water when using it on my sinuses &amp; forehead but it does not solidify when refrigerated like true Mentha arvensis. Also, there is little to no taste when put into my homemade ice cream. Also, why does it say it is Mentha piperita on the site and then say it is Mentha arvensis on the bottle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least it is much better than the Rocky Mountain peppermint oil which is not the real anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer New Directions oils overall. They seem the most reliable in quality and competitive in pricing.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like peppermint. Can&#x27;t wait to try it in my soap recipes.</li>
    <li> great product would order again</li>
    <li> Fabulous smell. I used it to make bathroom cleaner. It&#x27;s potent and smells soooo fresh and yummy. I definitely recommend this if you are looking for a quality mint scent- you&#x27;ll want to eat it.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil has so many uses, but I use this in an essential oil mix and rub on my scalp to control itching and to help stimulate hair growth.  The smell is strong, but as suggested, mix with other oils like jojoba, almond or olive oil.  You can also add other &#x27;growth&#x27; stimulating oils (such as rosemary, lavender, castor) to create your own growth mix.</li>
    <li> I am totally happy with this product and the speed it was sent to me.  I have already recommended it to some of&lt;br /&gt;My friends.</li>
    <li> i love the way it makes my hair smell and the awesome tingle. so glad i purchased this product!</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil is lovely! I use it to make my own toothpaste and soaps and as aromatherapy for myself and for my kids. The smell is very strong and it can be combined with a neutral oil (olive, coconut, almond) to spread on the body. Just a few drops contain a very strong scent.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> This peppermint essential oil is really a good grade and priced well. I am very pleased with its purity and consistency. This is my second order, and it won&#x27;t be my last. I incorpoorate it in my skincare routine as well as in other medicinal use such as relieving seasonal allergies and stress relief.</li>
    <li> We had been puchasing from one manufacturer for several years but need some ASAP and they were a couple days out.  I was worried when we ordered but it is a good quality oil.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I got turned on to essential oil therapy or aromatherapy by reading an article on Dr. Mercola&#x27;s website. The article I was reading lists the uses for different oils and says that peppermint oil is helpful with: , stress, depressed mood, pain, memory, and attention. So I figured ah whatever I&#x27;ll give it a try. I got some oil, put it in a burner, lit a candle under it and sat back. To my surprise I actually did feel more attentive and at ease.It is funny how I neglect my sense of smell and think ah it is just a smell it doesn&#x27;t matter. But when I burn peppermint oil in a diffuser and inhale it, I feel better. I love the smell of peppermint oil. I just need to remember to do it on a regular basis. Another heavy hitter according to the article is lavender oil. I have yet to try this.    Bonus: Peppermint oil just helped a lot with the itching from a mosquito bite. The itching is practically gone, this is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my physical therapist. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. I put a drop on each wrist when I am very stressed. I have had anxiety syndrome for many years and just inhaling this delicious smell calms me down. Would never be without it. Wish I had known about this product 30 yrs ago.</li>
    <li> Just as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used it as a mouse deterrent, my only complaint is that I wish I could buy a larger size. &#x3D;) The house smells great and this oil is great.</li>
    <li> Did I say this is concentrated?  It tastes wonderful, but don&#x27;t taste i straight, it burns!  I have made tons of pepermint infused products and only now can you see I have actually used any.  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> wonderful product, helps my tummy</li>
    <li> This oil smells great.  Early assessment of the quality is that it seems very clear and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> Love this... has helped my stomach/nausea issues</li>
    <li> Purchased to deter spiders! So far so good with keeping the spiders and creepy crawlies at bay! I mix about 15 or so drops into a spray bottle with some water and spray around the door frames and windows, especially the basement door, to keep those little buggers away!</li>
    <li> Seems pure. Used to ward off spiders and ants along with cucumber oil. magic</li>
    <li> strong smell.  good size. good price.</li>
    <li> Delivery exceeded my expectation. Oil is a very potent, fresh and clear Peppermint fragrance. Bottle is not labeled therapeutic. I am not an expert, however, the oil has a crisp clean fragrance like therapeutic oils. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Saw a recommendation for this product to repel spiders.  I have noticed a definite reduction in the pests in my laundry room.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A higher price does not always mean higher quality.  I love Plant Therapy.  I&#x27;ve been happy with all of their EO&#x27;s and the price is so much better than most other companies.  The peppermint oil works great for headaches.  I also made some peppermint lip balm to give out for Christmas.  I received great feedback from all of the gift recipients.</li>
    <li> Great oil and great value for the money. We have a big problem with tiny ants in our apartment, and I use this diluted in a spray bottle to keep them at bay without toxic chemicals. It works great and smells nice, too.</li>
    <li> It did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like pure peppermint, does smell like there is an additive or something.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Purchased to use in my foot spa. It created a NASTY BLACK OILY MESS and required a lot of time and elbow grease to clean it out. May be ok for other uses, but not for this intended purpose.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful...I bought it for my headaches and it does work :-)</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for Amazon.com, I could not find anything local that was organic.... Yes, I intend on buying this product again... LoveIT... Thank you ;o)</li>
    <li> One of the many oils I keep on hand for my aromatherapy. A very fresh, crisp, and potent oil. Try it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Im using it to hrlp keep spiders away and im seeing a huge decrease. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Clean and refreshing. Like it</li>
    <li> The mice took about a one + week vacation! I reapplied after about ten days and there they were again</li>
    <li> I use this in the bath with epsom salts to help with migraines. The product is dependable and top quality.</li>
    <li> i got this because I get frequent tummy aches. All it takes is one drop in an empty capsule and within 30 minutes I feel better. It also freshens my breath. I would use it over and over.</li>
    <li> Organic Peppermint Essential Oil. 30 ml (1 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted. It is very good peppermint oil. Thanks for sent me it very soon.</li>
    <li> Ran out and needed it for a cold I had so hubby ran to a local health food store and bought some. Quality is not as strong. Does not work as well. Will be buying this again soon.</li>
    <li> Used this for a plumbing test of my sewer stack and it worked PERFECTLY!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this item and with this company and I would not hesitate to order from them again. The quality is comparable to Young Living&#x27;s product but is much cheaper. I have already ordered this product three times!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Just as useful as the more expensive buy-in/ club brands. Don&#x27;t hesitate to use this. I hope they expand their Organic line, it&#x27;s wonderful quality, useful for everything.</li>
    <li> Great smelling peppermint, very low price.  You will not be disappointed in this company&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> This peppermint essential oil is wonderful. I totally love Plant Therapy&#x27;s oils. They are high quality, and reasonably priced. They offer free shipping on every order on their website, but sometimes I order through Amazon when I need to add to an order to get an order shipped for free. Plant Therapy stands behind all their products 100%. They are AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily, both orally and topically. I put a couple drops in my hands and I rub my hands together, then I rub them on my arms and neck and the lower part of my face. It really freshens me up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a drop on my toothbrush very carefully or I&#x27;ll use other methods to get it into my mouth. I went with this one because it&#x27;s organically certified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard there are more expensive oils out there and I&#x27;ve yet to try them, but I&#x27;m going to. Suffice to say, you should still have this, even if you&#x27;re going to buy more expensive stuff. The other stuff may be more therapeutic but this is very good for non-therapeutic application.</li>
    <li> I am on my third bottle of this.  It lasts a long time because its&#x27; so concentrated. It is the best.  Keep up the great work.</li>
    <li> I used this to make a spray, trying to drive mice out of my cellar so I could then plug holes without trapping them inside. It seems to be working and my cellar smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice quality peppermint oil. I use a lot of peppermint EO and thought this size bottle is a great price. It&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;candy cane&amp;#34; smelling which indicates a lower quality oil.</li>
    <li> Purchased and reviewed by Mrs. Jim L:  I am on my 2nd bottle.  The 1st smelled more like spearmint (I had flashbacks of Doublemint gum) but the 2nd bottle has the peppermint smell I wanted.  I use it in closets to keep linens, towels, and stored items smelling fresh (and hopefully to keep spiders away!) and I spray it in the kitchen after cooking things that leave a lingering smell (bacon....).  I&#x27;ve also put a dab on temples when I have a headache - I can&#x27;t say it makes the headache go away but it does soothe me.  It&#x27;s a great product and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a review 5 months after purchasing this oil. I haven&#x27;t used it in awhile (holidays, vacation, etc.), and went to use it today and discovered that it has crystallized in the bottle! There is still some loose oil, but there&#x27;s a huge chunk of crystallized something there, too. Don&#x27;t know why this happened or what to do about it. It still seems to smell okay, but I have no idea if this has changed the composition of the oil. I probably won&#x27;t buy from them again because of this.</li>
    <li> strrong but worth it.  gives you a very, very clean feeling.  not sure if it works as well as it states, but it sure packs a punch.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think this smelt like authentic peppermint, but after the initial introduction this smells just as I expected and provides that tingly feeling you are waiting for.  Great Value.</li>
    <li> We use essential oils on a daily basis, peppermint in particular helps with reducing asthmatic tendencies in a family member. Tried this one and we were impressed! Great smell, good quality and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Made peppermint hard candy and it was awesome.  Great price and great stuff.  Pouring a few drops into yhe candy, while its hot really can clear your sinuses. .  Oh boy...</li>
    <li> My use for this was to keep aunts out of my kitchen. It worked great when first applied but as the days went on, I felt it&#x27;s effect was wearing out, it had to be applied more often. Great natural remedy tho without any chemicals. And left my kitchen smelling minty</li>
    <li> I used to use a product called oramd, a combination of peppermint, spearmint and almond oil. It did wonders for my gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Unless one buys a lot of bottles at one time, it is very expensive. So I made my own. I have gotten a variety of peppermint essential oils, along with spearmint and almond oil, non of which was organic. They worked, but, the peppermint had a harsh bite or sting to it. I have tried about 5 different brands of peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came along this organic product from Plant Therapy. I thought I would give it a try. I tell you, organic is the way to go and this particular product is lovely. No bite or sting and the scent and taste is so smooth. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but waaaaay better than the nonorganics I have used in the past. It leaves the mouth fresh and cool. I am looking forward to when I can order their organic spearmint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an exceptional product. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I ordered. I use this to repel mosquitos, and it works great!  I received my item on time.  This is a great product.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> Great for digestion!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also use for hair so it will grow faster but haven&#x27;t seen results yet but its great to use!</li>
    <li> Good product for price :)</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this work with spiders.</li>
    <li> this was exactly what I hoped it would be and very good. thank you</li>
    <li> This product really fell short on the strength of scent. It seems diluted or watered down, and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay nearly as long as the NOW peppermint I have.</li>
    <li> sometimes you just want to rate something without have to put it into works? You should make this writing part option. Some people don&#x27;t have time to write about it.</li>
    <li> Delivery was very fast and the packaging was perfect. I love Peppermint essential oil. I use it to wake me up and energize me. I love the smell and especially love to use it in the bathroom to wake me up in the mornings. It is also useful to help my family breathe when we are congested from allergies or illness. I don&#x27;t live close to a health store so having this delivered to my door is convenient and saves me money, gasoline and time.&lt;br /&gt;If you like the smell of peppermint this is a great product to buy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful sweet clean scent.  High quality.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love ordering from Plant Therapy.  Their orders are always packaged carefully and delivered promptly.  The peppermint essential oil&#x27;s smell is one of my favorites because it&#x27;s strong and refreshing.  I love using it!</li>
    <li> It works beautifully for both my Mom and me! Thank you &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I bought this to relieve the occasional headaches my family may get.  It really works and a little goes a long way-very aromatic and authentic.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use when I have severe headaches.  It only takes a little bit, and rub it on your forehead or temples until you can feel the warmth.  Be careful to not get in or near your eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a small chihuahua and I cannot spray chemicals in the house, nor do I want to and they don&#x27;t keep the spiders out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I read one person had a spider so big she thought it might carry the cat off and she said this stuff took it to the pearly gates by sundown, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, because this is Tennessee and spiders have been an ongoing issue. I just wanted to move to the arctic circle, but not a realistic option, so in desperation I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt; I put some around the house undiluted on cotton balls and haven&#x27;t&#x27; seen any spiders since ; )&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a month since I started using it and I was seeing several enormous ones every week and now NONE!!!!!!! I am so happy!!! This is a permanent household item for me now!!!</li>
    <li> Since couple of month we do buy from this seller and so far never got dissapointed. Peppermint oil helps for dry scalp, chest rubs due to common colds etc. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> No complaints! Smells great &amp; seems to be legitimately organic, although the lack of any sort of \\&quot;seal\\&quot; confused me. I did contact the company to ask for verification that this product is legitimately organic, and received a document of authenticity... although I&#x27;m not sure how to read it or verify it! So hopefully it&#x27;s true :)</li>
    <li> I tried this oil for different purposes and it always works. Muscle spasms (rub it into skin), headaches, adding to cleaning and disinfecting solutions,&lt;br /&gt;improving clarity of thinking, instead of tooth paste (backing soda on tooth brush + few drops of peppermint oil &#x3D; whitens teeth and improves gums health) . The quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> Love these essential oils.</li>
    <li> Peppermint is a go to oil and this is excellent stuff.  This is my favorite brand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s organic&lt;br /&gt;good price for this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;will always buy from them.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Buy and enjoy.</li>
    <li> It is okay. I like Young Living better.</li>
    <li> Love the minty scent!</li>
    <li> Good quality and wonderful aroma.  Excellent price.</li>
    <li> Great product. Greatly concentrated.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep the spiders AWAY because apparently, they hate peppermint oil. Haven&#x27;t seen many spiders since I started using this. Makes my doors and windows smell good too...haha!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural way to help sooth  and heal my scalp after it became unbelievably dry and itchy. I scratched it so bad i had some scabs.&lt;br /&gt;Mixed with lavender and caster oil or the c.o and peppermint mix feels so good and cool. My kids think my pillow and hair smell like gum.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this oil. Have used it in diffuser, as well as mixed with almond oil for a headache. It has performed as it was supposed to. Will keep in my collection of oils.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product from plant therapy......I can barely tell the difference between the smell of this one compared to doterra.</li>
    <li> I put several drops in my hot tea every morning opens my breathing passages and add a wonderful taste to my Irish afternoon tea.</li>
    <li> Great oil, but you will need something other than the &amp;#34;Euro dropper&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great quality ! I use it for mouthwash</li>
    <li> Seems to have worked, but to soon to tell</li>
    <li> Have not had any mice in the camper but it&#x27;s still early.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal!  I have tried other peppermint oils and they actually stank of rotton leaves mixed with the peppermint leaves.  This oil is great for killing head lice - I deal with grade school kids.  And for keeping mice out of the house or car - I live in a forest in the Pacific Northwest.  Just put the oil on cotton balls and leave in areas where mice might come and go.  The field mice are adorable, but they need to live outside!  I think I killed an ugly grey house mouse with the oil, he just crawled under the stove and died of peppermint fumes.&lt;br /&gt;On a pleasant note:  make yourself yummy peppermint ice cream or mint chocolate dishes.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for family and friends!</li>
    <li> Good! I like it.. Especially because compared to Its competitors like young leaf its a bit more affordable... Seems to have the same structure of oils consistency... I wish they had thieves oil version that is the best concoctionNd natural term fighter! Happy with this oil</li>
    <li> I have used it on my sore neck and shoulders and it helped the pain go away. Also have put it on cotton balls to chase mice away from my bags of dog food.</li>
    <li> Thank you for my order, I was confused at first, the way they were shipped, but finally figured it out after getting all I order.</li>
