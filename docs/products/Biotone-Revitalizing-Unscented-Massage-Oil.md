      <li>Also it&#x27;s scent free</li>
      <li>plenty enough that it&#x27;s great for massages.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>I ordered it because I was a nice oil that didnt leave much of a scent.</li>
      <li>Smooth oils ...</li>
      <li>Absolutely fabulous.  </li>
      <li>No odor, easy to clean up, and</li>
      <li>When she&#x27;s ready for more, I will purchase for her again,</li>
      <li>Used it without adding any essential oil, loved it.  </li>
      <li>and I were hoping, but definitely a good massage oil all the same.</li>
      <li>It is absorbed into the skin quickly and leaves the skin silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Pleasing to the nostrils, priced right, shipped quickly, and smooth on the skin.  </li>
      <li>Was sent quickly.</li>
      <li>True to the description, this oil is very smooth and has no scent (for those like me who are sensitive to smells).</li>
      <li>IT doesnt get absorbed to quickly either</li>
      <li>I have tried many different lotions and creams for massages, and found this oil to be fantastic.</li>
      <li>Most of the oil eventually absorbs into the skin, leaving the skin soft and silky afterwards.</li>
      <li>Next time I will warm...</li>
      <li>It does leave a residue, so you&#x27;ll have to shower after a massage, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased when I used this oil for the first time and it actually had no scent whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Glides over the skin nicely and holds scent well, when used with essential oils.</li>
      <li>Well, there are always trace smells to anything, but compared to all of the other oils I&#x27;ve used, even the unscented ones, this one is great for having a very neutral smell that I can&#x27;t smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ladies, it&#x27;s right in between canola oil and baby</li>
      <li>but upon rubbing it around, it was just right.</li>
      <li>However, it will do just fine for normal skin.</li>
      <li>This oil is not too greasy, has no smell, is just right for massage by hand or with hot stones.</li>
      <li>I bought this to massage my girlfriend, who is sensitive to strong smells.</li>
      <li>The first thing I did when the bottle arrived was screw off the cap and take a whiff.</li>
      <li>(though my nose is pretty insensitive).</li>
      <li>I love that it is non-scented because then I can add a drop or 2 of essential oils like Rosemary, Lavender or orange depending on the mood.</li>
      <li>I added my favorite essential oil, and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably priced and works pretty well</li>
      <li>My mother said it really moisturizers her skin without her feeling too oily afterward, a condition she can&#x27;t stand.</li>
      <li>She absolutely LOVES this product.</li>
      <li>I really like this massage oil.</li>
      <li>Works very well for a massage.  </li>
      <li>It seems to absorb into the skin quite readily (but not too fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
      <li>The masseuse really like it.  </li>
      <li>When I dispensed a drop onto the back of my hand, I thought it was too light-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and absorbs really well.</li>
      <li>Amazon had it for a decent price</li>
      <li>great for people with sensitive skin, a little goes a long way highly recommended</li>
      <li>I highly reccommend this product.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend this oil.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It is graet massage oil, which I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>add a few drops of lavender oil and this is FABULOUS!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I added lavender and pink grapefruit essential oils to this.  Out here in Afghanistan, the foreign nationals only have baby oil to give massages.  I ordered this to take with me to my weekly massage.  The masseuse really like it.  It&#x27;s not sticky and absorbs really well. I like the fact that it&#x27;s scent-free and I can mix it to my own liking.</li>
    <li> I ordered it because I was a nice oil that didnt leave much of a scent. This works like a charm.  IT doesnt get absorbed to quickly either and my GF loves this stuff. I would highly recommend for anyone just using it for a relax day.</li>
    <li> add a few drops of lavender oil and this is FABULOUS!  very smooth and workable!  I love this oil and my clients do too!!!</li>
    <li> good massage oil, spreads nicely, you don&#x27;t have to use much, and it softens skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily layer</li>
    <li> This oil works well. But it gave my wife a rash. Other people may not have a bad reaction so I would still recommend it</li>
    <li> I have tried many different lotions and creams for massages, and found this oil to be fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like baby oil, but stays slippery longer than lotions, never gets &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34;. Most of the oil eventually absorbs into the skin, leaving the skin soft and silky afterwards. I love that it is non-scented because then I can add a drop or 2 of essential oils like Rosemary, Lavender or orange depending on the mood. I highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> The oil is less slippery than using plain peanut oil, thus less messy. I like that it has virtually no smell, so I can use my choice of aromatic oils or candles. It is graet massage oil, which I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when I used this oil for the first time and it actually had no scent whatsoever. Great for those who are sensitive. Feels great and washes off easily.</li>
    <li> The first thing I did when the bottle arrived was screw off the cap and take a whiff. I didn&#x27;t think it was possible, but the oil truly is odorless. The bottle may as well have been empty, I&#x27;m still astonished! When I dispensed a drop onto the back of my hand, I thought it was too light- but upon rubbing it around, it was just right. I added my favorite essential oil, and I&#x27;m ready to go. I highly reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice, clean, non-sticky massage oil.  No odor, easy to clean up, and it&#x27;s silky smooth.  Good stuff.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> no smell  that&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I bought this to massage my girlfriend, who is sensitive to strong smells. She really liked it and I can&#x27;t smell it at all (though my nose is pretty insensitive). You don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it. It takes less than an ounce for the entire body, front to back. She used it on my back too and I liked how it felt. It didn&#x27;t make me feel goopy afterward either. It seems to absorb into the skin quite readily (but not too fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is odorless and what I would consider a mid-weight oil.&lt;br /&gt;For ladies, it&#x27;s right in between canola oil and baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;For men, its about as thick as 0w20 motor oil at room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably priced and works pretty well, though I&#x27;ve never used another brand. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> This oil is not too greasy, has no smell, is just right for massage by hand or with hot stones.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any other oil to compare this to, yet.  I&#x27;ve only used this a few times for hot stone massages and it works fine for that.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin with no scent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous.  Used it without adding any essential oil, loved it.  Used a towel underneath in bed to avoid staining the sheets, but it absorbed quickly enough such that half an hour after finishing the massage I threw the towel aside without fear of ruining the linens.  I did not have to bathe before sleeping.  Not too slippery, perfect!  My boyfriend loved it, too.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a little more slick than it is, but it does last for extended periods of time before having to replenish. My wife and ordered it to add spice to our romance and it was disappointing for slippery body to body contact, but for deep massage it works well.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I have very sensitive skin and this is fine for me to use. I love the medium viscosity, and it doesn&#x27;t feel super greasy either.</li>
    <li> Have used other products, but my husband, the person giving me the massages (Yay), says it is glides on nicely, is not messy and there is not smell (which I like).  I would recommend this oil to any person getting a full massage!</li>
    <li> Works great, would buy this again</li>
    <li> I was looking for an oil that&#x27;s similar to what they use for professional massages. I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t sticky afterwards and didn&#x27;t smell. I guess I could have asked my massage therapist where she gets her oil, but I&#x27;ve been too embarrassed, so I just ordered a few oils on Amazon that looked like professional massage oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, this massage oil is great, and I&#x27;m sure that a ton of professional massage therapists use this oil. It works well, but doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky and oily and greasy after you use it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell at all. Well, there are always trace smells to anything, but compared to all of the other oils I&#x27;ve used, even the unscented ones, this one is great for having a very neutral smell that I can&#x27;t smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I&#x27;m a pretty hairy man, so this oil works great on hair. Overall, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite as slick as my girlfriend and I were hoping, but definitely a good massage oil all the same.</li>
    <li> Great for actually giving a legit massage. If you&#x27;ve never used oil to massage your wife&#x27;s shoulders after a long day, you are doing it wrong.</li>
    <li> Was sent quickly. It has no smell and a perfect thickness.</li>
    <li> We have very sensitive skin and can not tolerate any perfumes or scents.  This massage oil is excellent!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Glides over the skin nicely and holds scent well, when used with essential oils. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> My wife and I are senior citizens and decided to try massage therapy for our aches and pains. So far it is working great. We have tried several massage oils and we really like biotone revitalizing oil. It makes for a smooth massage and leaves the skin feeling great. I wish we had started this massage treatment years ago. We both recommend you try biotone revitalizing oil. It is absorbed into the skin quickly and leaves the skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Works very well for a massage.  Good slip and lasts well.  No real smell.  Would purchase again. Good if you like unscented items.</li>
    <li> I like this but I should have gotten the scented</li>
    <li> The oil have a sticky feel when it starting to dry and it make the body feel sticky</li>
    <li> Maybe just a bit overpriced, is all. The Gallon size is not prime eligible which is a bit disappointing. 8 Oz wont last very long, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I found this oil to be sticky and didn&#x27;t glide well...I don&#x27;t know if it was old or what, but disappointed....</li>
    <li> I really like this massage oil. It&#x27;s not too greasy and the fact that it has no scent makes it great for massaging feet on the couch without having to worry about getting it on the couch, clothes, etc. I think it&#x27;s an excellent value.</li>
    <li> No real smell, stays on the skin well, not too slippery, but plenty enough that it&#x27;s great for massages.  I was looking for something like this, and while I can&#x27;t only use a few drops like some people have commented, I still have the bottle a few months later so it doesn&#x27;t take a ton.</li>
    <li> I finally got to use this massage oil and it was perfect.  Not greasy, a little goes a long way, nice and slippery and no scent.  Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> The best--no scent, nice medium feel. After this was gone I ordered a 1/2-gallon.</li>
    <li> Smooth oils ... a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!  True to the description, this oil is very smooth and has no scent (for those like me who are sensitive to smells). It&#x27;s not too oily so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re bathing in olive oil and soaking your bed sheets in grease. At the same time, not sticky at all. Non irritating for those with sensitive skin. You also don&#x27;t need a lot (just a couple of drops). Not sure about the &amp;#34;revitalizing&amp;#34; - I&#x27;d call it more soothing.</li>
    <li> Pleasing to the nostrils, priced right, shipped quickly, and smooth on the skin.  What more can you ask?  Purchase without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Nice feel, no unpleasant or overwhelming scent. Feels lovely and makes for a effective massage oil that lasts. Next time I will warm... but no complaints from my happy husband!</li>
    <li> This was for my mother, who gets regular massages from a masseuse who uses this product. My mother said it really moisturizers her skin without her feeling too oily afterward, a condition she can&#x27;t stand. She says the scent is really light and fresh, pleasant but innocuous. She absolutely LOVES this product. When she&#x27;s ready for more, I will purchase for her again,</li>
    <li> I like this product. Amazon had it for a decent price so I purchased it here instead of from the massage magazine.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  Good All Purpose Oil.  I have used this oil for 9 years of work as a massage therapist.  They used it in the school where I studied massage.</li>
    <li> Good massage oil with no smell at all.</li>
    <li> I could tell you what I use this for but...you don&#x27;t need to know. It works well and seems safe for all regions.</li>
    <li> This is a great massage oil.  Use it sparingly as a little goes a long way.  You can use it for muscle work and it smells great, not overpowering or flowery.</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff the pros use when you go to the spa (I asked).  It does leave a residue, so you&#x27;ll have to shower after a massage, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Used it before and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll buy. No smell, doesn&#x27;t stain and while it&#x27;s oily it&#x27;s not greasy (if that makes any sense to you).</li>
    <li> great for people with sensitive skin, a little goes a long way highly recommended</li>
    <li> this is an excellent massage oil. I love it and my clients love it. It&#x27;s not heavy and no one has complained of any sensitivity to it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a client who has eczema but this oil was still irritating to the skin. However, it will do just fine for normal skin.</li>
    <li> I use this massage oil and have been quite pleased with it.  It is not too watery and is the perfect consistency (in my opinion, anyway).  Also it&#x27;s scent free so people like me that are allergic to essential oils, will not have a reaction to this.  It was hard to find a scent free massage oil.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Leaks through the bottle.</li>
