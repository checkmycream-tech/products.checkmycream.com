      <li>I think that much of the reason that this product affected my skin the way that it did is because it doesn&#x27;t rinse cleanly off of your skin, it leaves an oily residue.</li>

      <li>It is sometimes hard to keep a balance because you want to keep your skin healthy and clean but</li>
      <li>Have used even since discovering in the USA on holiday some years ago  Took very little time to arrive so happy to obtain as was on my last bottle.</li>
      <li>It has gentle exfoliating beads and is mild enough for any type of skin.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this body wash in the past but where i live now doesn&#x27;t carry it, hence ordering it through Amazon. It exfoliates pretty well, and isn&#x27;t scented which I definately prefer. It also suds up nice on a loofah. This particular seller also did a great job shipping it out fast and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I never have issues with breakouts on my chest or back- but almost immediately after I started using this product I broke out in a terible rash. I didn&#x27;t realize that it was from the body wash, so I continued to use it until the rash turned into pimples. I quickly switched to a body was for sensitive skin and the pimples and rash went away. I think that much of the reason that this product affected my skin the way that it did is because it doesn&#x27;t rinse cleanly off of your skin, it leaves an oily residue. Don&#x27;t try this if you haev sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This is a great, basic body wash. It has gentle exfoliating beads and is mild enough for any type of skin. I love that it&#x27;s on subscribe and save and I don&#x27;t have to ever think about it, it just comes in the mail so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I was using Dove&#x27;s Exfoliating facial cleanser but they stopped making it.  I decided to try using this on my face and it works great... maybe even better than the facial cleanser did.  I have adult acne sometimes and a good facial cleanser is important to me.  This one makes my skin look clean and fresh and soft... and it seems to be controlling the acne.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> ITS KEEPS MY SKIN SMOOTH. I CAN USE IT EVERY OTHER DAY. I DO NOT HAVE TO USE IT DAILY.</li>
    <li> On a recent fondue kick, I was looking to complete the experience with a nice and stylish set of plates that had a modern look. In a nutshell, here&#x27;s what I thought of the Dove Gentle Exfoliating body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD&lt;br /&gt;- available on Subscribe &amp; Save so you&#x27;ll never run out (typically a better discount than you find in stores as well)&lt;br /&gt;- leaves you with a fresh clean scent and no soapy residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD&lt;br /&gt;- not entirely sure if the exfoliating beads really do much of anything&lt;br /&gt;- the exfoliating beads tend to get stuck in a loofa if you use one, don&#x27;t freak out if you see lots of little blue dots after you shower!</li>
    <li> I have been using this body wash for as long as I can remember. It leaves my skin so clean and fresh. It has a great smell too. It does not make me break out like other body washes around back and chest area. Will use it always.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat-dry skin and this is the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s something about the &amp;#34;exfoliating blue balls.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know what they are or what&#x27;s in them, but they&#x27;re fantastic!</li>
    <li> The exfoliating was minimal at best.  I will not order again.  I like the Dove no fragrance, sensitive skin better.</li>
    <li> It exfoliates well; it is full of lather.  It also has a very nice to it. Whether using a cloth or a pouf, you can feel the tiny beads on your skin.</li>
    <li> Have used even since discovering in the USA on holiday some years ago  Took very little time to arrive so happy to obtain as was on my last bottle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
    <li> We have used Dove body wash for a while now and like them a lot. So when we saw this new product, we decided to give it a shot. The body wash has small blue color beads. But we haven&#x27;t found anything exfoliating with them. In fact, my kid does not like those beads at all and hates this wash because of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also much more expensive than the regular dove body wash. That also weighs down on this. Go ahead if you want to experiment. But I personally would not buy this again. Of course, we continue to love the regular dove body wash and stick to them for now.</li>
    <li> Have you ever felt the skin of a baby after it came out of the shower? The way it feels soft, smooth, and moisturized.  I have used many different body washes that have made my skin feel that way because I hate the ay my skin feels when it is dry and tight. But one body wash that stood out over all the rest was Dove Gentle Exfoliating Nourishing Body Wash. Apart from the fact that it smells good it is gentle on my skin and it leaves it soft and refreshed. There are many reasons why I would recommend this item, but the three main reasons are first everybody showers might as well use a body wash you are happy with, second it is affordable specially if you buy it in multiples, and third the body wash is a good product that gets rid of dry skin and if you use it constantly you might not even have to use lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone showers some people even shower twice a day, so using a body wash that you enjoy should be a must. For example using a body wash with an unpleasant odor is irritating or a body wash that just does not do its job.  This body wash will make you feel clean, soft and refreshed. Picture this, after a hot day of being out all day and feeling dirty and sweaty you want to get clean and fresh so you take a shower. You expect your shower to be calm and relaxing and that&#x27;s what this body wash does. You get out of the shower with your skin feeling hydrated and clean, no dirt left behind. You get the perfect amount of foam, not too much were you will feel over powered but not too little where you feel like you have to use you whole bottle in one use. I first tried this body wash after a long day of working in the hot sun, my roommate had it in the bathroom and I did not feel like using mine, it was not working and after I would get out the shower I still felt I needed another shower. When I tried hers I automatic loved the smell and when I put it on my skin it felt like lotion so I knew this body wash was going to do the work.&lt;br /&gt;With money being tight for a lot of people deals, bundles and specials is what we need right now. Some people might think that brands define a product, that because a brand is very well known you will get better looking skin and everyone will like you better but truth is that they do not. But in this case Dove is well known for being gentle on your skin, for moisturizing, and for nurturing. Compare Dove Body Wash, Deep Moisture, 24 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4) to a bottle of Victoria&#x27;s secret 8.4 Fl. Ounce, well there really is no comparison when it comes to prices. The Victoria&#x27;s secret bottle is 12 dollars and the four pack of Dove body wash is 24 dollars you would be getting twice as much for twice as less. Not only is Dove a great brand that is well known for leaving your skin and hair soft, they make their products affordable. You do not have to bend over backwards or hunt down coupons you always get a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;Our body has natural moisture that keeps the body from feeling tight and dry, and when we use bar soap that strips our skin from that moisture. Dove uses pure moisturizing cream that leaves skin soft and keeps from striping down our natural oils. Like the saying goes \\&quot;too much of a good thing can be bad\\&quot;. It is sometimes hard to keep a balance because you want to keep your skin healthy and clean but if you over do it you can end up harming it instead of helping it. Dove body wash is a well-known body wash that is good and nourishing that actually goes deep down your skin to nourish and gets rid of dead skin. Above everything else some people are sensitive to some body washes so Dove is perfect to try because most likely it will not irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion there are many body washes out there and there are a handful that are very good and that accomplish their job, Dove Body Wash, Deep Moisture is one of them. Apart from its great smell, being easy on the skin and being such great quality for its price it is an all over great product and it makes your skin feels great. I would recommend this product to anyone not just the girls because I know guys want to have soft skin too. Everyone needs body wash, so one that does its job for a good price is worth getting. And a body wash that you are just simply are going to be happy with, you want to be able to know you are going to be happy with your product. I guarantee you, this product is worth trying</li>
    <li> This Dove product is so good it leaves my skin soft and smooth and smells so good - try it you&#x27;ll love it too</li>
    <li> I love Dove, I wish that when I apply the soap to my skin that it would lather more on my skin.</li>
    <li> Design the bottle to fit a wet soapy hand. When bottle is turned upside down it is almost impossible to squeeze with one hand</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would remove the need of a body scrub. I have dry skin and I had used a Bath and body works sugar scrub for body. Which I think was really amazing at exfoliating the dead skin and gave me a relly nice smooth skin after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dove gentle exfoliating has few tiny beads, But I don&#x27;t think it really exfoliates dead skin. The smell and texture is ok. Does not leave a greasy film on my skin. I would say it&#x27;s only as good as any other regular body wash. Do not buy it if you want exfoliation.</li>
    <li> My skin tends to get dry, especially in the winter.  this is the only product I found that helps with that.  it is not an &amp;#34;end all&amp;#34; cure, but it helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Yes is a great product. Big bottle packaged good. no mess buy it gety soapey and have a nice wash</li>
</ol>
