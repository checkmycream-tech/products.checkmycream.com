      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>The benefits are amazing.  </li>
      <li>This amazing butter has enhanced the quality of my products tenfold.</li>
      <li>Truly amazing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing in soap and I have also made some whipped body butter with it.  </li>
      <li>I even rubbed it on my hands, my hands look amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also upset that it was covered in a ton of some kind of powdery substance.</li>
      <li>Like the &amp;#34;bucket&amp;#34; packaging, as it reseals nicely.</li>
      <li>If u r someone who has to Make ur own products for any reason(personal /business ), add this to ur arsenal.</li>
      <li>love this stuff , used shea butter  until I learned more about Kokum  smell is good  mixing with oils for salves  so good for the skin will buy again</li>
      <li>it rose,</li>
      <li>I could not even rub it between my hands to warm it up without hurting my hand.</li>
      <li>The kokum butter adds a good hardness without having to add a ton more beeswax.</li>
      <li>also very easy to break up for measurements.</li>
      <li>Love the kokum butter, it&#x27;s works amazing &amp; eye received it on time</li>
      <li>A very light scent which does not affect the end product,</li>
      <li>but I need to see how it works on my skin before I decide if I will buy more.</li>
      <li>Not nasty at all.</li>
      <li>but I love the healing properties.  </li>
      <li>and I love that when I close it, it will seal air tight.&lt;br</li>
      <li>One with a more diluted, fragrant and girly scent for day</li>
      <li>its more then just slight..hard to cover up..</li>
      <li>The product oxidizes and a waxy layer forms on the top, and it does not melt into the skin or hair, it feels like there was sand that I could not wipe off my skin when I applied it to my skin</li>
      <li>I really love this kokum butter.</li>
      <li>And I know the seller gave me more than 16 oz</li>
      <li>What popped out of the molds this evening was fantastic!  </li>
      <li>Love, Love it.</li>
      <li>I make most of my skin and hair care products</li>
      <li>but it is suppose to be able to melt in your hands after rubbing together.</li>
      <li>Mango and cocoa butter&#x27;s are okay, but</li>
      <li>so I am used to working with many types of butters (mango, cocoa, shea, avocado, etc)...</li>
      <li>Love this butter.  </li>
      <li>Used this product for the first time and loved the way it turned out in the product I made.</li>
      <li>I order this again, it will be mostly for the fantastic softening properties.  </li>
      <li>Great product arrived super fast ( 4 days)</li>
      <li>It starts to melt in my hands easily</li>
      <li>With my new line of hair product, this oil is so good for your hair.</li>
      <li>Kokum butter is a fine moisturizing ingredient/product to include in homemade body products</li>
      <li>just fine</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this better!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is kind of a money saver when using a coco butter based recipe because you don&#x27;t need quite as much coco butter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m making body butters, primarily with beeswax and coconut &amp;#34;oil,&amp;#34; the hardened butter type.</li>
      <li>Came in a cheap plastic container unlike the one pictured.</li>
      <li>and OMG it is so fabulous on the skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far so good</li>
      <li>That being said - it would allow other products to be firmer without adding beeswax, and it&#x27;s very good for the skin.</li>
      <li>It had a wonderful feel to it and while it still has to undergo the heater test, I can tell right away that it&#x27;s going to be able to withstand more heat than any other butters I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a trial and fell in love at first feel.</li>
      <li>Will order again when I&#x27;m out :) thanks a lot!</li>
      <li>I purchased mine through SpirZon LLC and it arrived quickly and packaged securely.</li>
      <li>WOW this butter is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Prefer when the butters come as butters because then all the space in the container is filled up, so you know you are getting your moneys worth.</li>
      <li>One smelly one for sleeping alone with more intense ingredients.</li>
      <li>I mixed it with shea butter and coconut oil to offset the crumble, but I did note that on skin contact it melted and permeated fairly well.</li>
      <li>but when I melt it down and use 1/3 Kokum and 2/3 some other kind of butter the consistency is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>But even then I am certain that a heated spoon could easily scoop this out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of my new favorite butter.</li>
      <li>Great product after it&#x27;s remelted slightly.</li>
      <li>It has a lovely white color and smooth consistency, with no noticeable odor.</li>
      <li>The price is similar to what you find online with free shipping from Amazon it makes it better.</li>
      <li>This butter absorbed into my skin very quickly, making my hands SUPER SOFT.</li>
      <li>Item was exactly as described and quick delivery time</li>
      <li>There is a distinct recognizable scent.</li>
      <li>Actually, first I weighed it 17.5 oz so with the plastic container that it came in, it was right on the money in terms of weight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Um maybe I didn&#x27;t understand about this, but it was completely dried up and unusable.</li>
    <li> No problem with this order. Items received as promised.</li>
    <li> I bought this to add hardness and a new  spin on my products besides the yummy cocoa nut.  This butter is flaky yet hard ,  and makes my products have an indescribable softness. Works so well with any combination of oils. A very light scent which does not affect the end product, And I know the seller gave me more than 16 oz the kokum was pushing the top off (it was taped down a little cane out on travel but not enough to fuss at all. love this, made tons of stuff and still have half a container. Definitely keeping this in my cupboard. If u r someone who has to Make ur own products for any reason(personal /business ), add this to ur arsenal. also very easy to break up for measurements.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I was hoping for something with a little less of an odor.  This has a pungent bitter &amp; earthy scent and can really overpower any other ingredients you use in a lotion or body butter recipe. The benefits of the product are undeniable; it softens the skin like nothing i&#x27;ve ever had before so you can imagine my dilemma with how odorous it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I order this again, it will be mostly for the fantastic softening properties.  I&#x27;m only hesitant because I would have to use a lot of fragrance to mask the smell if I use it in a body butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was prompt and I had a good experience.</li>
    <li> Love this butter.  Very high melting point.  Great for home made lotions &amp;  lip balms.  Helps with scar healing.  I only give a 4 star due to the container.  The lid is very hard to open.  Feels like it&#x27;s glue to the container.</li>
    <li> Came in a tub, I actually think I got more than 1lb. Will buy it again when I need it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this better! I&#x27;ve used a variety of other butters particularly in making my homemade lotion bars. I&#x27;m not fond of Shea I find it too greasy and I dislike the older associated with it. Mango and cocoa butter&#x27;s are okay, but nothing to write home about. This better has a much harder consistency than many of the other butters with a higher melting point.  It has a lovely white color and smooth consistency, with no noticeable odor. I find it to be dryer when I make my lotion bars giving it a less greasy, more, almost waxy feel which I prefer.  In addition the dryness allows me to add more of the specific type of oil which I am focusing in the lotion bar be it rose, hemp, macadamia, whatever.  Additionally since the oils cost less than the butter this ends up saving me money in the overall production. All in all a very loud round of applause for this butter!</li>
    <li> I put a small amount of this butter in a dish to melt it in the microwave- took what seemed like forever to melt. It has a very high melting point. It doesn&#x27;t really have a nut smell, slight odor to me, a bit on the &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; side, nothing to discourage me from using it. If you mix a bit of raw cocoa butter with it- perfect.&lt;br /&gt; I purchased it to use in soap making, have not had an opportunity to use it in soaps yet, however, I did put some of the slightly melted butter on my hands- This butter absorbed into my skin very quickly, making my hands SUPER SOFT. Even after I washed my hands, I could still feel the softness of this butter. It is absolutely a WONDERFUL product for the skin. I would definitely recommend this butter for skin care.</li>
    <li> Good product, as described.  Very minimal scent and blends well with other butters for lotions and soaps.  Just as described and was exactly 16oz. Like the &amp;#34;bucket&amp;#34; packaging, as it reseals nicely. Will likely purchase again when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Great product after it&#x27;s remelted slightly. Summer heat is hard on any butter during shipment. Would order again any day.</li>
    <li> Very hard to use.  Lots of small chunks, bits, and crumbled pieces.&lt;br /&gt;Will see how it actually works in my products.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, quick delivery, product exactly what they advertised. Will buy from them in the future. AA+++</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I bought it because the seller described it as harder than coconut, cocoa and other vegetable butters. I&#x27;m making body butters, primarily with beeswax and coconut &amp;#34;oil,&amp;#34; the hardened butter type. But when I add all of my essesntial oils and extracts, the mixtured tends to get too soft. The kokum butter adds a good hardness without having to add a ton more beeswax. I&#x27;ve found it to be a wonderful addition to my home-made body butter recipes!</li>
    <li> Product does not come in a reusable vapor lock container as described. It comes in a plastic container with a lid.</li>
    <li> I used this in my lotion.  It works great.</li>
    <li> the butter was much harder than I expected. I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it with other products and so I probably wont purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is nothing like shea butter i wish i would know this before i purchased it. It&#x27;s hard like a rock and takes forever to rub into your skin. Perhaps there is a specific way to use this product but i haven&#x27;t figured it out yet. It does moisturized but it&#x27;s difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected!  Greasy...  Return was quick &amp; simple though..</li>
    <li> I ordered this back in June. it came in a plastic clear food type of container not the the one pictures or in discretion. It didn&#x27;t look like the open container in the picture either. Mine was one solid piece like if it was melted  and re cooled. It was Hard as a Rock there was no taking out a little to try..I had to break the container and melt it all at once.they say it has a slight odor, its more then just slight..hard to cover up..It took lots of oils and lots of coconut,with some shea butter and a lot of whipping, to just make it workable in anything i was looking to use it for. I have added grapefruit essential oil to try to cover up the off putting smell. If i smell the container it smells like the grapefruit,but when you rub it on your skin you get that smell back ,not as bad but its still there..still working on getting rid of the smell..hate to toss it,with everything I have added to it and how expensive it is.&lt;br /&gt;so wish me luck . I might have to just might use it for my feet with socks so i don&#x27;t smell it. My daughter bought Kokum butter from somewhere else and hers doesn&#x27;t smell ,and its softer&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the place she got her&#x27;s from added something to theirs or what but it was different then what I received from this place.</li>
    <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
    <li> Good Alternative to the Mango Butter.</li>
    <li> I have made several batches of body lotion for family and friends. This butter does not have an odor which worked well for friends who asked for no smells. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Came in a cheap plastic container unlike the one pictured. The butter itself was in small pieces, very hard, very dry, and very old. I used mine in cold process soap and it made my soap crumble. Will never buy from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> love this stuff , used shea butter  until I learned more about Kokum  smell is good  mixing with oils for salves  so good for the skin will buy again</li>
    <li> Used this product for the first time and loved the way it turned out in the product I made. Will definitely order this in the future. It&#x27;s one of my new favorite butter.</li>
    <li> Hardness of the product would be expcted by those who do their research. Good quality product for crusty feet.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about getting this product, due to the comments saying it was so hard. But I am so happy I got it anyway. It is harder than mango butter or shea butter but when I melt it down and use 1/3 Kokum and 2/3 some other kind of butter the consistency is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing in soap and I have also made some whipped body butter with it.  It is very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Great product arrived super fast ( 4 days) I&#x27;m still learning how to properly mix with other butters in order &amp; alone</li>
    <li> This was the first time I ever used kokum but I would suggest it for any mixture you have that is too thin/runny. It provides a stablizing agent to mixtures that have gobe a little wrong.  I used it with cocoa butter and castor oil to make a custom butter for a friend who&#x27;s hands are in water alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful because if you don&#x27;t use enough oil it can create a crumbly or hard product</li>
    <li> I bought this as a trial and fell in love at first feel. Truly amazing. My mom would only use my lotion creations if i add kokum.</li>
    <li> I make homemade lip balms and due to summer coming up I had to adjust the stability and hardness of my balms so they don&#x27;t melt while sitting in a hot mail box in the middle of summer when I ship them.  I did research and found kokum butter.  Well it arrived today and I experimented.  WOW this butter is amazing.  It&#x27;s very hard and comes in a ton of pieces so making sure same amount is used in each batch can be difficult but that does not discourage me.  The benefits are amazing.  My lip are sooo soft after using it.  I even rubbed it on my hands, my hands look amazing.</li>
    <li> Love, Love it. It is absolutely great moisturizer. It came packaged a lot different. It came in a jar sealed which was great for me. It is a hard butter you will have to melt a little to mix into something. I have used it twice and OMG it is so fabulous on the skin. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Im still working with kokum butter in place of shae or other butters. Id like to write a new review in about a year.</li>
    <li> I use this butter because I HATE the smell of coco butter but I love the healing properties.  Kokum Butter is a great substitute.  My only issue was that it is soooo brittle and hard.  Just melt it separately, you can mix other butters or essential oils with it after it melts.  Otherwise, it works great on the skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product based on other customer reviews.........when the butter arrived it was in a cheap plastic container very much different from the picture. The butter was in very small pieces it almost looked like I got the leftovers. I&#x27;m also upset that it was covered in a ton of some kind of powdery substance. By the way......the container was cracked on the bottom as well. If you are looking for this butter I would recommend using a different seller. FYI..... If you visit their website on the container they sent me....they dont have a single customer review which I found quite odd....I hope this helps someone out.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat buyer. I use kokum as a foundation butter in a body balm because of its higher melting point. It blends beautifully with shea and mango butters. This seller never disappoints. I receive my kokum in a little bucket, so much better than the bag pictured.</li>
    <li> A little does a LOT.  I use this on my skin oil I make and you only need less than a teaspoon and it blends well with my White Shea butter and other oils I mix.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much. Great product.</li>
    <li> The Mango Butter I was preparing to order sold out. Amazon suggested Kokum Butter. In the description it said it could be used as Mango Butter. Not true! It&#x27;s much much harder and melts at a much higher temperature. I was making body scrub and it didn&#x27;t melt or mix well at all. Kokum is very lumpy unless melted. But even with melting it, the body scrub turned out hard and crumbly once it was mixed and the Kokum re-hardened. That being said - it would allow other products to be firmer without adding beeswax, and it&#x27;s very good for the skin. I just wish I&#x27;d read further about it before ordering instead of relying on the description saying it could replace Mango Butter.</li>
    <li> This amazing butter has enhanced the quality of my products tenfold. I have received numerous reorders for all my products that include Kokum butter.</li>
    <li> I was unfamiliar with this product but it worked beautifully in my lotion bars as a substitute for cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> Got this a day early Yay!!! The butter container was a little hard to open for me but I have a trusty screwdriver that works just fine and I love that when I close it, it will seal air tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product inside is random shaped lumps. The lumps are various sizes. It is glandular looking and I am not sure where this hard thing comes from I can pinch it apart with my weak fingers. My plain fingernail easily scores it. I suppose if it was summer and it had melted and re hardened it would be a different story. But even then I am certain that a heated spoon could easily scoop this out. In fact I am a bit disappointed that it is not harder as I anticipated having to dilute it quite a bit. It is softer than candle wax, maybe a little bit harder than bees wax but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merely touching it in this cold cold weather it has a waxy lotion bar feel. It starts to melt in my hands easily I could use a lump AS a lotion bar if I want a thin layer. Not sure what this high melt point is all about in the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Yes, I has one lol. There is a distinct recognizable scent. But only if I put it under my nose. From one foot away...nothing. It smells EXACTLY LIKE the lumber section in the hardware store...cut cured wood. Not nasty at all. I bet a man could use it straight if he is into a woody scent and no one would say a peep. To me this is an advantage. Many expensive perfumes have a woody undertone. This would be awesome with spicy oils added. So to preview the scent just go stand in the lumber section at the hardware store and start thinking of layers to complement that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work or not? On all of the benefits for the skin that are mentioned? That remains to be seen. I plan to use this to make two versions of dense butters. One smelly one for sleeping alone with more intense ingredients. One with a more diluted, fragrant and girly scent for day and I may just use small lumps to try out different oils and see what happens...a pound would be a lot to waste on a bad combination but a lump...what the hay why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good but I need to see how it works on my skin before I decide if I will buy more.</li>
    <li> With my new line of hair product, this oil is so good for your hair.</li>
    <li> great product.  Kokum butter is much harder than coco butter and even shea butter.  So, you do not need quite as much of it in your recipes (1/3 less), or you can substitute soft oils instead (i.e. olive, sweet almond, etc).&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of a money saver when using a coco butter based recipe because you don&#x27;t need quite as much coco butter.</li>
    <li> I got this butter today and immediately went to work with it. Actually, first I weighed it 17.5 oz so with the plastic container that it came in, it was right on the money in terms of weight. I decided that my project would be lotion bars. Since this butter has a higher melting point, I wanted to give this a try since I carry lotion bars in my purse and in my work bag which inevitably winds up under the heater in my car.   Well once i got over my disappointment that there was so many little shavings in the container, (yes there where big chunks too, but i find scooping out a lot of shavings is messy), I put this and the beeswax in first and when that was about 3/4 melted I added in the other ingredients. What popped out of the molds this evening was fantastic!  It had a wonderful feel to it and while it still has to undergo the heater test, I can tell right away that it&#x27;s going to be able to withstand more heat than any other butters I&#x27;ve tried so far. Less of the product melted off the bar, (great for people who just want a touch of lotion), it soaked right into the skin and left it silky smooth. I&#x27;m already planning on ordering a bigger size because I&#x27;m going to have to include this in all my DIY recipes.  The bottom line.... If you want to try something new or if you&#x27;re looking to firm up any recipes or make them more resistant to heat... Buy this butter.   Update... A year later....  I now put this butter in everything I make.  I typically do have to decrease the amount used as opposed to Shea butter, or add some extra coconut oil instead, but now that I&#x27;ve figured out how to tweak my recipes......  I am able to make the best,  NON GREASY, Body butter!!!   It has a wonderful texture and no odor to speak of.  I won&#x27;t make any products without this kokum butter.</li>
    <li> I really love this kokum butter. I use it in hair and body products. Whipped butter and hair creams. I wish it were easier to get out of the container. IT is a real pain to get just a little out. I dont use all of it at once. If it were broken down into chunks, I would be happier since this is a hard butter similar to cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> Kokum butter is a fine moisturizing ingredient/product to include in homemade body products but I do not think that I will bother using it in the future.  I do not think it enriched the end product enough, considering the odor that it added to the finished product.  This odor was difficult to mask and somewhat unpleasant.</li>
    <li> is a very hard butter, takes a long time to melt down - which is great to use in small amounts with creams &amp; lotions to keep with the intended consistency of the creams during the heat of summer months.</li>
    <li> Kokum butter is a hard butter.  It has to be melted in order to use it in your blends.  It has a longer melting time than shea butter; if not it&#x27;ll be gritty.  The scent is not pleasant and it must be masked with a lot of scented essential oils.  I have only used a small chunk from the 16oz container I bought...which came in little pieces as opposed to a block.  My butter blend will last me at least a month so I don&#x27;t know how soon I&#x27;ll use it again.  Kokum in your butter blends gives a harder feel in comparison to using only shea butter with oils.  Won&#x27;t necessarily buy again as it seems I&#x27;ll have leftovers from my present purchase for a long time</li>
    <li> I ordered this along with the Raw White Mango Butter to add to my supplies for making lotions and other beauty products. I purchased mine through SpirZon LLC and it arrived quickly and packaged securely. Of course, they could slap a mailing label on the little bucket itself and it would still make it in one piece... it&#x27;s that sturdy. I also like the airtight lid that can be pried off with a coin or flat head screwdriver. Kokum butter is one of the most stable butters and has a long shelf life. It&#x27;s even harder than Shea butter, but mixes really well with other butters. Since this is refined the smell was truly faint, and what I did pick up on was quite nice. I&#x27;ve already made a batch of whipped lotions with it and I&#x27;m really happy with how they turned out. It&#x27;s not as slick as your Coconut, Jojoba, or Shea when it&#x27;s rubbed together in your hands, but I prefer something not as greasy when making a lotion for my 5 year old. :)</li>
    <li> The price is similar to what you find online with free shipping from Amazon it makes it better. It comes in clumps but not as hard. I have not gotten to use it yet but plan to during the summer since it is supposed to be good for the soles of the feet. Want my foot bottoms to look good in my sandals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will have to update when I use it, but the packaging was good. Prefer when the butters come as butters because then all the space in the container is filled up, so you know you are getting your moneys worth. Harder when there is gaps of space. It would be nice if they push it down. LOL.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to make a healing balm for my daughters eczema...it works wonderfully.  It was easy to work with and very helpful in creating the balm that helped clear up the skin condition. Excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, butter was in a plastic container. It was my first time using kokum butter, and it&#x27;s pretty hard. I use it in body and hair oil and it has not failed me yet.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described and quick delivery time</li>
    <li> So I just used this in a deodorant, and it seems to be a fairly good addition. As with most of what I write as far as reviews, this is my first impression to be refined later should the need arise. This might be a somewhat odd product to do that with, though, as there is no way I am going to make deodorant out of just this. That would be weird, and probably extremely crumbly. I mixed it with shea butter and coconut oil to offset the crumble, but I did note that on skin contact it melted and permeated fairly well.</li>
    <li> I know that the Kokum Butter is a hard consistency but it is suppose to be able to melt in your hands after rubbing together. Very, very dry would not purchase again</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product at a very good price.  I used it for making lotion and it melts really well.</li>
    <li> Awesome butter! Fast delivery! Will order again when I&#x27;m out :) thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> This kokum butter is a great go-to when I mess up something I&#x27;m making that is too runny or soft. It melts easily in a double boiler and is easily grated. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Love the kokum butter, it&#x27;s works amazing &amp; eye received it on time thank you....</li>
    <li> Love it! Its great for my infants eczema</li>
    <li> I really Like this butter,,,, It works well on general and dry skins,,,, I have also used this with a muscle balm I stared making about 4 months ago,,,, And I can&#x27;t keep stock up,, I get so many complements on how well it feels on your skin, It isn&#x27;t a overly greasy butter and it blends well!</li>
    <li> its a fine product, customers were not happy with the use of it in my lotions, made lotions dry....yet velvety.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of this butter. I am unsure if my issues are related to the shipment that I received or if it is specific to the type of butter. My first issue was that I received the product in a 16 oz. plastic tub (similar to the kind provided by a Chinese carry out) and there was not 16 full oz of product in the container. Because the product had not been melted, it was placed into the container in chunks, it did not full up the 16 oz container. Upon weighing my product I actually received more like 14/14.5 ounces of product. That was disappointing, I feel like I should get what I pay for. My second issue was with the actual product consistency. It has been over processed! Terribly so! It was hard as a rock! At room temperature (I let it sit in my home for 2 hours and my apartment was 75 degrees) the product was rock hard...I could not even rub it between my hands to warm it up without hurting my hand. I decided to melt it down in a double boiler, adding coconut oil and grape-seed oil. This worked and I was able to get it to a soft consistency after meting completely then whipping with a handheld mixer. However, I still had issues when using this on my skin and hair. The product oxidizes and a waxy layer forms on the top, and it does not melt into the skin or hair, it feels like there was sand that I could not wipe off my skin when I applied it to my skin and I had little white bits in my hair when I applied it to my hair. It was gross, the majority of the product I could rub into my skin but there were little white bits left all over the place that would not melt, I had to grab a towel and go over my skin to get them off. Overall...the experience was terrible. I will attempt to use the rest of this as a body moisturizer just because I paid money for it and I am not going to waste a natural resource...but my experience working with it was awful. I make most of my skin and hair care products so I am used to working with many types of butters (mango, cocoa, shea, avocado, etc)...this is my first time working with kokum butter and I will never use this again...it is not worth all the trouble. I will also never purchase from this distributor again because I would like to receive the amount of product that is listed on amazon. Thanks, but no thanks.</li>
    <li> Getting the lid off of this container was a real chore and took me at least 10-15 minutes! The product inside is just what I was hoping for and seems to be of a nice quality with absolutely no odor.  I will use it as an ingredient in lotion.  Thank you for the nice product but please rethink the packaging!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this very much but it seems to be an effective moisturizer and a good addition to body butters.  It has a faint smell, hard to describe but not unpleasant (to me!).  It is very hard, had to chisel it out of the tub with a knife. I could have melted it but there was a chip out of the plastic on the bottom.</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade lotion and I love it!</li>
