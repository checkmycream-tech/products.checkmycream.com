      <li>I just like any woman like go in bed with nice smell around me.</li>
      <li>Can be worn on its own or with your fave perfume.</li>
      <li>so you can mix with your OWN cologne.</li>
      <li>honestly haven&#x27;t gotten any complements on it...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not always a sexual thing, although that can be a NICE side effect, but it attracts conversations and interactions with people you may not have sought out on your own.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it smells on me</li>
      <li>it says sex attractant cologne...and would probably market better to women AND men</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>Not the sellers fault, maybe i should have read it more</li>
      <li>But more to the point it didn&#x27;t have any noticeable effect on anyone</li>
      <li>i have noticed that since i started using it ,i have felt better about myself.........</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>If my hubby would be a mechanic he maybe would like this greasy smell :).</li>
      <li>it (the scent) tells me they love it, and want to know what it</li>
      <li>Will definately order more.</li>
      <li>I have introduced this to many of my friends and they all love this</li>
      <li>but i have noticed that people want to talk to me more...</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>and create a slightly less impressive scent, and the texture of the product will change as well!  </li>
      <li>i tried this product not expecting any more than a possible pleasant sent;  while it hasn&#x27;t got me a date or anything</li>
      <li>and you will likely be very satisfied with this product!</li>
      <li>and you will likely be very satisfied with this product!ready!</li>
      <li>but since it was cheap, i didnt mind taking a loss.</li>
      <li>but i prefer the natural kind as i would much rather use my own cologne.</li>
      <li>more sexual, and nearly everyone i come across notices</li>
      <li>I used to be a consultant for a large party company that sold this and many sensual products.</li>
      <li>I have noticed whenever I use this product I get special attention.</li>
      <li>You do have to keep it in a cool place or the scent does change (and it is not pleasent.</li>
      <li>Overall for the person who is looking for something like this, its good.</li>
      <li>It mixes very nicely with my Hawaiian White Ginger fragrance and is just very, very pleasing.  </li>
      <li>This sold the best and had very few complaints from the women who purchased each bottle for almost $20!</li>
      <li>(you still have to do your own social work)</li>
      <li>Give it a try though cuz its totally worth it.</li>
      <li>Smell good, but the same problem - gone so fast</li>
      <li>so yea..i rarely put it on</li>
      <li>but until I&#x27;m not afraid to show the bottle to my friends and family as a man.........</li>
      <li>They also sent a free gift with it which was not expected but much appriciated!!!</li>
      <li>This is a gently fragrance which put one in a special mood.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money just for the delicious smell...and the really weird part is,</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m not totally \\&quot;out\\&quot;, the only reason the company isn&#x27;t  selling more of this product is that many men (mostly homophobes) are turned off by the pretty purple bottle with a big heart on it!</li>
      <li>first couple of days me wearing it in this northeast heat.</li>
      <li>I am not a person who where perfume on a regular basis, but this doesn&#x27;t have that floral old lady smell, it is very fruity and sweet smelling!!!  </li>
      <li>I had to show my neck and arms again, and put my old \\&quot;friend\\&quot; lotion - sweet pea - with smell that was never wrong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this for the day, but so far, I&#x27;m loving it...</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love this scent; and so does everyone else ;male / female.gay or straight</li>
      <li>This Pure Instinct 2 pack was exactly the product I wanted.</li>
      <li>I put a couple of drops of Pure Instinct on my wrists and neck 10 hours ago and I can still smell it.</li>
      <li>Not saying pure instinct does or does not work but for what i was looking for, certainly wasnt it.</li>
      <li>I received my 2 pack of Pure Instinct pheromone colognes today and I decided to try it.</li>
      <li>Its almost unbearable for yourself to smell if you use too much.</li>
      <li>I really think it contains pheromones because I noticed when I wear this...</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable, too.  </li>
      <li>I purchase this product because it sells for double the price for one thur pleasure cataloge, also if you put it on it creates your one of a kind smell, I went to a pleasure party and everyone in the room try it, and everyone scent was different, even  men can wear it.</li>
      <li>Yes, it does have very nice smell, that last .... for a few minutes!</li>
      <li>so go with 2 bottles and store them in a cool place to make it last longer</li>
      <li>so go with 2 bottles and store them in a cool place to make it last longer</li>
      <li>I had a really bad day but the funny thing is, when I put it on, I instantly felt more happy.</li>
      <li>if it were labeled &#x27;PURE INSTINCTS SCENTED OIL&#x27; PLAIN AND SIMPLE, With neutral colored packaging, and a artistic shaped bottle,that makes you think of a social function rather than a gender or sexual</li>
      <li>you will not have my word of mouth; and the same is probably true of lots of male customers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>There seems to be a trend that the pheromone products which actually work have no added scents, and you can really smell the pheromones.</li>
      <li>Idk but pheromone is supposed to be natural.</li>
      <li>However for someone looking for an actual pheromone, get the natural one</li>
      <li>/&gt;WARNING&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;do not attempt to mix this product directly with another product (i.e : mixing with another bottle of cologne or putting the product in the same location on the body as another cologne!)  </li>
      <li>Almost like when you pamper your young child with johnsons baby cologne and you can smell the kid the entire day</li>
      <li>Be careful when you do a search on pheromones, as you may stumble upon certain things like this.</li>

    <li> This perfume smells different on different people.  I love the way it smells on me and so does my boyfriend.  I initially bought it at a \\&quot;girl&#x27;s night\\&quot; party, but it costs way less here.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> I received my 2 pack of Pure Instinct pheromone colognes today and I decided to try it. I had a really bad day but the funny thing is, when I put it on, I instantly felt more happy. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a coincidence, but the smell just makes me fall in love with this stuff!! It&#x27;s worth the money just for the delicious smell...and the really weird part is, is that it smells different on each individual person! I&#x27;ve only tried this for the day, but so far, I&#x27;m loving it...can&#x27;t wait to see if it works on the opposite sex!!!</li>
    <li> i tried this product not expecting any more than a possible pleasant sent;  while it hasn&#x27;t got me a date or anything (you still have to do your own social work) i have noticed that since i started using it ,i have felt better about myself.........more sexual, and nearly everyone i come across notices it (the scent) tells me they love it, and want to know what it is!&lt;br /&gt; because it&#x27;s both male and females asking ; and i&#x27;m not totally \\&quot;out\\&quot;, the only reason the company isn&#x27;t  selling more of this product is that many men (mostly homophobes) are turned off by the pretty purple bottle with a big heart on it! it says sex attractant cologne...and would probably market better to women AND men if it were labeled &#x27;PURE INSTINCTS SCENTED OIL&#x27; PLAIN AND SIMPLE, With neutral colored packaging, and a artistic shaped bottle,that makes you think of a social function rather than a gender or sexual orientation!&lt;br /&gt;i love this scent; and so does everyone else ;male / female.gay or straight and so will you ; whoever may be reading this................but until I&#x27;m not afraid to show the bottle to my friends and family as a man.........you will not have my word of mouth; and the same is probably true of lots of male customers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but if you are reading this; thinking of buying this product ; try it; you will probably like it!  just a few drops of the oil on your neck and or wrists; rub it in then give a single spray of your usual perfume or cologne, and people will question you over whether or not you are wearing a new cologne or something because it smells really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;do not attempt to mix this product directly with another product (i.e : mixing with another bottle of cologne or putting the product in the same location on the body as another cologne!)  the chemicals and synthetic pheromones interact in odd ways. and create a slightly less impressive scent, and the texture of the product will change as well!  also order 2 bottles at a time and no more till you are ready! i bought a 3 pack the first time,and the last few uses of the 2nd bottle had an odd change in scent,and the entire 3rd bottle had gone bad! so go with 2 bottles and store them in a cool place to make it last longer and you will likely be very satisfied with this product!ready! i bought a 3 pack the first time,and the last few uses of the 2nd bottle had an odd change in scent,and the entire 3rd bottle had gone bad! so go with 2 bottles and store them in a cool place to make it last longer and you will likely be very satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes that it did what it proclaimed too. I don&#x27;t know if it is the product or the confidence it gave me but I will continue to use it and my boyfriend likes it too. Will definately order more.</li>
    <li> honestly haven&#x27;t gotten any complements on it... but i have noticed that people want to talk to me more... so yea..i rarely put it on but it works okay</li>
    <li> I love wearing this scent, it is so beautiful. I am not a person who where perfume on a regular basis, but this doesn&#x27;t have that floral old lady smell, it is very fruity and sweet smelling!!!  I DEFIANTLY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I really think it contains pheromones because I noticed when I wear this...I feel confident and I get along well with people! Great buy! I would buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like fruit flavored skittles or starburst. Not exactly the fragrance I would want to be wearing.     But more to the point it didn&#x27;t have any noticeable effect on anyone and I don&#x27;t smell anything like pheromones.     There seems to be a trend that the pheromone products which actually work have no added scents, and you can really smell the pheromones. If all you smell is a fragrance then usually it seems that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> The produc itself is awsome, and the seller had it shipped qiuickly, it arrived earlier than anticipated! They also sent a free gift with it which was not expected but much appriciated!!!</li>
    <li> Like the way this smells on and so does my partner! I would recommend this product. I have used this for over 5 years.</li>
    <li> Be careful when you do a search on pheromones, as you may stumble upon certain things like this. Not saying pure instinct does or does not work but for what i was looking for, certainly wasnt it. Not the sellers fault, maybe i should have read it more but since it was cheap, i didnt mind taking a loss. Anyway this cologne is not that bad however its VERY strong. Its almost unbearable for yourself to smell if you use too much. Almost like when you pamper your young child with johnsons baby cologne and you can smell the kid the entire day lol. Yeah its like that. WHen i searched pheromone, this item popped up. Idk but pheromone is supposed to be natural. Maybe they did put it in their fragrance but i prefer the natural kind as i would much rather use my own cologne. Its almost impossible to mix this with your own cologne and i dont know about you but i rather not use this to go out. It doesnt smell bad but its a unisex smell meaning it could work both ways. I rather not wear something that could pass for a girl. Not my style but people prefer different things obviously. Nevertheless i also believe this is a winter scent as it gave me a good headache first couple of days me wearing it in this northeast heat. Overall for the person who is looking for something like this, its good. However for someone looking for an actual pheromone, get the natural one so you can mix with your OWN cologne.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does have very nice smell, that last .... for a few minutes! I just took shower, put the perfume on my neck and wrist. Smelled so nice! 10 minutes later, after I put my rope and came in a living room to my hubby - smell was gone! Only oil on my skin with some oil-grease-like smell, not even close what was in the beginning. If my hubby would be a mechanic he maybe would like this greasy smell :). I was not using it for seduction purpose. I just like any woman like go in bed with nice smell around me. And it didn&#x27;t happen - I had to show my neck and arms again, and put my old \\&quot;friend\\&quot; lotion - sweet pea - with smell that was never wrong. I am disappointed, a lot!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have purchased two items with different names from the same vendor. I have received the the item. Why then name it differently, if you sell the same product. Smell good, but the same problem - gone so fast, I have never had a perfume with such a short \\&quot;life-time\\&quot;. That&#x27;s why I am using the same post on another product (copy-paste).</li>
    <li> This Pure Instinct 2 pack was exactly the product I wanted. The price is reasonable, too.  I have never had a bad experience with this company or product.</li>
    <li> This is a gently fragrance which put one in a special mood.  The process of ordering this product was without incidence.  I will reorder this again.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product because it sells for double the price for one thur pleasure cataloge, also if you put it on it creates your one of a kind smell, I went to a pleasure party and everyone in the room try it, and everyone scent was different, even  men can wear it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve been using for a few years now and can definitely tell when people react to it.  It&#x27;s not always a sexual thing, although that can be a NICE side effect, but it attracts conversations and interactions with people you may not have sought out on your own.  Great for networking!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful and I love it.  It mixes very nicely with my Hawaiian White Ginger fragrance and is just very, very pleasing.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I put a couple of drops of Pure Instinct on my wrists and neck 10 hours ago and I can still smell it. I have noticed whenever I use this product I get special attention. I&#x27;ve had doors held open for me three times today! This secret potion works wonders on men!</li>
    <li> Loved the smell, dunno if it&#x27;s the product or just me but I did notice an increase of activity when using this item. Try it for yourself, worst case you get a nice smelling perfume.</li>
    <li> Love it. The smell is fruity and I feel great when wearing it. Can be worn on its own or with your fave perfume. Does it work? For me, yes. I think each person is different though so it may not work for you. Give it a try though cuz its totally worth it. I used to be a consultant for a large party company that sold this and many sensual products. This sold the best and had very few complaints from the women who purchased each bottle for almost $20! Order it here!</li>
    <li> I have used this for as long as I can remember.. I put it on my wrist and behind my ear (the side I hug on. Whenever I use this product I always gets compliments on how good I smell. You do have to keep it in a cool place or the scent does change (and it is not pleasent. I have introduced this to many of my friends and they all love this in fact we call this \\&quot;the date getter\\&quot;</li>
