      <li>Very pretty color!</li>
      <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Preference for 15 years and have always had great results - it actually improved the condition of my hair.</li>
      <li>Anyway so far, so good,</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how easy it was to color my own hair.</li>
      <li>sure you really mix the color before you put it on your hair.  </li>
      <li>I love it, highly recommend it over drug store stuff!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over 5 years and am glad to be rid of high salon prices, although I still go for cuts.</li>
      <li>the other hair colors have, although those are good to have if someone&#x27;s prone to fainting, needs to be revived and there are no ammonia capsules available.  </li>
      <li>And this is my new favorite color-  </li>
      <li>It is much more gentle and contains less of the ammonia and chemicals that are not so good for you.</li>
      <li>(You know that feeling, right?)</li>
      <li>I was very scared my hair was going to turn either full blown orange or go platinum.  </li>
      <li>Relatively easy to use and not messy.</li>
      <li>users of this product and first time at-home hair dyers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product several times and will continue (since I keep getting compliments  :))</li>
      <li>your hair is longer than neck/shoulder length, and you are using the product for the first time, I would recommend ordering two boxes for one treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is pretty and seemed to cover well.  </li>
      <li>First, this product is NOT chemical-free.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t give up on it if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time and remember to be gentle to your hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend finding a really gentle shampoo and conditioner if your scalp is sensitive.  </li>
      <li>I then rinsed and dried it and was very pleased</li>
      <li>color was a bit more red than I expected, but my hair has good texture and shine following colorant.</li>
      <li>Love the look and that it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally a light to med brown with some gray mixed with it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-I think this hair dye really is made for mixing.  </li>
      <li>Also, to combat dryness, use every bit of the included conditioner and keep it in for the recommended two minutes at the very least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is still a light brown/dark blonde color after using this mix of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wheat Germ color get lots of compliments, especially from excited hair dressers.</li>
      <li>the 8N Wheat Germ Blonde shade still turned my hair golden red at the roots when I didn&#x27;t mix it with the 10A Light Ash</li>
      <li>Actually it turned out pretty much exactly like the picture on the box.</li>
      <li>It was simple and I got exactly the color I wanted!</li>
      <li>lightened my hair a couple of shades without turning it red or orange and instead left me with lovely natural looking highlights.  </li>
      <li>With the Light Dawn Blonde and the Light Ash Blonde colors mixed, my hair has natural looking highlights and avoids that tell-tale dyed hair look of monotone color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I certainly don&#x27;t want to be platinum blonde, but the 10N Light Dawn Blonde mixed with the 10A Light Ash Blonde</li>
      <li>I love this dye as it it all natural without the strong chemicals and color lasts as long as any other regular dye.</li>
      <li>This past time, I went to the store and bought a box each of the Light Ash and the Light Dawn Blonde.  </li>
      <li>I was terrified to try a new product!&lt;br /</li>
      <li>have very stubborn early-onset grey hair which first appeared when I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it my hair came out golden-red but only at the roots.  </li>
      <li>It has a lot less of the toxic chemicals than the Preference - so I think I cut my chemical exposure in half which is a good start.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just saw a new hairstylist today and he THOUGHT THIS WAS MY NATURAL COLOR.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m going to keep mixing half Light Ash into any of the colors I use and continue to gradually lighten my hair up.</li>
      <li>hair has been in good condition for years, but lately it&#x27;s been on the dry side.</li>
      <li>Yes, this dye is more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than other at-home products, but it will still dry out your ends over time.</li>
      <li>This hair color, made in Europe, is all I&#x27;ve used for a decade, people always think my hair is natural color.</li>
      <li>I began using the Number 6 line of Naturtint, which is quite a bit lighter than my natural color.</li>
      <li>No harsh chemicals</li>
      <li>So my hair has been dyed professionally before</li>
      <li>Naturally I have some honey undertones</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe a professional thought my hair just grew out of my head looking this way.</li>
      <li>the Naturtint website and figure out the closest shade to your natural hair color.  </li>
      <li>My hair does feel a little dryer than it usually does after coloring with Preference, so I&#x27;m going to use a good conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Naturtint (Wheat Germ Blonde) for 4+ years, and I always get the same consistent results.</li>
      <li>Then I went out and bought a box on the Light Ash Blonde color to try and tone it down.  </li>
      <li>I mixed half of the Light Dawn Blonde and half of the Light Ash Blonde into the squeeze bottle (I just eyeballed it) and crossed my fingers.  </li>
      <li>Then I followed with my regular Giovanni shampoo and conditioner and left that conditioner on for another couple minutes to really soothe my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s my advice to other first time</li>
      <li>I tried various shades over the years including Dark Blonde, Dark Golden Blonde, Light Brown, etc.  </li>
      <li>Mine is somewhere between the 4N Natural Chestnut and the 8A Ash Blonde but</li>
      <li>Using the Light Ash Blonde by itself didn&#x27;t have much of a dramatic effect on taking away the orange in my hair, but mixing it with the other blonde shade (Light Dawn Blonde) and then applying that mixture did have a big effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even with the shipping, it costs less for me to buy this through Amazon rather than buying at my local Whole Foods store.</li>
      <li>Naturtint covers grey hair like no other at-home hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pretty color! I get compliments on it all the time. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad like most hair colorants. I&#x27;ll keep using this in the future.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great in coverage, color and odor.  Just wish it was easier to get out of the dispenser.</li>
    <li> So many compliments on the color. Never had any before!</li>
    <li> The product works well and lasts up to six weeks depending on how often you shampoo your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The color was a bit more red than I expected, but my hair has good texture and shine following colorant.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great coverage, color true to picture on the box. I&#x27;ve used this product several times and will continue (since I keep getting compliments  :))</li>
    <li> I love this brand of hair dye. Great cover, natural, not tested on animals. I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used permanent dye before but wanted to give some glow to my dark blonde hair.  Naturally I have some honey undertones so I thought I&#x27;d be safe choosing the Wheat Germ shade.  It turned my hair strawberry blonde.  It isn&#x27;t garish, but it doesn&#x27;t match the box.  If you look at Naturtint&#x27;s website at their models, ([...] my hair looks closest to \\&quot;Melissa Combs\\&quot; with some darker undertones.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love the color and was somewhat disappointed by how different it turned out from the box, hence the three stars.  My hair feels fairly close to its original texture.</li>
    <li> I have been using this color for a while now and am very happy with it.  No harsh chemicals and I can do it myself easily.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural hair color I have found.  The conditioner is great.  I will be purchasing more of the conditioner soon.</li>
    <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Preference for 15 years and have always had great results - it actually improved the condition of my hair. However I&#x27;ve been trying to move towards organic/less toxic beauty products so I tried the Naturtint. I was terrified to try a new product!&lt;br /&gt; First, this product is NOT chemical-free. If you have had allergic reactions to hair color in the past, this is not for you. I&#x27;ve never had that problem and I didn&#x27;t have any negative reactions to Naturtint. It has a lot less of the toxic chemicals than the Preference - so I think I cut my chemical exposure in half which is a good start.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews that I read suggested choosing a lighter color than you normally would, because the result is a little darker than what is shown on the box. I normally use a dark blonde color so I went with the wheat germ blonde. Actually it turned out pretty much exactly like the picture on the box. Next time I might try a darker shade. The color is pretty and seemed to cover well.  My hair does feel a little dryer than it usually does after coloring with Preference, so I&#x27;m going to use a good conditioner.  Now I&#x27;ll have to see how long the color lasts. I normally color every 6 weeks because my dark ugly roots start showing by then. Anyway so far, so good,</li>
    <li> Easy use and great price. Love the look and that it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. Feels great and the compliments everytime I do my hair make me laugh cause its so easy.</li>
    <li> Great hair color! I will definitely purchase again. It was simple and I got exactly the color I wanted! It&#x27;s not as damaging as most home hair color.</li>
    <li> I have been using Naturtint (Wheat Germ Blonde) for 4+ years, and I always get the same consistent results. Naturtint covers grey hair like no other at-home hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very stubborn early-onset grey hair which first appeared when I was in my 20&#x27;s. Brand-name products found in a drugstore or supermarket do not work as well as Naturtint. (Not Loreal, Garnier, Clairol, etc. I&#x27;ve tried them all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only advice for repeat users of Naturtint is DO NOT keep reapplying it to the ends of your hair. Yes, this dye is more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; than other at-home products, but it will still dry out your ends over time. Just coat your roots and hairline well, and don&#x27;t leave it in for longer than the recommended time - you don&#x27;t need to. Also, to combat dryness, use every bit of the included conditioner and keep it in for the recommended two minutes at the very least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works so well that I have found it actually lightens my hair without need for a salon treatment such as stripping. If your hair is any shade from light/mid brown to dark blonde, it will turn your hair to a sunny blonde with repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is longer than neck/shoulder length, and you are using the product for the first time, I would recommend ordering two boxes for one treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE March 13, 2013: Guess what? I just saw a new hairstylist today and he THOUGHT THIS WAS MY NATURAL COLOR. He complimented me on my \\&quot;champagne blonde\\&quot; hair. I can&#x27;t believe a professional thought my hair just grew out of my head looking this way. I told him the truth, of course, but still... Thank you, Naturtint!</li>
    <li> I have been using Naturtint products for over 3 years now and LOVE them! And this is my new favorite color-  I always just color my roots, since I have dark hair mixed with resistant grey strands, and put conditioner on the rest of my waist-length hair as I color it. My hair was quite dark, and people who have not seen me for a few years do a double take when they see me.  I began using the Number 6 line of Naturtint, which is quite a bit lighter than my natural color. I was very pleased with the results.  Then I decided to try the 7 line ( all excellent)  and then about 4 months ago began using the 8 line (this one being my favorite).  I get so many compliments on the color, it looks sun-kissed, as if I had spent a lot of money in salons getting highlights. Also as my hair grows, and it grows quickly,  the grey and dark roots are much less visible, so I can get away with another week (at least) without re-coloring.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how easy it was to color my own hair. The box also comes with a packet of shampoo and conditioner!  I&#x27;ll surely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I discovered this brand over a year ago when I was looking for a healthier alternative for coloring my hair.  It colors the gray beautifully without the hormone-altering chemicals in the mainstream hair color products.  Even with the shipping, it costs less for me to buy this through Amazon rather than buying at my local Whole Foods store.</li>
    <li> So my hair has been dyed professionally before and I&#x27;ve always been left with a burning scalp and lots of hair fall afterwards.  I have very thick, coarse hair, so I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to go bald but it was bad enough for me to worry about what effect the dye was having on my body.  I recently decided I wanted to change back to a blonder color but, being a grad student, I am on a shoestring budget and didn&#x27;t want to pay to go to a hairdresser and have highlights done that just grow out within a month anyway.  So, I came across this stuff here on Amazon and selected the Wheat Germ Blonde.  The first time I used it my hair came out golden-red but only at the roots.  So weird.  Then I went out and bought a box on the Light Ash Blonde color to try and tone it down.  It did work a bit but there was still a bit of orange gold color to my roots.  This past time, I went to the store and bought a box each of the Light Ash and the Light Dawn Blonde.  I was very scared my hair was going to turn either full blown orange or go platinum.  I mixed half of the Light Dawn Blonde and half of the Light Ash Blonde into the squeeze bottle (I just eyeballed it) and crossed my fingers.  My hair came out a couple shades blonder, no hint of red or orange, and it has highlights!  So, I&#x27;m going to keep mixing half Light Ash into any of the colors I use and continue to gradually lighten my hair up. I want it to eventually be a medium colored ash blonde.  Also, I noticed the scent of this stuff as being kind of like licorice but with a chemical undertone.  Not nearly as yucky as the stuff the salons use, but I found it noticeable when I was applying it.  Also, my scalp did burn slightly when using the dye but I didn&#x27;t have the hair fall like I did with the other salon stuff.  I strongly recommend finding a really gentle shampoo and conditioner if your scalp is sensitive.  I use the Giovanni 2Chic Avocado and Olive Oil Ultra-Moist Shampoo and Conditioner and they save my hair and scalp from utter destruction.  I also use keratin masks once a week to keep my hair from drying out.  Here&#x27;s my advice to other first time users of this product and first time at-home hair dyers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-if your hair turns out orange or red, mix half of one of the ash colors with the shade you want to achieve the next time you dye.  Using the Light Ash Blonde by itself didn&#x27;t have much of a dramatic effect on taking away the orange in my hair, but mixing it with the other blonde shade (Light Dawn Blonde) and then applying that mixture did have a big effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-make sure you really mix the color before you put it on your hair.  The box recommends shaking the bottle for two minutes before applying, I set a timer to make sure I do a full two minutes.  Don&#x27;t let it sit and settle after you have mixed it either, as this seems to mess with how the color turns out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-use the shampoo and cream conditioning treatment provided.  Remember to leave the conditioning treatment on for at least the recommended two minutes. This seems to help how the color comes out.  Then I followed with my regular Giovanni shampoo and conditioner and left that conditioner on for another couple minutes to really soothe my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-visit the Naturtint website and figure out the closest shade to your natural hair color.  These dyes are only supposed to lighten your hair a couple of shades lighter at a time.  Mine is somewhere between the 4N Natural Chestnut and the 8A Ash Blonde but the 8N Wheat Germ Blonde shade still turned my hair golden red at the roots when I didn&#x27;t mix it with the 10A Light Ash Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-don&#x27;t be scared to use a lighter blonde color than what you want to achieve if you are using it to mix with one of the ash colors.  I certainly don&#x27;t want to be platinum blonde, but the 10N Light Dawn Blonde mixed with the 10A Light Ash Blonde lightened my hair a couple of shades without turning it red or orange and instead left me with lovely natural looking highlights.  My hair is still a light brown/dark blonde color after using this mix of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying hair dye off of the internet sight unseen.  It&#x27;s best to go to the nearest retailer that sells Naturtint and pick out the shade or shades that you like and try them.  Once you figure out what shades work best for your hair then you can buy them from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I think this hair dye really is made for mixing.  With the Light Dawn Blonde and the Light Ash Blonde colors mixed, my hair has natural looking highlights and avoids that tell-tale dyed hair look of monotone color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this hair dye.  Just don&#x27;t give up on it if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time and remember to be gentle to your hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> This hair color, made in Europe, is all I&#x27;ve used for a decade, people always think my hair is natural color. It doesn&#x27;t have ammonia or parabens or crap like that. I love it, highly recommend it over drug store stuff!</li>
    <li> If you color your hair at home you&#x27;e gotta try Naturtint. It is much more gentle and contains less of the ammonia and chemicals that are not so good for you. Love the color I use. So do the hair care professionals I see for my keratin treatments and extensions.</li>
    <li> like the color for highlights!</li>
    <li> Grateful for no ammonia.  Good color and easy to use. You can cut it in half by weighing it out in two different bottles.</li>
    <li> Wheat Germ color get lots of compliments, especially from excited hair dressers. I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over 5 years and am glad to be rid of high salon prices, although I still go for cuts. The color washes out in about 6 weeks, but is is perfect for coloring gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been in good condition for years, but lately it&#x27;s been on the dry side. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product, but will follow a suggestion to try neutral Henna for conditioning. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My gynecologist recommended, I have been using ever since.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years. My hair was naturally dark auburn before it went gray. I choose lighter color because it blends better with gray. Love this color. I get tons of compliments. Also I feel like it&#x27;s less toxic than the main store brands. Smells less toxic anyway. Relatively easy to use and not messy. I&#x27;ll keep using it. Also less expensive through Amazon than Whole Foods or New Seasons.</li>
    <li> 5 stars to the distributor; I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love that it is non-toxic to my skin and to the earth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for several years but always purchased locally. I love this dye as it it all natural without the strong chemicals and color lasts as long as any other regular dye. This price is the cheapest I &#x27;ve seen anywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Naturtint for years.  I tried various shades over the years including Dark Blonde, Dark Golden Blonde, Light Brown, etc.  They always turned out too dark---sometimes almost black--but I just lived with it since after about 2 weeks or so, it lightened enough that it was tolerable. My hair is naturally a light to med brown with some gray mixed with it.  On Christmas day, I decided I needed to color my hair before I went anywhere, so I had bought this shade to try. I figured it&#x27;s either do or die because it was the only thing on-hand and all the stores were closed. (You know that feeling, right?) So...I mixed it up and took my wide-tooth comb and combed some through the front to do the strand test. I then rinsed and dried it and was very pleased so I went for it. It&#x27;s a nice honey brown on me and it leaves the hair in great condition, very shiny. It doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp or have the strong smells the other hair colors have, although those are good to have if someone&#x27;s prone to fainting, needs to be revived and there are no ammonia capsules available.  Try just one box of Naturtint and you won&#x27;t be sorry. I hightly recommend the Naturtint Shampoo and Conditioner, the companion products that go with the color.</li>
