      <li>Perfect fit.  </li>
      <li>surprise here which gets a good rating from me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of sizes and styles, and these are the best so far.</li>
      <li>so they were more like socks.  </li>
      <li>Perfect, same item they used at the hospital.</li>
      <li>COSTS MUCH MORE IN RETAIL STORES.</li>
      <li>My husband used this product following surgery and they worked great!</li>
      <li>They are not the most glamorous in the world but they do work.  </li>
      <li>This product makes my budget and Dr is pleased</li>
      <li>but that was ok.</li>
      <li>Even though it takes little more of your time to wear it, it fits perfect!</li>
      <li>It works and is also comfortable.</li>
      <li>The Amazon price was great but when received the stockings - they were way too big.  </li>
      <li>These are light support stockings, and so take that into consideration when considering alternatives.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great for long flights as well.</li>
      <li>Good for the price..didn&#x27;t realize the we&#x27;re open toe..</li>
      <li>I understand they need to be tight to be effective, but this was over the top.</li>
      <li>I need Ted stockings for a medical reason,  so when Dr ordered this kind I started to shop.  </li>
      <li>and they do what they are supposed to do if you get the right size.</li>
      <li>exact same kind as the ones you get in the hospital.  </li>
      <li>Cheaper than local shops and is the same great quality that Kendall&#x27;s stockings have always been.</li>
      <li>These are exactly like the ones he received in the hospital.</li>
      <li>ordered more of these to hold me for an entire week</li>
      <li>First tried after surgery and reordered from stocking number.  </li>
      <li>FITS VERY WELL ON MY HUSBAND,</li>
      <li>They are just one of a few pairs I own to help stop leg swelling from sitting at a desk all day.  </li>
      <li>These were the exact same as they gave me in hospital for a very reasonable price!</li>
      <li>Top rolls down.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a close-toe anti-embolism stocking I would highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>These stockings were very easy to put on,  my husband is not able to put them on himself, so I have to do it for him</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them on and off for about a year and they stand up to normal washing and drying without shrinking or coming apart.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really want to wear these but with the amount of fluid</li>
      <li>I will be returning the 2nd &amp; 3rd pair due to lack of function and purchasing more Futuro stockings.  .</li>
      <li>However, they are still a little long and cut into my calves where I fold over the too-long top.</li>
      <li>I have a little swelling and pain in my right ankle only.  </li>
      <li>She likes it so far, but will see how long it lasts!</li>

    <li> Good for the price..didn&#x27;t realize the we&#x27;re open toe..but that was ok.</li>
    <li> Stopped the swelling in my bad leg.</li>
    <li> would have given 5 stars. Looking at the picture, it shows these stockings are closed toe. I received opened toe. They helped my swelling in my foot and foot. I would buy another pair.</li>
    <li> ordered more of these to hold me for an entire week</li>
    <li> Gift for Mother.  Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> I needed an extra pair of stockings after hip surgery but they were too expensive. These were the exact same as they gave me in hospital for a very reasonable price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wanted Kendall(specifically did not want Covidien). Received 3 pairs of Covidien with sticker applied to package calling them Kendall.</li>
    <li> My husband used this product following surgery and they worked great!</li>
    <li> perfect. Grandma loves it</li>
    <li> I bought these for my fiancé who spends hours on her feet as a surgical assistant. She no longer complains of knee and leg pain. They&#x27;re great for long flights as well.</li>
    <li> A little pricey for the quality</li>
    <li> Top rolls down. I constantly have to pull it back.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE! COSTS MUCH MORE IN RETAIL STORES. FITS VERY WELL ON MY HUSBAND, WHO IS OF MEDIUM BUILD AND 5 FT.11 INCH TALL.</li>
    <li> It works and is also comfortable.</li>
    <li> Mother in law loves them. They work great</li>
    <li> I would recommend Futuro brand over these.  I have a little swelling and pain in my right ankle only.  With the Futuro brand, I&#x27;ll notice reduction in swelling and resolution of pain after wearing one day.  With this Kendall (Covidien) brand, the pain and swelling continue as if I am not wearing them at all.  I also purchased closed toe (or thought I did), but was shipped open toe.  Double check the product description before ordering.  I will be returning the 2nd &amp; 3rd pair due to lack of function and purchasing more Futuro stockings.  .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of sizes and styles, and these are the best so far. However, they are still a little long and cut into my calves where I fold over the too-long top.</li>
    <li> Works well and fits as they should</li>
    <li> I ordered Kendall closed toe stocking, instead , I  got another brand open toe stocking. I called the company number but the person who answered was not very helpful</li>
    <li> Cheaper than local shops and is the same great quality that Kendall&#x27;s stockings have always been. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> These are light support stockings, and so take that into consideration when considering alternatives.  I like them somewhat, but can not stand up all day in them.  For standing all day and for airplane travel I recommend truform 20-30 below the knee open toe sold here on Amazon.  Sometimes, like in summer, I prefer the lighter compression that these offer, however.  The printing on the foot is in a spot visible when I wear my shoes, so that is not good.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and loved finding them online rather than hunting all over town!</li>
    <li> After several knee surgeries I get a lot of swelling and pain in my lower legs and the stockings help keep the pain and swelling down.</li>
    <li> These stockings were very easy to put on,  my husband is not able to put them on himself, so I have to do it for him and this is not a easy task with any other stockings that I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit.  These never slipped down and after 14 hours an the floor I parked my stethoscope and and went to a party.&lt;br /&gt;No surprise here which gets a good rating from me.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a friend.  She loves them.</li>
    <li> My husband needed to wear these after knee replacement surgery.  These are exactly like the ones he received in the hospital.</li>
    <li> Way too tight!  I can&#x27;t wear!</li>
    <li> They are not the most glamorous in the world but they do work.  First tried after surgery and reordered from stocking number.  They are just one of a few pairs I own to help stop leg swelling from sitting at a desk all day.  I were them under pants with boots so they don&#x27;t have to be a fashion statement!</li>
    <li> My doctor told me I had to wear these for any type of travel. If you&#x27;re looking for a close-toe anti-embolism stocking I would highly recommend these. The fit is perfect and they helped prevent any type of edema I would have had had I not worn them when I traveled.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t look anything like the photo.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom. Even though it takes little more of your time to wear it, it fits perfect! She likes it so far, but will see how long it lasts!</li>
    <li> Not what I ordered, however I can still use them. I ordered blue without the holes and received white with the holes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and on my feet the majority of my shift so I&#x27;ve been wearing Ted hose for several years.  The Amazon price was great but when received the stockings - they were way too big.  I&#x27;ve been wearing the same size for years but these were not comfortable at all.  But, I already worn and washed them, so I&#x27;ll keep them.</li>
    <li> These socks were way too tight. They cut into my legs. I understand they need to be tight to be effective, but this was over the top.</li>
    <li> Ist Hard Rock her them on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they do what they are supposed to do if you get the right size.</li>
    <li> exact same kind as the ones you get in the hospital.  I stitched the toes closed so they were more like socks.  great for people who are on their feet all day!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really want to wear these but with the amount of fluid I&#x27;m retaining due to medication I have no choice.  These are tight as they should be and well made.  I&#x27;ve used them on and off for about a year and they stand up to normal washing and drying without shrinking or coming apart.  I recommend them if you need to wear embolism socks.</li>
    <li> I need Ted stockings for a medical reason,  so when Dr ordered this kind I started to shop.  This product makes my budget and Dr is pleased</li>
    <li> Perfect, same item they used at the hospital.</li>
    <li> Great support at a great price. Highly recommended.</li>
