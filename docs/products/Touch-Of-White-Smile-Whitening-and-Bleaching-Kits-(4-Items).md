<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the molds came out perfect and it works great.  i get so many compliments on how white my teeth are</li>
    <li> Fantastic fit. The end product is perfectly molded to my teeth, and I have whitened several shades lighter with only one tube.  This is an amazing value considering what dentists charges.  The initial package contained one bag of goo that had dried out, but I contacted the seller was promptly shipped another at no charge.  All around great experience.</li>
    <li> The whitening products are good but the trays didn&#x27;t fit at all. I&#x27;ve had better luck with the heat and set trays from the drug store.</li>
    <li> I personally went to the dentist and had them do my trays.  It was over 225.00 for their services and so on.  I purchased this item for my girlfriend and it is same thing.   The instructions that come with the custom molds are very helpful.  Creating the molds was very quick and easy.  The molds were mailed back in the provided envelope. The trays arrived at my mailbox very quickly, I would say less than five days since being mailed to the lab.  We are very pleased with this item and will recommend this to friends and families...</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and was very excited to receive it until it arrived and I read the instructions.  There were typos, grammatical errors, and unclear directions.  I&#x27;m not talking about missing a comma or two, but some serious typos.  The directions were so poorly written I didn&#x27;t even use the product for fear of it being at the same low quality.  I contacted the seller because I was so unhappy with and uneasy to use the product that I wanted to return.  He informed me that he does not offer a satisfaction guarantee and assured me that the product was safe to use.  I have not used the product, will not use the product, and unfortunately am out the money but I don&#x27;t want to use a product that has incomprehensible and confusing directions.  I would not recommend this seller or product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Received  the materials to make the teeth whitening  trays in a short time. Making the trays was very easy with plenty of material to do the job.  The trays were returned in 10 days from mailing and fit very well. The whitening process is quite simple to do and can be done watching TV or doing any task.  The results are  as advertized. Would recommend product to anyone(even my brother -a dentist!).</li>
    <li> I think that its safe to say that MOST of us who are buying these trays are not dentist.  Therefore, we would like some level of support through this process (not hand holding but just being able to ask a question).  I received my trays and found that the top trays just seemed to be a better fit than the bottom trays in my opinion.  However, maybe the product is working as designed I&#x27;m not sure which brings me to the point of this review.  I wrote the seller and have not heard from them at this point.  In the mean time the trays are just sitting around because I&#x27;m not sure if they are suitable.  Overall I believe that this product is a good bargain.  However, I would be doing the readers of these reviews a disservice if I did not mention the fact that there is apparently at least some chance that you will get these trays, do a less than perfect job on the impressions and not year back from the seller.  From what I&#x27;ve read this isn&#x27;t the case with most buyers but at this point it most certainly is the case with me so I cannot give this product a good review at the time of this writing.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. It is very nice, I really enjoy using my teeth trays. They don&#x27;t hurt or bother your teeth either. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I quickly received the kit to create the molds.  It came with detailed, easy to follow instructions (with a few annoying typos), and making the molds was so easy (and FUN)!  I received my trays about a week later, and they fit absolutely perfectly!  Included with the trays was two, 10 ml syringes of 36% carbamide peroxide whitening gel.  I put them in and made the mistake of putting a bit too much gel in the trays.  Trust that a little gel goes a long way!  I simply wiped the excess gel off my gums and even gently rinsed with the trays in my mouth (that is how perfectly they fit).  After one use, I notice a great difference in the whiteness and brightness of my teeth.  Yes, my gums burn a bit and my teeth are a bit sensitive, but it&#x27;s certainly worth having pearly whites!  Great product!  Highly recommended.      PS I previously used the cheap-o, heat in water to mold trays, and they are an absolute joke compared to these things.      :D!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of annoyed, because I&#x27;d figured, given all the great reviews on shipping speed for this product, that the final teeth trays would be sent back to me within a respectable period of time.  I ordered the kit on January 12th.  Didn&#x27;t even get the impression kit until the 20th.  I sent it back the very same day and waited... and waited.  By the 31st I was beginning to get frustrated by how long it was taking since my initial order to receive the final product, particularly since I&#x27;d ordered it specifically for several events that&#x27;d already come and gone, so I sent them an email.  They replied Tuesday that they&#x27;d send the product out that day (had I not, one would wonder how long it would&#x27;ve taken them otherwise.)  I received it on the 4th.  A total of 23 days.  Not acceptable.    But despite that, I&#x27;ve used the kit twice last night and today, and there&#x27;re noticeable improvements, so I deem the kit very effective.  A note, though: the syringes in which the peroxide is supplied are extremely difficult to push.  And I&#x27;m fairly muscular compared to most of my friends (I&#x27;m a 26 y/o male).  Would I order again?  Only as a last resort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I extremely recommend it! I. If I ordered it from dentist in Sydney in Australia I would had payed 600$.</li>
    <li> The kit they send to make your mold is very easy to use, the instructions were great, the pictures made sense, the whole thing is very simple. The turnaround after I mailed back my molds was quick, the trays I received are quite good. They are a little shorter in the front than I would like but really there is no noticeable effect on the whitening process. It&#x27;s very easy to wear these trays for an hour as prescribed. You can even drink beverages in them if needed. Mine go over my soft palate a little more than I had hoped but I think it&#x27;s because my mouth is small and the material for the trays is shaped in standard sizes. I could trim that part off.    The whitening gel at this 36% strength will hurt your gums if you don&#x27;t use it sparingly, it&#x27;s amazing how little you need. Also it comes out of the syringe fast. The third and fourth time I used the trays I used too much gel and my gums which had been scraped by rough food did hurt. I just stopped bleaching for a couple days. But I  read about a trick of painting your gums and palate with petroleum jelly with a q-tip before bleaching. I tried this and it works very well. But the best bet is still using a small amount of the gel, your supply will last longer and it will spare your gums.    This kit is pretty similar in price to two boxes of the best brand name white strips and those never bleach really deeply and only help with surface staining. In 3 or 4 uses my teeth are already whiter than anything standard over the counter. The results are incredible and exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
    <li> Received in a very timely manner! Made my impressions and got my trays quickly too. Rembrandt whitening works better than the whitening I purchased with the trays... But love the trays!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been scouring the internet to find. After reading all the great reviews, I decided this was the product for me!  I received the kit to make the molds of my teeth very quickly and they were easy to create (and kind of fun - if you like playing with Play-Doh as a child). With the kit came a form to order another kit at a discounted price. This was a no-brainer and I sent in a check for my boyfriend as well. It took longer than the 5-10 business days to receive my custom trays, and I am only 4 hours driving distance from the seller. I still haven&#x27;t received my second set of molds, even though the check was cashed nearly a month ago. Luckily the seller has been responsive over email, but not with the answers I&#x27;d like to hear.    As for the product, the 35% carbamide solution is VERY strong, so you should use a lot less than you think you should - and then reduce THAT by half. I noticed results after the first use and even though I don&#x27;t use it every day, I love what my smile looks like now!    My recommendation is to get this product, but make sure you do all the transactions through Amazon, so you&#x27;re covered in case there is a shipping or product error. It&#x27;s worth the full price of this product to be protected :)</li>
    <li> I have never priced whitening trays with my dentist, but I hear they can be on the expensive side. I decided to order these do-it-yourself trays as a more affordable alternative, and I&#x27;m glad I did.    The instructions that came with the kit were clear and easy to follow. Unfortunately, I had some concerns about one of the plastic trays in the kit -- while creating one of the molds, it became apparent that it may have been slightly damaged during shipping so I stopped using it immediately. I contacted the seller about getting a replacement, and I received a response the same day letting me know that another tray and set of molding putty was on the way. No hassle, no questions asked. Touch of White Smile&#x27;s commitment to customer service is truly impressive. (Thanks, Matt.)    As for the product itself, I am very pleased with the end result. After receiving my replacement tray I made the second mold and shipped everything out. Roughly two weeks later I received the custom trays, 2 syringes of whitening solution, and a small case for the trays. The trays are thin, light, and fit perfectly. The whitening solution is strong -- I may have to cut down on the recommended application time as my teeth were very sensitive afterwards -- and my teeth were noticeably whiter after the first bleaching. Very effective. And for those interested, everything I was received was marked as made in the USA.    I&#x27;m happy with my trays and I would recommend this kit to anyone looking for a (more) affordable solution to whitening their teeth. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> First, let me point out that I am not a whitening addict. I don&#x27;t spend $200 a year on whitening products. However, Even if you only use this twice a year, it will save you money within a few years and will make the whitening experience a LOT less tedious. I originally hesitated due to the high cost of this, but decided that using less gel would make up for it over time. The comfort of being able to whiten without being miserable was enough of a reason for me. The quality is somewhat dependent on how good of a mold you make. But it&#x27;s easy to do it right. I believe this does a better job, covers more area, and is cheaper in the long run than strips.    READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY... a couple notes.    1. Push the mold straight up, don&#x27;t push the front then back. You&#x27;re instinct will be to roll it, but try not to. Just straight up, evenly (or straight down for bottom set).    2. The plastic container that the molding material goes into had to be designed to fit all mouths. As a result it won&#x27;t cover you&#x27;re molars very well. The material will glob up a little by your molars. I suggest using your fingers to form that glob around those back teeth. Also, this isn&#x27;t too important because it&#x27;s not a visible part of your smile.    I thought I hadn&#x27;t made a great mold (see #2), but the resulting trays were perfect. So, if you&#x27;re mold looks average, you&#x27;ll get an awesome tray. If you&#x27;re mold is just really bad, email them and they&#x27;ll send you more for a very small cost. The customer service is great.    Highly recommended product and seller.    Robert Jason</li>
    <li> Very good price very good product and does what it says it does. Just as good as my wife&#x27;s dental made teeth whitening system for a whole lot less can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> A physician, I had custom trays for bleaching made at my dentist&#x27;s office some years ago for an exorbitant price.  Worked well, but upper wore out and I&#x27;d lost lower (the dog may have run off with it...), relocated cross country and changed dentists, etc.  Tried OTC products but they are expensive for what they are--not very good.  Found this kit online and decided to give it a try.  Very glad I did.  This kit allows you to make the impression yourself and the company does the rest.  Within days of sending in the impression, I received trays that fit perfectly.  In fact, these trays are better than the ones I had gotten from my previous dentist.  So I am whitening my teeth again, vowing to drink less coffee again, and have gone ahead and ordered a night guard from the same company.  By cutting out the dentists in the middle--no offense to my dentist, who is great, and who advised me not to go through her for the trays because it is too expensive--this company provides a high quality product at a fraction of the price.  I strongly recommend this product and service.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product, it IS exactly as described and saves you hundreds of dollars from the dentist. This is my second set of trays (for my husband) and the customer service was impeccable.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent system for cost effective tooth whitening.  They send out a tooth mold kit, you return a rough mold, they refine it and make/send you some trays.  This is HUNDREDS of dollars cheaper than going to the dentist for whitening and produces the same result.      The peroxide gel is in a quality syringe and appears to be well manufactured with even viscosity, transparency and concentration.  As someone who has worked in drug manufacturing I am confident that this is a quality product.      The customer service is excellent.  I recently contacted Touch of White by phone to request an addition to my order and the sales representative was able to assist me without incident.  Good job Touch of White!</li>
    <li> These trays fit perfectly on my teeth like glue. First I got my impression kit to make these trays in a week. Sent it back through this yellow envelope that you get with impression kit. I received the trays in 2 weeks with two 10mL syringe of 35% through mail. I sent it on Monday and received on Saturday of next week. Don&#x27;t cost a penny more unless you want to buy more gel, trays, ect...Making the impression is not hard at all. You have less than 45 sec to mix these play-doh like material of blue and white together as they are beginning to harden. Put them in the plastic tray and push up on your teeth and leave it for around 4 minute to stabilize. These custom trays fit flawless, flexible and should last forever. Don&#x27;t ever have to hold them with your fingers or bite down to make them stay like other cheap trays.</li>
    <li> My friend got a product through her dentist for three times the price, and I purchased this one. They truly are very similar and this is well worth the price. The molds are very easy to make if you read the directions thoroughly before starting, and the trays are delivered in an adequate amount of time. Customer service was very helpful as well. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a full 5/5 rating is because the whitener that it came with and the extra that I purchased got chunky very quickly and would not come out of the injection tubes they come in. I haven&#x27;t decided where to get my next whitener, but the trays are well worth the cost by themselves!</li>
    <li> Years ago I had professional trays made for teeth whitening, and they worked very well. When I needed new trays, I balked at the thought of paying hundreds of dollars for a new set. One day I was checking on the internet for whitening gel, and stumbled across Touch of White Smile trays. I was excited and wanted to get started right away as I was going away on vacation soon. I emailed their customer service and asked for their help. I was given expedited service, and received my trays the day of my flight--awesome! It is rare in my experience to have such personal attention. I greatly appreciated it. And yes, the trays are very good!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Excellent Service.. Called and asked about expediting my order and they were very friendly. The Custom Trays I bought fit perfectly. Excellent price concidering most dentists charge $200+ for the same product\\&quot;</li>
    <li> When I was last at my dentist getting a crown fitted and they were making the mold, I thought to myself \\&quot;I could do this...wonder if there is a teeth whitening kit online\\&quot;.  I had done whitening several years back through the dentist, but had lost my bottom tray and didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars just to replace the tray through the dentist.  Sure enough - this kit seems like the exact same process that my dental office used.  The molds fit perfectly and I ordered the 40% gel offered in the kit, and my teeth look great.  I would recommend you don&#x27;t bite down too hard, and follow the directions of pushing the stuff back towards the tray as you make your molds.  The directions are good - I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The trays were easy to make, shipping super fast and I could tell a difference in a single application.  I also ordered the remineralization gel which is nice.    My teeth have definitely lightened up and the custom trays are so much better than the ones you make with warm water.  Just like my dentist wanted to charge me $600 for!</li>
    <li> This is truly the Best Teeth Whitening Kit available. I have used all the over the counter strips and gels and they were so messy and honestly got frustrated by the whitening of them. I recently went to the dentist and they priced a custom mouth piece at $375.00 and $15.00 for the bleaching gel. I wanted my teeth whitened but was NOT going to spend that kind of money. I found this kit and ordered it. The mold itself was extremely easy to do, sent the molds back to the lab and about 2 weeks later received my bleaching kit. I was amazed after one use the fit of the cutome trays and the look of my teeth. I am an avid coffee drinker and it whitened my smile about 3 shades after the first use. I LOVE this product and will recommend to all my friends.    [[ASIN:B001COG778 The Best Teeth Whitening Kits and Bleaching Kit Available. Custom Mouth Pieces. These Teeth Whitening Trays Are Made in a Professional Dental Lab. 36% Gel for 60 to 80 applications. If you want the best you&#x27;ve found it! Many People Use Them for Night or...]]</li>
    <li> I have had a bleaching tray from my dentist&#x27;s office that wasn&#x27;t this good! They&#x27;re made from a silicone like material (not hard plastic like my old ones) which is very comfortable to wear. The fit is perfect. The quality of the bleach supplied with the trays is good. The impression making process is not unnecessarily complicated, clearly explained and easy to follow. Once the impressions were made and mailed off, the completed trays were received in 2 weeks without prompting, which I thought was an excellent response time for a custom made item. My only suggestion (and I&#x27;m not complaining, just suggesting) is that the merchant may want to consider some variable sizing with the impression making kit. As a result of having what might be larger than average teeth, I am not able to bleach the last 1/2 of each left and right lower back teeth or the complete left and right upper back teeth. The trays are exactly as the impressions were sent, it&#x27;s just that the impression making material was clearly for a smaller mouth and was inadequate to completely accommodate all my teeth. I am not sure how critical it is to bleach just everything that far back but it would be nice to have all my teeth all one color, at least once in my life. Please consider variable sizing in the molding material. One size does not fit all. Otherwise, very good value for the money, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was so worried that I did not get the molds right and was amazed of when I got the trays back how perfectly they fit. The customer service was 100% and turn around time from receiving the molds to getting the trays was about a month.  The whole experience was a good one and I am extremely happy with the trays and so are my nice white teeth. I highly recommend this product you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> First let me state that I never write reviews, but after my experience here. How could I not?!    The product came, exactly as described in a very timely manor. I made the trays and shipped it back per their instructions. 5 business days later I had 2 professional made trays along with the extras I ordered. The trays fit PERFECTLY! They were made just like you would get locally at your dentist office, only these cost 1/5th the price and in my opinion were easier to get.  Less time spent waiting for the dentist, making trips back/forth to the office.    You will not be disappointed.  Stop thinking about it and buy it now!</li>
    <li> Here is how it works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You place your order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They ship you the ingredients.  You mix ingredients (read instructions TWICE before starting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When mixing the blue and white putty, I found that mashing and squishing it in your (sanitized) hands was most effective.  Just like play-do from when you were a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Practice biting into the trays before using the putty so you get a feel for your teeth placement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Once the putty is in the trays, DO NOT roll.  Straight up or down only.  Hold your mouth open and still for the instructed time.  For the first few minutes, you probably should delicately hold the tray in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- As the putty dries, you will feel a slight pressure on your teeth.  Actual pressure, *not* pain, you can just tell that the putty is hardening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Once the instructed time has passed, I suggest lifting your lip and tapping the putty to ensure it has hardened thoroughly.  It should feel like hard plastic when complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Carefully remove the mold from your teeth.  You label your molds with your name and email address (they provide everything you need to do so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You bag up your teeth molds and send them back (they include packing and return postage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You wait.  One week or two.  (Two for me.)  During this time, your trays are created with your molds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They send back your professional trays custom-made for your own chompers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Your work isn&#x27;t done yet!  The molds reach up over your gum line.  If you plan on whitening your teeth with your trays, this is NOT a good thing.  Trust me.  Whitening gel is hell-fire for your gums.  So:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Take a pair of GOOD scissors, and start cutting away the excess.  You will NOT get it perfect.  It&#x27;s better to have a little more tray than a little less.  Take your time!  One hapless snip could ruin all your work and patience.  I suggest placing them on your teeth every so often infront of a mirror to carefully monitor your progress.  Now that you&#x27;ve gotten rid of most of the excess... You&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the actual review:&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THESE!  I know my suggestions above may seem overwhelming, but once you get the ingredients and instructions, you&#x27;ll see how simple it is.  I threw out suggestions from my experience.  The final trays come with two whitening gels, but I strongly suggest you buy \\&quot;Re-mineralizing Gels.\\&quot;  The ingredients in teeth whitening products are hard on your teeth.  You need to take care of your teeth, so buy that gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the trays, they fit perfectly.  They&#x27;re very comfortable, and I like that they are clear so I can actually see the gel I use to whiten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, and most importantly: ***Customer service is WONDERFUL***  I can&#x27;t tell you what a relief it is for a company to respect their paying customers.  I sent two emails and both were responded to promptly, courteously, and full of *relevant* information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Touch of White for a great product and business.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that the product works very well and is probably the best deal you&#x27;re going to find on professional whitening trays.  The trays fit perfectly and so far the whitening process has gone very well.  If you&#x27;ve been looking at white strips I&#x27;d highly recommend spending a little bit more and getting these trays.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because the product presentation is lacking to say the least.  While the instructions are fairly straight forward, there are numerous grammatical errors that will leave you wondering exactly what you got yourself into.  People are going to have a hard time believing this is a high quality product when the instructions appear to be written by a 10 year old.  I attempted to clarify the instructions from their website but that isn&#x27;t exactly of the highest quality either.  Even the title of the product as listed on Amazon is a little on the ghetto side (47 words for a title is just a tad over the top).  This low-quality product presentation almost made me pass on ordering despite the great reviews from fellow Amazon shoppers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal of this review isn&#x27;t to trash whoever created the instructions, website, etc.  Instead I&#x27;d like to assure other potential buyers to overlook this lack of professionalism as the product really is of high quality.  To the owner of this company:  I highly recommend spending a few hundred bucks to have somebody rewrite the instructions and revamp your website.  It will more than pay for itself.</li>
    <li> Following another review here I bought this product a couple months ago after trying various other over the counter products.    I received the 1st shipment very quickly (a couple days after ordering) and was a bit nervous during the molding step... I had not done anything like since elementary school, but it was actually easy and barely took any time. Also having this paste in my mouth was not bad as I had expected, it was very much ok.    About a week later, I received my new package and was very happy to see that the trays fit perfectly my teeth (so I did a good job too!).  They don&#x27;t hurt my teeth like other trays I&#x27;ve tried, they don&#x27;t hurt my jaw either because I do not need to forcefully keep my mouth closed or something, they just stay put where they should be!    I have not had any sensitivity issue due to the gel or the trays, and after a few weeks my teeth looked way better than before.  So all in all I am happy :) and it saved me the price I would have paid a dentist for the same thing...      Now remember that you still need to brush a few times a day with good products to make the best out it!    Cheers</li>
    <li> The Touch of White Smile whitening system really works, and is an incredible bargain.  I have applied the 36% whitening gel once daily for several days, and already I can see that my teeth are much whiter.  Compared to whitening strips, one of the many advantages of Touch of White Smile&#x27;s whitening trays and gels is that I can treat selectively only one tooth if desired.  One of my teeth was knocked partially out during a basketball game some time ago.  That tooth had been darker than my other teeth for many years, but not any longer.  I have applied the whitening gel to only that one tooth a few additional times in order to whiten that tooth to the point that it matches my other teeth.  I simply whiten all of my teeth in the morning, then I selectively whiten that one tooth in the evening.  I would not be able to selectively whiten one tooth using whitening strips.  I purchased an additional whitening kit for one of my friends, whose teeth became discolored when she was a child, presumably due to Tetracycline antibiotic treatment.  After she applies the 36% whitening gel in the evening, her teeth become whitened non-uniformly and exhibit horizontal stripes.  However, by the following morning, the stripes disappear completely from her teeth.  I can see that with each successive application of the whitening gel, her teeth become progressively whiter.  Some reviewers have commented that Touch of White Smile&#x27;s instructions for creating the dental impressions are filled with grammatical errors and are difficult to understand.  However, I found the instructions to be nearly error-free and easy to understand.  Perhaps these instructions have been re-written in response to the comments of earlier reviewers.  Although the Amazon description of the Touch of White Smile whitening system doesn&#x27;t mention it, those of you with sensitive teeth may order 22% whitening gel instead of, or in addition to, the 36% whitening gel that is typically supplied.  After you have made your dental impressions, you send them back to Touch of White Smile in a prepaid envelope.  In preparation for that shipment, you must fill out a form to indicate your address, and that form allows you to order additional whitening gel and other products.  You can specify on the form that you would prefer 22% gel instead of 36% gel.  Or, for a mere $6, you can just order the 22% gel in addition to the 36% gel.  I recommend that when you return your dental impressions, you also order the fluoride re-mineralization gel.  As I recall, it will cost you $5 with no shipping costs, because Touch of White Smile will ship your whitening kit and any additional items to you for free, as part of your original purchase.  Or, you can order the fluoride gel directly from Amazon: [[ASIN:B001TJ3S5A *New* Remineralization Gel for Use After you have bleached your teeth by Touch of White Smile]].  I ordered the fluoride gel from Amazon on the same order that I used to order my whitening kit.  Shipping for both items cost me $7.49, instead of the $5.49 plus $4.99 that I would have paid had I ordered these two items via two separate orders from Amazon.</li>
    <li> So much foam is produced inside the mouth that it is hard to keep the trays on for the suggested amount of time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often I write a comprehensive review on a product, but I&#x27;m making an exception in this case.  I not only rate this company outstanding but I have never dealt with an internet company that treated me in such a superior manner.  My trays they produced were better than what I received from my dentist which cost $367.  I had to wait several weeks to provide the impressions because I was in the midst of having front teeth capped.  It took three to four weeks to receive the finished product (caps).  I immediately took impressions and sent them to Touch of White Smile and received the finished product in a week.  I compared the trays to the ones I received from the dentist and the Touch of White trays not only were made of a better product but fit in my mouth much better as well.  During the time I received the initial package from Touh of White Smile to when I received the kit, I was constantly in touch with the company via E-Mail.  I received responses to my E-Mail within hours (sometimes minutes) not days.  This is now my favorite internet company for teeth whitening and I will never waste money at a dentist again.  Thank you Matt at Touch of White for everything.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that I would have trouble making my own teeth molds, and even after I did so I was afraid I hadn&#x27;t done it right and they might not fit well. I was wrong. They fit like a glove and only require a tiny dab of gel. I saw a noticeable improvement compared to the over the counter products I&#x27;ve tried, and they are surprisingly comfortable to wear for the time required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is as of March 14, 2012, and at this point I feel the company has resolved every issue I noticed people complained about in previous reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays arrived in about 12 days from the day I mailed the molds. The instructions were clear with no noticeable typos, and the trays were perfectly trimmed when I received them. There was no need to modify them in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I have no idea how long the gel will last, but it takes such a tiny amount to fill the trays I suspect they will wind up being the cheapest teeth whitening product I&#x27;ve ever bought on a &#x27;cost per treatment basis&#x27;. In addition the perfectly fitting trays are without question the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever used. After a minute or two you almost forget you have them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I&#x27;ve also used was the Crest 3D Intensive Professional Effects, which is probably the best over the counter treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried, however this product is both more comfortable to use and gets better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is of course more work as it requires you to make your own molds, and it takes time to get them, but if you are looking for the best whitener product you can find, it is in the same class as the $300+ Dentist treatments I&#x27;ve  had done. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Received my trays today and they fit perfectly.  I haven&#x27;t use the whitening gel yet but gel is gel.  The trays are what is the main cost in this product.    Nice work.</li>
    <li> This is an unbelievable product at an unbelievable price.  These are professional custom bleaching trays at a fraction of the cost that you will pay in your dentist&#x27;s office.  These are the EXACT same trays made by your dentist.  The service is personal and professional and FAST.  If you are looking for bleaching trays, I highly recommend this product.  Custom trays promote better use of product and better and quicker whitening.  These trays are awesome!  BUY THEM!</li>
    <li> These trays and gel are of same quality but a fraction of the cost of what my dentist was charging. The process to make, instructions, and customer service was great!  I would highly recommend this to a friend (and as a matter of fact I did buy a kit for a Christmas gift for someone..)</li>
    <li> The molds came in just over a week and were shipped back to me the following week. I was very satisfied with the way that they fit and have been using the product for just under a week with dramatic results already. I am very satisfied with the product and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this whitening kit. It is my 3rd time purchasing it. In my opinion in works better than going to the dentist. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my teeth. Surprised that it only cost $50. It arrived very fast, perfect because I needed it befor vacation. You guys will be so happy with this. It is truly amazing. Worth 20 times the price!!!</li>
    <li> These teeth whitening trays are exactly what they say. Just like the ones the dentist wants $400 for. You just eliminate the middle man. Very easy to make the impressions at home. Send them off in a postage paid package, just like my dentist would do, and then about 10 days or so later you have your Trays delivered to your address not the dentist office, You save that trip back to the dentist. I tried the trays and gel for the first time last night, they are great</li>
    <li> Totally works! Even after the first use. I was very skeptical but again, it works!! Read the instructions all the way through before you start and keep a timer next to you.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t yet loaded these babies up, but so far so good.  Arrived on time  Instructions are clear on how to take impressions  Easy to take impressions  Easy to send back as post paid envelope included (nice touch)  Took about 10 days for kit to come back    Will update this review once I&#x27;ve used them a few times    Definitely more cost effective than the dentist ($350)!</li>
    <li> Product works great.  My only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it took a long time to receive the product and the finished molds.</li>
    <li> The kit came quickly in the mail and had no problems making impressions. very easy to understand</li>
    <li> This kit is awesome. I paid $400 to get trays from my dentist, then lost them. This kit is just as good, maybe better, than what I got from the dentist. The trays fit great. Now I have my pearly whites back!</li>
    <li> I am not going to bore with a really long review, but this was one of the best online purchases I ever made.  Crest white strips always had my teeth hurting like crazy, but with this stuff I could keep the tray in for an hour and not feel pain at all.  Of course just to be safe, use Sensodyne if your teeth are really sensitive like mine. People keep commenting on how nice my teeth look now and how bright they are.  Ignore the spelling mistakes and you will be happy.  I will try to post some pictures in the next few days if I get time.</li>
    <li> Making the molds were easy.  I returned them in the mail and in a week I had the trays.  They are as good as the ones that I got from the dentist a few years ago.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my self and my husband. The molds were easy to make. The bleaching trays that were made from the molds turned out well. I&#x27;ve only use the tray 4 times thus far but see a quit a differance. I&#x27;ve use store bought trays in the past that were loose in my mouth and cause me to gag.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOSH!  THIS KIT IS AWESOME!  I RECEIVED MY MOLDING KIT,  MAILED BACK MY IMPRESSIONS, AND GOT MY NEW MOLDS AND GEL JUST LAST NIGHT. LAST NIGHT I APPLIED MY 1ST TREATMENT.  I HAD STAINS ON THE TOPS OF MY BOTTOM TEETH FOR YEARS AND THOUGHT NOTHING COULD REMOVE THEM.   THE 1ST TREATMENT REMOVED 90% OF THEM!  I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.  !  I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL TOOTH WHITENING KITS AND NOTHING CAN COMPARE TO TOUCH OF WHITE SMILE.  I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THE RESULTS IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS!  I ONLY WISHED I HAD DONE THIS A LONG TIME AGO.  THANKS FOR GIVING ME BACK MY SMILE!  WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
    <li> I finally received the dental trays today.  The fit is absolutely perfect.  I am not going to review the whitening gel as I assume it will work differently for each person.  Expect the wait time from when the kit is ordered until you receive the final product to be 3 weeks.  A bit impatient on my end, but now that the trays have arrived, I will say their quality and fit makes it worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I received my kit in a short amount of time and sent it off the same day.  After sending my molds in they were sent back in a week but were lost by the postal service.  The customer service could not have been any better in helping me with this issue.  They were quick to respond and willing to replace the lost trays.  Thankfully the post office was able to find my package a week after delivering it to the wrong address.  You can not ask for better customer service than what I received from this company.     The whitening trays and gel are great products.  They trays fit perfectly and my teeth were a few shades whiter just after a few uses.  I have plenty of whitening gel left over to use to maintain my teeth for quite some time.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to get whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the most money I have ever saved on a product in my entire life. I was skeptical about this product because I had called numerous dentist and this same product was going for well over $300. After reading numerous reviews I took a chance that I don&#x27;t regret. This is my second day using this product and I am seeing results my mouth pieces fit perfectly. I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to get super white teeth super cheap. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Instructions for making the molds were very easy to follow.  Trays arrived in 2 weeks.  Quality of trays was excellent; better than what I received from my dentist.</li>
    <li> Tired of the dentist ripping you off for procedures? This is real easy to do and saves you a ton of cash. Turn around time is fast, probably faster than your dentist can do. I am ordering another one for my girlfriend and brother. Actually make a rather cool present for family and friends.</li>
    <li> They did a great job.  The molds are perfect.  They were easy to use and look just like the ones I had made from the dentist for $600.  Quick shipping.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Changing my review to ONE star.  After using for a few weeks out of the year, the trays stretched-out.  The gel no longer was in contact with my teeth, and they became useless.  I contacted the seller who told me there was nothing they could do.  I&#x27;ve had to throw them away.  The ones I purchased from the dentist lasted forever.</li>
    <li> I received the mouthpiece back today and it is terrible! They did not trim around the teeth impressions so the mouthpiece will hold the bleach on your gums about a 1/4 inches above the tooth. This will burn your gums! Do not get from here there are other places that do a much better job. I got two others from another company(the whole family got them) and they came out fantastic.</li>
    <li> Make sure you take your time and read the instructions until you fully understand everything! Awesome service and customer service. Very good results!</li>
    <li> Had been thinking about doing something for my dingy teeth for a number of years.  My problem was compounded by the fact that the two upper teeth in the center are crowns and after many years are less dingy than the others  -- it is pretty obvious they are crowns.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to say that the product worked for me as advertised after only a week&#x27;s application.  There is some discomfort (a slight burning sensation to the gums) when the product is applied but the results are well worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> Update: The trays and gel arrived. They fit very well. I think over a month was too long, and I don&#x27;t understand why they never got back to me, but I&#x27;m glad they are here. It&#x27;s very reasonable for a professional system, much cheaper than going to a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First post: I also received the molds, and returned them, but then never got the final product. I have tried to call Touch of White many times, and only get their answering machine. They haven&#x27;t returned my messages. I also sent them an email, and didn&#x27;t get a response. Are they still in business? How do you get a refund from Amazon?</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with my tray and gel. I got the materials in a timely manner and they did what they were advertised to do. So I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after being constantly put down by the over the counter brands (crest white strips ect..) and was amazed at how quickly and efficiently the product worked. But it wasn&#x27;t only the gel, the custom trays that fit exactly to your teeth are what made the product unique, and affordable...a must buy!</li>
    <li> The molds that were ordered arrived very fast and the directions were extremely easy to follow. I waited 3 weeks for my trays and gel to come, but when I emailed them, they were very helpful and I recieved my trays soon after. It must&#x27;ve been post office&#x27;s fault for slow delivery intially. The trays fit perfect and customer service was excellent! If you&#x27;re thinking about getting your own trays for bleaching, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t understand the instructions,  it said you had in register the kit, I totally didn&#x27;t see how this product worked</li>
    <li> This kit is the real deal. Works as described and the customer service is excellent. Matt quickly answered every one of my questions. Very satisfied. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is one of those situations where a little patience is well worth the wait. I ordered this product expecting that you get what you pay for. I was surprised. Believe me when I tell you that these trays are worth the wait. Save yourself several hundred dollars and buy these. Your friends will need sunglasses to see your smile. Your teeth will be so white you might be asked if they are made of ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these for Christmas or that person you love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are easy and the finished product fits like a glove.</li>
    <li> The molds were easy to make and the trays fit well.  (I also use them for fluoride treatments that the DDS prescribed.)  My teeth were very discolored, but with repeated use of the 36 % gel they are much whiter - even my dentist was impressed. I have tried other whitening gels that were supposedly 35-36% concentration that were runny, full of air bubbles, and did not whiten nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Matt and his team of experts has changed my smile in the first 30 minutes to a smile&lt;br /&gt;I am very proud to wear and it will only get better from additional applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there were six stars info@touchofwhitesmile.com would receive the award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very happy client,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uncle Pete</li>
    <li> my treys fit perfect i sow the different in my first use I looooove them, the best teeth whitening ever.</li>
    <li> the kit fits perfect to my teeth. I started to notice results after third application. But it causes so much foam in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Mouth pieces were not properly trimmed so they just wont hold in my mouth. Had it been a cheap product I would understand, but this is definitely not worth the money the seller charges.</li>
    <li> before ordering this kit, i had used the Opalescence Trèswhite Supreme Mint Whitening System trays.  while i was quite pleased with the Opalescence trays, i had an interest in purchasing customized trays.  unlike non-customized trays, customized trays offer, obviously, a better fit, as well as the ability to decide on how much gel is applied.  in addition, customized trays can serve as night guards for people who, like me, have a tendency to grind their teeth at night.  considering the price of these customized trays versus Opalescence trays, these are a much better value over the long run.      the whole process was smooth and easy and the finished product was right on par with my expectations. ordered from amazon, had my kit in about 7 days.  unlike some, i didn&#x27;t have a problem with the directions.  its not advanced chemistry, just mix white and blue, quickly stick it on the mold, and bite down and hold.  easy!    once i sent in my finished molds, i received my finished trays back in about 5 days.  top tray met my expectations:  fit my teeth nicely with little to no overlap on the gums.    the lower tray was less than perfect: the tray was short some teeth on the left side.  while some may feel that this would automatically warrant a four star review, it was the response by Touch of White (TOW) that to me more than made up for this shortcoming.  i wrote TOW at 10:30 pm on Tuesday night and i received a response within 45 minutes!  after we clarified the issue, TOW sent out another tray, the next day, which met my expectations when I received.  they continued to follow up with me to ensure that all of my concerns/expectations were met.  i can&#x27;t remember the last time i had a similar experience when purchasing a good/service.    this is my first set of customized trays so i am not in a position to compare their quality to anything else.  that said, they appear, to me, to be of good quality.  they look durable and i expect that i will be able to use them for quitesome time.    i have used them a couple of time so far.  they fit great.  i like them better than the Opalescence trays because of the customized fit, not as much excess gel, and can easily be warn overnight.  if you intend to whiten your teeth on a long term basis, than this is best value for your money.</li>
    <li> I love this.... I received my mouth molds and they fit perfect. Only use a small amount of the whitening gel in the mold, then after your done use the re-mineralization gel it will make your teeth feel better. I love this system. Will recommend to other people. Got this in two week same time as the reg Dentist.  Try it just make sure you follow the directions... I had no problem even with the type-o&#x27;;s so what I have long nails and I make those errors all the time.  T</li>
    <li> Yes, the instructions have terrible grammatical errors, and I had a few moments of &amp;#34;Am I really going to put this stuff in my mouth?&amp;#34; when making the molds. However, the instructions do provide enough information and I am very pleased with the custom trays. I trimmed the excess material around the gumline, as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel provided is more than enough. In fact I only used about a third of one tube in a year. I am happy with the whitening results. My teeth look naturally whiter, not fake.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing these trays but.... all of the emails i sent to the company were returned very fast and the customer service was great.  Also, the trays have a fantastic fit to my teeth.  They arrived very fast and I could not be happier.  I will re-post a comment after I start the whitening.  Definitely recommend this to others.  People who say they don&#x27;t fit must have messed up when they took the molds of their own teeth.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY IRRITATES YOUR GUMS AND TURNS THEM WHITE! I HAVE LEARNED A LIL TRICK TO RUB VASELINE OR ORAJEL ON YOUR GUMS BEFORE PUTTING THIS PRODUCT ON. THE IMPRESSIONS I SENT IN WERE SENT BACK TO ME WRONG. I RECEIVED THE SAME FOR THE TOP AND BOTTOM. DON&#x27;T KNOW IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ANYONE ELSE.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit because I lost the top impression tray from when I had my teeth professionally whitened many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the quality of trays I received from this kit were close to that of the trays my dentist made.  The trays I received from my dentist were a slightly softer material and had a slight \\&quot;pocket\\&quot; in front of each tooth which I assume was to keep all of the gel from squeezing out when inserting the tray.  The total cost of trays and gel from my dentist back in 1999 was about $350.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to this kit.  I am satisfied with this kit but think the 36% gel is a bit stronger than I prefer.  I originally used 17% gel and had ghost white teeth within two weeks without the pain that I am experiencing with the 36% gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this with the cautionary advice to be careful with the amount of gel you put in the trays.  It takes very little gel considering the tray is a perfect mold of your teeth which will force much of the gel out once you apply the tray.  The amount of gel supplied should fill your trays well over a hundred times so if you overdo it and your gums start burning, pull out the tray, rinse with water and try again.  It&#x27;s better to waste a little gel up front learning how to use an appropriate amount than it is to have plenty of gel but irritated gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two cents.</li>
    <li> I had saved some money to get my teeth professionally whitened but then realized that I needed a nite guard (because of teeth clenching) so I dedicated that money toward the nite guard for which my dentist was charging me $450. I then saw Touch of White on Amazon and read the amazing reviews for the whitening product; I was happy to find something that would allow be to whiten my teeth at such a low cost. I ordered the product and was surprised to learn that I was also able to order a nite guard for an extra $25. I thought I would see if the guard was suitable before I went to the dentist and spent 450 for the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CREATING THE IMPRESSIONS&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous about this as I did not want to make a mistake and ruin the whole thing. However, after reading the instructions carefully a couple of times, the process was actually very easy. Sure, the packaging is very basic and the instructions contain some typos, but who cares if it keeps the costs low? Not me.&lt;br /&gt;I sent the impressions in and received my trays within two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHITENING PROCESS&lt;br /&gt;It took me a few days to get the process down right, so here is what I have been doing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I prepare the gel (36%) in the trays first by applying a drop of gel in every tooth of the tray on the side that will be touching the front of the teeth&lt;br /&gt;2. I apply some petroleum jelly to my gums, and Orajel on the roof of my mouth near my front teeth as well as on the middle of the top tray where it touches the palate. The reason for this is in case the gel leaks out of the trays, it prevents burning. I had the idea for the Orajel only later after having the bad experience of burning my palate, it was really uncomfortable. I also think applying the gel specifically to one side of the tray and not just in the middle has helped control where the gel goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the trays in for only 30 minutes the first days and then increased to one hour per day. I am now in my second week of treatment and my teeth are a lot whiter. I don&#x27;t think I would have gotten these results with an over the counter product and I am satisfied with the results so far. I know we are not supposed to drink coffee during this process but I have had 3 or 4 cups and I don&#x27;t think it has affected the whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue, aside from the palate burning that the Orajel has solved, is the sensitivity I get about 5 minutes after I remove the trays. It&#x27;s strange, it&#x27;s a sudden sensitivity in my bottom teeth, it lasts only a few seconds but it&#x27;s a little painful. I purchased the remineralization gel which I intend to use after the end of the week to hopefully help desensitize the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one note on the night guard: It fit perfectly and therefore I cancelled my dentist appointment! It did come back with one side longer than the other however. I emailed the company and received a reply almost immediately offering to trim it down for me. After using it though, I thought it was ok the way it was and did not need to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the whitening product and thrilled to have saved the money for my nite guard.eatment and my teeth are a lot whiter.

    <li> My trays weren&#x27;t a perfect fit and I think that may have had some affect on the whitening process. Overall, I&#x27;d buy this again if the darn trays fit properly.</li>
    <li> too bulky to do. go to a dentist &amp; get a tray done.  They were prompt. Florida mailing. Looks like it is done in the garage.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I felt like I had to for this one. I received the kit fairly fast. The instructions were clear and the mould making process was easy. I sent the moulds in and waited. After a couple weeks passed I contacted Touch of White to see if my my trays were coming. Matt was very friendly and stayed in touch. He ensured me that my trays were coming and I received them the next day. As for the trays themselves, they fit perfectly. I&#x27;m excited to use them over my cheap heat form trays that I previously had.</li>
    <li> AMAZON CUSTOMERS!!  This is it! Amazing results!!! Custom trays!! If you looking for thr best whitrning kit you found it!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the molding kit and have to say i absolutely love it. Simple and yet easy to do. I received everything rather quickly  especially the mouth piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did run into a little misunderstanding about the product which was my fault on my behalf. I had misplaced the directions etc. i contacted them and they responded pretty quickly as we went back in forth by email. They were very helpful and proffessional. So on the note this gets 5 stars from .. Plus the product is amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> After I made my molds and sent them in, I received my whitening trays within a few weeks. They fit fine. The whitening process went without a hitch, however, I did not feel that my teeth were much whiter at the conclusion, even though I followed the timeline suggested. My teeth are normally fairly white so maybe that is why I could not see much of a difference. I have used various whitening strips and whitening toothpastes over the years that I felt did a better job of whitening. I did develop some gum discomfort after a few treatments, but I know this is relatively common. The discomfort was not enough to deter me from using the product, however, the lack of great results will likely motivate me to try another product.</li>
    <li> After two uses my teeth were SOO sensitive and I could barely eat or drink anything. And the taste when it hits your tongue is disgusting! I wish they made whitener that doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity.</li>
    <li> It has been nearly a year since I ordered this product.  Took me a few months before I even made my impressions to mail back, and when I finally did I did I messed it up.  I emailed this fellow and he was kind enough to send me another batch of molding material.  My second try was better but still not what I though he would need to make a satisfactory set of trays.  I mailed both impressions to him explaining what I&#x27;d done and asked him to let me know how to proceed.  BEFORE I even had the chance to email him with a follow-up inquiry I received my trays in the mail.  I am astonished at how well he made them from the poor impressions I&#x27;d sent.  They fit PERFECTLY and are doing the job nicely.  So a great big kudos to this fellow for 1) A truly great and professional grade product, and 2) His very excellent work ethic and customer service.  This is a really great product at a very fair price and this gentleman has exceeded my expectations! If you are looking for whitening trays THIS is your number one source!!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product 3 times since I got it (busy schedule), and all I can say is that it is wonderful!  If I can see a remarkable difference from the minimal time I have put in so far, I can only imagine how white my teeth will get once I start using it on a regular basis!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better than the product itself is the customer service this company provided me.  I had to redo one of my trays, ask several questions and have bothered Matt at this company many, many times.  Each and every time he has been patient and courteous and has met my needs 100%!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order this product, not only because it works...but because you will be happy with the attention you are given should you have any issues.  Companies like this don&#x27;t exist much anymore, unfortunately.  It&#x27;s good to recognize the people who still care about their customers.</li>
    <li> I was using the generic bleaching trays and they just weren&#x27;t doing it for me. I saw this and thought it was a much better deal. The trays fit perfect!!!! They are just like my teeth. So in all this product saved me time from going to the dentist to get impressions and bleach which would cost a fortune and money. I haven&#x27;t used the bleach just yet but it&#x27;s plenty of it. I&#x27;m glad I stumbled on this.</li>
    <li> This was such an inexpensive, fast and easy way to purchase whitening trays! The instructions are clear and exact and customer service is responsive and helpful.  The trays are soft and comfortable, and the gel noticably whitens the teeth after one application!  I highly recommend this product and this seller!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The mouth trays are too small unless you have very small teeth (mouth).  The tray will not cover all teeth, it is too short.  In addition, it is too narrow and needs to be pressed on.  I was not able to make a mold.  I sent an email to the vendor and the vendor stated they would call to talk with me in person.  The vendor never bothered.  I am returning the unused product.  I would  not recommend spending your money on this product unless your mouth is very small.  I cannot comment on the final product because I was unable to make the mold.  I can say that if there are any problems, customer service does not exist.</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding. Making the teeth molds is very simplistic. The bleaching mouth pieces are superior to the ones I paid a dentist $500 to make. I highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I paid my dentist $150 for a custom fit upper tray. The tray did not fit well. At first it was too tight against my gums, then it quickly lost its form. It was loose around my teeth. You can&#x27;t beat the price of these trays (upper and lower). The fit is perfect! The strength of the whitening gel is stronger than the gel my dentist gave me. I was thrilled to see an order form was included in my order to order extra trays and whitening gel at a discounted price. BEST DEAL EVER!</li>
    <li> I received the product did the teeth impressions got it back with the 2 gels did it but didn&#x27;t see a major change.  Well still using it and it changing slowing.  So I guess it works ok I just wish it could a change more quicker than this.  Thats the only thing I would say needs approvement.</li>
    <li> I received the molds within a week of ordering the product and had absolutely no trouble (despite my original worry that I would not bite down correctly).  The important part here is to make certain you follow all the instructions and label BOTH trays with your name and e-mail address.  Register the product on the site included with the instructions, as well.  The seller even offers a postage paid envelope to return the trays to his office; I received my whitening gel, trays and case within 1 week from my dropping off in the local postal box.  They fit perfectly to my mouth and although my gums were slightly sensitive the first day or two from the gel, this sensation dissipated and the product works wonderfully to whiten my coffee-stained teeth.  I&#x27;ve recommended this item to several of my friends who&#x27;ve commented on how great my new smile appears!  Thanks for a quality product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I just decided to give it a go. Never expected to be of so not high but perfect  quality. It is worthed to be my first review in Amazon.</li>
    <li> i really want to give this product 5 stars because the product is really great, but like others have already mentioned, the presentation is lacking. it&#x27;s unfortunate because all it would take is for the owner to spend a couple of hours with someone to help clean up the instructions, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;besides that the product works really well. i was a little nervous beforehand because i knew i only had one shot at each of the trays, so i practiced several times with just one of the colored components to make sure my timing was correct. i&#x27;m glad that i did. everything came out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after i was done making impressions, i put my labeled trays in the pre-addressed/postage-paid packet which was included with my original order. 1-2 weeks later i received a package which included: my trays, a carrying case, and two tubes of whitening gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the trays seem like they&#x27;re good quality and they fit *really* well. i have used them for applying whitening gel, tooth strengthening paste, and also as nightly guards for protection from grinding my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am very happy with this purchase and would order the kit again if these ever wear out.</li>
    <li> Works great, plenty of gel. Don&#x27;t put it on anything other than teeth</li>
    <li> Custom trays covers your gums.&lt;br /&gt;This is an issue because the whitening gel will go on your gums and if placed on too long, it will damage your gums.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the last thing you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, these things are suppose to be cut tracing out your gums and keeping only the teeth covered.&lt;br /&gt;This way you can wipe off the excess gel that goes on your gums. But, my custom trays are over my gums so that&#x27;s pretty much impossible. I am not completely happy with this purchase due to this fact.</li>
    <li> lots of work and must send back</li>
    <li> Great product, i&#x27;m going to order three more for the rest of my family for whitening there teeth.  Thanks for the product</li>
    <li> This is was wonderful. The molds came in the mail and with in an hour or so the process was complete.I sat them on the counter over night and shipped them out the next day. With in 2 weeks I received my trays in the mail and like they should they fit perfectly. By far the most least expensive best quality I have found.</li>
    <li> I got the trays and clay with in a week it was easy to use I did it in a day and sent it out. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and nothing has come back still waiting on my in prints. We will see how they fit if I ever get them</li>
    <li> Trays work well. It took 4-5 emails and six weeks to finaly get gel. Whould have given 5 stars without the frustration.</li>
    <li> I didnt have any issues with the instructions, I got the mold kit and did it right away. I received my trays about a week later and love them. they fit perfectly. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Just got my trays and am very happy with the outcome. As a reference, my fiancée recently did hers at her (expensive) dentist - in my opinion her trays look and feel just like mine.     I also needed to rush the process a little bit and was very pleasantly surprised by the responsiveness and kindness of these guys when I approached them. They prioritized the making of the trays and sent it back quickly.    Great product and great service. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I ordered this product. Buying these plates through your dentist is really expensive. This was cheaper and the plates made feel great in my mouth. They did a really good job at making the plates to match the form of my mouth.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it too long, since the smell/taste made me want to vomit.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this teeth whitening kit.  I was careful when I took my teeth impressions and the resulting trays that came back from the lab are very nice.  I have used one tube of the gel so far in about 15 applications and my teeth are really getting white after a lifetime of minimal care and heavy coffee drinking.  My dentist is going to flip when I see her next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I thought the product would be sent, but no, they sent an envelope and some product to make a mould of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;After it I had to send the product and now I am waiting the product, between 7 to 14 work days.</li>
    <li> So far after a week of use I do see some decent whitening effects. I ordered an extra tube of the whitening gel, the remineralizer, and an extra set of custom molds just in case. I don&#x27;t see the need in really trimming them at all, they fit PERFECT. Now this is because I followed the instructions very well (which are easy to do), but I also have had some practice with these types of molds before. Just be patient and do them properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Great customer service! I searched all around the web to find something like these, prices for others were higher and I am really happy with the product I received. Feel safe buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t got it back yet. Wish I had it so my teeth would be whiter and my gf like me</li>
    <li> The whitening trays sent back to me after I sent in my mold impressions were not completely the same as my mold impressions. It came back without my last molar on my lower left side.    I wrote to the owner who responded, \\&quot;We make the tray according to the impressions.  Most trays don&#x27;t cover the last molars.  The impressions trays are designed to make an impression of only 8-10 teeth or what we call the smile zone.  Crest white strips cover only 6-8 teeth.  The back molars are not seen in the smile zone and are hidden by the cheeks and in shadows.  This is why they are not whitened.  Some dentist will make a full tray because they want the person to use more gel and purchase the gel from them. Basically making more money selling gel when it is not needed.  However, this is not the standard in the teeth whitening industry.  I&#x27;m sure from what you&#x27;ve told me, the tray will work just fine for you.\\&quot;       For one, the tray was shoddily made since my impressions contained my last molar. How could they not?    Other than that, the trays fit me well.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it was really easy to do and I am super happy with what came back.  I had a few questions and emailed them in and I got a really fast response.  I had no trouble making the molds.  I was a little nervous going in, but it couldn&#x27;t be simpler.  The trays I got back fit perfectly and the whitening really works.  As I&#x27;m sure others have said my dentist wanted $450 + $50 per whitening application and I can&#x27;t imagine their trays being better.  I highly recommend getting this if you are considering it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  The trays are professionally made and fit perfectly!  I had a couple questions and customer service responded within a few hours of my email.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more :)</li>
    <li> My dentist has been hounding me to get a night guard for my chronic teeth grinding, but I&#x27;ve always been detered by the $300+ charge for the device.  During my last visit, he also suggested I try a tooth whitenting kit for a stain on my front teeth.  Given the design of the ads for the product, I have to say I was very skeptical.  But, for the price, I decided it was worth a shot.  I received my kit within about one week.  And although the instructions were all included on one sheet of paper (with typos), they were clear and easy to follow.  I mixed the blue and white putty, made impressions of my top and bottom teeth, and sent them off in the postage paid envelope (with an additional $25 for a night guard and case).  Two weeks later, I received my tooth whitening trays, 2 tubes of whitening gel and a night guard.  They are all well made, very similar to what the dentist charges $$$$$ for, and they fit perfectly!  So far, so good!  I wore the night guard last night, and it did the trick ... prevented grinding and comfortable to sleep in.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the whitening kit!  This is a GREAT VALUE!  Do not be detered by the cheezy advertising.</li>
    <li> Kind of weird getting this online but I love it and it works so well.</li>
    <li> i received equipment to make impressions.</li>
    <li> The idea is nice. but for me it such a hassle to put the gel in the top and bottom tray. And the gel burns your gums too. It took over two and a half weeks for my top and bottom trays to be made and mailed back to me. I had to contact the company a few times. I am going back to the white strips because it is easier and faster with the same results.</li>
    <li> An update: After writing the below review and giving this product 1 star, I received a call from the company. The representative was apologetic and emailed me instructions on the spot. As other have mentioned, the instructions are full of grammatical errors and typos, but they seem fairly comprehensible. Once I receive my trays and whitening gel, I&#x27;ll revisit this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my trays and two containers of goo, but there were no instructions. I found the company of Facebook, and sent a message. I&#x27;ve received no response. I found a phone number and left a voicemail. No call back. I guess it&#x27;s time to contact the BBB, which is a shame. Other folks on here seem to have been happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Very fast service, shipping was great and there are no other additional charges unless you choose to purchase more (I did not). The trays are the soft ones, not that I will be wearing them overnight but I feel it&#x27;s a good point to make in case someone wanted to use these for a night guard. And the tray doesn&#x27;t cover the back teeth, doesn&#x27;t affect bleaching since you can&#x27;t see your back teeth but I did expect it to be a whole mouth tray. The bleach is very strong. Used recommended time and I got shooting pains in my teeth and I don&#x27;t normally have sensation teeth (I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the kit I got from my dentist, although I know that wasn&#x27;t as strong). Definitely much more reasonable than going to the dentist and got pretty much the same thing. Make sure you use a sensation toothpaste a few weeks before you start bleaching, it helps!!</li>
    <li> The first package (to make the trays) arrived with postage due although I had paid postage in the original price. Pretty easy to follow the instructions to make the mold for the trays. It took longer to get the customized trays than stated. I can&#x27;t tell yet if they are working properly. No instructions on how much whitener to put in the trays and it seems like the gel all comes out and that the trays may be a bit too tight. But, the trays do fit, if snugly. I have used 3 times and think my teeth are getting whiter but too early to tell.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product, due to all the positive reviews found here. I did think it was odd that I could not find any other reviews on any other site, but figured this was legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my molds and received an extremely fast and helpful reply when I emailed the company. In two weeks the molds to be used with the whitening gel arrived. The molds fit alright, but don&#x27;t cover the very bottoms of some teeth and have some weird gaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel causes my teeth to become extremely sensitive and in pain for over a day after. I wouldn&#x27;t mind dealing with this pain if my teeth were actually becoming whiter. However, they are not. I have been using the product for over a week and with no results at all. When I posted a short and polite question to this company&#x27;s Facebook page asking if the same thing happened to anyone else, it was promptly deleted. This left me upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret wasting over $60 on something that causes pain and shows no results. It also bothers me that a concern I brought up was deleted from public viewing. This makes me wonder if this entire company is a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product for another week or two, in the hope that I see some positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will help someone who questions the legitimacy of the company. If anyone has found any reviews of this product somewhere OTHER than Amazon, I would love to see it.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal. These $60 bleaching trays replace the $300 trays I got from my dentist - and these trays are better quality, and includes ample bleach to get you started. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 10yrs since I was off of my braces and my clear retainer doesn&#x27;t quite fit right (sorry mom, I should of worn it every day). I wanted to start bleaching my teeth so I needed something that would fit good. I tried some mouth guards that you boil I bought on here and one set worked OK but didn&#x27;t get into the \\&quot;grooves\\&quot; of my teeth and only bleached the front and of course not the back teeth either. I went through about 3 sets also tried football mouth guards which did not work well at all. I knew if I wanted something good I had to spend money. I went to my dentist for my normal cleaning and asked how much it would cost for mouth impressions, $300 for top and bottom which I figured. I opted for this DIY method and WOW! I was skeptical but after reading all the positive (and negative) reviews, I knew this would be something I should try. It was really simple and straight forward if you read the instructions. Nothing much else to it, unless you have a bad gag reflex like I do but I still made it through. Once I was done with the impressions, I let it sit for a little while to harden before I dropped them off in the mail. About a week and 2 days later I get my impressions back and DAMN, spot on!!! I actually like these better than the retainer I got when I got my braces off because this is more of a silicone flimsy type (still sturdy) so it&#x27;s easy to clip away the excess that&#x27;s not needed like on top of your teeth. The good thing is they go all the way to the back teeth!! everything fits nice and snug. As it should as long as you make good impressions. They key is not to wiggle them out when you&#x27;re making them so it can be as precise as possible. I haven&#x27;t bleached them yet with these but just putting them on their soooooo much better than anything you&#x27;ll buy on here and as close as you can get straight from the dentist. Do yourself the favor and go this route, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;real customer, not a computer! :)</li>
    <li> It was easy (if you follow the instructions) to create the molds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result is as good as the molds I had made by my dentist.</li>
    <li> I have been ashamed of my smile since my baby teeth fell out. I do the mouth closed laugh, the geisha laugh (covering the moiuth), I try not to smile to broadly. I never wanted a hollywood smile, I just didn&#x27;t want these ugly grey teeth thanks to tetracycline prescribed to my mother while she was pregnant with me when no one knew better. I was told veneers were the only solution, or a $600 trip to the dentist every year or so, I noticed a difference the FIRST DAY with this. I had to moderate my usage because it is a strong chemical bleach and it does make your teeth and gums hurt. But the trays are professionally made and shipped quickly and fit my teeth perfectly. Thank you so much, I&#x27;ll keep using it regularly. So happy I&#x27;m smiling mouth open!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My only cons is that the initial tray that customer uses to create impressions are not long enough to cover anything more than one teeth behind the incisors so that whitening does not really go beyond the incisors.</li>
    <li> I didnt expect this would whiten teeth as well as the treatments at the dentist that can cost several hundred or even thousand dollars. It does whiten better than any of the store bought whitening treatments though and does not make my teeth sensitive like the strips. The trays were semi difficult to get good impressions with, even with my dental hygenist fiance&#x27;s help. The trays fit tight enough though for the purpose. Turnaround on the trays was about 8 business days.</li>
    <li> Bought this after my dentist wanted to charge me 600 dollars to do EXACTLY the same thing this product does. I&#x27;ve been using this a week now and it&#x27;s simply amazing!  My teeth are already much whiter. The trays are very high quality and fit perfectly. Be careful with the gel as using too much really can burn the gums. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These trays arent as nice as the professionaly made ones my girlfriend has but it saved a trip to the dentist and $250.  They fit and work perfect. I did have to trim them slightly.  They even came with a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was the total turn around time was over 3 weeks.  I did send them in over tbe holidays which would cause sone delay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m submitting this review after using the gel 2-3 times a week for almost 6 months. It has whitened my teeth maybe 2-3 shades. Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing a lot of research on Carbamide Peroxide everyone says to watch for expired product. I can&#x27;t find an expiration date anywhere?!?! Well no wonder! It&#x27;s likely that they stuff they sent me was already expired. When Carbamide Peroxide expires it gets milky. All of my 6 tubes they sent are milky right now. I&#x27;ve been wrecking my teeth with sensitive pains for 6 months for almost nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am emailing the company to try to see if they will send me non-expired product that actually has an expiration date on the tubes... If it doesn&#x27;t it just means they are what I hope they aren&#x27;t... A scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told the company that most of these reviews are probably fake and it is a shame that they are ripping people off. The response that I received stated that \\&quot;ALL (yes in caps) of those reviews are legitimate customers!\\&quot; How would they even know? It just sounded really shady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end make sure that your products have expiration dates and that they do not look milky. Carbamide Peroxide should be clear with maybe a few bubbles in it.</li>
    <li> I spoke with Matt R from touch of white about why I haven&#x27;t received my trays and they never received my molds. I continually asked them to either send a new mold kit or refund my purchase. I was fine with either. He said he would look in the lab for them, but never responded after that, he ignored multiple emails after that and has not responded for weeks.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase and the results.  I read through the reviews pre-purchase so knew that there were some things to be expected.  Making the molds was rather easy but read through the instructions until you are clear on everything before you start.  After that, it did take some time fore me to actually get my molded trays.  They fit well but did need to be trimmed to help with not burning the gum line up.  Applying the bleach evenly in the trays also takes some work but that would be with any system  (too much, too little, full coverage, etc).  I was trying to keep the bleach on my teeth for 1 hour but I did have sensitivity issues.  I ended up taking a break on whitening to order the Remineralization Gel, which helped a lot and also taste great after a bleaching session.  I reminerlaized at least once a week during further sessions.  As far as result, I could tell a difference after the first session.  I normally brush with a total care paste and my teeth are well maintained but I drink a lot of juice, wine, coffee, etc so that is what I was trying to whiten.  I can visibly tell a difference after these treatments but recommend to use some sort of color comparison chart so you can be certain of the result.  Looking at your teeth every day it may be possible to not realize the totality of the result over time.  Also a chart will let you see points of where things are so you know when to consider a touch up or another full session.</li>
    <li> Trays fit nice and tight and gel goes along ways .. Teeth are white .. Would reccomend whitening kit to anyone looking to improve your smile ..</li>
    <li> Working with Matt from the Touch of White Smile Company was an absolute pleasure. There was a problem with my remineralization gel order.  We discovered another company was selling this Touch of White Product on Amazon.  I worked with Amazon and Matt to help resolve the problem.  Between the two companies we got things straightened out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased with the service I received.  You can be assured that The Touch of White Smile company is a first class operation and I highly recommend their service.</li>
    <li> Great trays and excellent customer service. I would however recommend that you buy a less intense whitening gel as this gel is very strong and concentrated and can burn your gums and hurt your teeth. But we&#x27;ll worth the money for the trays. They are durable and thick - very professionally done!</li>
    <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t take almost two weeks after you mail back your molds to get the custom trays, but maybe they keep the cost down that way.  After just two times using the 36% gel, my teeth are almost sparkling white!  Important as mentioned in other reviews, to trim the custom trays so they don&#x27;t reach up to your gums and only cover your teeth, but don&#x27;t trim too much or you&#x27;ll have yellow outlines around your white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have some pain while trays are on from the solution on my teeth (kind of burning/sharp nerve pain), but the results are totally worth the temporary discomfort.  I recommend getting the remineralization gel, to help your teeth recover from the whitening, and I also started brushing with Sensodyne toothpaste while waiting for my trays to come.</li>
    <li> We all know that getting the correct fit on a bleach tray is critical for proper bleaching. When I&#x27;ve gone to a dentist for a bleach tray it took several times to get the impression right.  So I was really grateful for the detailed instructions that came with this kit.  I followed them carefully and received a tray that fits perfectly. The price is excellent and the response to my questions was prompt.  Thanks Matt!</li>
    <li> Lo he utilizado y funciona.</li>
    <li> I had a little issue with the wrong instructions enclosed but after contacting the seller, everything was taken care of. I sent the molds of my upper and lower teeth, received the trays in about a week and a half. The whitener works wonders. I used it three times and see a big difference. Worth every penny and the wait.</li>
    <li> I went to my dentist and he wanted to charge me $600 for a kit similar to this. Making the initial molds was a snap and the kit arrived about 2 weeks later. I have since done numerous treatments and am always getting positive comments on how white my teeth are. I keep my solution in the fridge until I am about to use it and it has held up for months. As others have stated place a small amount of Vaseline on your gums so you don &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; or stain them with the bleach and a small amount of bleach in each try goes a long way. i used the mineralization gel only a few times as my teeth did not have any sensitivity issues. I might try and go to a higher and stronger bleach in the future but I don&#x27;t think it will be necessary, don&#x27;t want to overdo it. Also the seller has great communication as I had to contact him regarding something, so A+ to him.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit! So simple to do and no trip to the dentist. They send you the putty and mold trays, you mix the blue and white putty then place in tray and make a mold by sinking in your teeth, remove and repeat with the other tray so you have a mold of both upper and lower teeth. Then you send back in stamped addressed envelope and in a couple of weeks you have a dental tray that fits like a glove. After one week of once daily use with the gel they send I already have bright white teeth. I feel like I could stop now but I want to see if it is even possible to get whiter with another one week. So much better than white strips. I highly doubt my dentist could have done a better job and one thing&#x27;s for sure, it would have cost a whole lot more!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly not a scam.  I had no problems of any kind.  I followed the instructions, and I got my trays yesterday, which was 2 weeks from the date I sent them my molds.  The trays fit surprisingly well.  I trimmed them up a bit, and I used them for 1 hour last night.  So far,I felt no discomfort.  I plan to buy another set as a gift.</li>
    <li> The trays fit very well and are doing a great job. The bleach makes my teeth sensitive which I didn&#x27;t realize until after the fact. I got sensitivity toothpaste and it has been fine.</li>
    <li> Seems strange to endorse, but like other reviewers, my experience has been a positive one. It is a somewhat drawn out process, but if you know what the expectations are at each stage, you&#x27;ll come away with the same conclusion - it was worth it. Follow the instructions carefully and you&#x27;ll get a set of custom trays when all is said and done. They are very comfortable and on par with the set professionally made for my wife at the dentist&#x27;s office - just a lot cheaper! If you found this helpful, please click the button below. I appreciate your feedback.</li>
    <li> Worked really well.  Tip don&#x27;t put too much product in the trays.  If gel hits your gums it burns!</li>
    <li> Best teeth whitening kit there is. I loved it so much, I ordered a kit for my husband. Get this before he raises the price because I&#x27;m sure he will!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and fast turn around time.  Great price.  Read instructions everything you need comes in the kit. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I am very glad with how the entire order processed. Package with molding kit came fast and was very easy to use. I send the molds back and within a timely wait got my two trays, the case and the two syringes with the whitening product.&lt;br /&gt;What I like is that I can also use the mouth trays as mouth guards at night - so I am getting double the usage. And as night guards the trays are very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;When I whiten my teeth, not to irritate the gums and have more control on product usage, i use a small brush (from an art store) to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; a small  amount of whitening gel unto my teeth and then put the mouth guards in, one at a time. This method works well and I never get any burning or gum irritation. Also it allows me to use as much or as little of the gel that I need.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> they did not tell me that the kit they send you - is way way too short -  does not cover your back teeth - so I was very disappointed when I received the finished soft trays and they did not fit -  since they do not cover back teeth - they droop!  I have written for a refund -  but not heard anything yet.  Just has been a horrible experience!!!!!  I would not recommend this to anyone - unless you don&#x27;t want all your teeth white.  I was told &amp;#34;as good as white strips cover, etc etc  - &amp;#34;  but they never did tell me when I requested a new fit - that it is short also -  I do have pics and will get them posted.  I had molds made about 5-6 yrs ago (which are so old now and do not fit right after dentistry)  these are NOT like my old ones nor like my ones from the dentist years ago.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care about your back teeth - then ???  guess OK  -  I HAVE REQUESTED A REFUND BUT HAVE NOT HEARD A THING YET!!!  Way it has been since I been dealing with them  way back in OCT - and the guy that makes them -  right here in Ft. Myers where I am!!!!!  If you order extra products at &amp;#34;discount price&amp;#34;  then expect to wait longer as they wait till the check clears!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this, it came with a beautiful case to store the gels, trays, and LED light. It comes with 1 desensitizing gel for the teeth, 1 whitening gel, the LED light with battery, a molding set to create your whitening trays. I&#x27;ve also received 2 whitening gels from the company under the condition that I pay for shipping. Shipping was around $5 and I think it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has whitened my teeth and the process does hurt but I&#x27;ve lost a lot of my enamel and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad. I&#x27;ve noticed results and measured my progress with the included scale that show me the different teeth shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t perfectly white but this whitening kit as well as the 3D crest whitestrips I used before this has made me a little more secure with my smile. My teeth used to be very stained due to poor oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of these dental trays and even more happier with the value. I highly recommend that once you get your kit and before you send it back in that you look for the information to order additional trays for about $10-15 extra. Turn around time ordering from Amazon to receiving my trays was about 3 weeks. The sooner you mail your molds back, the sooner they can make your trays. I don&#x27;t think the wait time was too bad, its pretty reasonable considering the mailing back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally tossed my old trays in the trash when i had them in a napkin in my pocket, which is what led me to this product. I don&#x27;t see any difference at all with these trays compared to my dentist trays except the price being hundreds cheaper. The material of the tray plastic is not too stiff and not too thin that it will crack or break. The trays have some attention to detail where they cut carefully around the gumline to give a fit over all teeth and making sure to leave little room to allow bleach to spread to the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to follow the directions EXACTLY in order to make quality impressions with this kit and you will end up with quality trays like i did. Read over the directions at least twice, because once you mix the pieces of the mold putty together they will harden quickly. The directions give you the proper amount of time before they will harden, I think 30 seconds. But I recommend to play it safe and finish squishing, mixing, rolling it together in under 20 and then place them in the tray and make your teeth impressions. It&#x27;s nothing you have to rush super fast to get done or worry about, I think I waited like 35 seconds and mine were still fine. Just make sure it all turns blue don&#x27;t over do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My motivation for this review is because I am always skeptical when ordering something medical or dental online but this is one item I can vouch for. There is absolute zero reason to pay hundreds at your dentist. And there is absolute zero reason everyone shouldn&#x27;t whiten their teeth bc yellow teeth are NASTY! I have only one recommendation to the seller, maybe include an extra set of blue and white puddy in case someone makes a mistake they can redo the mixture once more.</li>
    <li> Excellent and great value!!!</li>
    <li> Item came promptly, was easy to use, well documented, and the molds were shipped in a timely manner. It would&#x27;ve been nice if instructions were included in the package with the molds. They were available on the company website. This is the same thing your dentist charges $500 for.</li>
    <li> This kit is absolutely brilliant and very easy to do, with comprehensive instructions supplied.  I have recommended it to several other family members and friends who all have been very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;I live in the UK and it is extremely expensive to get this done at the dentist so this is positively cheap by comparison!  The gel supplied does the job, but tastes horrible in my opinion!  Still, once it&#x27;s been used, you can always buy a different product - Contrast PM+ being the best in my opinion, at least for me because it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth tingle unbearably like the other ones seem to do!</li>
    <li> I previously paid $425 for a teeth whitening kit from my dentist.  This kit comes with tooth whitening gel and molds which were made from my mouth impressions.  The instructions for diy molds were easy to follow, uncomplicated, with professional results.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I saved about $375 with this kit, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Fits my teeth perfectly and it was easy to do.  Would order again!  Excellent customer service, my aunt paid $300 for same thing!</li>
    <li> Overall great experience and a great product.  will be doing business with again and recommending to others!  Trays fit PERFECT as long as you follow all instructions (easy) and sellers communication if you have questions is prompt and a pleasure to deal with</li>
    <li> The only complaint that I have is that it is hard to put a small amount in the tray.  I have to use something the spread the gel so that I do not have too much on each tooth that will get up to the gum area.  Be careful that you do not get any on your gums as it is very strong and will cause irritation.</li>
    <li> The trays fit perfectly, the gel is extremely strong and effective. Be sure to cover all the way to the back of your teeth when you make the impressions. The seller offered a second set of trays for $15, which is a good deal. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product as long as you follow the instructions. After the first application my teeth were two shades whiter.</li>
