### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Well let me tell you it was the best investement i ever purchased!  </li>
      <li>WE&#x27;RE USING ECZANA(NO STEROID) AND ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it reduces the itchiness to a great degree</li>
      <li>fans of the discontinued medicated product, I found a great dermatologist at Stanford who recommends mixing cortisone (the lowest strength that works for you) with antibacterial cream (Bactroban - you need a prescription).  </li>
      <li>I did not have a good experience with this company.</li>
      <li>I read so many great reviews about this product, so I decided to try it.</li>
      <li>If you think its a good idea to give babies hydrocortizone, that is your decision, but many people including some doctors, have doubts.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is nice too because it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
      <li>and i can honestly say that within 3 days of using the cream he had almost stopped sratching and he was sleeping through the night</li>
      <li>this product is not longer effective since they removed the cortisone.  </li>
      <li>Now when I mention his eczema, many of our close friends &amp; family say \\&quot;Oh</li>
      <li>DETERMINED TO FIND SOMETHING SAFE</li>
      <li>how grateful I am to Freederm for giving me back my beautiful baby boy!!  </li>
      <li>They sent me some more in august, I didn&#x27;t order it.</li>
      <li>Thank you for formulating such a magnificent product.</li>
      <li>WE ARE SO PLEASED AND RELIEVED TO FIND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I used to bandage his hands because we would wake up with blood all over our bedsheets - but now, he&#x27;s so much better.</li>
      <li>Instead of making my eczema better, let&#x27;s just say that it \\&quot;angered\\&quot; my skin and didn&#x27;t stop the itchiness.</li>
      <li>In my case it didnt work better than Cortaid that I had</li>
      <li>One more thing.  </li>
      <li>and they both said it looked okay to try.  </li>
      <li>From what I can tell, this is nothing more than over-the-counter 1% hydrocortisone cream.</li>
      <li>This works better than high-powered cortizone or tubes of cream we paid $90 for.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the product with great hopes after reading all the positive responses however after faithful use for two weeks, it has done absolutely nothing, its not even a good hand or body lotion.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pure magic in a bottle!  </li>
      <li>, I see the product, since I purchased it, is available without cortisone?</li>
      <li>I tried the product and experienced similar results.</li>
      <li>and I can enjoy it.  </li>
      <li>My right hand is probably the most severe as it is always prone to cracking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to use the new cream, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all, and seems to make the skin inside my ear crack and weep even more!</li>
      <li>IT IS THE ORIGINAL FORMULA- NOT THE LOTION.  </li>
      <li>After 3 months of positive results with this product, I am so glad that I listened to his advice.     </li>
      <li>I purchased 2 of a special package deal (2 creams, 1 moisturizer, 1 bar of soap for $49.95).</li>
      <li>I am a lifelong, chronic eczema sufferer who experienced severe breakouts on my hands, arms, neck, and face.  </li>
      <li>All I wanted was to return the product and get my full refund (which they guarantee within 30 days)  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t sleep at night and my days were full of discomfort.  </li>
      <li>I can say that the Freederm has worked very well, and my husband and I feel it works better than the prescriptions.   </li>
      <li>Have purchased  Freederm HC from the manufacturer many times over the last several years, and it used to be a great product.  </li>
      <li>I am a chronic eczema sufferer - have had it since I was a baby - and have never been able to live without super strength cortisone.  </li>
      <li>My son developed some mild excema a few months ago and I ordered this cream to try out since it has so many good reviews and seems to work for everyone!  </li>
      <li>Mabye the cream works for some people, but if you do try it out make sure test it out on some areas first before applying over your whole problem area.  </li>
      <li>Product is hyped far more than it perfromed for me.</li>
      <li>It used to be that my hands looked weathered like old leather, and now it is as though my hands are restored to a more youthful even glow.      </li>
      <li>I saw some success.</li>
      <li>Her skin is rarely 100% cleared up.</li>
      <li>I thought it was worth giving it a go since nothing else had worked</li>
      <li>and you might have success like us.</li>
      <li>I agree with the other posters that the good feedback is done by freederm associates.</li>
      <li>RIGHT NOW</li>
      <li>This new formula might be a good regular moisturizer, but it&#x27;s not doing anything for my eczema.  </li>
      <li>Cortizone10 cream works better for general skin rashes IMO.  </li>
      <li>and for the first time in years, I have been pretty much eczema free for about two months in a row.</li>
      <li>so he has been using Freederm for more than ten years.</li>
      <li>They are professionally written and they all sound alike.</li>
      <li>If you are interested go to pearlcium.com/adirondacksuzy</li>
      <li>First off, my review of this product seems to have been removed.</li>
      <li>first couple of days that we used it</li>
      <li>I will admit my son&#x27;s eczema was pretty progressed by the time we got FreeDerm, and we did not see an improvement in a month&#x27;s time.  </li>
      <li>, you&#x27;re probably willing to try anything.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Do not waste your money, it works exactly as any another cheap brand.</li>
      <li>I was a bit leary of this stuff at first</li>
      <li>Yes, he still has his flare-ups especially now that it&#x27;s winter, but I no longer stress about it because I know it will get better with Freederm.</li>
      <li>Freederm&#x27;s combination of the mild (1%) cortisone and anti-microbial (benzalkonium chloride) entirely cleared up all my milder eczema problem areas (face, arms, torso) and significantly improved my severe hand eczema.  </li>
      <li>The old cream was amazing, and the only thing that I (and the doctors) found would work, and it didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
      <li>I have skin eczema that has been rapidly spreading to pretty much all my fingers on my hand.</li>
      <li>The daughter  used a small amount of this cream and good results were seen within 5 days.  </li>
      <li>I had to make more research to help my condition, and what worked for me was Eucerin&#x27;s Dry Skin Therapy Calming Creme.</li>
      <li>I have chronic eczema over large areas of my body.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER ON MY SECOND ORDER (ORDERED 2 JARS W/C COMES W/ FREE SOAP AND MOISTURIZER)WE DIDN&#x27;T RECEIVED THE PACKAGE .</li>
      <li>THANKS THANKS .</li>
      <li>I hope I can easilty get a refund because it really pissed me off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read so much about eczema and had tried everything I could get my hands on - probiotics, restricted diet,  hypoallergenic formula, fragrance-free laundry soap, all kinds of steroids, oils, creams, even lard, flaxseed oil</li>
      <li>AND USPS)WITHOUT OFFERING MUCH HELP</li>
      <li>I have the Free Derm HC with \\&quot;Eczema/Dermatitis Cream\\&quot; words written in red.</li>
      <li>Within 36 hours my poor baby was a happy toddler again.  </li>
      <li>With Freederm HC, we have gotten his eczema under control &amp; now are able to cut back considerably on our use.  </li>
      <li>did nothing more than any other cheap hand lotion would do for me personally.  </li>
      <li>(cause i only tried a couple of spots first in case it didn&#x27;t work) were really red and inflamed and seemed to hurt him more.  </li>
      <li>We now only have to use it for a day or so whenever his skin starts to flare up, which is pretty rare these days.  </li>
      <li>I have also used Freederm on my 2 young sons, who both get a seldom flare up here and there, and I am pleased to say that we get them back to clear skin in just 2-3 days.</li>
      <li>MY DAUGHTER HAS HAD EXCEMA SINCE SHE WAS 2- MILD TO MODERATE.  </li>
      <li>Many doctors told me that the eczema was stress related, but regardless of what is happening around me, it never comes back.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different topical ointments prescribed by physicians</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this cream for eczema.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d much rather have natural products on my skin than a steroid cream.    </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to apply steroid creamanywhere near as much as before.  </li>
      <li>Within a few days her skin looked and felt much better.  </li>
      <li>use Adovia Dead Sea soap instead much better helped me out than this product.</li>
      <li>The scabs have healed and my legs look normal again.  </li>
      <li>And Eucerin cream (Equate brand)smothered on after a bath has done wonders preventing any new eczema (recommended by our physician).</li>
      <li>It can&#x27;t hurt to try something new if what you are trying isn&#x27;t working.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyone try the NEW one without Cortisone?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to try the product, but I want a new, undamaged jar.</li>
      <li>We ordered our first jar the next day!   </li>
      <li>I had only done twice on that first day and my sons excema got this burn type reaction.  </li>
      <li>it is not a total cure all, but it does lessen the rash symptoms and redness, most especially the irritating nighttime itching (I am sleeping so much better now).  </li>
      <li>My friend told me to stick with it for a couple of months and the eczema would clear up.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been dealing with this for nearly a year now  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My now 2 year old daughter suffers from severe eczema that is caused by food and environmental allergies.  We&#x27;ve been dealing with this for nearly a year now  (her pediatrician last year said she had seen only one case worse than hers).  We tried all of the topicals that the pediatrician prescribed with Elidel and Protopic being the last two.  I can say that the Freederm has worked very well, and my husband and I feel it works better than the prescriptions.   Her skin is rarely 100% cleared up. Not sure she ever will be, but we do feel it has made an impact.  We showed it to her pediatrician and dermatologist before we tried it and they both said it looked okay to try.  The moisturizer is nice too because it&#x27;s not greasy. &lt;br /&gt;If you or a family member suffers from severe eczema, give it a try---it you&#x27;re at your wits end like we were, you&#x27;re probably willing to try anything.</li>
    <li> My son had very bad eczema since he was 1 month old. I&#x27;ve read so much about eczema and had tried everything I could get my hands on - probiotics, restricted diet,  hypoallergenic formula, fragrance-free laundry soap, all kinds of steroids, oils, creams, even lard, flaxseed oil - you name it! Nothing has cleared his skin as well as Freederm. I just happened to chance upon this product from a mom&#x27;s bulletin board on baby&#x27;s skin problems. One of the moms who posts there was gracious enough to give me a small sample because it does cost a lot, so she wanted me to try it before I bought a tub. Lo and behold - my son&#x27;s eczema cleared up in a few days! I used to bandage his hands because we would wake up with blood all over our bedsheets - but now, he&#x27;s so much better. Yes, he still has his flare-ups especially now that it&#x27;s winter, but I no longer stress about it because I know it will get better with Freederm. I&#x27;m down to my 2nd tub right now because I have one tub at home and one at his daycare. Hope other desperate moms out there will find this helpful. You can e-mail me at efren_k@hotmail.com if you have any questions on my experience with the product.</li>
    <li> This cream worked wonders for me after I started using it in January 2007.  I am a chronic eczema sufferer - have had it since I was a baby - and have never been able to live without super strength cortisone.  Freederm&#x27;s combination of the mild (1%) cortisone and anti-microbial (benzalkonium chloride) entirely cleared up all my milder eczema problem areas (face, arms, torso) and significantly improved my severe hand eczema.  I was ecstatic.  But when reordered, the product that came was completely different - no cortisone, no antimicrobial, totally different base.  I admire Freederm&#x27;s effort to make a nonmedicated cream.  However, this new formulation not only doesn&#x27;t work for me, it actually irritates my skin.  I am baffled by Freederm&#x27;s apparent decision not to offer both versions.  And I also feel that it is not truthful for them to post all the glowing testimonials when the testimonials are for an entirely different product.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For fans of the discontinued medicated product, I found a great dermatologist at Stanford who recommends mixing cortisone (the lowest strength that works for you) with antibacterial cream (Bactroban - you need a prescription).  Same theory and works as well as the old Freederm medicated cream.</li>
    <li> This cream not the same as the older version they had a couple of years ago.  Different formula did not help me at all.</li>
    <li> I am 39 and I was born with severe skin issues... contact dermatitas, severe eczema; the driest skin in the world.  As a child I would soak in a tub of olive oil, crying my eyes out because I hurt so bad.  I had to get cortizone shots every year for my head to toe break out burst.  Finally last year, my mom found me this product.  I have the Free Derm HC with \\&quot;Eczema/Dermatitis Cream\\&quot; words written in red. (I believe this is a stronger version??)  It clears me up overnight!  It stops the itch and even the pain.  I break out in this rash still, from around my mouth, to my neck (from tomato sauce and citrus allergy) to my wrists ( from dish soap) to the back of my legs from sweating.  This works!!!  Please give it a try.  God Bless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using the original Freederm with hydrocortisone and antimicrobial for years, but because I only go through a jar so slowly (my eczema is very small, but inside my ear) I didn&#x27;t know the formula had changed until I just received a new order a couple weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve been trying to use the new cream, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all, and seems to make the skin inside my ear crack and weep even more! The old cream was amazing, and the only thing that I (and the doctors) found would work, and it didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  This new formula might be a good regular moisturizer, but it&#x27;s not doing anything for my eczema.  I&#x27;m trying to take advantage of their 30 day guarantee to return it :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Freederm to treat my excema for ab out a year (having ex. for 4 years) freederm hc lessened the severity but never completely cured it (it was still there). Then I came upon a product I mixed with the freederm and in 1 week - my excema is completly gone! If you are interested go to pearlcium.com/adirondacksuzy</li>
    <li> Product does not work.  Made my skin rash and burn!  use Adovia Dead Sea soap instead much better helped me out than this product.</li>
    <li> My children and I have severed heat induced rashes on the neck and upper body. This cream works wonders on our skin. Two applications and it is cleared. We only have to use it sparingly in the summer.    The companies shipping policy is terrible in my opinion. I purchased 2 of a special package deal (2 creams, 1 moisturizer, 1 bar of soap for $49.95). They charged me $9.95 shipping and handling on each package. That was almost $20 shipping and handling. Both packages came together in a $1 envelope with a $4.95 postage sticker (USPS). A rip off in my opinion.    At least I have plenty of the product now so I won&#x27;t have to shop with them again, EVER.</li>
    <li> Have purchased  Freederm HC from the manufacturer many times over the last several years, and it used to be a great product.  However, they have changed the cream and it&#x27;s not the same, nor does it do the job for our family any longer.</li>
    <li> I ordered Freederm HC for my son when he was just 5 months old.  We had tried Elidel, Eucerine, Corizone, but nothing seemed to help.  His eczema was so bad that he had huge red sores that covered half his cheeks.  The sores would bleed &amp; ooze puss all the time.  It just made me want to cry every time I looked at him!!  He was so little and helpless!!  When I first found Freederm HC online, I sat down &amp; read every testimonial.  The one that was the kicker for me was about a baby who&#x27;s parents had to tape bandages to her face to keep her from scratching.  As I read her story, I looked across the room at my sleeping baby &amp; HIS big bandages taped to HIS cheeks!  We ordered our first jar the next day!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first couple of days that we used it, nothing seemed to be happening.  I thought oh well, but then on about the 3rd or 4th day, we woke up &amp; suddenly his face was nearly clear!!!  I was shocked and amazed!!  You have no idea how grateful I am to Freederm for giving me back my beautiful baby boy!!  With Freederm HC, we have gotten his eczema under control &amp; now are able to cut back considerably on our use.  We now only have to use it for a day or so whenever his skin starts to flare up, which is pretty rare these days.  Now when I mention his eczema, many of our close friends &amp; family say \\&quot;Oh yeah, I forgot he had that!\\&quot;   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank you Freederm HC!!  You are my hero!!</li>
    <li> My 18 month old son has suffered with eczema since birth and nothing that the doctor or health visitor gave him would work. He had got to the stage that he could not sleep at night for scratching and we hated seeing him in so much distress, when i saw Freederm on there website I thought it was worth giving it a go since nothing else had worked and i can honestly say that within 3 days of using the cream he had almost stopped sratching and he was sleeping through the night it is heaven in a tub.</li>
    <li> I have been an eczema sufferer for 30 years. I tried this product as a last ditch effort as the testimonials and reviews were so promising. I have been using this product for a week now, halfs of the jar is gone and I have seen no difference whatsoever. Please do not get your hopes up. I am anxious to see how hard it will be to get my money back as I have read several times that the customer service stinks.</li>
    <li> My infant daughter suffers from severe eczema.  I tried everything I could but nothing worked.  In a desperate effort to give her some kind of relief, I did a search on the web and found your site.  I tried it because I had nothing to lose, and it worked wonders.  Within a few days her skin looked and felt much better.  Thank you for formulating such a magnificent product.</li>
    <li> Here are all the ingredients in this product: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Deioninized water, Polawax; Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glyeryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chloroxyethanol &amp; Caprylyl Glycol, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Benzylalkonium Chloride, Triethnolamine, Citric acid and 1% hydrocortisone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It takes only a minute or two to see that the only thing that is likely to have a positive impact on skin is the hydrocortizone. If you think its a good idea to give babies hydrocortizone, that is your decision, but many people including some doctors, have doubts.</li>
    <li> Bought this cream for my skin had a small heat rash and within a few days it was gone, worked well.</li>
    <li> WE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT IN JANUARY AFTER HAVING TRIED IT ON MY SON&#x27;S ECZEMA BACK HOME IN THE PHILIPPINES. I WOULD SAY THE PRODUCT DID WORK WELL AS MY SON&#x27;S CONDITION IMPROVED . HOWEVER ON MY SECOND ORDER (ORDERED 2 JARS W/C COMES W/ FREE SOAP AND MOISTURIZER)WE DIDN&#x27;T RECEIVED THE PACKAGE . I CALLED UP THEIR SUPPORT LINE AND WAS TOLD THAT USPS ALREADY DELIVERED IT. AFTER GOING BACK AND FORTH(FREEDERM AND USPS)WITHOUT OFFERING MUCH HELP, WE FINALLY GAVE UP. DISGUSTED FOR PAYING $59.90 FOR NOTHING, WE  DECIDED TO LOOK FOR OTHER CREAM. RIGHT NOW WE&#x27;RE USING ECZANA(NO STEROID) AND ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS.</li>
    <li> Freederm HC takes the red out of the rash within minutes of applying.  It does not cure the rash.  I have eczema on my hands, and this stuff works!</li>
    <li> I bought some for my granddaughter in march, it didn&#x27;t work for her. They sent me some more in august, I didn&#x27;t order it. I sent it back and they returned it to me again. They don&#x27;t understand phone calls and repeated emails explaining the situation so I&#x27;ve about given up. If they charge my card for it I will be really angry.I will not buy from them again because of their service.</li>
    <li> I used the entire jar and would put on before bed and I saw no difference. My eczema was still there! So far the only thing that has worked is prescription Elocon but I am going to keep trying products for a non steroidal cream.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This did nothing more than any other cheap hand lotion would do for me personally.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The product seems to have rave reviews from the other Amazon.com users so my eczema must be especially stubborn!</li>
    <li> I used the HC and the moisterizing cream as directed for my son&#x27;s eczema.  We have seen no improvement and it has actually become more painful to him since using the products.  Hydrocortizone cream and Cetaphil cream at least did not make his condition worse, as the Freederm has.  Don&#x27;t waste your money! In addition, don&#x27;t ask for a refund either.  The company&#x27;s website boasts of wanting satisfied customers, but was very rude and not helpful when I contacted them.  When I told them that was going to give their product a bad review, they threatened me with an attorney!!!  Worst customer service ever!!</li>
    <li> Within a couple of hours of using this cream I broke out worst than I ever have before,  it is no more than a cheap lotion.  It is not worth the money.  Big hassle to return the product and get your money back.  Again please dont use this product.  Especially not on a child!</li>
    <li> I read so many great reviews about this product, so I decided to try it. All I can say it&#x27;s that this product is not for everyone. Instead of making my eczema better, let&#x27;s just say that it \\&quot;angered\\&quot; my skin and didn&#x27;t stop the itchiness. I had to make more research to help my condition, and what worked for me was Eucerin&#x27;s Dry Skin Therapy Calming Creme.</li>
    <li> this product is not longer effective since they removed the cortisone.  I did give it a try for a few months for psoriasis, but it was was basically just greasy stuff on my elbows and knees that did nothing.  bought this other stuff, \\&quot;MG 217\\&quot; and it completely cleared it up in 4 weeks.  amzing stuff!!  maybe the freederm works for other conditions, but not for psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream back in, I believe it was 2006. I have chronic eczema over large areas of my body. My right hand is probably the most severe as it is always prone to cracking. I wish I would&#x27;ve wrote this review sooner because I&#x27;m having trouble remembering the specifics. Here&#x27;s what I do remember. I saw some success. Itching definately calmed, and dark areas began to clear. I think the bottom line was that it was far, far too expensive for the limited results I was seeing. Because I have eczema over several areas of the body, it seemed as though the jar only lasted a few days. It was $30 for a very small jar, and the additional benefit was minimal compared to what I&#x27;d seen with just some Eucerin cream. Beware though, I&#x27;ve read other reviews that seem to list this product as having a formula switch somewhere in there.</li>
    <li> Cortizone10 cream works better for general skin rashes IMO.  Product is hyped far more than it perfromed for me.</li>
    <li> I got very small spot on my face,and I tried very cheap eczema cream Cortaid with 1.0% of hydrocortisone. It didnt help much, though it became significantly small, less red &amp; no itch at all, Id say \\&quot;almost gone\\&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so after I decided to buy this one , more expensive brand Freederm HC with same amount of hydrocorisone 1.0% . It didnt make ANY CHANGES..Im using it every day, evry time I wash my face, since 3 months, that small spot is still there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money, it works exactly as any another cheap brand. In my case it didnt work better than Cortaid that I had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> the cream is water based, smell is not strong, not particularly pleasant. did nothing for eczema on my kids.</li>
    <li> Just read them. They are professionally written and they all sound alike. Nearly all the 5 star reviews are miracle cures for young children. And notice how the majority of 5 star reviewers names have quotes around them. You should really be reading the reviews of those that gave it 3 stars or less. From what I can tell, this is nothing more than over-the-counter 1% hydrocortisone cream. Be wary!</li>
    <li> My baby came down with eczema at 2 months old- The nurse said she&#x27;d never seen eczema that looked that bad.  In the creases of his arms, neck and knees it was so inflamed it was oozing yellow fluid.  We tried everything-we went to 3 doctors and tried every prescription they would give us.  This works better than high-powered cortizone or tubes of cream we paid $90 for.  I don&#x27;t know or care what is in it but I can tell you I never run out.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for my son. He had a reaction to the cream - the advert states \\&quot;no side effects\\&quot;. His body went red and had lumps and bumps after we applied the cream.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from eczema for a couple of years trying all the creams that doctors had to offer.  Nothing worked for me.  When I came across the website for freederm, I was so desperate to try anything.  The itching and embarrasing red sores all over my legs prevented me from wearing dresses, skirts, or shorts.  I couldn&#x27;t sleep at night and my days were full of discomfort.  Scars covered my legs.  Then I found freederm. &lt;br /&gt;In less than 2 months, the eczema was completely clear.  The scabs have healed and my legs look normal again.  It&#x27;s summertime and I can enjoy it.  Now, I only apply freederm once a day after my shower to keep the eczema from coming back.  Many doctors told me that the eczema was stress related, but regardless of what is happening around me, it never comes back.</li>
    <li> I am a lifelong, chronic eczema sufferer who experienced severe breakouts on my hands, arms, neck, and face.  I am relieved to have finally found a cream that worked for me.  Before Freederm there were many days where I didn&#x27;t want to go out in public, because my flareups were so bad.  I had strangers ask me if I had been crying, because my face was so deeply reddened by the rash.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong it is not a total cure all, but it does lessen the rash symptoms and redness, most especially the irritating nighttime itching (I am sleeping so much better now).  I personally found Freederm HC to work just as well as the steroid ointments without the harsh effects.  I also know from having severe eczema on my hands for the last 10 years that my skin used to be really thick and patchy, but after using the Freederm HC for just over a week, my once rough and severly dry patches were just as smooth and soft as the healthier skin.  It was a very welcomed sign to see, since I was always self concious of the darkened rough areas around my knuckles.  I can&#x27;t tell you how long it has been since my hands were the same skin tone.  It used to be that my hands looked weathered like old leather, and now it is as though my hands are restored to a more youthful even glow.      There is one item I would like to touch on.  I personally found that the results in just 3 days claim was a bit unrealistic for someone like me, who has had severe and constant eczema flareups for years.  I found that my skin peeled constantly for the first few days to the point that I was going to give up and return it.  My chiropractor who referred me to try Freederm in the first place, told me that it is common to peel.  Afterall, peeling is part of the body&#x27;s healing process.  He urged me to continue with using the cream and to stay away from switching back to the steroid ointments.  After 3 months of positive results with this product, I am so glad that I listened to his advice.     I have also used Freederm on my 2 young sons, who both get a seldom flare up here and there, and I am pleased to say that we get them back to clear skin in just 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> A co-worker told me about this product.  Her daughter needed help with a stubborn skin rash.  The daughter  used a small amount of this cream and good results were seen within 5 days.  I tried the product and experienced similar results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pure magic in a bottle!  &lt;br /&gt;I happen to be a mom &amp; pediatrician whose sons have had severe eczema. The younger is now 6 months old and has had severe eczema from the age of 6 weeks. When I say severe, I mean rash covering the entire body except diaper area, unable to sleep well due to itching, complete with oodles of scratch marks where he had rubbed himself raw. As a physician I had him seen by specialists who treated with all the standard recommended meds: varying strengths of corticosteroids and elidel.  Despite these, there was no relief forom the constant itching all day and night which was driving our family crazy. In desperation, I searched the internet and came across Freederm. I was VERY sceptical as it contains only a very low strength corticosteroid, which I had already tried to no avail. After I got it, within two days, his skin was like butter!! I ran out and it all came back with a vengeance - I had some express shipped to my house!!  If you are at your wits end as I was, you must try this!!</li>
    <li> As soon as I got the Freederm moisturizer, I was immediately suspicious because it looked exactly like Cerave which I purchased over the counter in a container that was twice the size, yet half the price of Freederm.  Cerave had little palliative effects for me and Freederm had absolutely zero effect on my eczema versus the Cerave, and did virtually nothing to moisturize my skin.  20 minutes after application, my skin was just as dry and irritated as before the application.    I have since switched to moisturizers and balms from Earthworm Herbals.  That product has not cured my eczema by any means, but it has stabilized it. It does maintain it&#x27;s moisturizing effects for a few hours after application.  Best of all, it reduces the itchiness to a great degree so I don&#x27;t have to apply steroid creamanywhere near as much as before.  I&#x27;d much rather have natural products on my skin than a steroid cream.    Freederm cream was an absolute waste of money.  Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with anxiety induced excema. The itch was driving me insane. I purchased the product with great hopes after reading all the positive responses however after faithful use for two weeks, it has done absolutely nothing, its not even a good hand or body lotion. I feel like I was duped by a \\&quot;snake oil charmer\\&quot;. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
    <li> Ive had eczema on my eyelid for a year nothing worked well, elidel worked some what . I cant believe it, a product that does what it says it does! THANKS THANKS .</li>
    <li> I have skin eczema that has been rapidly spreading to pretty much all my fingers on my hand. It caused me considerable discomfort and was unsightly. I&#x27;ve tried so many different topical ointments prescribed by physicians but none brought it under control. I heard about Freederm through a friend and started using it. I gave up after one month because I didn&#x27;t see any improvement. My friend told me to stick with it for a couple of months and the eczema would clear up. I did just that and for the first time in years, I have been pretty much eczema free for about two months in a row. I put the cream on every night and if I start to see any sign of eczema returning, I start using the cream 2-3 times a day and it always clears it up. I would recommend this to any one who suffers from eczema.</li>
    <li> This cream worked really well on my three-year-old&#x27;s eczema behind her ear.  I applied it only for two days and the rash was gone.  It briefly came back for one day and I applied the cream again and it was gone.  So far, my daughter&#x27;s eczema has not returned and it has been about two months.  I highly recommend this cream for eczema.</li>
    <li> I was a bit leary of this stuff at first but when all the creams i purchased for my 18 month old failed (even the doctor&#x27;s presscription!) i caved in and forked the $30 over.  Well let me tell you it was the best investement i ever purchased!  Within 36 hours my poor baby was a happy toddler again.  Her rash had cleared up about 95%.   &lt;br /&gt;The only thing i will mention is that this cream just cures eczema and doesn&#x27;t really provide the skin with moisturizers.  I still have to use a seperate cream to moisturizer her daily.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandson, who has eczema, not a severe case but still has an occasional seasonal flare-up with it.  Wanted to try something besides prescriptions, so thought I&#x27;ve give this a try. Waste of money, did NOT SEE any improvement, as a matter a fact it seems as though it made it worse. I even purchases the soap, moisturizer &amp; creme.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> In response to another review - I do not work for Freederm.  However, one year, I got eczema really bad and went to a dermatologist where he prescribed me a prescription strength cream.  It actually made it itch worse.  I thought it was never going to end until I was googling one night and came across the Freederm website, so I decided to give it a try.  I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose at that point.  When I got it and put it on, the itching immediately stopped.  I just put it on now when I need it.  It is wonderful.  It may not work for everyone, but it definitely worked for me.  It can&#x27;t hurt to try something new if what you are trying isn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> First off, my review of this product seems to have been removed. &lt;br /&gt;Now, I see the product, since I purchased it, is available without cortisone? &lt;br /&gt;Oh.....things have changed. &lt;br /&gt;Anyone try the NEW one without Cortisone? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If its still got cortisone, I am not risking using it on my child everyday and risking thinning of the skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> My son developed some mild excema a few months ago and I ordered this cream to try out since it has so many good reviews and seems to work for everyone!  The instructions were to put the cream on 3 times a day.  I had only done twice on that first day and my sons excema got this burn type reaction.  The spots I tried the cream on (cause i only tried a couple of spots first in case it didn&#x27;t work) were really red and inflamed and seemed to hurt him more.  The other places where i didn&#x27;t put the cream remained the same.  I stopped using the freederm cream and the \\&quot;burn\\&quot; patches cleared up within four-five days.    Mabye the cream works for some people, but if you do try it out make sure test it out on some areas first before applying over your whole problem area.  Especially if you are putting this on a child!    One more thing.  When I tried to get authorization to return the product they kept telling me that it was an allergic reaction and kept trying to convince be to purchase another of their product.  All I wanted was to return the product and get my full refund (which they guarantee within 30 days)  Their customer service is very bad.  They were rude and acted offended that I wanted to return their product.  All in all I did not have a good experience with this company.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER HAS HAD EXCEMA SINCE SHE WAS 2- MILD TO MODERATE.  I BOUGHT THIS PRAYING IT WOULD HELP, BUT IT BURNT HER SKIN EVERY TIME I PUT IT ON.  SHE WOULD SCREAM AND CRY.  I THINK THE BURNING DID MAKE THE ITCHING STOP- BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT.  HOWEVER, I AM GIVING IT A 2 BECAUSE MY HUSBAND HAS THIS STRESS REACTION THAT ITCHES HIS ARM.  HE SAID IF HE PU THE LOTION ON EARLY ENOUGH, IT WOULD TAKE THE ITCH AWAY.  HE HAD NO RASH OR BROKEN SKIN, THOUGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR MY DAUGHTER, IT SEEMS TO WORK TO MATCH CORTIZONE OVER THE COUNTER WITH EUCRIN CREAM IN THE TUB.  IT IS THE ORIGINAL FORMULA- NOT THE LOTION.  IT IS SUPER THICK AND CREAMY, AND DOESN&#x27;T BURN HER AT ALL.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I developed perioral dermatitis and tried everything imaginable to cure it....creams, oils, change in diet, etc. I was skeptical when I ordered this product and didn&#x27;t open the box for two days after I received it because I was sure it would not work. I was wrong! My face cleared up almost immediately. I felt it was working as soon as I put it on and noticed a difference within hours....within days the redness was gone.</li>
    <li> WE USED ELIDEL CREAM FOR SOME TIME UNTIL FINDING OUT THE BAD SIDE EFFECTS THAT COME WITH IT- DETERMINED TO FIND SOMETHING SAFE WE WERE RECOMMENDED FREEDERM BY A FRIEND- WOW- WE ARE SO PLEASED AND RELIEVED TO FIND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I bought these creams to try on my eczema and within 10 miinutes of applying I broke out into a contact dermatitis rash onmy neck and face.  I have had skin problems all of my life and never had a contact rash before.  It was so itchy and burning, I had to go to the ER for steroids and antihistamines it was so bad. PLEASE DO NOT BUY!  I hope I can easilty get a refund because it really pissed me off.  I agree with the other posters that the good feedback is done by freederm associates.</li>
    <li> Freederm came totally broken with the product spilled all over the bubble wrap. When I called, their phone disconnected me twice. When I tried the 800 number, the person on the line couldn&#x27;t help me but said she would take a message. A message!!!!!! Please!!!!!! Her voice was lethargic and flat. I&#x27;ve never been so unsatisfied with customer service on a product. I&#x27;d like to try the product, but I want a new, undamaged jar.</li>
    <li> This product has not done what I intended for it to do. I still have the same spots I had before using it. Any answers as to what might work for me?</li>
    <li> This product did not work for us--I believe just over the counter Hydrocortisone would have worked as well as this.  I will admit my son&#x27;s eczema was pretty progressed by the time we got FreeDerm, and we did not see an improvement in a month&#x27;s time.  Some of the spots that were just beginning to develop might have improved, but we ended up having to get a prescription afterall, which healed the eczema in a week.  And Eucerin cream (Equate brand)smothered on after a bath has done wonders preventing any new eczema (recommended by our physician).</li>
    <li> My son has had severe eczema since birth and we&#x27;ve tried almost everything from rice bran to Protopic. Nothing worked except Freederm. It was like a miracle for him so he has been using Freederm for more than ten years. Don&#x27;t give up--try this product and you might have success like us.</li>
