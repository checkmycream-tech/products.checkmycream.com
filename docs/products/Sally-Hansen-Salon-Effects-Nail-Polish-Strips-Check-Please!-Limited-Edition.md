      <li>great buy</li>
      <li>The designs are great, very many complements on these.</li>
      <li>The look so good</li>
      <li>The greatest invention since the light bulb.</li>
      <li>Loved the design I got a lot of compliments with this one</li>
      <li>These are the best nail strips Ive came across brand wise, They are more like real nail polish then plastic which just falls off.</li>
      <li>I tried to draw checkered patterns on my own with a nail polish pen and couldn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>They apply easily and they look great for many days, but when it&#x27;s time to remove it</li>
      <li>These seemed great when they first came out</li>
      <li>what&#x27;s great is I&#x27;m able to do it myself without painting my whole finger!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve lost more of these to that than to chipping the tips.</li>
      <li>I love the strips.</li>
      <li>Love this one and lots of compliments</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re fantastic!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just okay about.</li>
      <li>I love the pattern on these strips.</li>
      <li>we love the checkered Look</li>
      <li>One of my favorite prints.</li>
      <li>Worked perfectly and a big hit at the race track!</li>
      <li>Love these wraps.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I will buy many more colors and designs.  </li>
      <li>I love how easy applying the nail polish strips was.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, and received tons of compliments.</li>
      <li>These nail polish stickers are the easy way to change nail color in a jiffy.</li>
      <li>they were super cute</li>
      <li>They came delivered very fresh.</li>
      <li>I just love these...bought my first pack of these yesterday in \\&quot;Check</li>
      <li>You need to have a clean edge.</li>
      <li>Also,the directions almost sound like you wrap the strip over your nail but that really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>and if you don&#x27;t use it right away the glue somehow disappears and it doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
      <li>The effect was stunning and plan to use for every major NASCAR event.</li>
      <li>They take a somewhat steady hand to apply, but I was able to do a decent job while riding as a passenger in the car on the highway.</li>
      <li>/&gt;only to find out, they apply so nice, last so long and get you so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;applied</li>
      <li>in moments -- your ready to GO!</li>
      <li>I love these because they last for close to two weeks.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it i put a couple on crooked and thought it&#x27;d be better to have someone else put them on.</li>
      <li>Regardless of this minor drawback, I definitely intend to purchase these again in many more designs.</li>
      <li>I was able to use about half of the strips in the pack for my manicure and had to paint the rest of my nails.</li>
      <li>and you need a steady hand.</li>
      <li>and i got quite a few compliments,looked cute.</li>
      <li>there are extras if you screw up but as soon as you open the sealed pack of 5 they start to dry out even though each strip has a top and bottom layer of protection.</li>
      <li>So if you think you can do a new nail a day or 2</li>
      <li>Besides bad packaging,the actual product was fine, and worked great.</li>
      <li>From what I&#x27;ve read- this product is actually very cool and works well, but when I ordered them they arrived dried out and did not stick at all.</li>
      <li>If you need a quick fix for rough nails for a day or so, these are the solution.</li>
      <li>Also, coat the strips after application with a clear coat to avoid chipping.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely hooked and my natural nails have never been as long and symmetrical with no breaks or chips.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cool concept but hard to use</li>
</ol>

<li> Cool concept but hard to use</li>
<li> You get enough to do both hands if you have long nails or if you have short nails</li>
<li> /&gt;I had no trouble applying strips and found that running the angled edge of the included orange wood stick along the edge of the nail where the strip folds over was precise for cutting the strip along the edge of the nail.</li>
<li> Regular nail polish remover has not really work well to remove the remaining polish.</li>
<li> I opened the package so excited today, unfortunately they were expired.</li>
<li> It takes about 10 minutes and your nails are already dry.</li>
<li> Violent Lips - The Black &amp; White Checker - Set of 3 Temporary Lip Appliques]] and received many compliments from my friends as well as complete strangers.</li>
<li> I spent four minutes per nail.</li>
<li> People think I spent a fortune getting my nails done, and</li>
<li> My only negative comment is that they took A REALLY LONG TIME to remove.</li>
<li> the nails lasted longer than i expected!</li>
<li> These were not fresh however and kept getting stuck to the plastic while I tried to peel them off to use.</li>
<li> If they&#x27;re not fresh they don&#x27;t stick as well.</li>
<li> Even though I chipped mine the 2nd day the over-the-top design is distracting enough that no one noticed.</li>
<li> The strips for me can stay on for about a week &amp; a half.</li>
<li> you can probably cut one set in half and get 2 rounds out of it.</li>
<li> The black squares did not want to come off.</li>
<li> if they work properly they last so long, but unfortunately this was my second bad experience!</li>
<li> Sadly, the box looked used, it was torn open and had nail polish on it.</li>
<li> I bought these because I was unable to create checks with regular nail polish.  </li>
<li> Perhaps it is because I applied a base coat to my nails before the nail decal?</li>
<li> I coordinated them with Violent Lips temporary lip tattoos</li>

    <li> Easy to apply, and received tons of compliments. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> A great deal – cheaper than retail.  I love these because they last for close to two weeks.</li>
    <li> They came delivered very fresh. If they&#x27;re not fresh they don&#x27;t stick as well. Worked perfectly and a big hit at the race track!</li>
    <li> I opened the package so excited today, unfortunately they were expired. They don&#x27;t stick to your nails. Such a bummer. I Use to buy them a lot cuz if they work properly they last so long, but unfortunately this was my second bad experience!</li>
    <li> Cool concept but hard to use and if you don&#x27;t use it right away the glue somehow disappears and it doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> If a boy painted his nails, this would be it.&lt;br /&gt;so i ordered a bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only to find out, they apply so nice, last so long and get you so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;applied in moments -- your ready to GO!</li>
    <li> I just love these...bought my first pack of these yesterday in \\&quot;Check Please\\&quot; and they are stunning!!!  I can&#x27;t stop looking at my hands...I&#x27;m sure I will buy many more colors and designs.  Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> These seemed great when they first came out so I got them and they were a pain in the neck to take them off.  They turned my nails yellow and I had to use over 20 cotton balls to get them off my nails.  Do not buy these if you want to spend an hr just trying to remove them.</li>
    <li> I work on my motorcycle and hand wash dishes, and my nails are totally protected for up to two weeks using these strips. I am absolutely hooked and my natural nails have never been as long and symmetrical with no breaks or chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no trouble applying strips and found that running the angled edge of the included orange wood stick along the edge of the nail where the strip folds over was precise for cutting the strip along the edge of the nail.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was unable to create checks with regular nail polish.  The effect was stunning and plan to use for every major NASCAR event.</li>

    <li> Loved the design I got a lot of compliments with this one</li>
    <li> the nails lasted longer than i expected! they were super cute and i got quite a few compliments,looked cute. great buy</li>
    <li> Love these wraps. They last 2 weeks !</li>
    <li> I love the pattern on these strips. Even though I chipped mine the 2nd day the over-the-top design is distracting enough that no one noticed. The strips themselves I&#x27;m just okay about. The first time I tried it i put a couple on crooked and thought it&#x27;d be better to have someone else put them on. Also,the directions almost sound like you wrap the strip over your nail but that really doesn&#x27;t work. You need to have a clean edge. You get enough to do both hands if you have long nails or if you have short nails you can probably cut one set in half and get 2 rounds out of it. there are extras if you screw up but as soon as you open the sealed pack of 5 they start to dry out even though each strip has a top and bottom layer of protection. So if you think you can do a new nail a day or 2 later you&#x27;re out of luck. But maybe if you have an airtight container it might last longer. The biggest problem i&#x27;m having with this is that when i shampoo my hair catched the edge of the strip at the nail bed and pulls up the edges. I&#x27;ve lost more of these to that than to chipping the tips.</li>
    <li> People think I spent a fortune getting my nails done, and what&#x27;s great is I&#x27;m able to do it myself without painting my whole finger!</li>
    <li> If you need a quick fix for rough nails for a day or so, these are the solution. The look so good and if you wear these people will ask you how you got them done. I love the strips.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my daughter for her 50&#x27;s graduation party  we love the checkered Look we will bye again</li>
    <li> I tried to draw checkered patterns on my own with a nail polish pen and couldn&#x27;t. I love how easy applying the nail polish strips was. It just takes a while and you need a steady hand. Also, coat the strips after application with a clear coat to avoid chipping.</li>
    <li> Love this one and lots of compliments</li>
    <li> One of my favorite prints. These were not fresh however and kept getting stuck to the plastic while I tried to peel them off to use. I was able to use about half of the strips in the pack for my manicure and had to paint the rest of my nails.</li>
    <li> Sadly, the box looked used, it was torn open and had nail polish on it. Besides bad packaging,the actual product was fine, and worked great.</li>
    <li> These nail polish stickers are the easy way to change nail color in a jiffy. It takes about 10 minutes and your nails are already dry. The greatest invention since the light bulb.</li>
    <li> From what I&#x27;ve read- this product is actually very cool and works well, but when I ordered them they arrived dried out and did not stick at all. It took me a while to figure out why I couldn&#x27;t get them to work until I ran into a girl who had the same problem.</li>
    <li> They arrived on time.  They worked well and I got compliments on the the checkered flagdesign.</li>
    <li> I bought these nail polish strips to wear for Mardi Gras in St. Louis over the weekend. They&#x27;re fantastic! I coordinated them with Violent Lips temporary lip tattoos [[ASIN:B006R0LFRO Violent Lips - The Black &amp; White Checker - Set of 3 Temporary Lip Appliques]] and received many compliments from my friends as well as complete strangers. They take a somewhat steady hand to apply, but I was able to do a decent job while riding as a passenger in the car on the highway. I did not use a topcoat since I knew I was only going to wear them for two days. My only negative comment is that they took A REALLY LONG TIME to remove. I spent four minutes per nail. The black squares did not want to come off. I tried acetone as well as acetone-free remover and the latter was what worked. Perhaps it is because I applied a base coat to my nails before the nail decal? Regardless of this minor drawback, I definitely intend to purchase these again in many more designs.</li>
    <li> They apply easily and they look great for many days, but when it&#x27;s time to remove it it&#x27;s a nightmare. Regular nail polish remover has not really work well to remove the remaining polish.</li>
