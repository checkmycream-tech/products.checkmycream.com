      <li>Beautiful scent, not heavy or overwhelming.</li>
      <li>i got both compliments from wearing the perfum from it smells nice and sweet to smells like detergeant .. or cleaning supplies odor</li>
      <li>(Strong perfumes)then  abercrombie 41 is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a softer smell, if you like stuff like Clinique happy, or D&amp;G light blue, or any ralph lauren perfume-</li>
      <li>Great product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly</li>
      <li>/&gt;However if you like softer stuff like CK euphoria, or the original Juicy perfume...</li>

      <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>Anyway, Abercrombie 8 is the closest scent I have found to the classic 41.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite purfume, easier to have sent then drive 45 minutes to a store just to purchase, and a little bit cheaper.</li>
      <li>There are a few misc bottles of it out there, but I don&#x27;t love it enough to pay $200 for the bottle!!</li>
