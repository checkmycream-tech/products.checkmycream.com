### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>These are the best for your feet.</li>
      <li>excellent value and great for your tootsies!</li>
      <li>Five stars for it&#x27;s awesome &#x27;raspiness&#x27; —</li>
      <li>Great buffer for your feet.  </li>
      <li>My feet always looked great, because I could literally afford to get one every week.  </li>
      <li>Great as alternative to scrubbers at salons.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
      <li>Very satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>but it really is worth every penny - my feet are happy!</li>
      <li>This one is nice on tougher calluses but</li>
      <li>I own two</li>
      <li>I also have the #11 which is made with a nice ergonomic handle.</li>
      <li>the #11 is the best at giving your feet a good overall smoothing.</li>
      <li>More of a buffing file.  </li>
      <li>It works better for me than the Diamancel file which I also like, but is more flexible than the file.</li>
      <li>Works so much better than anything else.</li>
      <li>Great product I&#x27;d readily recommend.</li>
      <li>the handle and the design on the medium tool are much better.</li>
      <li>I have the medium rasp of this which I think is better.</li>
      <li>this tool was fantastic!</li>
      <li>Love this foot file.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I risked the price to buy this.</li>
      <li>My daughter used mine and loved it do much I gave it to her and will buy another one for myself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simply the best and worth the price.</li>
      <li>None of them provided ergonomic AND strong skin removal.</li>
      <li>It gets pretty warm from friction during use.</li>
      <li>The #20 is a great companion however, to further smooth rougher spots.</li>
      <li>and they will stay baby smooth.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need another tool to smooth my callouses at home.</li>
      <li>This is my solution for keeping my feet smooth in between pedicures.</li>
      <li>one star for the cheap, flimsy &#x27;handle&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, cheap &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; styles on plastic handles, motorized sanding-style devices, and the Denco foot buffer.</li>
      <li>It works FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny, is cheaper than 1 or 2 pedicures and it is yours for many years to come.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, clean, and store.</li>
      <li>It will polish your feet fairly well, but it did not rip through the callouses on my feet nearly as well as I had hoped it would.  </li>
      <li>I really recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>It seems &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; but it does an excellent job of taming callouses in hard to reach spots, like toes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth paying alittle more for such a durable and effective product.</li>
      <li>I have very calloused and cracked heals and have tried many products and lotions.</li>
      <li>it bends very easily, but does get most of the dry skin off of my heels.</li>
      <li>After a 30-minute soak in warm water, I was able to smooth out my callouses to baby-softness with very little effort on my part.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you, it was worth</li>
      <li>Worth it?</li>
      <li>It takes off dry skin easily and the file itself is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>This file (USED ON DRY FEET) is the very best thing for buffing off dry, cracking, callused, thickened skin.</li>
      <li>I could use a little more commercial grade rasp but this has been the best I have found so far.</li>
      <li>The rasp is one piece, made of a lightweight and very thin but incredibly durable stainless steel which makes it easy to clean--just rinse under water!     </li>
      <li>I wash the diamencel with soap and water after every use and it is good as new for the following day.</li>
      <li>and you have a nice little pile of powdered skin on the floor - but baby smooth skin on your feet.  </li>
      <li>Easy to keep clean with a toothbrush and a dab of detergent or white vinegar.</li>
      <li>It really does the job!</li>
      <li>I was devasted to lose my first one after 5 years.</li>
      <li>The file fills up with dead skin and needs to be rigorously cleaned fairly often or its effectiveness is severely diminished.</li>
      <li>I purchased the #11 foot file a few years ago and was so delighted with it, I decided to purchase the #20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>I threw away all of my other &amp;#34;foot &amp;#34; items, as this one is definitely the most effective.  </li>
      <li>, it was far cheapr, far better made and guarnateed for (don&#x27;t worry about Sears folding, there is a huge line of potential buyers for the Craftsman devision) life!</li>
      <li>The file cleans easily with soap and water and will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be sure to use on dry skin.</li>
      <li>It will work this way, but is less effective.</li>
      <li>This has made walking more comfortable without the hard, cracked callouses on my heels.  </li>
      <li>It is more flimsy than I expected-</li>
      <li>Seriously, it really works.  </li>
      <li>It really smooths them out.</li>
      <li>Really like this product also.</li>
      <li>This rasp works really well.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Absolutely</li>
      <li>I tried a Craftsman &#x27;wood&#x27; rasp on another corn (after cleaning in Betadine + heat) and it worked absolutely as well.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll have your feet ready for summer sandals in no time.</li>
      <li>The shaver works great, but I needed to soak my feet first and if you aren&#x27;t careful you can actually cut to deep and make your feet very sore or risk infection.  </li>
      <li>I use it daily on a dry foot and my feet are smoother than I&#x27;ve ever experienced, even when I used creams and soaks almost daily.</li>
      <li>The price may seem a bit high, but it pays for itself, really, in one use.</li>
      <li>The Diamancel is probably one of the better products on the market to clean and beautify dry, rough feet.  </li>
      <li>It does smooth out those dry feet at the heel.</li>
      <li>The version with the black handle (which cost more) is easier on your hands.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty simple to use and works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>In between uses, I like to give it a quick scrub with a soapy nail brush and sanitize it if necessary.</li>
      <li>The #20 removes more dead skin.</li>
      <li>Eventually I will have to replace it, but I definitely think I am getting my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>I used to live in San Francisco - where a mani-pedi cost you $20</li>
      <li>Do this last in the shower as your feet need time to soften first.</li>
      <li>It attacks rough areas quickly and painlessly.</li>
      <li>I have callouses on my feet so thick and tough, even my pedicurist is impressed.     </li>
      <li>Within a few seconds your feet can be smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>use it on dry skin or after a shower to remove more dead skin.</li>
      <li>feet, and rub back and forth over the rough areas - the dead skin comes off in a fine powder that as I recall one reviewer likened to parmesan cheese - and that is exactly what it is like.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve probably tried every new callous remover on the market, and keep coming back to Diamancel.</li>
      <li>it really got rid of my dry skin.</li>
      <li>II followed instructions to a T, but apparently this stuff isn&#x27;t meant for Houston 90+% humidity and the oiliness it causes.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong, though I can see it starting to wear down a little.  </li>
      <li>This works the callous down gently so you don&#x27;t overdue it.</li>
      <li>The diamond chips feel rough, but won&#x27;t cut you if you run your fingers over it, so it&#x27;s pretty safe, unlike callous shavers which can be dangerous to use on your feet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great buffer for your feet.  The version with the black handle (which cost more) is easier on your hands.  The #20 removes more dead skin. The #11 smooths the skin after you have used the #20.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a must for those rough places on your feet. It really smooths them out.</li>
    <li> This rasp works really well. I have very calloused and cracked heals and have tried many products and lotions. This works the callous down gently so you don&#x27;t overdue it. I could use a little more commercial grade rasp but this has been the best I have found so far.</li>

    <li> Worth every penny, is cheaper than 1 or 2 pedicures and it is yours for many years to come.  I really recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I have callouses on my feet so thick and tough, even my pedicurist is impressed.     I&#x27;ve tried several products on the market (shavers, creams) including the Pedegg, (waste of money) which didn&#x27;t even begin to scrape the surface. I was afraid I would forever be paying a pedicurist to keep my callouses in check until I read about the Diamancel #20 Callous Rasp.     After a 30-minute soak in warm water, I was able to smooth out my callouses to baby-softness with very little effort on my part. It&#x27;s just amazing! The diamond chips feel rough, but won&#x27;t cut you if you run your fingers over it, so it&#x27;s pretty safe, unlike callous shavers which can be dangerous to use on your feet. The rasp is one piece, made of a lightweight and very thin but incredibly durable stainless steel which makes it easy to clean--just rinse under water!     I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need another tool to smooth my callouses at home. The price may seem a bit high, but it pays for itself, really, in one use. For me it means not having to see my pedicurist every month for maintenance.</li>
    <li> The only file you will need for the rest of your life! Easy to use, clean, and store. With proper care lasts a lifetime. Great as alternative to scrubbers at salons.</li>
    <li> I have the driest feet. I have tried every tool and lotion every created. this tool was fantastic! it really got rid of my dry skin. I bought this tool and the buffer.</li>
    <li> It will polish your feet fairly well, but it did not rip through the callouses on my feet nearly as well as I had hoped it would.  My callouses get very thick very fast and even with nightly scrubbings with this, they kept getting thicker.  The file fills up with dead skin and needs to be rigorously cleaned fairly often or its effectiveness is severely diminished.</li>
    <li> It is more flimsy than I expected- it bends very easily, but does get most of the dry skin off of my heels.</li>
    <li> The Diamancel is probably one of the better products on the market to clean and beautify dry, rough feet.  (Note:  I&#x27;ve never used the razor blade type products because they scare me).  It&#x27;s pretty simple to use and works pretty well.  I would&#x27;ve given the product five stars if it got rid of the cracks on my heels.  Regardless, it was money well spent to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Really like this product also. It seems &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; but it does an excellent job of taming callouses in hard to reach spots, like toes. Be sure to use on dry skin. Easy to keep clean with a toothbrush and a dab of detergent or white vinegar.</li>
    <li> I had really thick callouses on the bottom of my feet, probably corns really. Incredibly painful and thick, but this tool actually shaved down to were I could walk pain free.  It&#x27;s fantastic and I would have given it five stars, save for the outrageous (that would be an understatement) price! I tried a Craftsman &#x27;wood&#x27; rasp on another corn (after cleaning in Betadine + heat) and it worked absolutely as well.  Not only that, it was far cheapr, far better made and guarnateed for (don&#x27;t worry about Sears folding, there is a huge line of potential buyers for the Craftsman devision) life!</li>
    <li> This file beats anything I have ever used. It takes off dry skin easily and the file itself is easy to clean. My daughter used mine and loved it do much I gave it to her and will buy another one for myself. Expensive?  Yes. Worth it? Absolutely</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well this works. use it on dry skin or after a shower to remove more dead skin. I use it with the buffer and Flexol cream.</li>
    <li> I have the medium rasp of this which I think is better. This one is nice on tougher calluses but the handle and the design on the medium tool are much better. I have small hands and only a size 8 foot and I would say if my feet were any bigger this would be a little too small.&lt;br /&gt;But it does stay sharp and reduce calluses.</li>
    <li> Five stars for it&#x27;s awesome &#x27;raspiness&#x27; — one star for the cheap, flimsy &#x27;handle&#x27;.  I also have the #11 which is made with a nice ergonomic handle. But this thing is like they just forgot to put a handle around the rasp part. Why wouldn&#x27;t they make them all with the same handle?</li>
    <li> It was expensive but I expect it to last for many years. I would give this rasp a 5 star rating if it had a padded handle.</li>
    <li> No better than the $5 ones from the drugstore. It&#x27;s also quite dull after just a week of use.</li>
    <li> Is sorely working down them calluses</li>
    <li> This tool exceeded my expectations. I was skeptical due to the price but it really is worth every penny - my feet are happy!</li>
    <li> Love this foot file. File when feet are dry so you can see problem areas easier. It&#x27;s worth paying alittle more for such a durable and effective product. Very satisfied customer. You&#x27;ll have your feet ready for summer sandals in no time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably tried every new callous remover on the market, and keep coming back to Diamancel. It&#x27;s simply the best and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased the #11 foot file a few years ago and was so delighted with it, I decided to purchase the #20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only purchase one tool the #11 is the best at giving your feet a good overall smoothing. The #20 is a great companion however, to further smooth rougher spots. If you have calloused areas that need attention the #20 will make short work of them and you can follow up with the #11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #20 has a larger, grittier surface than the #11. It attacks rough areas quickly and painlessly. Within a few seconds your feet can be smooth and soft. The file cleans easily with soap and water and will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent value and great for your tootsies!</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product. It works FANTASTIC. Five out of five stars</li>
    <li> As a former manicurist and dry heel sufferer, I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun for my feet. This file (USED ON DRY FEET) is the very best thing for buffing off dry, cracking, callused, thickened skin. The key is to always use it on dry feet, and tap int on the edge of a sink or trash can every now and then to knock off the powder that collects on it. In between uses, I like to give it a quick scrub with a soapy nail brush and sanitize it if necessary. I own two and they have lasted for decades! I also have the larger Diamancel file with the lack, rubbery handle, and while that one is easier to handle, I prefer the #20 Rasp because it is slightly grittier. I think that people who are disappointed with it are likely using it on wet feet. It will work this way, but is less effective.</li>
    <li> My pedicurist recommended this product. It really does the job! I used it on dry skin, moisturized following use, and it has taken care of  dry, dead skin on my feet!</li>
    <li> These are the best for your feet.</li>
    <li> More of a buffing file.  Not for debridement like I was hoping for.  I do use it, but it needs a lot of rinsing to keep the cutting teeth clear.  It gets pretty warm from friction during use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several foot file products over the years. I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, cheap &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; styles on plastic handles, motorized sanding-style devices, and the Denco foot buffer. None of them provided ergonomic AND strong skin removal. The sanding devices and pumice stones were not strong enough or wore down quickly, and the Denco device did not enable me to buff the sides of my heels. This Diamencel rasp is SMALL enough to travel with and store easily and TOUGH enough to remove more dead skin than any other callous product I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it daily on a dry foot and my feet are smoother than I&#x27;ve ever experienced, even when I used creams and soaks almost daily. I wash the diamencel with soap and water after every use and it is good as new for the following day. I&#x27;m glad I risked the price to buy this. Had I bought this product years ago I would have saved at least $100 in other creams and buffing products. I&#x27;ve found they last about a year using it 2-4 times a week.</li>
    <li> This has made walking more comfortable without the hard, cracked callouses on my heels.  My feet are less tired after 10 mile hikes.  So there was benefit for me beyond aesthetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use in the shower.  Do this last in the shower as your feet need time to soften first. Then lather your heels in some soap and give it a few passes all the way around the heel.  Depending on the thickness of your callouses, it might take a few days in a row.  Then just touch up when you remember or after a shave.  Also, this is very thin and light and fits in your travel kit.</li>
    <li> I used to live in San Francisco - where a mani-pedi cost you $20 and you could get one on ANY street corner. My feet always looked great, because I could literally afford to get one every week.  However since moving to the Midwest, my feet just don&#x27;t get the same TLC they used to.  Last summer when I walked around barefoot or in flip flops all day, my heels actually started getting so dry they would crack.  I was horrified, and tried all sorts of scrubs and lotions and even shavers to get rid of those ugly, and painful cracking calluses.  The shaver works great, but I needed to soak my feet first and if you aren&#x27;t careful you can actually cut to deep and make your feet very sore or risk infection.  Plus, the callousing always seemed to come back a few weeks later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other stuff like pumice, and cheese-grater like callus removers from the drug store just didn&#x27;t do the job.  So I was skeptical that this would - but the reviews were glowing -- so I decided to try it.  Let me tell you, it was worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it on dry (not wet)  feet, and rub back and forth over the rough areas - the dead skin comes off in a fine powder that as I recall one reviewer likened to parmesan cheese - and that is exactly what it is like.  15 minutes of buffing your feet with this thing and you have a nice little pile of powdered skin on the floor - but baby smooth skin on your feet.  Seriously, it really works.  Use it every few days to even once a week and maybe some occasional moisturizer and they will stay baby smooth.  And although this is a bit expensive it lasts a long time.  I have had mine about 8 months and it&#x27;s still going strong, though I can see it starting to wear down a little.  Eventually I will have to replace it, but I definitely think I am getting my money&#x27;s worth.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on all that other junk.  Get this - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations.  I threw away all of my other &amp;#34;foot &amp;#34; items, as this one is definitely the most effective.  I was worried that it may to too rough, but it wasn&#x27;t at all.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Works so much better than anything else.</li>
