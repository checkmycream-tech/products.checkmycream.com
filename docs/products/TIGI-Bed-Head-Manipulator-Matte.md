      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This gel is great since it&#x27;s so malleable but it still keeps the shape well.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>Great stuff love it !</li>

      <li>I have lots of Bed Head products and this is just another good addition.</li>
      <li>Works amazing.</li>
      <li>It is not gooey, it&#x27;s very pasty and it smells great!</li>
      <li>This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>Love this product because I get the result I want without the oily appearance.</li>
      <li>I love how this isnt shiny at all.</li>
      <li>I really love this hair paste.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the TIGI Bed Head B for Men Matte Separation Workable Wax, and while I did like it, this product is better by leaps and bounds.</li>
      <li>It offers great texture and hold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too sticky and is easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>So much better than the first one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not thin and creamy like the original Manipulator, this is more of a waxy pomade.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Overall pretty good though.</li>
      <li>My son seems to really like this stuff!!</li>
      <li>Good hold, a little too greasy</li>
      <li>I love the super hold effect, but it almost feels dry when I try to take some out of the plastic case.</li>
      <li>This is the only stuff I have found that gives my fine hair that volume, textured hold without the gel look.</li>
      <li>Great for short hair, messy style.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, I&#x27;m always looking for product that wont leave my hair all stiff.</li>
      <li>It gives a good textured look, it&#x27;s not shiny, and it&#x27;s really thick!!</li>
      <li>but I still miss the old manipulator.</li>
      <li>I really liked the original Manipulator and really hate the current version of it.  </li>

    <li> I really love this hair paste. I&#x27;ve used the TIGI Bed Head B for Men Matte Separation Workable Wax, and while I did like it, this product is better by leaps and bounds. It gives a good textured look, it&#x27;s not shiny, and it&#x27;s really thick!! It is not gooey, it&#x27;s very pasty and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I really liked the original Manipulator and really hate the current version of it.  I had hopes this would be a good replacement. I used it once and threw it away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great . I like my hair spiked.</li>
    <li> This gel is great since it&#x27;s so malleable but it still keeps the shape well. I like that it&#x27;s matte. It&#x27;s not too sticky and is easy to wash out. It also smells really good!</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff I have found that gives my fine hair that volume, textured hold without the gel look. Even after a long day at work, wind blowing through my hair, it still maintains hold and can be styled back into place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching awhile now for something that will hold my thick asian hair up, while still remaining matte. This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far. Just for reference, I&#x27;ve tried: American Crew Fiber and Molding Clay, Gatsby Spiky Edge, Mitch Reformer, Star Wax Clay, and Woody&#x27;s Clay.</li>
    <li> Good hold, a little too greasy</li>
    <li> My son seems to really like this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Skeptical at first. But, this stuff is great. It&#x27;s not thin and creamy like the original Manipulator, this is more of a waxy pomade. It offers great texture and hold.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works amazing.</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever.  Great for short hair, messy style.  Holds but is not stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m always looking for product that wont leave my hair all stiff. I just want that wet look but with some hold, and I have found it in this product. My hair stays in place looking wet and with some bounce in it.</li>
    <li> I love how this isnt shiny at all.</li>
    <li> Received the wrong item in the mail. Instead I received the Bed Head Ego Boost and now I get to go through the hassle of sending it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used regular Manipulator...makes my hair look a bit oily. Love this product because I get the result I want without the oily appearance.</li>

    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for my hair..</li>
    <li> Great stuff love it !</li>

    <li> Love it!! Ordering my second one. So much better than the first one.</li>
    <li> I love the super hold effect, but it almost feels dry when I try to take some out of the plastic case. I know that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to feel like, but I still miss the old manipulator. Overall pretty good though. I have lots of Bed Head products and this is just another good addition.</li>
