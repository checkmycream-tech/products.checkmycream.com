<li> so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
<li> have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil -</li>
<li> Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It is helping to grow back my edges and other areas where my hair has thinned.</li>
<li> It came faster than I expected and larger than I expected.</li>
<li> The only thing that bothered me a little was the pungent scent.</li>
<li> just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand.</li>
<li> I was surprised to see castor oil being sold so inexpensively, and I wondered whether it was inexpensive because of poor quality.</li>
<li> This gave me pause to think perhaps I wasted my money.</li>
<li> This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a thick oil so not a lot is required.</li>
<li> It got here on time and the oil is thick.</li>
<li> I have seen dramatic changes with the growth of my hair..</li>

    <li> Effective product that delivers benefits.The only thing that bothered me a little was the pungent scent.I had to mix Cocunut Oil in it to use in my hair and on my skin.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems to be fine (A on the surface of things, however, the bottle has no information whatever. it simply states to go to their webpage to obtain information. I went there and this product is not even listed, so how much do I take of it? What type or quality of oil  is it? This gave me pause to think perhaps I wasted my money.( no information in order to dodge law suits?)  Also, under CONTACT US, the email address is non existant. I clicked on to send them an email and it was just a blank page.</li>
    <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
    <li> Get this now!  Great quality, insanely fast shipping and the price can not be beat.  Win, win, win!</li>
    <li> Brand new ! And quick delivery !</li>

    <li> Got it sooner than I expected :) Will order again soon!!</li>
    <li> Great price and arrived quickly and well packaged. The oil itself is thick and sticky and has a mild scent, but it&#x27;s not bad. I&#x27;m using it as a hair treatment and on my eyebrows and lashes!</li>
    <li> I love this castor oil. It keeps my natural hair very moisturized.</li>
    <li> it definitely moisturizes my hair. Great during the summer months so far.</li>

    <li> Love it.the bottle is bigger than I thought it would be.cheap as well.makes my hair soft everyday.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best castor oil that I have ever used. I am sold on this one and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I used it twice a day for a week and already started to notice really good results, even on my eyelashes it works wonders! It took about 4 days for them to process my order but after that I received it in the mail two or three days later. So I was pleased with the shipping. I was also loving the price of this oil, most of the time caster oil isn&#x27;t exactly cheap but for this bottle you pay about $7 and get 16oz so that&#x27;s really good. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It came faster than I expected and larger than I expected. I plan on using it for my new hair regimen so that was great to receive it on time. I also like how it is odorless. Many people always complain about how Castor oil smells very strong and unpleasant but this product has no smell. It&#x27;s a thick oil so not a lot is required. Overall pretty satisfied</li>
    <li> This product can&#x27;t get any closer to nature.. the arrival time.. the smell, the feel everything about this is real and all natural thanks Nature&#x27;s oil</li>

    <li> I was surprised to see castor oil being sold so inexpensively, and I wondered whether it was inexpensive because of poor quality. That turned out not to be the case at all. Not only did the product arrive so quickly it made my head spin, but it was very high quality. Checking further, I discovered that the Nature&#x27;s Oil brand carries many other natural products, usually at a very significant savings over other companies. Thanks for the great service. I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is helping to grow back my edges and other areas where my hair has thinned.</li>
    <li> I have seen dramatic changes with the growth of my hair.. this is the same product as Jamaican castor oil so I wanted To try it.. I willl buy this product every time I run out 😊</li>
    <li> So far so good. It got here on time and the oil is thick.</li>
    <li> Beyond my expectations, thanks!</li>
