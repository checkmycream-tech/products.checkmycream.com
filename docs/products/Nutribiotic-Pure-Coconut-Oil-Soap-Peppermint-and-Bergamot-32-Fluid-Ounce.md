      <li>I&#x27;ve had good experiences with various coconut products</li>

      <li>The only way this soap would be better is if it went to the gym for me. :&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to make a nice lather and my hands are much much softer and well moisturized.</li>

    <li> This is fabulous stuff - I really love it - I have both the pure no smell and the one with smell and I like them both.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell and it dried my skin.</li>
    <li> The best castile soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Awesome summer cooling experience. Non drying. You feel wonderful your skin will truly look and feel the best it ever has</li>
    <li> I love this soap so much. I&#x27;m allergic to chemicals and therefore perfumes. Even some essential oils bother me. This nice, light scent is so fresh and yummy and light, and the soap is slippery and clean feeling. I LOVE putting &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; products on my body, and this has all of three, maybe four ingredients. It rinses clean, too, and it&#x27;s the soap I leave for guests at my home. No one complains, even people who prefer commercial products. This stuff is the BEST and it lasts a nice, long time too. Doesn&#x27;t have the harsh/drying sense that Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has plus smells better.</li>
    <li> It gives you such a refreshing feeling.  Large bottle will last quite a while but will purchase again.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong.</li>
    <li> The smell is refreshing and wakes me up in the morning.  I love that it&#x27;s all purpose.  Can use on dogs, laundry, hair, household cleaner etc...great stuff!</li>
    <li> This soap makes me feel really clean without making me feel dry.  That is the most important part of soap, I decided.  People have said that it burns your lady bits, which... I guess their lady bits are untenably sensitive.  Because my normal lady bits were not burned or bothered at all by the suds.  I originally bought this with the hopes that it would help curb my Tina versicolor.  Which, it didn&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s okay.  I did subtract a star for that since that was really the only reason I made this purchase.  Barring that, It&#x27;s clean and natural and I like coconut anything because I feel like it is an amazing versatile fruit that has many beauty applications.  I also like it better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s because there isn&#x27;t any rambling religious narration all over the bottle which is nice and secular.  I appreciate that.</li>
    <li> This saves my hands, especially in cold weather--it&#x27;s not painful to wash with this, but feels soothing!</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF, I USE IT FOR MANY THINGS.</li>
    <li> Five stars because it contains none of the ingredients in salon shampoo that I can&#x27;t spell much less know what I&#x27;m putting on my hair. Just natural coconut oil, good for myself and dog shampoo.</li>
    <li> refreshes, stimulates and opens eyes with all the armoa waffling thru the steam and water ahhhhh. will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Great product for washing hands constantly in winter time. Does not dry out skin. Smells great.</li>
    <li> In a search for a natural shampoo, I tried a well-known peppermint castile soap with terrible results--my hair became stiff as a bottle brush and my skin dried out horribly--so I tried Nutribiotic&#x27;s coconut oil alternative.  It&#x27;s a winner.  I use it to wash from head to toe.  This soap softens my skin and keeps my hair in fine shape between washings.  Nutribiotic smells wonderful; the peppermint and orange scent is very pleasing without overpowering me.  The liquid is not thick, like most shampoo/body wash.  Add it to a loofah or washcloth and it lathers up beautifully.  Economically, a little goes a long way!  The peppermint cools the skin, which is a plus for me in the climate where I live--it&#x27;s going to be hot soon.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great, will order again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this soap. I use it in a foaming dispenser and it works great and lasts forever! This soap has a great scent as well. The best part are the healthy simple ingredients that I can trust. Does a great job of cleaning, I even use it on my face. I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bonner&#x27;s products for years and this one is as good as all the other! The peppermint does leave a nice tingly feeling on your clean hands...</li>
    <li> Great smelling and very efficiently de-greasing (without drying) soap!</li>
    <li> I love it! It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling dry. It would be good for all. Best of all it is non GMO</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful - does not leave a residue and keeps skin soft. I recommend this for winter dry skin...works for me!</li>
    <li> Same consistency as water, so don&#x27;t expect a liquid soap. If you&#x27;re using a loofa, it will leak straight through. A wash cloth is best used with this soap so the cloth &amp;#34;catches&amp;#34; the soap. Aside from that, it smells good and feels good on your skin.</li>
    <li> I did not like this soap.  It has the consistency of water, and it had too much of a &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; to it.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! My hands get very dry, rough, scaly, and often will get raw and rashy, in the winter especially. I wash my hands a lot so I decided to try some kind of natural soap. I&#x27;ve had good experiences with various coconut products so I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a try. I bought a small bottle at one of our local stores to test it out and I liked it so much I bought this much bigger one! It doesn&#x27;t take much to make a nice lather and my hands are much much softer and well moisturized. I&#x27;ve stopped using hand lotion all together. The smell is nice and not too strong, although they do have an unscented version if you&#x27;re sensitive to that kind of thing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great, is light, and best of all is natural.  It feels pure and natural.  I love it!  The only way this soap would be better is if it went to the gym for me. :&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My family loves this soap!</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I will use now. I am very particular about what I put on my face and body. Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good hand soap and I did try it in the shower. Ladies, keep it away from your private parts. It has enough peppermint oil in it to make it burn a bit afterwards for quite awhile.</li>
