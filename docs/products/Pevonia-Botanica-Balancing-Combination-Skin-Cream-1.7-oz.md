      <li>It is a great product, especially if you have touchy skin.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this brand in the past and have been very happy.</li>
      <li>Love this facial scrub ... will buy again for sure!</li>
      <li>I originally learned about this from the lady at the spa who used this product line on my face.</li>
      <li>I placed the order for my full size balancing lotion to continue using at home.</li>
      <li>I do not have any particular effect from this cream, but it is just really ok for me.</li>
      <li>I have tried many facial moisturizers over the years, but this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found to be really great for my combination oily/dry skin.</li>
      <li>this moisturizer is really lovely, it has a fantastic scent to it and it goes on light and provides -moderate coverage.</li>
      <li>was looking for a good cream for a long time...</li>
      <li>A bit of a let down for a product that otherwise works great.</li>
      <li>She was spot on......very light weight, non greasy formula with a very pleasing fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The Combination Skin Cream is light, not greasy, and moisturizes really well.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and smooth after using this lotion!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh and light and creamy and really moisturizes without being oily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 10 years and its worth every cent.</li>
      <li>I used the sample and concurrently did my own independent research on the product.</li>
      <li>I was really exciting to get my product.</li>
      <li>Was worried about whether this item from Amazon was a knock-off or old since the price was so good, so I was happy to see it was exactly the same product as what I have recently ordered directly from Pevonia @ $52.50/jar.</li>
      <li>Light enough for summer, not greasy and easy to apply powder, concealer, and makeup over it.  </li>
      <li>I did not like it very much I am 50 and was to grease for me, and dont like the smell.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light, fast absorbing, and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to cut corners to save money in some areas but this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
      <li>From now on, I won&#x27;t spend the kind of money I spent on this cream without sampling it first.</li>
      <li>I liked the way my skin felt -- soft and not greasy -- and I was further convinced by what I read on the product.</li>
      <li>otherwise so I&#x27;m over it, but at first I was really put off by the smell..</li>
      <li>My skin is healthy and glows and I am not young!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s real.</li>
      <li>and I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>I really like the results; and fully recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>i purchased it and really like it a lot.</li>
      <li>I had gotten a sample of this product and found it worked reasonably well on my oily/combination skin and under a mineral sunscreen I was using, so I took the plunge.</li>
      <li>I am used to it now and really like the cream</li>
      <li>BTW, I have combination skin, super dry in areas and super oily in others...</li>
      <li>I have no personal experience with this product however my beautiful wife loves this product and uses it everyday!  </li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this product while at a spa on vacation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pevonia products for years and highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>In the winter, when my skin is drier, I apply a little more.</li>
      <li>; so many creams are heavy and greasy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on the top of skin forever.</li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and everything breaks me out.  </li>
      <li>I use Proactiv to wash and tone my skin, but wasn&#x27;t happy with their moisturizer and was constantly looking for one that would moisturize my dry areas and not make my face an oil slick.</li>
      <li>However, I may say that in my just started 50th with sensitive skin this cream works well.</li>
      <li>recommend it for sensitive, combination skin</li>
      <li>I dont know if it was and old product</li>
      <li>It works well with my skin as it is not heavy.</li>
      <li>It is clearing up all my skin issues, and I am old (65).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried others.  Expensive and inexpensive.  Nothing works for me like Pevonia.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about 15 years, since recommended by a good spa.</li>
    <li> It is clearing up all my skin issues, and I am old (65).  I just love it!</li>
    <li> I love the light lemon scent this product has - it&#x27;s very clean and refreshing! I also like that while it appears to be an effective moisturizer it&#x27;s also very light. I can&#x27;t say if it balanced my skin or not, but I do like it. The instructions are to apply 2X daily, morning and evening, but I only use it in the morning.</li>
    <li> was looking for a good cream for a long time... if you have a combination to oily skin prone to breakouts - get combination skin series! solved all my skin issues. this is me though, so talk to your skin care specialist about your skin type.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years and have tried many others.  This one does the trick - keeps face moist and balanced.</li>
    <li> I did not like it very much I am 50 and was to grease for me, and dont like the smell. I dont know if it was and old product [[ASIN:B000ULNEUM Pevonia Botanica Balancing Combination Skin Cream 1.7 oz]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pevonia products for years and highly recommend them. The Combination Skin Cream is light, not greasy, and moisturizes really well.</li>
    <li> I love this cream in my face! It makes me feel like I just came out of a spa!</li>
    <li> This is the only cream I can use that will not make me breakout!   When you put on the cream it absorbs into your skin right away, so there isn&#x27;t a greasy feeling and a little goes a long way. Also it smells like lemongrass which I think is a refreshing and clean scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product. A spa I went to on vacation once used this product line, so it always reminds me of that bit of heaven. Beyond that though, t has a wonderful fresh clean scent and is soothing and moisturising.</li>
    <li> Works very well with my kind of skin.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product! Creamy, smells great, and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It is the only product that works well for me.  It is specifically made for oily skin, and truly does keep my skin from getting shiny and oily by the end of middle of the day.  It has grapefruit in it and you can smell it!  It&#x27;s fresh and light and creamy and really moisturizes without being oily.  I love it!  It is fairly expensive and Amazon sells it less than anywhere else I have ever found -- even when including the shipping.</li>
    <li> Love it!! My Tzone is very dry throughout the day since I started using it. Totally recommended.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin so i always thought that rich moisturizing creams are a no-no. I went to my local spa and the lady suggested this brand - i purchased it and really like it a lot. It&#x27;s not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on the top of skin forever.</li>
    <li> I have difficult skin - sometimes dry (forehead, cheeks, top of nose), sometimes oily (chin, sides of nose), and have had reactions to many facial lotions and products. This is not one of them. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over 9 years and have never once had a problem. In the winter, when my skin is drier, I apply a little more. I use this lotion before I put on my makeup and after I take my makeup off at night. It is a great product, especially if you have touchy skin. Plus, I love that it smells like lemon Pledge!</li>
    <li> This is a great skin product....recommend it for sensitive, combination skin</li>
    <li> I love that this cream has just a hint of coolness when I put it on.  Very light and refreshing; so many creams are heavy and greasy.  I love the three Pevonia products I&#x27;ve used (also the cleanser and the toner).</li>
    <li> The price and quality of this product is a good value. It works well with my skin as it is not heavy. I have used this product for 4 years.</li>
    <li> Two years ago I went to a local spa for a facial. The esthetician used a million products on my face and dug up things buried in my pores for millennia. Of course, my face felt Jennifer Aniston fabulous...whose doesn&#x27;t after having someone rub it for an hour? So, I bought some of the products. Seriously, I have not had to have another facial. I have not had a break out, not one in two years. My skin is healthy and glows and I am not young! I use all Pevonia products now. I suggest that you give it a try. BTW, I have combination skin, super dry in areas and super oily in others...pain in the butt. Not nomore.</li>
    <li> Pevonia products have resulted in my skin feeling supple and not dry or greasy. I have combination skin and it is very difficult to find the right product.</li>
    <li> This product is recommended by my esthetician. It also smells like lemon pie.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was recommended by my facialist.  She was spot on......very light weight, non greasy formula with a very pleasing fragrance.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Was worried about whether this item from Amazon was a knock-off or old since the price was so good, so I was happy to see it was exactly the same product as what I have recently ordered directly from Pevonia @ $52.50/jar. Great buy, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love pevonia products. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Smooth feeling! Love Pevonia!</li>
    <li> this moisturizer is really lovely, it has a fantastic scent to it and it goes on light and provides -moderate coverage. i would have liked it to be a bit heavier weight for the winter months, but this is a nice spring/summer cream.</li>
    <li> My aesthetician recommended this moisturizing lotion for my skin type after I had a facial with her. I was a bit skeptical; so she gave me a sample to try at home. I used the sample and concurrently did my own independent research on the product. I liked the way my skin felt -- soft and not greasy -- and I was further convinced by what I read on the product. I placed the order for my full size balancing lotion to continue using at home. It has been a little over a month since I&#x27;ve used the Pevonia Botanical Balancing Lotion. I really like the results; and fully recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin (and A LOT of allergies)... this may have a smell, but the product is AWESOME. I will not be using anything else. My mother uses the Ligne Rose and I have used hers in the past, that is also AWESOME.</li>
    <li> Perfect for combination skin. Not oily when you put it on your face. I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This cream is creamy and leaves my skin feeling and looking so nice. I use other products from this line as well. It absorbs nicely. Wish it was not so expensive, but Amazon has it for the cheaper than I can find locally.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I am in my 40s with combination skin. I use this product once or twice a week to keep the dullness off my face. This product leaves my skin clean, glowing and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great for your skin. I use the whole line and it keeps my skin looking great.</li>
    <li> Much less expensive then what I&#x27;ve paid for before. Great value</li>
    <li> I bought combo line , care cream, lotion, mask and exfoliatir. I was really exciting to get my product. When I get it,I was really unhappy coz I did not even open the product yet I find out the lable claim is vague. I tried to read with i-nigma ( scan for a lable ) but it shows nothing. That means something is wrong. I don&#x27;t know what to do. Can anyone give me some idea. Should I return it or use it? I don&#x27;t want to open the products yet until I know it&#x27;s safe to use and it&#x27;s real.</li>
    <li> A few minutes after I used this product on my face, my husband came into the room and asked, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that smell? Is it some kind of liniment?&amp;#34; It really smells awful to me. I may try to doctor it up with some fragrance oil, but I think I will end up throwing it away. So disappointed, since the reviews are mostly good. From now on, I won&#x27;t spend the kind of money I spent on this cream without sampling it first. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I like it, but wish it had a nicer fragrance. I do like what it does for my face.</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft and smooth after using this lotion!  It&#x27;s perfect for winters in New England.  That said, my skin has enough oil in it that now that it&#x27;s warming up, I&#x27;ve broken out a bit when using it, so I&#x27;m about to switch over to something a little less moisturizing until the weather cools again.  However, it&#x27;s by far the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used in the winter.</li>
    <li> Amazing line.  I only use this on my face and nothing else.  I have VERY sensitive skin and everything breaks me out.  This is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t.  I originally learned about this from the lady at the spa who used this product line on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m willing to cut corners to save money in some areas but this isn&#x27;t one of them. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 10 years and its worth every cent. one jar last me months though. If I go even 3 days without it, I see a difference in my skin. Blackheads and even pimples start appearing. I love, love this product. Smells good too! Like lemons :)</li>
    <li> Excellent products - just love them.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this product while at a spa on vacation. I tried it, not expecting much, but I loved it! I was happy to find it on Amazon and they seller shipped it very quickly. I am almost 50 and I have very oily skin. I use Proactiv to wash and tone my skin, but wasn&#x27;t happy with their moisturizer and was constantly looking for one that would moisturize my dry areas and not make my face an oil slick. I still have to blot my face mid-day, but I haven&#x27;t found ANYTHING that will help me avoid doing that. I have been using for about 2 weeks and have not had any breakout or irritations. It leaves my skin &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; and I can&#x27;t explain it, but the texture and pore-size seem to have improved.</li>
    <li> Love this facial scrub ... will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this cream for last 3 years and like it and like its results.</li>
    <li> I do not give 5 stars, because it is not a wow cream for me. However, I may say that in my just started 50th with sensitive skin this cream works well. I do not have any particular effect from this cream, but it is just really ok for me. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Using this makes a girl feel oh so kissable and young and you start looking for a swing its that great</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for over a year.  A little goes a long way so it lasts a long time.  I use it in the morning before makeup and my skin feels heavenly.</li>
    <li> I have tried many facial moisturizers over the years, but this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found to be really great for my combination oily/dry skin. I love the Pevonia products!</li>
    <li> I have no personal experience with this product however my beautiful wife loves this product and uses it everyday!  Enough said!</li>
    <li> Love Pevonia products including this balancing combination skin cream.  Light enough for summer, not greasy and easy to apply powder, concealer, and makeup over it.  Compared to other skin care products, Pevonia is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this brand in the past and have been very happy. This lotion seems to work well, but I do not like the smell. I won&#x27;t have to worry about mosquitoes bothering me as the smell reminds me of mosquito repellent. I will buy Pevonia again, but will try a different type of lotion next time.</li>
    <li> I love this cream - it&#x27;s light, fast absorbing, and leaves my skin soft and smooth. The only downside is the smell.. this cream has a lemon-ish scent that reminds me of furniture spray, or some lemon-scented dish soap! I am used to it now and really like the cream otherwise so I&#x27;m over it, but at first I was really put off by the smell..</li>
    <li> I had gotten a sample of this product and found it worked reasonably well on my oily/combination skin and under a mineral sunscreen I was using, so I took the plunge. Pevonia is very tight lipped with their ingredient list( a very large detractor for their entire brand). I was dismayed to find that when I received the product it had octinoxate in it as a UV protector, which has questionable safety and  alone is a fairly inefficient(unstable) as a sunscreen. I was hoping that like another vaguely labeled &amp;#34;UV protection&amp;#34; product from pevonia that the protector was titanium dioxide, but no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Amazon will not return this product, even unused, I am stuck with it and have still not decided whether I should use it. A bit of a let down for a product that otherwise works great.</li>
