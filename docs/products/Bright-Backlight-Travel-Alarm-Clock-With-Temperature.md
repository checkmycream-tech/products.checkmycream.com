      <li>I love this alarm!  </li>
      <li>I love this clock!</li>
      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Nice and compact</li>
      <li>My wife and I have used this travel alarm for over 10 years and it has worked flawlessly that whole time.  </li>
      <li>Would have been nice if one had the option to go backwards.</li>
      <li>The date is nice, but who ever forgot what day is was?</li>
      <li>So I have been searching for a replacement and was thrilled to find this.  </li>
      <li>The night light feature is excellent and it only turns on when you tap it, what is good.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to set up and it keeps near perfect time and temperature.</li>
      <li>It is a better daytime/desk clock.  </li>
      <li>Most Brookstone products I have are well made; but, these were the products purchased 10 years ago.</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE this clock.  </li>
      <li>I had one of these for about 15 (or more) years before the alarm stopped working.</li>
      <li>I do love the thermometer on the front tho.  </li>
      <li>How many of those have you seen with Scotch tape holding them together?</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stop working when the power is out, it&#x27;s the most reliable clock I&#x27;ve had</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
      <li>However, I was still able to use it.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find an exact replica of my much used and loved travel alarm clock, which expired.  </li>
      <li>The large, bright numbers are easy to see and the alarm works like a charm!  </li>
      <li>I purchased it more than fifteen years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
      <li>OK it&#x27;s fine for traveling</li>
      <li>I travel quite a bit and having a travel alarm that has a good backlight feature, large display, calendar and room temperature, all running off 1 AAA battery was what I needed.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice, small clock that is perfect as a travel clock with a temperature feature.  </li>
      <li>This is well placed and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It packs easily and you can see the time just as easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>and unfolds easily</li>
      <li>It is easy use and convenient for travel.</li>
      <li>That space could have easily been used to show the alarm&#x27;s time.</li>
      <li>easy travel.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>The deal breaker has always been that the light stops functioning after about one year.</li>
      <li>: Uses only 1 AAA battery, very dependable, Bright backlight, good snooze alarm and folds up for light/</li>
      <li>The backlight makes all the information available without having to turn on a light and adjust your eyes to a lighted room.  </li>
      <li>I would prefer for the light to stay on all night, a switch to make this happen would be an improvement.</li>
      <li>This is a straight forward alarm clock with a nice backlight, snooze and all the jazz.  </li>
      <li>As for setting the alarm, have you ever missed an important appointment because your alarm was set to PM and not AM?</li>
      <li>This clock is not user friendly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how you could beat this travel alarm for the price for any other brand that includes time, temperature, great alarm with snooze, and night light.</li>
      <li>The light feature was also useful.</li>
      <li>It takes a fair amount of force to open the cover.</li>
      <li>Preferably one with nice big buttons that are easily accessible.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>The clear plastic that covers the clock is cheap and scratches easily.</li>
      <li>(most clocks are the same) and the plastic sides easily break (doesn&#x27;t affect function).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>In addition, this clock is compact and light - about the size of a deck of cards (but much lighter).    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday use, and for traveling.  </li>
      <li>The Indiglo-type backlight clearly displays the time in even the darkest hotel room, by tapping the button on the top of the clock.</li>
      <li>In all 4 ones that we own, the time/alarm adjust button in the back is not working so well</li>
      <li>It felt very cheap, and the backlight was barely visible; I could see my watch better in the same light.</li>
      <li>I am ordering a second one today as my wife wants her own.</li>
      <li>I travel frequently and like to have an alarm that is easy to use and also provides the room temperature (the hotel thermometers are always inaccurate).  </li>
      <li>Two of them fell on the floor, they didn&#x27;t stop functioning, but the back lid can&#x27;t stay in place any more because the pins cracked.  </li>
      <li>You have to pick the clock up at night and aim it properly at your eyes to be able to read the display.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Would need to be cheaper than the current price of $25 to qualify for more than the three stars I give it.</li>
      <li>It has been to many different countries.</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with my first one.</li>
      <li>Not quite sure why having to unclip the battery cover is such a problem.  </li>
      <li>Yes, at first it was aggravating to have to remove the back of the clock for every setting, but the longevity has more than compensated for that.  </li>
      <li>, I purchased it from LL Bean over 12 years ago and it was almost exactly like the clock being sold here.  </li>
      <li>and it travels really well.  </li>
      <li>The temperature feature works very well.  </li>
      <li>control are tiny - the clock is tiny - they do a great job making it look bigger than it is, but it&#x27;s about the size of a pack of gum</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>FURTHER, THE LIGHT DOESN&#x27;T GO OUT UNLESS YOU PULL OUT THE BATTERY WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO RESET ALL THE DATA.</li>
      <li>but when it&#x27;s beside your bed, you really can&#x27;t see the numbers.</li>
      <li>I was given one of these clocks as a gift approximately 19 years ago and even though it has been knocked on the floor several times, it still works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>No need to charge,etc.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend over other brands, have used many</li>
      <li>only difference between this new unit and my old deceased clock is when using the backlight you have to tip the clock a bit to be able to read the numbers, as opposed to seeing it straight on.  </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve only used it for traveling once, which was also great because it folds up into a small post-it note size.  </li>
      <li>When the backlight is on, you have to look down at the display at a 45 degree angle to be able to see the numbers at all.  </li>
      <li>The buttons for doing this are so tiny that I can&#x27;t imagine how a person with big fingers would be able to operate it without using a stylus or something.  </li>
      <li>The product has a deceptively high quality feel about it.</li>
      <li>**) accurate regarding temperature but seems to take a long time to change the display if moved to a room with a different temperature (or the inside of my computer case in this instance).</li>
      <li>I am extremely satisfied with its performance, especially the alarm, which is loud enough to wake me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased one from Brookstone, then I found the exact same clock at Radio Shack for less, and purchased 3 more.  </li>
      <li>JUST USED THE NEW ONE--</li>
      <li>Setting a new alarm or changing the time is a pain.  </li>
      <li>, now I have to buy a new one, which is unfortunate because I&#x27;ve super-glued it successfully for a year or two, but it&#x27;s time for a new one now.  </li>
      <li>The original model I had purchased from LL Bean and none of these flaws--it contained 3 large horizontal buttons located directly under the display which made it simple to set any function on the clock without having to ever touch the battery cover to do anything other than change a battery.    </li>
      <li>I hope I get enough space to express how much I loathe this alarm clock.</li>
      <li>This product just doesn&#x27;t work for me because it looks bigger than it really is.</li>
      <li>When I say the picture online I immediately bought it, thinking I had found my old reliable clock.  </li>

    <li> It is easy use and convenient for travel. No need to charge,etc.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend over other brands, have used many</li>
    <li> I was on the verge of buying this in a Brookstone store; I saw 2 issues with this. It felt very cheap, and the backlight was barely visible; I could see my watch better in the same light. Most Brookstone products I have are well made; but, these were the products purchased 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure why having to unclip the battery cover is such a problem.  I have had this alarm clock for over 2 years and have NEVER jarred the battery.  This is a straight forward alarm clock with a nice backlight, snooze and all the jazz.  It has been somewhat (**) accurate regarding temperature but seems to take a long time to change the display if moved to a room with a different temperature (or the inside of my computer case in this instance). &lt;br /&gt;Would need to be cheaper than the current price of $25 to qualify for more than the three stars I give it.</li>
    <li> I have owned this model travel alarm for at least 10 years now. It has performed perfectly for me. It is easy to set up and it keeps near perfect time and temperature. I used to travel in business so my clock has 100,000+ miles on it. It has been to many different countries. It is all beat up now and looks bad but it works perfectly, always has. It is very small, lightweight, and the single battery lasts and lasts and lasts. I am ordering a second one today as my wife wants her own. I don&#x27;t know how you could beat this travel alarm for the price for any other brand that includes time, temperature, great alarm with snooze, and night light. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have the Howard Miller version of this clock. I purchased it more than fifteen years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong. The clock keeps excellent time. Unlike other reviewers, I appreciate the fact that the controls are under the battery cover - I never fear the clock will be changed or reset in my suitcase. I&#x27;ve traveled all over the world, and except in India, only had to press the hour time-set button in order to account for time changes. In addition, this clock is compact and light - about the size of a deck of cards (but much lighter).    The alarm is loud enough to wake you from a sound sleep and yet not as annoying as other alarm clocks I&#x27;ve heard. The Indiglo-type backlight clearly displays the time in even the darkest hotel room, by tapping the button on the top of the clock. It runs on a single, AAA battery.</li>
    <li> I love this alarm!  I won one just like it for a doorprize about 12 years ago.  It still works just fine, but this past year I dropped it and broke off the cover to the battery.  It also broke apart one side of the stand.  So I have been searching for a replacement and was thrilled to find this.  It&#x27;s exactly the same, though marketed under a different name.  So far it has preformed just as well as my old one.  I use it every day and take with me whenever I&#x27;m away for the night.&lt;br /&gt;--lights up easily for night vision, but isn&#x27;t annoyingly lit all night&lt;br /&gt;--alarm is loud enough to wake me up, but isn&#x27;t obnoxious&lt;br /&gt;--love the temperature readout&lt;br /&gt;--folds and unfolds easily&lt;br /&gt;--very small for ease of packing&lt;br /&gt;--you have to take off the battery cover to change the alarm, but I don&#x27;t mind that.  Have done it for 12 years every night with no problem.</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit and having a travel alarm that has a good backlight feature, large display, calendar and room temperature, all running off 1 AAA battery was what I needed.  And I had such a clock, I purchased it from LL Bean over 12 years ago and it was almost exactly like the clock being sold here.  After over 12 years of continuous use around the world, my clock died and I discovered that LL Bean no longer carried it.  I looked all over the place and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement.  When I say the picture online I immediately bought it, thinking I had found my old reliable clock.  I failed to realize that this clock was lacking a critical design function that, IMO, renders this device practically useless.      As a number of people have mentioned, all the buttons to set the time and the alarm are located on the back of the clock UNDER the battery cover, so every time you want to set the time, alarm or date, off comes the battery cover.  Besides being an almost certainty to break the battery cover with the constant sliding off/on to set this piece of garbage, the buttons are tiny and you must select the proper feature you want to set by moving a slidder switch up/down to get to the date, time or alarm functions--needless to say, the print on the back to find the proper feature is also too small to read.    The original model I had purchased from LL Bean and none of these flaws--it contained 3 large horizontal buttons located directly under the display which made it simple to set any function on the clock without having to ever touch the battery cover to do anything other than change a battery.    Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this piece of junk--it really is useless.  Shame on you Brookstone for designing and selling such a useless piece of trash!</li>
    <li> This clock is great.  The blue illumination is not too jarring at night.  Nice and compact and it travels really well.  It clicks into place, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it folding up on you.</li>
    <li> I travel overseas 6 months a year and one thing you learn is not to depend on a power (electric) alarm clock. I have used this travel alarm clock for the last 6 years and have yet to miss a meeting or wake up late. In short:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Uses only 1 AAA battery, very dependable, Bright backlight, good snooze alarm and folds up for light/ easy travel.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Must take the back off to set (minor irritation), No warning when battery is dying (most clocks are the same) and the plastic sides easily break (doesn&#x27;t affect function).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros out weigh the cons. I will continue to use this clock during my trips</li>
    <li> I went on a round the world backpacking trip and found this to be invaluable.  The date, time, temperature and alarm and its light weight was perfect.  The light feature was also useful.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find an exact replica of my much used and loved travel alarm clock, which expired.  I had come to depend on it since it also gives the temperature and therefore informs me whether it&#x27;s too hot or cold in the room, or it&#x27;s just me.  The backlight makes all the information available without having to turn on a light and adjust your eyes to a lighted room.  And it folds up into a very small secure unit which hardly adds at all to a corner of a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference between this new unit and my old deceased clock is when using the backlight you have to tip the clock a bit to be able to read the numbers, as opposed to seeing it straight on.  With all the other features I wanted present, I can tip the clock.  This is a clock I&#x27;ve used on a daily basis for the last 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was much faster than I expected too.  All in all, I&#x27;d give it 4 1/2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy</li>
    <li> The third day I used it a piece of the caseing broke off.  However, I was still able to use it.  But the worst thing about this clock is that you have to remove the back (where the batteries go) to set the alarm and time.  The buttons for doing this are so tiny that I can&#x27;t imagine how a person with big fingers would be able to operate it without using a stylus or something.  I have to use my fingernail!  Then, you have to turn it over to see the face while you set it from behind.  I could go on and on about how poorly made this clock is, but it is just a clock.  And I do have a life. &#x3D;)  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased one from Brookstone, then I found the exact same clock at Radio Shack for less, and purchased 3 more.  It&#x27;s great for everyday use, and for traveling.  The temperature feature works very well.  The night light feature is excellent and it only turns on when you tap it, what is good.  Battery life is very long, I even leave one in my travel necessaire without bothering to remove its AAA battery.  Few minor problems:  In all 4 ones that we own, the time/alarm adjust button in the back is not working so well, there is some sort of bad contact there, it can be a little annoying when you are adjusting the time or changing the alarm time.  Two of them fell on the floor, they didn&#x27;t stop functioning, but the back lid can&#x27;t stay in place any more because the pins cracked.  Can&#x27;t be noticed when the clock is open.  The same problems happen with a 5th unit that I gave as a gift, so these problems seem to be design problems.  I would give 5 stars if not for those.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews stating that they hated this alarm clock. For me, it&#x27;s been the best alarm clock I&#x27;ve had and I&#x27;ve had it for about 7-8 years.  It doesn&#x27;t stop working when the power is out, it&#x27;s the most reliable clock I&#x27;ve had and I don&#x27;t mind moving the backing to switch the time I need to awake - it becomes second nature when you use it for a long period of time.  After all these years it has broken because I had probably slammed it too hard when snoozing and, now I have to buy a new one, which is unfortunate because I&#x27;ve super-glued it successfully for a year or two, but it&#x27;s time for a new one now.  By the way - I use it as an everyday alarm.  I think I&#x27;ve only used it for traveling once, which was also great because it folds up into a small post-it note size.  I&#x27;m used to this alarm clock - it&#x27;s simple and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I love it!  I&#x27;m about to purchase another one this week.  I recommend this alarm clock for people that want a simple way to wake themselves and to adjust simple features.  It&#x27;s just a simple mechanical clock that does what it needs to do, is tiny, doesn&#x27;t need electricity (batteries run out every 2 years or so) and is so simple.  LOVE, LOVE this clock.  Am about to buy another. Just looking for the best price for it at the moment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the negative reviews for this clock.  I got it as a gift and I love it!  The large, bright numbers are easy to see and the alarm works like a charm!  You also get date and temperature with this clock.  It is IDEAL for when you travel!  It packs easily and you can see the time just as easily.  I love this clock!</li>
    <li> I hope I get enough space to express how much I loathe this alarm clock. I can&#x27;t imagine what the engineer who designed it was thinking. The only way to set the alarm, or any thing else for that matter, is to remove the back. The back is exactly like the battery hatch on a TV remote. How many of those have you seen with Scotch tape holding them together? It won&#x27;t be long before my new alarm clock is held together with tape. The back must constantly be removed. You can&#x27;t even tell what time the alarm is set form without removing the back cover. This is not convenient for the traveler who always has a different wake time. The date is nice, but who ever forgot what day is was? That space could have easily been used to show the alarm&#x27;s time. As for setting the alarm, have you ever missed an important appointment because your alarm was set to PM and not AM? The AM/PM sign on this clock is 1.5mm tall. Try telling the difference between AM and PM in the dark with crusty eyes in the middle of the night with the back light which only makes hazy--the day of the week sign is 8mm!  Save yourself a hassle. Look for something else. Preferably one with nice big buttons that are easily accessible.</li>
    <li> I purchased this travel alarm about two months ago and it has already stopped functioning.  I have reset the clock, date, and alarm several times and they all get reset to what appear to be default settings within a couple hours.  The temperature reading also reverts to centegrade after I set it to fahrenheit.  I have replaced the battery three times and the same problem occurs.  I highlly recommend you buy some other product.</li>
    <li> This clock is not user friendly. You must take the back battery cover off the clock every time you set the alarm (it is only a matter of time before it breaks).  Then the user must minipulate small bottons on the back while looking at the front hoping they are pushing the right button on the back. Alarm is too soft to wake a sleeping person.  I have purchased many products from Brookstone and have been very happy.  This clock is not what I expect from Brookstone.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd model of the same travel alarm clock I have purchased and it works exactly as did the earlier model.  I am extremely satisfied with its performance, especially the alarm, which is loud enough to wake me.</li>
    <li> control are tiny - the clock is tiny - they do a great job making it look bigger than it is, but it&#x27;s about the size of a pack of gum</li>
    <li> This is a nice, small clock that is perfect as a travel clock with a temperature feature.  I will buy another one when something happens to this clock.</li>
    <li> Excellent - just like the one I purchased from LLBean 20 yrs ago.</li>
    <li> In order to set the alarm, you have to remove the battery cover.  Inevitably you will wind up jarring the battery and reset everything, which is very frustrating.  The time set and alarm set buttons should have been in a different spot.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for about 15 (or more) years before the alarm stopped working. I&#x27;m buying another. It takes a little time and coordination to set the clock but I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with my first one. The size is great and the backlight comes on when you tap the top. You can&#x27;t see what time the alarm is set for but you can see that the alarm is set. JUST USED THE NEW ONE--IT&#x27;S A PIECE OF JUNK. TAP THE LIGHT/SNOOZE BUTTON AND IT OBSCURES ALL DATA. FURTHER, THE LIGHT DOESN&#x27;T GO OUT UNLESS YOU PULL OUT THE BATTERY WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO RESET ALL THE DATA.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have used this travel alarm for over 10 years and it has worked flawlessly that whole time.  It was unfortunately damaged and the cover broke off.  It still works but we decided that it was time to replace it.</li>
    <li> good delivery for my gift for the holidays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks ... 4 stars. I never got to test it, but the brand is of quality, so ill wait for recipient to advise me if different.</li>
    <li> Yes, at first it was aggravating to have to remove the back of the clock for every setting, but the longevity has more than compensated for that.  I was given one of these clocks as a gift approximately 19 years ago and even though it has been knocked on the floor several times, it still works perfectly.  I admit every time it lands on the floor, everything has to be reset, but it has been too reliable for me to complain.  Best clock I ever had.</li>
    <li> Ditto what others have said about the button design.  You have to remove the battery cover on the back to set the alarm.  WORSE, you have no way of telling what time the alarm clock is set for without taking the battary cover off, and then switching the mode to \\&quot;set alarm time\\&quot; to then have it display on the clock.  Who the heck designed this thing?!  Obviously someone who doesnt travel!  I do love the thermometer on the front tho.  I would never buy this product (got it as a gift).</li>
    <li> This clock is in use on my desk but I gave up on using it in my bedroom.  You can set the clock up without reading the instructions, it&#x27;s that simple.  The screen is a bit busy for a travel alarm clock especially when you wake up in the night and want to know just the time.  It is a better daytime/desk clock.  The setup buttons are behind a cover on the back which keeps you from accidently pushing buttons when you pick the clock up.  Only the snooze/backlight and alarm on/off buttons are normally exposed to your fingers.  My only serious complaint is that the viewing angle of the LCD display is very limited, especially in a darkened room.  You have to pick the clock up at night and aim it properly at your eyes to be able to read the display.  I need reading glasses and have extra difficulty reading the display in a darkened room.  Ambient lighting or a flashlight causes screen glare and makes it difficult to read any of the numbers.  When the backlight is on, you have to look down at the display at a 45 degree angle to be able to see the numbers at all.  Straight on viewing when the backlight is on is not possible.  Checking the time when you are half asleep is a difficult task.  Not recommended for a bedroom.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! It is just like one I bought years ago but gave to my Mother when hers broke.</li>
    <li> This product just doesn&#x27;t work for me because it looks bigger than it really is. OK it&#x27;s fine for traveling but when it&#x27;s beside your bed, you really can&#x27;t see the numbers. Very disappointed compared to an earlier version of the same type of product (from Brookstone, no longer available) that had HUGE numbers. It was a slightly larger version of this clock that did not fold up.</li>
    <li> This is a slim hard silver plastic traveling alarm clock made in China. The slim size would allow you to put it in your pocket if you wanted to. The product has a deceptively high quality feel about it. The cover flips over the clock function to protect it when not in use. The cover can be flipped back to enable you to stand the alarm clock up on a nightstand. The cover is opened by pushing on the snooze button which  just seems wrong to me. It takes a fair amount of force to open the cover.The clear plastic that covers the clock is cheap and scratches easily. As other reviewers have mentioned the controls for setting the time, alarm, etc. are located on the back of the clock near where the battery is. The back has to be slid off to access the controls. Having to do this every time you change the alarm is inconvenient and puts you at risk of breaking off one of the three small plastic tabs that hold it in place. If you don&#x27;t break off the tabs you have the risk of eventually loosing the back completely. I wonder how many of these clocks are being used without the backs attached because people just got tired of the hassel they create. You can not see what time the alarm is set for from the front of the clock. The only way to see this is to open the back of the clock and put it in alarm setting mode. The buttons that change the time, date, etc are small, but I can work with that. They only go forward. Would have been nice if one had the option to go backwards. The snooze button is the large long black button you can see on the clock in the photo. This is well placed and easy to use.The alarm is not that loud. If there is a way to increast the volume I have been unable to find it. If someone was in a deep sleep I don&#x27;t think it would wake them up. I have purchased 2 of these clocks in 2 years. I know, stupid right. I got seduced by the feel. The deal breaker has always been that the light stops functioning after about one year. Make no mistake, I will not be purchasing a third clock. I finally learned my lesson.a third clock. I finally learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> Clumsy controls must remove the back to set various functions. Does not show the time the alarm is set for with out opening the back. I would prefer for the light to stay on all night, a switch to make this happen would be an improvement.</li>
    <li> Great product and perfect for travelling. I have travelled with a few different clocks over the years and I found this one to be the best. Easy to use and I especially like the backlight feature.</li>
    <li> I travel frequently and like to have an alarm that is easy to use and also provides the room temperature (the hotel thermometers are always inaccurate).  I have gone through several as I sometime leave them behind.  So why not a Brookstone from the airport store?  They are supposed to design or sell cutting edge good stuff.  Not this time.  Setting a new alarm or changing the time is a pain.  Has to be done from under a rear panel.  Now the buttons work sporadically, deciding for themselves when to allow me to change anything.  A miserable design and poor durability.</li>
