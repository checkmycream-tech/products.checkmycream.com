<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product, speedy service.</li>
    <li> I have always loved PedEggs.  They work great for making my feet looks nice and smooth.  When I was looking for a new one I came across this one WITH A HANDLE!!!  Wow, what a great idea!  No more bending into weird shapes to reach my feet.  I read a few reviews that said the PedEgg would fall off the handle while they were using it.  I haven&#x27;t found that to be true.  It snaps into place very securely.  Love my PedEgg :-)</li>
    <li> These things work well to remove calloused areas and make them smooth.</li>
    <li> Not worth a single dollar. After only two uses, the detachable head no longer will remain attached to the handle. Returning for a refund.</li>
    <li> Good things first: If the regular Pedegg works for you, you&#x27;ll love this version with a handle which is ergonomically shaped and equipped with rubbery padding. Very comfy and thought- out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s the bad: Although the Pedegg dangerously looks like a sharp kitchen grater, it&#x27;s the worst performing foot file I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of calluses AND it doesn&#x27;t smooth down even mildly rough skin. Other than this product, I have a cheap metal file and an equally cheap stone (sandpaper- like surface) file and both work faster, deeper and have two surfaces with different roughness, leaving my skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s with just a few minutes of effort every week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a quite concerned that many five- star raters of this product have only this one review. If I was a tad more cynical I&#x27;d call astroturfing in progress...</li>
    <li> This is an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; device that seems to work reasonably well as long as the blade doesn&#x27;t keep popping off the handle, quite an annoying problem so I&#x27;m knocking off a couple of stars. It&#x27;s not great, but I&#x27;d say it does a 3-star job overall.</li>
    <li> I finally went out to get my PedEgg and I believe it&#x27;s the best foot product I&#x27;ve used yet.  I&#x27;m actually glad I waited a while because they came out with one that has a handle and it makes using the product so much easier.  I&#x27;m very happy with the result and suggest everyone get one.</li>
    <li> The PedEgg has proven to be a great product.  This was reccomended to me by a friend while on vacation, couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to purchase my own!  Difinitely worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a year ago and never used it because I still had some single edge razor blades.  I tried to used the PeddEgg Reach today and the handle kept coming off.  Sorry I didn&#x27;t try it when first bought. It would have been returned along with the extra blades I bought.  Now it has to all go in the garbage.  What a waste of money.  I am extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> why didn&#x27;t i buy this years ago?</li>
    <li> This product is great.   It allows you to reach your feet and not have to bend down for long.  It allows you to give yourself a pedicure in the comforts of your own home.  It works great!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a walgreens actually. Well at first I was pretty happy with the product till after 3-4 applications I noticed my calluses worsened. They were coming back with a vengeance. Not fun at all. The first time in my life I now have cracked feet. I would not recommend this product as it shaves your heels and it should be a surgical tool. I didn&#x27;t even think about it, but I heard before if you shave or cut it it&#x27;ll just get worst. So please don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have struggled for YEARS with serious cracking and thick callouses on my heels. My last success was an expensive foot file with lots of creams and a battery operated sander that took me months of every day work to get back down to my soft heel. That was a year ago and I did not maintain so my heels were worse than ever.    I bought the Ped Egg because it has a large file area and I read good reviews on it, although I knew nothing ever worked for me like it seemed to work for everyone else.    Let me tell you, within 20 minutes my heels were clear of callouses! I was amazed! My feet have not been this soft in 15 years! I used the sanding surface to finish them off and spread on some oil and I was done! I had to be very careful when I started because my feet had cracked to the point where large bits would pull off, but once I got past that layer, I put some muscle behind it and WOW!    I am buying replacement blades now to amke sure I always have this tool handy!!</li>
    <li> My feet become very dry and flaky, especially in the winter. Pumice stones do not work so I tried this and I LOVE it. The skin comes right off and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I use it twice a week and my feet are super soft now. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the handle on the ped egg made a difference..since I constantly caught myself holding it by the egg instead of the handle. It&#x27;s not the best in removing dead skin, but it does remove some. The only real downside is that it kinda hurts when using it... It&#x27;s sharp and doesn&#x27;t feel too good when rubbing on your heel. Not smooth at all.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. My feet after useing the PedEgg do not look like the picture on the product. (new born babies feet). I would suspect it will take  more than a few times using the PedEgg. My feet were just ruff and would snag my pantyhose. I like that it has a enclosed area to catch the dry skin. For the price it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels like a knockoff.  Flimsy and broke within 30 days</li>
    <li> The PedEgg itself is okay as far as a foot rasp goes. However, the handle is a problem. If you use anything other than very gentle pressure--which won&#x27;t do the trick--the blades pop out. I wasn&#x27;t able to really use it at all.</li>
    <li> Love the egg!  When I first used it I was afraid the grate would cut me.  No matter how hard I press I&#x27;ve never been cut.  It actually doesn&#x27;t do anything to your soft skin, it just glides over it.  I do a lot of walking in sandals and my heals can show it.  Without this product I would be sanding my feet a lot longer.  I do go over the areas with a fine sander to make it silky smooth.  Can&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work well for us:  the \\&quot;egg\\&quot; part doesn&#x27;t stay on and the handle is a bit awkwardly long.   The \\&quot;file\\&quot; part alone is ok- but we bought this so that we wouldn&#x27;t have bits of skin falling all over the place.  We&#x27;ve since replaced it with a similar product that has a much sturdier, less awkward handle and stays assembled during use  [[ASIN:B002BWQ68A Microplane Foot File Paddle, Blue]].</li>
    <li> Works fine, but I wish it came with a replacement head. Love the handle. I drop it far less often than I did the regular PedEgg.</li>
    <li> bought as a gift for my daughter - she loves it. recommend item</li>
    <li> this was great. it came earlier than expected. I purchased it for my friend and she said the product works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t pop apart when using the handle like one person said, I use mine multiple times a week and love this version with the handle!     The shipping took up until the very last day in the time frame. I shop online often and the shipping took a lot longer than any thing else I&#x27;ve purchased. Even so I will likely shop with this company again because of great prices and product quality!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what people are complaining about.    The long handle is great for those of us without the ability to bend down.    The knives work!    The only thing that is a bit sloppy is the shavings are NOT contained by the device if you move the device certain ways.    I put wet paper towel down on the floor before I begin.  Let the dust fall there and simply  pick up the towels when I&#x27;m done.  NO dust further.    The emory boards are really great.  You will feel like a baby when you are done. No nicks.  No infections.  No issues.</li>
    <li> Okay, so not only is the pedegg great, but this handle on it is awesome too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to go get a pedicure twice a month and use a pumice stone in the shower daily, but I knew I was spending too much on pedis and spending too much time with the pumice without a lot of result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pedegg is perfect. I can sit on my couch comfortably and scrape away and then I&#x27;m totally grossed out when I empty it, but very pleased that it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Junk - as seen on TV. Scrapes up your feet. Doesn&#x27;t remove skin smoothly. Falls apart all the time.</li>
    <li> Does everything it claims to do,  I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item, it arrived in a very timely manner, and was appropriately packed.</li>
    <li> The order was on time and I plan to look for this vendor in the future. I will recommend to other friend and family.</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use ped egg. The long handle makes for an easy and comfortable use. It&#x27;s effective as well. Smooth feet are only a few minutes away with this. After using it, your feet may be sensitive to touching the floor, socks... ect...Only use the ped egg on clean dry feet. For the price, i bought 2. I kept one and gave one as a gift. So for aorund $13, i got a deal. These retail for about $20...I prefer this model over the original hand held.</li>
    <li> This product could achieve 5 stars if the quality was a bit better. The blade piece broke off of mine and now won&#x27;t stay attached to the handle. It also would be nice if it came with replacement blades for when it gets dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the results, this thing really works! The first time I used it, I got over-zealous and both of my feet were burning so bad, I couldn&#x27;t wear shoes! I recommend taking it easy the first time and DEFINITELY stop at the first sight of blood. Also, moisturize really well after use and follow with cotton socks.</li>
    <li> This is a really great feature and I am very happy I purchased it and have used it often on myself and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
    <li> Keeps those feet smooth.</li>
    <li> After buying this foot file, I was anxious to use it.  I have seen many commercials for the egg and thought it would work wonders.  Nope.  It didn&#x27;t do a dang thing.  Now, not only do I have calluses on my heel, but I have small jagged pieces of skin hanging out making sure that my foot snags anything unless wearing socks.  Worst product I have ever purchased.  Will be returning it asap.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love it.</li>
    <li> This thing far outshines the regular ped egg....I have purchased several for friends, who have in turn purchased them for their friends....YIPPEE</li>
    <li> This is perfect, really files the heels to perfection!</li>
    <li> My feet are so smooth now...&lt;br /&gt;All I want to so is touch them all day long...</li>
    <li> Taking it back tomorrow..Bought it for the handle, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on as others have said..It did however, work wonders with a lot of time and scrubbing alone..Buying a Emjoi Micro-Pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover after seeing reviews.</li>
    <li> could not remove blade  had 2 pry it free. caught it in time 2 get refund  blade still sharp with little use probably super glue it n. got  full refund from?? review 4 TVTimeDirect postrd 6-7-15</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast and product was brand new.  Would purchas from this seller again</li>
    <li> Works great, much easier to use than the smaller version, but both work well.  One of the few as seen on TV items that actually works.</li>
    <li> A very cheaply made product--very flimsy-- that doesn&#x27;t work well--a lot of rubbing to remove a little callous, you might end up with callouses on your hands!. Definitely is not the miracle gadget it is advertised to be. As a runner with callouses I had hoped this would do the trick. Not so. I would buy a better make.</li>
    <li> The blade that came with the PedEgg with handle was so dull that it was useless. I had to replace it with a blade from an old PedEgg.</li>
    <li> Have a bad back so bought for the longer handle.  Needs a little bit longer of a handle for the disabled but works just like the regular one.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Would that  I had one years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to be concise ut it demands word counts.  Enough.</li>
    <li> I use this only for the black part now. The metal blades don&#x27;t do much for me. The handle is nice, but when you use it you don&#x27;t get enough leverage, so I always end up holding it by the main part anyway. The cover with the black part does not stay on the rest of the device very well either so I always hold that on when I&#x27;m using it too. Overall this product is okay, but not extremely satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Love the Pedegg Reach. Handle is just long enough to help with the pedicure.  Smooths the skin and helps remove calluses from my feet.</li>
    <li> I had the small PedEgg and thought it was great, but this one is so much easier to use.  Much more comfortable to hold onto.  Great product - works just like it says it does.</li>
    <li> Great for home pedicures. Love that it has a handle! Very easy to use even on rough feet - husbands.</li>
    <li> it ok hard to open to empty dead skin though</li>
    <li> It works exactly as advertised.  This company also provides specific instructions on how to use PedEgg that I followed.  With one use, my feet are in better shape than my old heel without handle ever did.  I&#x27;ve been putting lotion on at night &amp; then sleeping with socks on.  Feet are still soft.</li>
    <li> works great - the handle is very handy.</li>
    <li> Product does not work at all, keeps falling apart and doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  Do not buy! Do not buy!</li>
    <li> works really good the connection is a little loose but does not fall apart.,i like it.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> For the past 20 years I&#x27;ve used the large two sided sandpaper paddle type of callus remover which worked quite well but took a long time and made a powdery mess - I always put a bath towel under my feet when I used it.  This file not only works much faster than the sandpaper type, it catches the dead skin in the little egg so it doesn&#x27;t fly all over the place!  I was afraid to use the metal type in the past as I thought it would be too easy to take too much off and I&#x27;m not into pain - but I have had no problem going too far with this PedEgg - I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> This product is VERY CHEAPLY MADE. It serves it&#x27;s purpose provided you are able to hold it together while using it to prevent it spilling out everywhere. It&#x27;s easy to clean though and is functional with patience and persistence.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product the first week or so I had it, it does just what it says it does. Which, is gross, but this totally makes it less gross by keeping things from getting everywhere. However, the foot cheese grater went dull very quickly. It&#x27;ll do the job if I press a little harder, but I fear that more pressure could lead to injury. I guess I need to pick up a refill file.</li>
    <li> The thing keeps falling apart while I&#x27;m using it and the nasty foot shavings fall out all over the floor!!  Stick to the original PedEgg or the Revlon knockoff.</li>
    <li> i have this and love it but i have to replace emery file (brcause they dont give you enough) more often than blades. i wish they would sell these separately because i have to buy a whole new kit every time i need the emery file. this becomes very pricey and i wind up throwing out the blades ! any solutions to this problem? help!i am spend a small fortune for 3 emery files which dont last very long.HELP!!!</li>
    <li> Hardly made a dent in my heels. Ended up tossing it out. Rasp needs to be stronger to attack dry and cracking skin.</li>
    <li> Well, this is my first time to try out the popular PedEgg and boy, does this thing remove callus (i wear boots all the time) &amp; or dead skins (lift weights).  I am absolutely amazed at how this thing can actually remove callus in record breaking time.  I will surely recommend it and will probably buy another unit, just in case.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elderly mom who has a hard time bending down.  She adore this item as it help her tremendously.</li>
    <li> Way easier to use than the ped egg! Easier on the back!!!</li>
    <li> Smooths my rough heels right away.  LOVE IT.  2nd one i&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> We have used this product before. It was good then and still is a good product. It really does the job.</li>
    <li> Does not do a very good job on foot care, and is very cheap and flimsy feeling and falls apart when using.</li>
    <li> the pedegg gives me the foot maintenance I need.  the length of the handle is great.  used on a daily basis my feet look  good.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and the longer handle makes it alot easier to use when you have short arms and large feet</li>
    <li> I recieved my order promply and i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase . Mary in Tn.</li>
    <li> Lesson learned for good - TV products are crap. This thing is dull and the file part pops off constantly when you are trying to use it. Good thing it doesn&#x27;t actually shave callouses off, because if it did, then I&#x27;d be pissed that it kept opening up and exploding skin everywhere, but since it doesn&#x27;t work, you don&#x27;t even have to worry about it! You could do just as good with ANY product. If you want to see some action, get the &amp;#34;Microplane Colossal Pedicutre Rasp Pink&amp;#34;. That thing means business!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother buying this if you really want to get rid of the super thick, crusty callouses. Buy a Microplane. No, I am not paid by anyone to tell you this. I just think you should know the truth. I bought them both and tried them both the same day, and the PedEgg was crap.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase. This thing is a piece of cheap plastic junk. Does absolutely nothing. It falls apart every time I try to use it.</li>
    <li> This product is so simple to put together, use and clean. I love it and it actually works. After the first try my feet were nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> purchased PedEgg foot filer as well as other more expensive liquid products from ProLinc to attack my Callus problem. This product works very well, it&#x27;s fast and easy to maintain and clean; I highly recommend it. As for other products, I am not wasting my time any more.</li>
    <li> The blades keep falling off (broken tab). I didn&#x27;t even get to use it properly once. However, the blades do a good job on taking the dead skin off.</li>
    <li> This is awesome, ped egg on a stick is the best thing ever! Buy itttt</li>
    <li> Item as described..Good price</li>
    <li> Cheap, totally falls apart while using it</li>
    <li> I saw this commercial so many times and thought it looked silly. It looked like a cheese grater for the foot and possibly painful to use. However as my heels got more and more rough, I kept thinking about giving this a try. It works! It basically does just grate the old skin off your foot. Then you can use the filing tool to smoothen it even more. I use it weekly now and love it. It makes all the dry skin on my feet gone!</li>
    <li> I am stupid. I bought another one. The Heel Grater part never stays on. It is a waste of money. Next time, I will just buy a cheese grater and duct tape it to a stick.</li>
    <li> This item works well in regards to shaving off dead skin. I have been happy with the results it has provided in reducing dead skin build-up, but here is the problem, the micro blade attachment does not stay attached. This leads to shaved skin flakes flying all over when it decides to detach. I don&#x27;t have a huge build up of callouses, but it takes force to push the micro blades against your foot to get it to rasp the dried skin off. After less then a month, the blade attachment falls off. How gross is it to have to collect your skin foot flakes from the floor, come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: Micro-blade attachment falls off handle &amp; spreads foot cheese everywhere.</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg was already an incredible invention - an excellently engineered file for even some of the harshest dried, dead and even cracked heels. This goes a step further and offers a handle. I&#x27;ve heard some people say that the handle ruins it, but I like both - the handheld is great but the handle allows you to scrub at different angles. For this price, it is totally worth trying. If you haven&#x27;t tried the ped egg yet, you have to, either the handle version or the original. I get INCREDIBLY dry, calloused feet/heels, almost to the point of cracking. After I use the ped egg I feel like I have a new set of feet. That sounds like a commercial testimony, but it really is true. It has been like a God-send to me after using pumice stones, luffas, razor blades, and other files that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is easier to have the nandle and not worry straining you back.  It is a good buy!</li>
    <li> loved this so much and completely wore it out so  I had to order another</li>
    <li> My first pedegg was awesome this one is not so much.  I don&#x27;t know what they changed but what ever it is the shaver does not work as well.</li>
    <li> I had read mixed reviews on this product but I have to say, it works REALLY well.  My heels were cracking and flaking so badly that they would almost bleed.  I started using this product right after taking a shower on a daily basis for one week. However, it worked right away after the first shower. My heels feel much better and are much smoother.  I also bought a foot cream to help keep my heels feeling soft all day long.</li>
    <li> This has changed my feet from dry peeling gross winter feet, to smooth and soft feet. I use it and then put on lotion. I have bought this for several friends. You&#x27;ll want to get a replacement, or extra scraper, it gets dull within a couple months.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and definitely removes dead skin from the feet.  You need to be very careful not to remove too much or it can become painful.  All in all it keeps my feet very soft and attractive.  They look young and pretty.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to all of the bad reviews and saved my money.  I&#x27;m pretty sure my money would have went to better use if I threw it out the window.  The ped egg works if you scrape REALLY hard and with LOTS of back and forth - you&#x27;re hand with cramp and you&#x27;ll still have some rough spots.  Not at all what I expected after seeing the infomercial so many times.  I had high hopes for this product and it didn&#x27;t even come close to living up to what it says it should do.</li>
    <li> Does not compare to Dr. Scholl&#x27;s or PedEgg, it keep opening and the blades are not as sharp.</li>
    <li> Cheap, broke on first try...very dissapointed</li>
    <li> For years I have used pumice stones and moisturizing cremes for my feet. The pedi egg puts those products TO SHAME. My heels haven&#x27;t felt this smooth and healthy since I was a little kid.   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Similar to hand held device only good for those hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> It was purchased for daughter who has large callus on bottom of foot.  She says it works great, is safe and easy to use.  She stands on her feet all day and the PedEgg has given her relief from the pain.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong here. Works like a champ</li>
    <li> I ordered the one in the picture I thought but yet one with zebra stripes came #disappointedmuch it is for my guy not for me 😐</li>
    <li> The blade is always going out of the handle, effect on my heals is minimal to non existent. Beside calus I have also pain and lots of uncuted peaces of skin hanging on my heals.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This trumps my old pumice stone by far.  The PedEgg made my heels feel nice and smooth again without giving that awful shredded uneven look that some very rough pumice stones have done to my feet in the past. So happy with this product and happy not to have to use that toxic chemical at the nail salons anymore to remove callus.</li>
    <li> Love the ped egg. Worked the first time i used it to remove rough skin and made my feet look young again.</li>
    <li> save time &amp; money on pedicures! seriously! i loved the extended handle! and surprised at the print!</li>
    <li> Broke almost immediately after first use. Returned</li>
    <li> It falls apart too easy.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my wife, the blade portion popped off the first time she used it and won&#x27;t stay on. It did help get rid of the dry skin on her feet, but she prefers other solutions.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to bend down so it work very well. Now I have the feet I always wanted!! Hooray!!</li>
    <li> Horrible design.  The scraper pops off during use, spilling your grated foot cheese all over the floor.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom, and she loves it. But i think she went to close with it and cut her foot a little.  &amp;#34;Ouch, me poor mom!?&amp;#34; Very sharp :-(. But other than that i think she likes it.</li>
    <li> The handle snapped on the first use. It works OK but a pumice stone works a little better. Also the shavings don&#x27;t all go in the cup so it kind of defeats the purpose</li>
    <li> Super cheap and crap. The one I bought was broke right out of package. Seller refunded me and I tried using it a bit. Didn&#x27;t really work well. Garbage</li>
    <li> The handle on the PedEgg Reach makes it so much easier to use for those of us who can&#x27;t bend our knees far enough to use the regular PedEgg. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> does just what is says in the ad.  Good price andworks nice with the handle.</li>
    <li> So glad this one with the handle came out, makes filing so much easier.  It even does a better job than the hand-held one.  It works great and is a quality item.</li>
    <li> It keeps popping apart when trying to use it dumping icky dead skin flakes all over the place. Finally just threw it away.</li>
    <li> My first ped egg, and I never knew how much better it is than other files! The handle makes it that much better, I can&#x27;t imagine it without it!</li>
    <li> I worry the grater may become loose, but duct tape should fix that.  My only complaint is a three foot handle would be better.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these without a handle. It&#x27;s good but the handle makes it so much easier to use!</li>
    <li> feels a little flimsy but does the job.</li>
    <li> wirjs great I have tried using stone this works much better back to baby feet</li>
    <li> It worked really well the first 2 times but now tends to fall apart a lot and doesn&#x27;t get a lot of skin off.  I will not be replacing until I find something better but I am definitely going to have to do some research.  If you have only used a stone than I think you will love this style, just make sure you DO NOT have wet feet when you use it.  Overall the egg part works nice but the handle and buffer falling apart makes me think that you make want to keep looking.</li>
    <li> Great product works great. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Love this product.  works great!</li>
    <li> These things work well if you have dry skin on your heels, so I decided to try this one since I thought the handle would make it easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle DOES make it easier to use. However this one suffers from the same flaw all the PedEggs seem to have: the scraper keeps falling off. They simply failed to engineer it well enough to stay on. It works MUCH better than those single blade ones, but having the scraper fall off all the time is frustrating.</li>
    <li> The metal scraper part is great. It slowly takes off the dead skin n collects it in the cup so u can throw it out n also see how much came off. This one without a handle is less expensive but is a pain to use. I think you need a handle so you don&#x27;t have to bend over as far n it is easier to use with a handle</li>
    <li> I have used this before and it works great for the dead skin on my feet and I only use it a few times a month.</li>
    <li> I happened to see this when I was walking through Bed,Bath and Beyond, so I bought it on impulse. I see here now a wide range of opinions. It must be a quality control issue, because the one I got works great. It doesn&#x27;t fall apart, as someone else mentioned. It&#x27;s easy to hold, and does a great job making my feet smooth. I use it after getting out of the shower. I highly recommend this one with the handle.  It makes it so easy to reach your feet. I have no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! The new ones are DULL and the company TELEBRANDS could careless about their customers. Google and you will read about others dull eggs. The ped egg I had before this one from five years ago worked fine....BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> These work great and the addition of a handle makes it that much better and easier to operate.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and I love it.  I&#x27;ve purchased two now because my wife stole my first one!</li>
    <li> I really like this, works very well.</li>
    <li> The handle is not ergonomic. The blade is narrow (smaller then holder egg in handle). The teeths in the blade are small. Only one blade is included (not as you can expect from the picture - one on handle and one additional). The egg is not attached firmly and easily gets disconnected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of small area and uncomfortable handle it&#x27;s not possible to use at all. It&#x27;s easily slips off the area you want to work. The worst foot file I ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had another similar nobrand file (bought it in BBB) - it had 3 blades with teeths of different sizes. Wider working area, wider handle, twice lower price. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not sold in BBB anymore.</li>
    <li> When I receive it and I found it&#x27;s not like the picture showed online.  Very poor quality. Very unsatisfied. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for. Not many left out on the shelves. Thinking they are going to stop selling this one. Did come with an order sheet where you can order replacements right through the company.</li>
    <li> Works great just like the original only easier because of the handle! Would recommend to anyone. Way better than their cheap powered model.</li>
    <li> handle pops off with even a little force.</li>
    <li> My feet were ugly cracked and gross. I used the pedegg one time and my feet look like they did when I was 16.</li>
    <li> This item is not a original Ped Egg. Do not bother ordering and going through the hassle of having to return it. It is a knock off. Mine was actually used. Gross,Gross,Gross. Packaging was open. Flimsy. I have an original and was looking for a handle one due to being disabled and not able to bend over as I used to be. I&#x27;ll stick with the one I have and buy the blades from a local store. I am beyond grossed out and beyond understanding how a company can send out a used item and expecting a person to use it on your body. The infection I could get or anyone that receives it. I can&#x27;t believe people worship the high and mighty dollar to do such a thing.  I am disgusted beyond belief.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT ISN&#x27;T WORTH YOUR HEALTH.&lt;br /&gt;I am also disappointed in Amazon for allowing such a company to sell through them and I buy a lot of items from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed yet I will get over it.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of old hide.</li>
    <li> this product was either a total lemon or just not actual name brand.  when it arrived, it was as if the blades were already dull!  i&#x27;ve had several of these and never have i had one show up so dull and useless.  totally disappointed</li>
    <li> This thing is freaking amazing. I thought I had nice, smooth feet until I used this thing. The foot file is better than the metal file (for me personally) I mean I have NEVER seen that much dead skin come off my feet. As soon as my review is approve, I will post a picture.</li>
    <li> I have a handicapped daughter who truly needed this type of PedEgg.  She&#x27;s very happy to have another one as we couldn&#x27;t find it in any store!</li>
    <li> This product is much better than the standard PedEgg because it comes with a handle which makes it easier to reach your heels.</li>
    <li> A great addition to the PetEgg group. Works very well. No need to contork your body in ways that can cause injury.</li>
    <li> Have tried to use it multiple times since purchasing.  I find that it shaves off callouses decently in only a few locations on my foot.  The rest that are calloused are hardly touched by the blades no matter how much time I spend.  Trying different angles doesn&#x27;t do much more, but often causes the device to come apart and spill anything it&#x27;s collected all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not do a very good job of holding what it&#x27;s collected in the body of the device...you&#x27;ll find it will randomly spill out as you attempt to work on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice for the MFG would be to make the blade portion require a latch or button so it doesn&#x27;t flex and pop loose all the time.  And perhaps consider a design on the blades for it to be used side to side in places where the longer shape might not contour so well on the foot.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my callosed heals.  The handle makes it easier to reach.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the product. This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased a PedEgg; the first purchase was far superior to this one.</li>
    <li> Great product! Follow the package directions and it works! I thought it would be tricky to use. I love this item to safely keep feet healthy in all year in our tropical climate.</li>
    <li> I bought both the standard kind of ped egg and this handle kind and I LOVE IT SO FAR....easily the best pedicure product of this kind I have ever used. In the previous two years I had purchased at least TWO other similar inexpensive \\&quot;foot filers\\&quot; from both Target And Walgreens.  Big mistake, because the two of them combined did not last a whole year. They were little more than just glue and an emory board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the ped eggs on my mothers recommendation and boy was she right.  I bought two(one handle &amp; one standard) because I am so used to them not working or falling apart. But so far so good with this kind.  I have not even opened the standard ped egg because I like the handle kind so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, the removal of the unit from the handle for cleaning is a little tricky, since it is not that easy to remove.  After using the unit for about the 3rd time I had an easier time removing it and it was not that big of a problem.  I would definitely recommend this handle ped egg to anyone who wants a way to keep their feet smooth....while making it easy for you to reach your feet.....</li>
    <li> Shaver top doesnt fit well. When cap removed, shaver top comes off; skin shavings leak out.  Original pedegg worked better.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without a PedEgg.  It does a wonderful job on my heels, they&#x27;re soft again.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t fit the handle at all.  The insert looks like photo copy...what a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, my girlfriend loves it. It&#x27;s not five stars because it appears to have been sitting on some shelf for a very long time before we got it; on side of it is severely sun-faded to a yellowish brown, the other seems to be the original color. Doesn&#x27;t affect performance or structure, just looks bad.</li>
    <li> works well...would suggest everyone with foot issues get one.</li>
    <li> Noticed immediate results and love the handle! Going to buy for gifts during the holidays. Very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Works great, my feet look better than they ever have!</li>
    <li> I like the long handle which makes it easier for me to reach my heels and the sides of my feet.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother to buy the PedEGG  withouth the handle... the handle makes it SOOOOO much more user friendly! Buy THIS ONE!!</li>
    <li> This wonderful tool makes the job quick and easy.  Feet feel like they have been pampered at the spa!  Great product!</li>
    <li> There is nothing like the long-handle PedEgg to keep your feet smooth. The one I received is sharp and stays together well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the long handle makes it easier to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product being a man and having rough man feet( on my feet all day in boots) this is a good product, it works well, if I were to make a suggestion, that they make a mens model, with heavier duty files, and the handle on it is something that is bad about it, its fairly thin and with heavy &amp;#34; rough&amp;#34; usage I can see how it would/can snap/ break ....my suggestion is to hold it down toward the base for any heavy &amp;#34; rough&amp;#34; usage .... good product, it helps and does the trick ....</li>
    <li> Good file with a REALLY cheap handle that flexes during use. Beware when new this unit can really take off skin, as opposed to later the blade becomes dull much more force is required.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. Not a good buy. Product does not do a professional job. The file on all four purchases was dull.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and get the job done fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry hard feet, but with this tool they are back to pink. The handle is very strong and the grates really do the job. I not only used it on my feet but found that it works on my elbows and knees. Trust me get this one with the handle...you&#x27;ll thank me later!</li>
    <li> Works just the way it&#x27;s described! I&#x27;ve been a user of the hand-held PedEgg since it first came out (can&#x27;t even remember how long ago that was) and a big fan, but having the handle makes it so much easier for me to reach the entire foot area. So happy this wasn&#x27;t one of those &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; upgrades to encourage more sales.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. It was worth the money. I bought him the electic one first and he hated it!! This was a GREAT replacement.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! It does work, a little bit, but the blade cartridge does not lock into place (cheap plastic). So I have to press the blade cartridge in place while sanding away. Needless to say, I have white skin dust piles everywhere because it leaks out the side. 30 minutes of sanding, and I believe my feet are in worse condition than when I started. Disappointing!!</li>
    <li> The handle makes this awkward to use.  You cannot get a good angle on the PedEgg, to file your heels.  I may have to just toss it and buy a regular one.</li>
    <li> This product is truly awful.  It is more narrow and shorter than any ped gadgets I have ever seen.  It is so substandard I cannot express it fully.  Do not buy this item if you want any quality at all.</li>
    <li> This was one of the few times I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to other reviews and regretted it! In theory the handle is great.... but only in theory though! is was slippery to hold on to like someone mentioned and not even helpful at the time that I wanted to apply a little more pressure to the bottom of my feet. the portion that holds the sand paper is too loose and often comes out... I should&#x27;ve stick to my Dr. School version, which is cheaper and I could&#x27;ve gotten from my convenience store...</li>
    <li> As usual with these, it is a real gamble on whether or not the blade will work. I have about a 50% chance of it working, it seems. I don&#x27;t know if it is even worth the hassle of returning.</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend &amp; he really liked how it worked.... Until the first time he took the file part off the handle to empty it. Now, it won&#x27;t stay together &amp; keeps falling off. It isn&#x27;t made very well &amp; hopefully the company will improve this issue soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool that you can use while you&#x27;re watching TV at night. Keeps all the dead skin inside the egg so when you&#x27;re finished sloughing you can just empty the results in the trash bin. Best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel this worked as well as a pumice sponge thing they use at the nail salons... Maybe using this on wet feet may work better? Definitely doesn&#x27;t do squat to dry feet.</li>
    <li> ok, but the long handle doesn&#x27;t really help much and the metal part keeps coming out of the plastic.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and does a good job of removing excess skin.  The handle makes it much easier to use on the feet.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  You&#x27;d be better off using sandpaper.</li>
    <li> Well, the handle is a nice idea, but it&#x27;s poorly executed. You can&#x27;t get enough direct pressure using the handle for a decent removal and the file flies off at the slightest touch. I only bought this because my husband LOST my original PedEgg and I thought the handle would be helpful, but it&#x27;s actually just annoying. Feels more cheaply made than my original PedEgg as well. Thinner plastic? I feel like the handle could snap off at any moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PedEgg concept is a good one and the original works very well. Just don&#x27;t get taken in by the handle!! Go buy the egg shaped one. The handle ruins this product because it is of such poor quality.</li>
    <li> This came in a garish animal print. Boo.</li>
    <li> I love the PedEgg.  I have used so many products with poor to average results, but this PedEgg is the BEST!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had hip and knee joint replacement surgery and this tool works great for reaching,  I just wish I had tried this tool sooner.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the original, this version is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It is much less sturdy  than the original ped egg.  kind of disappointed in it</li>
    <li> *** UPDATE ***&lt;br /&gt;04/03/2013&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave this product 4 stars but I have downgraded that rating.&lt;br /&gt;The more I use this product the more aggravated I get with the fact that it keeps popping open while using.&lt;br /&gt;This is happening more and more often and I am tired of cleaning up my skin powder off the floor. Seriously guys.. if you&#x27;re going to make a product that catches debris make sure the damn thing stays closed. Using friction is not an acceptable method for making sure a container stays closed. At this point I won&#x27;t buy another one of these and I no longer recommend this product. You might as well just use a cheese grater and let the debris fall on the floor to vacuum up.&lt;br /&gt;Can ya tell I&#x27;m mad about this?&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I&#x27;d just like to say, Come on Folks!! The Best Product Ever? Give Amazon Buyers a break and write honest helpful reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4 stars because it does its job but it isn&#x27;t the Best Product Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is plastic, so is almost everything today. It does what it is supposed to do, it shaves off a thin layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have rough feet it&#x27;s going to take a little work to get them smooth.  Anyone whose used this file for any period of time will find that the file part will disconnect from the handle occasionally while you are using it. It&#x27;s manageable but it can be a pain and if your not careful you&#x27;ll spill the fine skin dust that is collected in the handle. The concept is nice for those that are not that flexible and have trouble reaching their feet. It will smooth your feet out eventually but as I said it removes a very thin amount of skin, which is not a bad thing. You don&#x27;t want it ripping your feet up. Just be patient, do a little at a time and you will get there. I go barefoot just about as much as I can. My feet get pretty rough. It takes me about 30 minutes to get one foot smooth. The handle is a bit smooth and being plastic can be slippery at times.Wish they had done a little more to make it a little easier to grip and wish they made a better locking mechanism for the file head. I think the price is a bit high at $12 for something completely plastic, but it looks like all of these type of files run in this price range. Good thing is you can buy replacement file blades, so it isn&#x27;t just a throw away product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review was helpful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and used the regular ped egg before and loved it. When I misplaced my ped egg I decided to order one with a handle. The first time I used it it worked great. By the second use it kept coming apart. Now, the two pieces don&#x27;t even snap together anymore. This was a bad purchase choice.</li>
    <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;Love it&amp;#34; is because the base falls off if you apply too much pressure.</li>
    <li> Just used it as soon as I got it, &amp; it&#x27;s AWESOME! Got it for $6. Great for the price. My feet feel like a got a salon grade pedicure. I&#x27;m a runner, so my calluses are built on top of calluses, lol, but this turns my beastly woman feet into lady like again. I like!</li>
    <li> I left my PedEgg in a hotel room, so I needed another. The handle is a great addition to the original produce. I don&#x27;t need to contort my body so much to reach all areas of my feet.</li>
    <li> Great for those hard to reach spot and works great like the regular pedegg.</li>
    <li> My Wife Loves it. She uses this weekly to get off dead skins. Would buy again in the future maybe for myself.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but I have so little need for it then I wonder why  I purchased it. I have nothing further to say.</li>
    <li> I love the handle and have always loved the ped egg.  Only problem I had was the attachment you use on your foot was not sharp enough.  It was already dull.  I took the blade from my old ped egg and used it on my new one and it then worked great.</li>
    <li> Never worked I kind of was expecting a foot grater.</li>
    <li> When you need it you need it....works good.</li>
    <li> This thing really works. I got rid of my callus and was amazed lol!</li>
    <li> Product fell apart.  The latch broke after a few uses. Great when it worked, but I ended up buying a Microplane Colossal Pedicutre Rasp Brown Foot File which was better made and had at least an extra inch of length.  Only draw back were all the scrapings were not caught in a container like the PedEgg. But, nothing that filing your feet over a sheet of paper couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> This product while simple, is not manufactured well. The blade simply attaches via clips/tight fit to the base, yet when any real type of pressure is applied it pops off. I will be returning this product.</li>
