      <li>and THANK YOU TEA TREE :D</li>
      <li>Tea Tree is wonderful!</li>
      <li>Happy!</li>
      <li>great product and price!!</li>
      <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s about $3 cheaper than in store.</li>
      <li>When used together, these products worked wonderfully!</li>
      <li>Very nice!</li>
      <li>The Body Shop was very good at authorizing the return, and refunded me as soon as the package was scanned out on my end.</li>
      <li>It is a good lotion for acne-prone skin!</li>
      <li>but her skin is looking beautiful now</li>
      <li>Body Shop&#x27;s Tea Tree products have made me happy.  </li>
      <li>and I am happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great product for those with acne.</li>
      <li>Works great to reduce acne without drying face.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>Did not have an allergic reaction on it, great.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>So I thought since this has tea tree oil and scar fighting ingredient, it might be good for both.</li>
      <li>but I think it won&#x27;t be a good idea to bring around during a trip.</li>
      <li>Good luck,</li>
      <li>Good luck,</li>
      <li>and i loved it</li>
      <li>The smell is good, it smells like tea</li>
      <li>I have used a lot of products, some good some not so good.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells good.</li>
      <li>It smells good and the times I did use it</li>
      <li>and when they did see me, they told me that my face looks much better!</li>
      <li>and my skin looks so much better!</li>
      <li>Simply amazing in everyway.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to massage it into the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a nice texture, not greasy unlike oil-based scar reducers.</li>
      <li>I have convinced my daughter to divorce the popular, AND over-priced brand that is sold exclusively in the mall kiosk-</li>
      <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s a nice scent.</li>
      <li>However, what research has been conducted has revealed that tea tree oil (5% solution) is just as effective as benzyl (5%) at clearing up acne.</li>
      <li>I have liked all the Body Shop products.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to massage it into the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best moisturizer I have ever tried!</li>
      <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s a nice scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the fade night lotion in the daytime sometimes too when I don&#x27;t need SPF and it keeps my face nice and matte and wears well under makeup also.</li>
      <li>Very suitable for one of my products, the effect is very good, hope can bring pleasantly surprised to me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have a very strong tea tree smell, but it fades over time</li>
      <li>It additionally  a very strong smell which deters me from even wanting to use it even if it did work.</li>
      <li>The product by far is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used up to date.</li>
      <li>Perfect for your sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Tea tree oil is as effective as benzyl, but it&#x27;s not as potent.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the strong smell, but I don&#x27;t recommend if you don&#x27;t!</li>
      <li>Face friendly, health friendly, and best of all, vegan friendly.</li>
      <li>Face friendly, health friendly, and best of all, vegan friendly.</li>
      <li>tree.&lt;br /&gt;Based on its price, I&#x27;m very comfortable with this product and how it works.</li>
      <li>feel very refreshing, brisk, and clean.</li>
      <li>In combo with the toner, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference!</li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>I find that if I use it every time I&#x27;m in the shower, it works TOO WELL and makes my face break out more.</li>

      <li>(okay</li>
      <li>I love the Body shop</li>
      <li>I was pleased</li>
      <li>I use this product every night after the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner and love the effect it has had on my skin.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I like tea tree oil products anyway, and this is possibly the best ever.</li>
      <li>the tea tree face wash is fantastic, though!</li>
      <li>so I just make sure to apply an hour or so before I go out or at bedtime.</li>
      <li>One that may be a deal breaker for many...</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the way it feels on the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure my acne marks went away.</li>
      <li>That leads to clogged pores and bla bla bla, I&#x27;m sure you know the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This lotion feels great going on, very hydrating and absorbs well, but not greasy.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>The best skin product both for daily use and business trip.</li>
      <li>Mainly I love it for what it is doing for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I ended up buying this on Amazon because it is cheaper here than in stores, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I think the skin clearing lotion is a much better product.</li>
      <li>this lovely blemish</li>
      <li>It is an okay moisturizer</li>
      <li>I chose this one because it is really gentle, good to use for a longer repair period.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s also easy to apply.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s also easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It can smell strong, but I like the smell of tea tree.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Advice for use:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually tried pure tea tree oil for acne- not the best idea.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Advice for use:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually tried pure tea tree oil for acne- not the best idea.</li>
      <li>Works great on my chest, arms and back as well.</li>
      <li>dare I say it, fabulous.</li>
      <li>dare I say it, fabulous.</li>
      <li>It is light and non sticky.</li>
      <li>For me, it took about 3-4 months to see significant clearing of my face.</li>
      <li>According to everybody,  if you stick a little great tea in something it will make that product better.  </li>
      <li>I put it on my clean face at night.  </li>
      <li>but she was right!</li>
      <li>so everything I have purchase thus far has been of high quality for a great price.</li>
      <li>Good for my 20-something facial care.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cool~</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything super special.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t work miracles but it will definitely make your face look better :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so much more confident; I actually like being photographed now</li>
      <li>However, ever since I started using this night lotion (in conjunction with Lush&#x27;s Coalface bar cleanser), I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in my skin!</li>
      <li>it is really an amazing product for skin issues, such as acne, inflammation, marks, etc,.</li>
      <li>You have to get use to smell, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>I use two squirts every night, occasionally skipping a night to let my face do some of its own work.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think the skin clearing lotion is a much better product.</li>
    <li> Skin feels softer. Smells like an attic or closed up cabin.</li>
    <li> Can get cheaper at Body Shop.com. http://www.thebodyshop-usa.com/ All products are cheaper on the website. Tea-tree is great for troubled skin.</li>
    <li> I saw some moderate improvement to my skin but nothing big. I think it helped just a little bit with my breakouts but not enough for me to purchsae it again. Worth a try becuase everyone&#x27;s skin is different! It has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  According to everybody,  if you stick a little great tea in something it will make that product better.  All the other reviews you see for this item saying that it works and can see a difference already..... it&#x27;s all in Thier heads.</li>
    <li> i feel like this really worked and i loved it but i&#x27;ve had it for two weeks and it&#x27;s almost gone already.I think i have to look for a different product because it&#x27;s so little product for the price.</li>
    <li> The third purchase since I bought it in 2011. it is really an amazing product for skin issues, such as acne, inflammation, marks, etc,. The best skin product both for daily use and business trip.</li>
    <li> great product and price!!</li>
    <li> I use this product every night after the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner and love the effect it has had on my skin. I only had occasional acne prior to using this product, but even that has cleared up as a result of using the lotion and toner. My skin also feels smoother, looks more even, and my pores seem a lot smaller. Other reviewers aren&#x27;t fans of the tea tree smell of the lotion, but I personally love it and find it very relaxing for sleeping. I was very hesitant at first about buying this product because the price seemed ridiculous ($14 for 1 oz. of product, what!!), but I have had the same bottle for 3 months even after using it every single night. A little goes a LONG way with this lotion, I usually am able to use less than the size of a dime on my entire face, and it spreads very easily. I will definitely continue to use this product in the future as it works very well.</li>
    <li> I will never be without this product.  I put it on my clean face at night.  Age spots are lightening slowly.  Mainly I love it for what it is doing for my skin.  I have a oily complexion with large pores.  The pores have almost completely closed, blemishes are a thing of the past, and my face feels so smooth.</li>
    <li> I like tea tree oil products anyway, and this is possibly the best ever. It moisturizes, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, and does lighten dark spots. I wear it every night!</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman in her late 30s who recently had a bout of adult acne that left some scarring on my forehead and cheeks. I tried this product for a few weeks and saw no results at all. It additionally  a very strong smell which deters me from even wanting to use it even if it did work. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I do not use the full line of the Body Shop&#x27;s Tea Tree products because it would dry out my aging skin, but I use this Blemish Fade Night Lotion for the occasional small break out of a pimple or two.  The very next day the pimple will be smaller and the redness will disappear! With in a day or two the pimple is dried up and gone. I have convinced my daughter to divorce the popular, AND over-priced brand that is sold exclusively in the mall kiosk- you all know which one I am talking about, right?  She got the complete line for Xmas and loves it over anything else she has tried.  She is 19 and has frequent break-outs but her skin is looking beautiful now and I am rest assured that she is not putting so many harsh chemicals on her skin.  Happy!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything super special. It is an okay moisturizer but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin when I use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help the redness on my face and I can only give it 3 stars because I was not using it daily or for a long period of time. It smells good and the times I did use it I was pleased so if you&#x27;re thinking about trying it, I would give it a shot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my 3rd bottle of night lotion for dark marks from my pimples. I chose this one because it is really gentle, good to use for a longer repair period. I usually choose something strong when the pimple just happened, and then when the dark marks are fading away, I use this one to make sure they are complete gone. It won&#x27;t cause dry skin at all, so ok to use for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it says, my skin is so much better, obviously not a miracle cream but it really has dulled my pimple scars</li>
    <li> It works! I have adult onset acne and already have bad scarring on both sides of my face and chin. In combo with the toner, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference! I don&#x27;t mind the strong smell, but I don&#x27;t recommend if you don&#x27;t! I still struggle with moisture and end up drying out quite a bit. That&#x27;s the only reason for four stars.</li>
    <li> I really like this fade cream by The Body Shop , I have terrible cystic acne and I use the Cleanser , toner and fade cream at night and I can tell a difference in just 4 days , less redness and cysts seem to be shrinking in face . I hope this really clears my skin</li>
    <li> Simply amazing in everyway. If you have acne-prone skin try this and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have a habit of picking pimples despite the fact that it&#x27;s the reason I have dark marks on my face. Thankfully, this lotion lightens the blemishes within a few days, so if you have the same habit then I suggest you buy yourself a bottle.</li>
    <li> this lotion burns my eyes, even when I don&#x27;t apply it near them. it seems like it kinda melts into my skin and then gets into the corner of my eyes and it stings. I am sensitive to a lot of things so it could just be me. the tea tree face wash is fantastic, though!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best moisturizer I have ever tried! It gets absorbed quickly and completely (I hate feeling a film on my face!!!).</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way it feels on the skin. It is light and non sticky. I am not sure if it will truly fade blemishes but feels good using it.</li>
    <li> I usually have good luck with the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree line, but this did nothing for me. If anything, it made my acne worse. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This has truly been one of the best products for my acne that I have come across and TRUST me, I have spent so much $$$ and time across the board that it would probably take me 2 months to write down everything that I&#x27;ve tried. This has definitely not broken the bank (wish I listened to my grandma sooner - she recommended this to me but I just tossed it down thinking she was a crazy bat) but she was right! for once, anyways. Also, this lotion has lasted me almost half a year and all products that claim to treat acne usually last a month or two for me but THIS... this lovely blemish fade night lotion is still only halfway gone and my skin looks so much better! Combined with kiehl&#x27;s cucumber extract toner first and then this lotion and then kiehl&#x27;s blue herbal spot treatment, my acne scars are fading - and damn girl, I have a ton (ugh), I don&#x27;t get cysts anymore (okay well I get one or two) but mostly I get small pimples from time to time that fade on their own or after two days with my nightly routine. I&#x27;m so much more confident; I actually like being photographed now (Would never have thought THAT would happen) and I just basically feel that I don&#x27;t have to hide in the dark, I can go outside and be me without the thought of others staring at my face ALL THE TIME. They don&#x27;t.... I just used to feel that way. Thanks Body Shop! and THANK YOU TEA TREE :D Wow, almost got emotional there. So if you relate, remember don&#x27;t give up and try this - it might work! Cross my fingers!</li>
    <li> I had a lot of acne scars and blemishes. My parents did not see me for 6 weeks and when they did see me, they told me that my face looks much better! Tea Tree is wonderful! I highly recommend this to anyone. It won&#x27;t work miracles but it will definitely make your face look better :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this every night, but when my face feels headed for a breakout, I go for it. Body Shop&#x27;s Tea Tree products have made me happy.  They are light, clean, and serious about their job.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I have to admit that I don&#x27;t use it as the recommended.  You&#x27;re supposed to use it at nighttime, but I use it both at nighttime and in the day if I don&#x27;t plan on going anywhere.  I also use it conjunction with Avalon Organics Vitamin C serum.  I&#x27;m an African American woman with dark pigmented skin.  I often times have dark scars from pimples, etc.  This fade cream has worked in significantly diminishing the dark spots.  I would recommend for skin evening and I will re-purchase when I&#x27;ve finished this bottle.</li>
    <li> This serum has been part of my evening routine for over 6 months now and I love it. Not greasy or oily like some other serums and affordable to boot. Good for my 20-something facial care. Just getting out the acne phase and trying to clear up the blemishes left behind. I recommend this product nightly and the facial mask used once a week for softer, brighter skin.</li>
    <li> Great product for those with acne. I had my doubts because the bottle is tiny and pretty expensive so I decided to forego buying it in store with the matching foaming facewash and concealer, but this entire line has not disappointed me. I ended up buying this on Amazon because it is cheaper here than in stores, and I&#x27;m glad I did. The combo of these products has kept my skin calm and pretty clear while it&#x27;s been breaking out due to my inconsistency with taking my birth control pills. I&#x27;ve been using the fade night lotion in the daytime sometimes too when I don&#x27;t need SPF and it keeps my face nice and matte and wears well under makeup also. My skin is looking better and my acne marks are definitely starting to fade. I was surprised by how well it works but I would definitely recommend it to anyone with residual acne scarring.</li>
    <li> I think it works pretty well since it&#x27;s soothing but also not being too dry especially for dry skin. But I received the product with no cap on it eep. I assume it&#x27;s just a careless mistake but I think it won&#x27;t be a good idea to bring around during a trip.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I wear it during the day AND night. Keeps my skin clear and just enough hydration (not too much, I have oily skin)</li>
    <li> Bought this in hope of lightening my acne scars. The product does noticeably lighten scars. I also noticed a slight improvement in my overall skin tone and a reduction in blemishes. It can smell strong, but I like the smell of tea tree.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help clear acne blemishes. I found that it worked very well on my T-Zone by reducing redness and helping fade inflamed areas. However, it caused a burning sensation on the thinner skinned areas of my face (such as my cheekbones and undereye area). I mitigated the problem by only using it on my T-Zone and chin. People with sensitive skin be aware that this product will cause irritation.</li>
    <li> To be honest, as a teenager, I&#x27;m extremely prone to acne. I&#x27;ve tried nearly all the treatments for it, including hardcore antibiotics. A year ago, I got tired of using all that crap (which was prolly killing me, anyway), so I decided to go a more natural route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter, tea tree oil. Now some may gawk at the thought of actually using oil to treat acne. Newsflash, oil isn&#x27;t bad for your skin. Over stripping of said oils (usually by oil-less formulas and harsh cleaners) dries the skin out, forcing it to overcompensate on oil production. That leads to clogged pores and bla bla bla, I&#x27;m sure you know the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works:&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree oil has a certain compound, terpinen-4-ol,  that has been shown to be antimicrobial (and anti-inflammatory), meaning, yes, this isn&#x27;t just for acne. Athlete&#x27;s foot, other fungal infections, and the likes are all capable of being treated with pure tea tree oil (so not this product). Research has been mildly slim on the possible use of the oil as a replacement for benzyl peroxide and other such medications. However, what research has been conducted has revealed that tea tree oil (5% solution) is just as effective as benzyl (5%) at clearing up acne. There&#x27;s just one catch. One that may be a deal breaker for many... Time. Tea tree oil is as effective as benzyl, but it&#x27;s not as potent. This means it takes longer to have noticeable effects on the condition than if you were to use the benzyl. For me, it took about 3-4 months to see significant clearing of my face. I&#x27;ve been using this roughly every night and occasionally on mornings for the past five months. Just recently, my face began to clear up rapidly. The benzyl peroxide inflamed then dried my skin. The Retinol made me feel as if I couldn&#x27;t go outside lest my face be seared off from &amp;#34;direct sun exposure.&amp;#34; The antibiotics killed the acne vulgaris but at what cost? Tea tree oil is the only thing that&#x27;s actually been working, sans the feeling I&#x27;m about to die or become a raisin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it feels:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soothing on the skin. I feel clean, but not in the way you do if you&#x27;ve ever used WAY too much shampoo. It&#x27;s more along the lines of a natural, refreshingly real clean.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to apply. The foam is easy to handle and relatively thick. A lather, really. It&#x27;s a nice way to massage it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It smells, dare I say it, fabulous. It&#x27;s clean, sharp, and lacking any industrial odours. I&#x27;d describe it as a less intense eucalyptus; possibly with a hint of camphor (Vick&#x27;s vapor rub). Trust me, it&#x27;s a nice scent. I use products with the oil for everything. Not complaining there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for use:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually tried pure tea tree oil for acne- not the best idea. It&#x27;s expensive and can irritate your skin if used too much. But products such as this one have just the right amount to be effective. I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy this exact bottle, as I usually get the 5 fl. oz. container, which needs replacing every few two months or so. So I reckon this particular size will go out within a few weeks. The foaming pump actually doesn&#x27;t make the light foam I&#x27;ve come to expect from such pumps. It&#x27;s more of a denser, more liquid foam, most likely due to the oil. I use two squirts every night, occasionally skipping a night to let my face do some of its own work. That particular routine may or may not work for you. I find that if I use it every time I&#x27;m in the shower, it works TOO WELL and makes my face break out more. Like all things in nature, moderation is key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s basically all there is to it. Face friendly, health friendly, and best of all, vegan friendly. Good luck, guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Don&#x27;t ingest the tea tree oil or any product containing it. It is relatively toxic if consumed, leading to flu-like symptoms and blood cell anomalies, among other things. Not deadly, but definitely not the most pleasurable experience.or become a raisin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it feels:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soothing on the skin.

    <li> Broke my skin out on first use, waste of money</li>
    <li> I think it is a little helpful. I feel it help me acne marks. I&#x27;m sure my acne marks went away.</li>
    <li> I have liked all the Body Shop products.  I&#x27;m not really sure that it helped fade anything on my face, but it smells good and I do like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Indian-American woman who has very oily skin that tends to break out horribly during the summer. However, ever since I started using this night lotion (in conjunction with Lush&#x27;s Coalface bar cleanser), I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in my skin! It takes at least a week or two to start working but since then, my skin has become less oily and less prone to break-outs, even during &#x27;shark week.&#x27; (If you know what I mean.) This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love the Body shop so everything I have purchase thus far has been of high quality for a great price. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I received the item on time with no damages. It was a lot smaller then I expected, about 4 inches in height. I applied this moisturizer after I washed my face at night. I have combination skin with dry spots and this did not moisturizer my dry spots away. I had to use  CeraVe moisturizing cream in combination with this on my face as a moisturizer. It has been a few months, and I have really seen a difference. It lightens the acne scars away almost so you cannot see them. I probably with purchase this again because it did the job and I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Perfect for your sensitive skin. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it might help me with my acne and scar.  Currently, I am using a herbal tea tree acne lotion. So I thought since this has tea tree oil and scar fighting ingredient, it might be good for both. I have only used it few time. I think it made my acne worse. I really broke out under my ear lobe/jaw line. Its really bad. So I stopped using it. Not sure what went wrong. I do have very sensitive skin maybe its my skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is mixed-oily and acne-prone, this night lotion makes your skin feel hydrated and not greasy at all, it also absorbs very well and leave a cool feeling on your skin. And the other day after I woke up, my skin looked very fair and red spots looked much lighter. But it does not last very long. The smell is good, it smells like tea tree.&lt;br /&gt;Based on its price, I&#x27;m very comfortable with this product and how it works. It is a good lotion for acne-prone skin!</li>
    <li> I use it every night!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Made me break out and did not fade any blemishes.</li>
    <li> The product by far is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used up to date. I&#x27;m an AA woman with extremely oily skin, which caused those really painful breakouts. I purchased this fade cream, along with the toner and facial wash. When used together, these products worked wonderfully! The night cream itself cleared my skin over night, it literally makes my skin glow every morning. It has a very earthly smell, so if you&#x27;re not use to it, it may be unpleasant. The lotion comes in a very small size BUT a little goes a long way, 1 pump covers your entire face. If you&#x27;re skeptical about this product, I say try it! I&#x27;ve been buying this particular line for 2 months now and I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to any friend. It works great and I notice a definite difference when I use this product.</li>
    <li> It dries my skin excessively.  I just can&#x27;t use it.  I like tea tree oil, and use it occasionally, but just once with this was awful.</li>
    <li> Works great to reduce acne without drying face. You have to get use to smell, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good. And I have noticed after a few weeks that its lightened some of the darker spots (which it&#x27;s supposed to do). Best of all, it&#x27;s about $3 cheaper than in store.</li>
    <li> You will see such a difference if you have oily skin and need to stop the glow and the blemishes that accompany the complexion.  This product, when used in combination with the Facial Wash are the best, most consistent and long term solution (without harsh acids) for blemishes.  It has been around and is proven around the world to work - otherwise The Body Shop&#x27;s number one selling line would not be sold in over 2000 locations around the world!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it and will use nothing else. The look of her skin has improved since she began using this fade cream,  It is clearer, brighter, and well moisturized</li>
    <li> Helps fade pimple scar fast, better than more expensive products. It has a nice texture, not greasy unlike oil-based scar reducers. Don&#x27;t waste it on active/inflamed pimple though, it&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s meant for.</li>
    <li> feel very refreshing, brisk, and clean. Unlike other product, which is very oily and cannot be absorbed by the skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion feels great going on, very hydrating and absorbs well, but not greasy. My skin feels soft and I have seen some improvement, just don&#x27;t expect miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very strong tea tree smell, but it fades over time so I just make sure to apply an hour or so before I go out or at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been using for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m not convince it does anything. I was not satisfied with my purchase. It is also not preventing any additional breakouts. It also smells bad.</li>
    <li> Very suitable for one of my products, the effect is very good, hope can bring pleasantly surprised to me.It&#x27;s cool~</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping it would lighten some dark spots i have on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 month now and i see no change. When i heard &#x27;lotion&#x27;, i expected it to be a type that gets absorbed by the skin, except this does not. when applied, it stays on as a layer on my face which then gets really oily. I&#x27;m not sure, if that&#x27;s whats supposed to happen, but its not pleasant. The smell i actually like, which if you&#x27;ve tried Body Shop products before, know what im talking about. I like that it has a little pump which makes it easy to dispense onto your fingertips.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this product and it is pretty soothing.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any lightening of my dark spots but still have hopes it will work.</li>
    <li> Did not have an allergic reaction on it, great.</li>
    <li> I hated this. It smelled terrible and made me breakout.</li>
    <li> I feel like product doesnt work for me and for 14 dollars i felt like it shouldve done something. I actually felt it caused me to break out.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
    <li> I noticed redness of my scars lighten after a few days of use. I like the product overall.</li>
    <li> Its hard to rate personal items but I will anyhow. I am 29 and have had some kind of acne for as long as I can remember. I have used a lot of products, some good some not so good. This smells pretty good, has a bit of a camphor smell (not exactly but difficult to pinpoint the actual smell). I only used it about 2 weeks, then returned it. The Body Shop was very good at authorizing the return, and refunded me as soon as the package was scanned out on my end. FAST!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. I have to use it sparingly on spots on my face. This stuff dries up blemishes like crazy but can irritate skin too. Works great on my chest, arms and back as well. Wish it came in a bigger bottle for the price tho...this bottle is tiny! : (</li>
