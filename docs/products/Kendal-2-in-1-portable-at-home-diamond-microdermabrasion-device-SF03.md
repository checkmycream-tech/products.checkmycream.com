    <li> First time I used and I&#x27;m convinced was a good deal. It cleans the pores immediatly in the level 2, and the swing was soft and radiant.</li>
    <li> DISGUSTING - Liked the device arrived on time. Used unit with skin flakes in it. Big fail on Kendal! Recommend going to another competitor product to avoid this. Simply gross!</li>
    <li> Beware several people, including myself received a device that with no shrink wrap on the box or unit itself. There was even a dirty filter inside the unit. I returned it because I am not using something on my skin that is not brand new from the factory.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the fact that I received a used system, instead a new one as stated in the item description. The system had a white dust inside and it even came with the sponge filter and the silicones rings pieces installed. These pieces are supposed to be installed before the first use of the system.</li>
    <li> Yes, very happy with the product!!!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely loved the results I&#x27;m getting. The only reason this is not getting five stars, is the smaller blackhead suction tips don&#x27;t get enough sickroom to work well.. The larger black head tip works amazing and the diamond tip results were just like the facials at spa.. Please remember to clean your face well before using and if you have a face steamer I would Suggest using that to open your pores.. Also make sure you using a toner and face creams to ensure your getting the full benefits of this product!!</li>
    <li> I just got this.  No instructions. What the hell am  I supposed to do?  No you tube video on this either. HELP!!</li>
    <li> The Kendal is ok. its not the same as going to spa but it will do.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and have noticed some difference. My face looks fresher and acne scars have been minimized.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for. Perfect for mild peeling, no irritation to face. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I Like it the electrical cord keeps coming off over all it is good product I can see the difference in my complexion I only use it twice a week</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with very good directions and suction power isn&#x27;t like I hoped. Also, doesn&#x27;t give you information about buying additional filters.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this was going to be powerful enoungh to get rid of stubborn blackheads but I was sadly disappointed..</li>
    <li> It works well but disappointed it did not come with better directions.  I had to learn how to use it myself.</li>
    <li> Adapter consistently keeps falling out as you use the machine, as well as filters being sucked in. Very cheaply made, sent it back</li>
