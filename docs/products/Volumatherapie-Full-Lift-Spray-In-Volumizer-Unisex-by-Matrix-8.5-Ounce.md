      <li>Glad I could get it!</li>
      <li>This is a very nice, light hair gel/spray product.  </li>
      <li>sure how effective this is</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair-</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Love Biolage products&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>so much static in my hair before.  </li>
      <li>Works better than anything I have tried without adding &#x27;gunk&#x27; to your hair.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Today I used my heat protector along with this and the softening mist, and it looks better today.</li>
      <li>First of all, I love it because it is easy to use!  </li>
      <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
      <li>Did I mention this spray is wax free?</li>
      <li>The next day I can smell it &amp; its great.</li>
      <li>Works great &amp; did not make my hair totally sticky or unclean right after a wash!</li>
      <li>This product did not work well for my hair type (very fine and straight) and did not provide the volume boost I was hoping to experience.  </li>
      <li>I have the top cut shorter and wanted to use a more natural product to give it some lift.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this smells, and that it is more natural.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesnt volumize as much as Too Sexy products but it leaves your hair extra fresh feeling and nice smelling.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best products I have found for my baby thin hair.  </li>
      <li>Although it is not a miracle product, it is the best product I have found for thin hair.</li>
      <li>I will combine this with a spray gel to result in a \\&quot;slept-in\\&quot; tossled effect, and am still looking for the right spray gel.</li>
      <li>I have tried a number of brands mostly well known brand such as loccitane, aveda, fekkai, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only spray gel that I&#x27;ve been able to use.  </li>
      <li>I am a former hairstylist and love this product.  </li>
      <li>However, i do prefer the Bodifying Spray Gel by Matrix because it works a little bit better for my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>the kind that goes limp if it hears the word &amp;#34;humidity&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>is definitely the top one so far.</li>
      <li>great for my long, thin, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It is great for giving the hair a smooth feel, but the static is crazy!!</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, wavy, dry and stubborn.</li>
      <li>I am older, and it is finer than it used to be.  </li>
      <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and tolerates these products really well.</li>
      <li>My hair has volume, not really big but pretty noticeable.</li>
      <li>The full-lift works a little better at giving my hair some extra body.  </li>
      <li>This spray smells so natural and even makes my scalp feel refreshed, plus giving my hair soft natural body.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly, but has gotten thinner over the years.  </li>
      <li>has a rather cloying fragrance, reminds me of old lady perfume.</li>
      <li>The biggest drawback for me was that it made my hair too soft.</li>
      <li>Use itcouple times so far, and I see difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I have average hair that needs washing everyday with a light hold/gel.  </li>
      <li>I just spray it on the roots, and leave it to dry naturally.</li>
      <li>Note I hv fine, thin and some what wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine thin hair and gives it body without making it oily.</li>

    <li> I am a former hairstylist and love this product.  I have average hair that needs washing everyday with a light hold/gel.  This is a very nice, light hair gel/spray product.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, wavy, dry and stubborn. Plus, it&#x27;s salt and pepper white. I&#x27;m \\&quot;mature\\&quot; and wear my hair short for minimum fuss, but haven&#x27;t found a natural-feeling amplifying tonic until now. This spray smells so natural and even makes my scalp feel refreshed, plus giving my hair soft natural body. I will combine this with a spray gel to result in a \\&quot;slept-in\\&quot; tossled effect, and am still looking for the right spray gel. Did I mention this spray is wax free?</li>
    <li> Works better than anything I have tried without adding &#x27;gunk&#x27; to your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using the &#x27;bodifier&#x27; spray for quite some time.  The full-lift works a little better at giving my hair some extra body.  My hair is baby fine so it needs help.  This worked so well I also got the shampoo &amp; conditioner to use as well.  It is not sticky or stiff like some others.  I spray it on after towel drying and use the blow dryer with a round brush - it defintely adds some lift &amp; body to my hair.</li>
    <li> Use itcouple times so far, and I see difference in my hair. My hair has volume, not really big but pretty noticeable. Note I hv fine, thin and some what wavy hair. Usually my hair just stays flat after washing. But with this product, my hair has somebody yetbit doesnt feel sticky ,oily or heavy. I use it after I towel dry my hair, and put argan oil. I just spray it on the roots, and leave it to dry naturally. I donot use hair dryer. Yet again, it gives some body to the hair.</li>
    <li> I have really straight long and thin hair. This helps quite a bit to poof up my limp boring hair. Helps keep curl in when used with heat.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair- the kind that goes limp if it hears the word &amp;#34;humidity&amp;#34;.  This product smells great and lives up to its claims.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This works great on my hair. I have fine thin hair and gives it body without making it oily.</li>

    <li> Like it , use it together with the creme conditioner, very good product,  glad I can purchase from Amazon at a much better price than retail stores.</li>
    <li> great for my long, thin, fine hair.  I get all sorts of compliments!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly, but has gotten thinner over the years.  This shampoo lathers well and using it, along with the conditioner and the &amp;#34;Full Lift Leave-in Volumizer Spray&amp;#34;; it does a very good job.</li>
    <li> This product did not work well for my hair type (very fine and straight) and did not provide the volume boost I was hoping to experience.  The biggest drawback for me was that it made my hair too soft.</li>
    <li> Works great &amp; did not make my hair totally sticky or unclean right after a wash!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have found for my baby thin hair.  First of all, I love it because it is easy to use!  Just spray and brush through.  It does not weigh down your hair or leave thick crunchy residue!  Although it is not a miracle product, it is the best product I have found for thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, down to my waist.  I am older, and it is finer than it used to be.  I have the top cut shorter and wanted to use a more natural product to give it some lift.  I love the way this smells, and that it is more natural.  It is great for giving the hair a smooth feel, but the static is crazy!! I have never had a product cause so much static in my hair before.  It is so bad on the top that curling it is almost impossible.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product would probably do well with thicker, shorter hair.  But for me it was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Love Biolage products&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how effective this is; I can not really tell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt volumize as much as Too Sexy products but it leaves your hair extra fresh feeling and nice smelling. The next day I can smell it &amp; its great.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  However, i do prefer the Bodifying Spray Gel by Matrix because it works a little bit better for my fine hair.  I wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued this line.  It&#x27;s the only spray gel that I&#x27;ve been able to use.  My skin is extremely sensitive and tolerates these products really well.</li>
    <li> Love this. Glad I could get it!</li>
    <li> Just what my wife was looking for delivered as advertised happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I like it, it does give me some volume, but not the volume I was hoping for. I use the Matrix softening spray to help settle it down. It just gives it a dried out type of look after I&#x27;m done blow drying. I gave it 4 stars bc it works.. and maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong.. I don&#x27;t think I am. Today I used my heat protector along with this and the softening mist, and it looks better today. I don&#x27;t know, once I&#x27;m done using it, i&#x27;ll be trying another product. Then maybe i&#x27;ll have something to compare it too.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of brands mostly well known brand such as loccitane, aveda, fekkai, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the top one so far. I really love it and plus great value!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I finially found the best one although all others have been pretty good.</li>
    <li> Works well for adding hair volume, a little goes a long way. Just wish it was unscented...has a rather cloying fragrance, reminds me of old lady perfume.</li>
    <li> Love this spray gel!  It is not sticky and gives my hair body.  I have used it for several years.</li>
