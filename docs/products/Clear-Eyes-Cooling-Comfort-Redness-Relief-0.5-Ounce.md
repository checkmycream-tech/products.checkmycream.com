      <li>I am a nurse practitioner &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use a product unless it was safe</li>
      <li>The cooling sensation, I personally love - my boyfriend hates it.</li>
      <li>Love the cooling effect this has on my eyes.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>i know many people enjoy the cooling effect and</li>
      <li>These are the only eye drops I have found that make my eyes feel this great.  </li>
      <li>but they burn the most the first time.  </li>
      <li>These really do actually cool your eyes as they say.  </li>
      <li>These eye drops work amazingly well for my husband who constantly has</li>
      <li>Clear eyes is always my favorite.</li>
      <li>They are awesome and cool my eyeballs better than other eye drops I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>Much different than most eye drops.  </li>
      <li>Works but really intense cooling effect!</li>
      <li>I use eye drops when I first wake up.</li>
      <li>First of all Don&#x27;t freak out when you try it the first</li>
      <li>Got this for my mom on subscribe and save because I keep catching her in my bathroom using my extra strength redness relief also by clear eyes.</li>
      <li>That being said prepare for intense stinging for the first fifteen seconds after the drops are applied, and then soothing relief.</li>
      <li>The extra tears are great, but i don&#x27;t recommend putting the drops in well doing something, because I couldn&#x27;t use my eyes for like half a minute.</li>
      <li>I bought these Clear Eyes eye drops with &amp;#34;cooling comfort,&amp;#34; and let me tell you, the first time I pulled them out of my bag and applied them out on the sidewalk, I thought I poured whiskey in my eyes!</li>
      <li>these eyes drops are very cooling</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s sort of like putting normal eye drops in the refrigerator before putting them in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better than a few others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>She says this burns a little at first, but says she likes it because it makes her sinuses feel clean</li>
      <li>Found out from my eye doctor that these drops should only be used when you have red eyes from a hangover and have a job interview or some important appointment.  </li>
      <li>She also guesstimates that the comfort lasts nearly 8 hours as claimed.</li>
      <li>This really cleared up my red eyes and gave a cooling sensation.</li>
      <li>but i guess my eyes are too sensitive to handle it.  </li>
      <li>so I would not say I have sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>but this really goes a long way to soothing in ways others don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cooling sensation is great, particularly when your eyes feel tired &amp;/or raw!</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak of a cooling eye drop.</li>
      <li>The first use is a bit odd because it tingles but give it a second</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely not a long lasting cooling feeling nor is it moisturizing in any way-</li>
      <li>Our favorite eye drops are these &amp;#34;cooling comfort&amp;#34; type for dry and tired and red eyes.</li>

<li> Our favorite eye drops are these &amp;#34;cooling comfort&amp;#34; type for dry and tired and red eyes.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest anyone interested to just find a favorite moisturizing eye drop and stick them in the fridge before using if you want a cold rush of relief to your eyeballs... because this stuff is cold for a very short amount of time (10 seconds tops) and really has zero moisturizing properties so it is not long term comfort by any means.</li>
<li> I thought it would help with my dry irritated eyes but this doesn&#x27;t get the red out</li>
<li> /&gt;This is now my go to when my eyes are itchy, dry, red...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just enough to provide a little extra relief for red eyes.</li>
<li> My eyes feel itchy and dry in the mornings when I wake up.  </li>
<li> I am always using eye drops for irritated, dry, allergy-prone eyes.</li>
<li> My eyes get very dry, sore, and burn after hours staring at the computer (I&#x27;m a software developer).</li>
<li> blood shot eyes due to no sleep and long work hours.</li>
<li> Computer eyes is not really a thing.</li>
<li> Not really a moisturizer</li>
<li> It works well just like any other cleareyes product</li>
<li> the other 2 kinda</li>
<li> One eye drop per eye usually does the trick as opposed to other eye drops where you need multiple drops.  </li>
<li> It does feel like your eyeball is cold at first</li>
<li> girlfriend and a friend both tried it and said the same thing that the initial feeling shocking.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m unable to see for a few seconds after putting In just one drop!  </li>
<li> It burns like crazy, then when it goes away in a few seconds, you feel like you can inhale spearmint-cold air through your eyeballs.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s that same horrible sensation you get when they put the drops in your eyes to dilate it.&lt;br /&gt;:o</li>
<li> Not for the faint of heart.</li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

    <li> My eyes get very dry, sore, and burn after hours staring at the computer (I&#x27;m a software developer). These are the best eyedrops I&#x27;ve used, combining redness relief and soothing comfort.</li>
    <li> That cooling effect almost like the tea tree effect on your hair- definitely perk your eyes up!</li>
    <li> i know many people enjoy the cooling effect and all but i guess my eyes are too sensitive to handle it.  I must keep my eyes shut for about a minute before i can open them without stinging.</li>
    <li> I use eye drops when I first wake up. These burn my eyes and I won&#x27;t be purchasing them again. I have purchased eye drops that do not burn my eyes so I would not say I have sensitive eyes.</li>

    <li> Bought as a stocking stuffer for my wife. She says they are quite cooling.</li>
    <li> The first use is a bit odd because it tingles but give it a second and then it cools amazingly!</li>
    <li> This burns your eyes, it&#x27;s torture! Nothing cooling about this.  We both screamed when we used it.  My partner is a doctor and he couldn&#x27;t believe they were selling this product. Horrible. Should be pulled from the market. Avoid!!!</li>
    <li> My eyes feel itchy and dry in the mornings when I wake up.  These are the only eye drops I have found that make my eyes feel this great.  Highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, recommended thanks!</li>
    <li> These eye drops work amazingly well for my husband who constantly has blood shot eyes due to no sleep and long work hours. That being said prepare for intense stinging for the first fifteen seconds after the drops are applied, and then soothing relief.</li>
    <li> Great eye drops! They are awesome and cool my eyeballs better than other eye drops I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> All the cooling of Rohtos with none of the burn</li>
    <li> Great, but they burn the most the first time.  I&#x27;m getting use to it. The extra tears are great, but i don&#x27;t recommend putting the drops in well doing something, because I couldn&#x27;t use my eyes for like half a minute.</li>
    <li> Our favorite eye drops are these &amp;#34;cooling comfort&amp;#34; type for dry and tired and red eyes.</li>
    <li> Great cooling comfort and no stinging.</li>
    <li> these eyes drops are very cooling there&#x27;s nothing else that works this well!!! love it</li>

    <li> Found out from my eye doctor that these drops should only be used when you have red eyes from a hangover and have a job interview or some important appointment.  He told me to toss it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Clear eyes is always my favorite. The cooling sensation, I personally love - my boyfriend hates it. It works well just like any other cleareyes product except it has that wake me up whoosh effect! Recommended for people who stare at computers all day!</li>
    <li> This really cleared up my red eyes and gave a cooling sensation.</li>
    <li> Not really a moisturizer but it is cooling... for all of ten seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not a long lasting cooling feeling nor is it moisturizing in any way- it&#x27;s sort of like putting normal eye drops in the refrigerator before putting them in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest anyone interested to just find a favorite moisturizing eye drop and stick them in the fridge before using if you want a cold rush of relief to your eyeballs... because this stuff is cold for a very short amount of time (10 seconds tops) and really has zero moisturizing properties so it is not long term comfort by any means.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen this product in stores so I thought I&#x27;d try it. Works great! It isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak of a cooling eye drop. It&#x27;s just enough to provide a little extra relief for red eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m unable to see for a few seconds after putting In just one drop!  it feels like it&#x27;s freezing my eye rather than cooling!  It&#x27;s that same horrible sensation you get when they put the drops in your eyes to dilate it.&lt;br /&gt;:o(</li>
    <li> First of all Don&#x27;t freak out when you try it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;It does say COOLING.  It does feel like your eyeball is cold at first but this really goes a long way to soothing in ways others don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend and a friend both tried it and said the same thing that the initial feeling shocking.  And for some might be too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my go to when my eyes are itchy, dry, red...whatever you do I use it now more then the other 2 kinda I bought to try.</li>
    <li> Love the cooling effect this has on my eyes. I bought this on accident and have not regretted it, now it&#x27;s the only eye drops I like. Feels really nice and cooling. Refreshing!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I am always using eye drops for irritated, dry, allergy-prone eyes. I have both prescription &amp; OTC products but these provide the most relief. The cooling sensation is great, particularly when your eyes feel tired &amp;/or raw! I am a nurse practitioner &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use a product unless it was safe but these are fab &amp; feel as great as the drops I paid $50 for (!!) that are prescription.</li>
    <li> Works but really intense cooling effect!</li>
    <li> I thought it would help with my dry irritated eyes but this doesn&#x27;t get the red out AND it burns when I put drops in. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
