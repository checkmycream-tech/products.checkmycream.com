      <li>It is a bit pricy, but you do not need to use very much.</li>

      <li>If i could i would buy more later</li>
      <li>I love the product so much, and it is not a really rich treatment but do great job to your hair with volume,and I sometimes have dandruff if I dont wash my hair everyday.</li>

      <li>I had tried just about anything to help an area of dry scalp on top of my head,</li>
      <li>You only need a little bit and the smell is great.  </li>
      <li>Rahua finishing cream really does what they claim it to do.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t use much product on it without it feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>People will frequently comment on how pretty my curly hair is, but I know it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the curls begin to resemble Bozo the Clown&#x27;s wig.  </li>
      <li>You only need a finger tip full</li>
      <li>so the bottle should last a very long time making the cost better</li>
      <li>After hair dries it leaves a very soft curl.  </li>
      <li>Very natural</li>
      <li>It does not get rid of frizz completely.</li>
      <li>But it does work and gives me my natural curls.</li>
      <li>This does make it soft and manageable</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I have always had pin straight hair but have stopped coloring my hair and am almost all grey.</li>
      <li>VERY MOISTURIZING, I have dry, processed hair</li>
      <li>I have thin curly hair, and this product was not heavy like most finishing hair creams.  </li>
      <li>This product FIXED my dry scalp !  </li>

    <li> lightweight, moisturizing, shine--it does just what it promised to do. LOVE IT!! I use the shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s my holy grail of hair products.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, curly, frizzy hair and have been defeated in my every attempt to control frizz.  It is not nice to wake up each morning looking like The Bride of Frankenstein or Helen Bonham Carter in Sweeney Todd.  People will frequently comment on how pretty my curly hair is, but I know it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the curls begin to resemble Bozo the Clown&#x27;s wig.  My daughter-in-law had Rahua with her on our last trip to Seattle, a frizzy haired persons vision of hell, and got me to try it.  I purchased my own jar on returning home  and been using it for several weeks (albeit much more than recommended).  I&#x27;m presently  and pleasantly pleased  (don&#x27;t you love alliteration ) to report, my hair has never looked so good.  I believe it takes several weeks of use to begin making a difference.  Next week it will have to undergo the San Francisco test.  Hopefully, it will pass!</li>
    <li> I love this product so far.  I have thin curly hair, and this product was not heavy like most finishing hair creams.  The price is slightly high for a hair product, but a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product if you have tried many products that promise no frizz.  Rahua finishing cream really does what they claim it to do. After hair dries it leaves a very soft curl.  I have not tried flat ironing or blow drying my hair afterwards, but I  initially purchased this product so I could wear my hair curly and not have a frizzy afro-do when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the scent 😳 I guess I was expecting something else... Smells like bad coconut lotion lol idk how to explain it but it&#x27;s not pleasent.. But it does work and gives me my natural curls. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This product FIXED my dry scalp !  I use it on my scalp, it is totally free of anything non-natural.  After shampooing with Rahua Shampoo, I massage this into my scalp, on the affected area.  It took care of it immediately !  I had tried just about anything to help an area of dry scalp on top of my head, nothing worked until I tried this.  VERY good to get rid of this problem !</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this product, but unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair. My hair is fine and wavy and I can&#x27;t use much product on it without it feeling greasy. I used a very small amount of this product a few times, and my hair felt greasy. It might work well for other people, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Sadly didn&#x27;t work for me..make my hair vey dull and matt</li>
    <li> Love this product! Can&#x27;t believe it works better than unnatural/chemically derived products. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I hate the smell!</li>
    <li> I Love this. makes your hair really soft and it smells good. If i could i would buy more later</li>
    <li> Love how soft and supple this makes my hair. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve used on my curly/wavy Mediterranean hair.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product is truly non toxic according to the EWG website and it does what is says.  Great leave in conditioner for the ends of my hair.  It is a bit pricy, but you do not need to use very much.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this product.  It left my hair feeling tacky and looking lack luster.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service .. Many thanks . I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works as advertised.  My hair felt so sleek without being greasy.  Just be sure you don&#x27;t use to much of the product.  Just a tiny dab is all that is needed or else you may end up greasy!</li>
    <li> Had a disturbing odor couldn&#x27;t even bare to try it.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  You only need a little bit and the smell is great.  Very natural</li>
    <li> I like this because it&#x27;s supposed to help with damage control from heat from my hairdryer and flat iron. I gave it a 4 star though because some days my hair comes out looking good and other times slightly flat/oily with this product even when I think I applied the same amount following the same recommendations. My next order though would probably be through the rahua.com website, because they suggested that Amazon is not an authorized dealer for their products and implied that the products sold on amazon might be expired or illegally obtained...</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this and was hoping that this would be my cure-all for my hair but, unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t. My hair has tons of split ends yet I have oily roots. This does make it soft and manageable but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker or anything. The nice thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down which is why it trumps everything else in my stash.</li>
    <li> I love the product so much, and it is not a really rich treatment but do great job to your hair with volume,and I sometimes have dandruff if I dont wash my hair everyday. But when I use this produce, my hair feels great,not greasy at all, and still have volume on my hair. I just totally love the product, I think I will buy this product again in official website.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s pricey.  But I use it sparingly and it lasts six months.  I put a small dab on the lower part of my shoulder length hair before drying. It doesn&#x27;t have an amazing scent, but tolerable and it dissipates quickly after drying.  Leaves my hair soft and manageable.  And have i mentioned the amazing Ibiza brush?  Check that out too.</li>
    <li> I REALLY DO NOT LIKE THE FEELING OF THE HAIR AFTER APLYING IT AND I DO NOT LIKE THE SMELL EITHER.</li>
    <li> I have always had pin straight hair but have stopped coloring my hair and am almost all grey. Suddenly I have curly hair. This product makes the curl soft and attractive. It&#x27;s added slot of shine also.  You only need a finger tip full so the bottle should last a very long time making the cost better</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good product. I have dry curly hair and I use this product almost like a styling cream. It does give your some help withe the curls and frizz without the hair feeling crunchy. It does not get rid of frizz completely. If you put too much of this product in it can make your hair look and feel dirty, however, a little of this product does go a long way. This has an interesting smell, it is not bad, but smells like nutty oatmeal. I would definitely buy this again, my hair does feel healthier because it gets a break from chemicals and other styling products.</li>
    <li> VERY MOISTURIZING, I have dry, processed hair</li>
