      <li>Light and fruity, perfect for a little girl.</li>

      <li>Have a little boy with naturally curly hair and this product works great!!!  </li>

      <li>My 3 year old step daughter calls it my magic spray because it makes it not hurt when I brush her hair</li>
      <li>Good price compared to other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; detanglers.</li>
      <li>It is pretty fruity but not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>When I was little, I had a doll with scented hair, and I absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>have fine but dense strands of hair, that pretty much respond to natural hair remidies and children&#x27;s hair products, so this did exactly what It says it will!</li>
      <li>thank you so much!  </li>
      <li>That much might be appropriate if the hair is very long ...</li>
      <li>The whole bottle went in the trash.</li>
      <li>and this stuff works really well.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it at this point.</li>
      <li>Worked great right after bath and even the next day on dry hair and didn&#x27;t weigh his hair down or make it greasy.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell but it gets a little greasy on the baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use too much or it can get a little heavy, but that&#x27;s true of most products.</li>
      <li>I simply spray this on when her hair is dry and the comb goes right through, plus it has a nice conditioner to it, and gives her little toddler curls shine.</li>
      <li>It was gummy and made my toddler&#x27;s hair more tangly and unmanageable when wet and knotted when dry.</li>
      <li>Too much to go through to send it back.</li>
      <li>The strong Kool-Aid smell is slightly less noticeable when dry.  </li>
      <li>You can spray on as much as you want and it will not weight hair down or leave it greasy.</li>
      <li>Use only a tiny, tiny bit - even a whole squirt on wet hair made for a sudsy head that I had to go wash out again.  </li>

<li> Also, my daughter has fine straight hair, and when she wakes up in the morning or from a nap, the poor thing usually has a literal nest on the side or back of her head.</li>
<li> carefully shipped</li>
<li> That said, a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> As the other review mentions, it takes just one squirt</li>
<li> we ended up keeping it because it was curl tamer or something and my other daughter has curly hair.  </li>
<li> Besides, it left my daughters hair completely dull and unmanageable.</li>
<li> The downside is it is a bit on the expensive side, and if you use a bit too much will leave a greasy look.  </li>
<li> My 20 month old has long curly Sue hair and in the morning it is a rats nest of messy curls, and painful for her to have me brush through when her hair is dry.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> I use it everyday</li>
<li> One bottle last approximately 3-4 months for two girls with shoulder length hair.</li>
<li> I use the detangler spray to tame it and reduce pain as I brush it out and it works like a charm keeping the frizziness away.</li>
<li> , what usually takes me an hour</li>
<li> Usually detanglers cause rashes and itching on us both but not with this one!</li>
<li> It helps me comb through my daugther&#x27;s hair and curl it up, but it makes her hair feel sticky and disgusting if I spray too much,</li>
<li> This product smells like the fake grape smell that is often used to flavor kids medicine.</li>
<li> The wrong product was sent...</li>
<li> Weird on a boy.  </li>
<li> I may have received the wrong product because the one we got said Hip Peas, Curl Tamer.</li>
<li> and we both have long hair and horrible allergies.</li>
<li> The smell is overpowering and unpleasant.</li>
<li> My daughter and I both hate this smell.</li>
<li> this product severely dries it out to the point it ends up horribly matted after an hour.</li>
<li> This is the worst detangler we have tried.</li>

    <li> I received a tube if cream instead of spray as pictured. I may have received the wrong product because the one we got said Hip Peas, Curl Tamer. Either way, it works nice</li>
    <li> I bought this product because our current hair detangler for my daughter was leaving her hair greasy. I wanted something lighter and eco-friendly was a must. This definitely fits the bill. You can spray on as much as you want and it will not weight hair down or leave it greasy. It does take a lot of product to easily get tangles out, but that is the case for most detanglers. I love the smell of this product! Light and fruity, perfect for a little girl.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite hair detangler! I use it on myself and my daughter and we both have long hair and horrible allergies. Usually detanglers cause rashes and itching on us both but not with this one! It smells great, light airy fragrance. Works like a charm and DOESN&#x27;T MAKE HAIR GREASY. What else can you ask for?</li>
    <li> LOVEEEE the smell and it works great as a detangler&lt;br /&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;I have fine but dense strands of hair, that pretty much respond to natural hair remidies and children&#x27;s hair products, so this did exactly what It says it will! I shower detangled with no problem in 15 minutes, what usually takes me an hour</li>
    <li> When I was little, I had a doll with scented hair, and I absolutely loved it. This stuff reminds me of that doll with scented hair. Also, my daughter has fine straight hair, and when she wakes up in the morning or from a nap, the poor thing usually has a literal nest on the side or back of her head. I use the detangler spray to tame it and reduce pain as I brush it out and it works like a charm keeping the frizziness away. I use it everyday and I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it at this point. My daughter would be a walking fuzz ball with tiny birds nesting on her head if it weren&#x27;t for this stuff.</li>
    <li> The scent is very nice, but the product leaves sticky residue, which doesn&#x27;t help with combing through toddler&#x27;s hair. Going back to Johnson&#x27;s detangler!</li>
    <li> arrived today and was fantastic!  thank you so much!  will buy again!  carefully shipped</li>
    <li> This detangler works great on my daughters hair. I personally love how it smells. My daughter has very fine hair that tangles easily and this stuff works really well.</li>
    <li> The wrong product was sent...we ended up keeping it because it was curl tamer or something and my other daughter has curly hair.  Too much to go through to send it back.</li>
    <li> Works great for my 2 year old&#x27;s fine hair. It has a nice light fragrance that smells sweet. Smooths her wispy bangs nicely.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this product line. We live in CA and this is a must have for my outdoor loving girls, who are always in the pool or at the beach. I wouldn&#x27;t use too much or it can get a little heavy, but that&#x27;s true of most products. That said, a little goes a long way. We use it almost daily.</li>
    <li> My 20 month old has long curly Sue hair and in the morning it is a rats nest of messy curls, and painful for her to have me brush through when her hair is dry. I simply spray this on when her hair is dry and the comb goes right through, plus it has a nice conditioner to it, and gives her little toddler curls shine. I bought this product because it is a natural alternative, but I love that it works and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> This spray is just ok. It helps me comb through my daugther&#x27;s hair and curl it up, but it makes her hair feel sticky and disgusting if I spray too much,</li>
    <li> This product smells like the fake grape smell that is often used to flavor kids medicine. My daughter and I both hate this smell. Besides, it left my daughters hair completely dull and unmanageable. After a couple days, it was literally one big knot. The whole bottle went in the trash. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells like grapes.</li>
    <li> Loved the sweet gentle smell and found it to be a very effective detangler. Best detangler yet. Well worth the $.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It makes my daughters hair smell delicious. We also like that it&#x27;s all nautical and actually works.</li>
    <li> Detangles, yes.  Use only a tiny, tiny bit - even a whole squirt on wet hair made for a sudsy head that I had to go wash out again.  That much might be appropriate if the hair is very long ... which ours isn&#x27;t.  The strong Kool-Aid smell is slightly less noticeable when dry.  Weird on a boy.  Good price compared to other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; detanglers.</li>
    <li> Hip Peas is a great detangler.  It has a wonderful smell of blueberries, and does the trick for nasty tangles.  The downside is it is a bit on the expensive side, and if you use a bit too much will leave a greasy look.  I am very happy with this product, have been purchasing for about a year.  One bottle last approximately 3-4 months for two girls with shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Have a little boy with naturally curly hair and this product works great!!!  As the other review mentions, it takes just one squirt but I didn&#x27;t find that it needed to be rinsed.  Worked great right after bath and even the next day on dry hair and didn&#x27;t weigh his hair down or make it greasy.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the hip peas brand but this is a no go in my book. It does a wonderful job of detangling but then again so does water however after applying no matter how well I oil her hair this product severely dries it out to the point it ends up horribly matted after an hour.</li>
    <li> We love this detangling spray. However if you don&#x27;t want greasy hair do not apply liberally, though that should be true of any detangling product. The smell of this product reminds me of grape BIG CHEW (the gum). It is pretty fruity but not unpleasant. It doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals or anything gross. We like it a lot!</li>
    <li> It smells so good. My 3 year old step daughter calls it my magic spray because it makes it not hurt when I brush her hair</li>
    <li> The shampoo/body wash is great. I found that the detangler leaves my daughters hair oily.</li>
    <li> I love the smell but it gets a little greasy on the baby&#x27;s hair. Glad to be putting something chemical free though.</li>
    <li> This is the worst detangler we have tried. It was gummy and made my toddler&#x27;s hair more tangly and unmanageable when wet and knotted when dry. The smell is overpowering and unpleasant.</li>
