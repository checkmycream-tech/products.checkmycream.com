      <li>Love this toner.</li>

      <li>I love the smell of this skin care line.</li>
      <li>buy at Kroger for a couple dollars more.</li>

      <li>I wish more people knew about these products.</li>
      <li>This makes me satisfied since I know</li>
      <li>It is extremely refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Its so light and feels clean and nice.</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous, as are most Alba Botanica products.</li>
      <li>Smells like a strong men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
      <li>I use it with the even advanced gel cleanser</li>
      <li>After purchasing the night cream from this line (which is by the way fantastic)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle but effective.</li>
      <li>Happy to finally receive this  bottle of toner.</li>
      <li>Light, nongreasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just too strong for me.</li>
      <li>Feels clean and tingly without drying out your face.</li>
      <li>Maybe this is good for other people, I am sure it contains something allergenic contents.</li>
      <li>Gentle, cleans my face deeply, even after a good wash!</li>
      <li>Getting ready to order some more</li>
      <li>I wish I could return it for a full refund, but of course it can&#x27;t happen since it&#x27;s been used already.</li>
      <li>Which it&#x27;s safe to say I have to be very picky in what products I put on my face.</li>
      <li>My skin feels clean and fresh after use.</li>
      <li>The solution dries quickly so I can put my moisturizer on afterwards.</li>
      <li>So I started using a mild benzoyl peroxide cleanser. &#x27;</li>
      <li>Leaves skin nice&amp; clean to touch, especially in the warmer months of the year.</li>
      <li>This toner has worked miracles and I love to use it at night and wake up with soft skin.  </li>
      <li>Product isn&#x27;t worth the &amp;#60;$10</li>
      <li>I will go back to Shea Tera rose water.</li>
      <li>It has an astringent smell that reminds me of fresh kitty litter.  </li>
      <li>but i guess it is ok since it is supposed to smell like natural sea kelp and not perfume.  </li>
      <li>it seems  to be a good facial toner for those with normal skin</li>
      <li>I have tried several different products and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s actually nice product, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of it very much though, and I don&#x27;t like the packaging either; the bottle has leaked a couple of times and the smell is just...odd.</li>
      <li>Very gentle</li>
      <li>I have oily acne skin and felt this toner worked better than others that use traditional acne-fighting ingredients like benzol peroxide and salicycic acid.  </li>
      <li>Think I&#x27;ll be buying the whole line!</li>
      <li>I love this toner, it is the only toner I will ever use again.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>After suffering through half a bottle in the hopes I&#x27;d eventually stop wrinkling my nose, I finally switched to Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner, which has a tolerable smell and has done a much better job of evening out my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Love this toner!&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on my very sensitive skin and leaves my skin feeling soft as if I applied a light moisturizer... not dry at all like some toners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I just started using this toner; it gives my skin a clean refreshed feeling and not tight.  </li>
      <li>I will certainly be purchasing it again.</li>
      <li>Scent is slightly strong but I like it...leave skin feeling slightly moisturized and clean...</li>
      <li>Unlike many toners I&#x27;ve used before, it&#x27;s quite gentle on my skin, and while I do feel a little dry after using it, that&#x27;s kind of the point.</li>
      <li>this works for me its gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hydrating and really seems to improve my skin.</li>
      <li>I really do like this toner.</li>
      <li>and I was very relieved it was gentle on my face.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it does much for my skin</li>
      <li>I tried it and it&#x27;s a bit sticky and very smelly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this toner!</li>
      <li>it is a gentle toner.  </li>
      <li>It really helps the skin to retain moisture.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It arrived spilled all over. There was about 1/3 left. I tried it and it&#x27;s a bit sticky and very smelly. I will go back to Shea Tera rose water.</li>
    <li> Great product. Light, nongreasy. Helps shrink pores.</li>
    <li> has helped even out my skin tone</li>
    <li> Seaweed is so beneficial for your skin, this product smells great and does not irritate my skin at all. Its effective, I feel my skin improved in texture over the months I have used this product. Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with adult acne for years.  These products by Alba have cleared my skin without drying.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner in the morning for a couple years now. It&#x27;s hydrating and really seems to improve my skin. I especially like it during the winter, since it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I use it with the sea kelp cleansing milk, which I also like for a morning cleanser. I use different products at night.</li>
    <li> I definitely like this toner; it&#x27;s very calming after cleansing and I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s really good for getting makeup residue off of your skin too - this is the only thing I would use to remove mascara residue from around my eyes, I don&#x27;t feel at all nervous about having it near my eyes. I don&#x27;t like the smell of it very much though, and I don&#x27;t like the packaging either; the bottle has leaked a couple of times and the smell is just...odd.</li>
    <li> Gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> When bottle arrived it was half empty.</li>
    <li> Works and lasts forever when you use a cotton ball... My skin is so even, now!!!!! I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that was vegan, cruelty free, and worked! I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> I suffer from large cystic type acne since high school...so I know a thing or two about acne. After deciding that neither the acne nor the \\&quot;teen hormone\\&quot; will go away naturally in my 20s, I had to resort to creating a skin care regimen...a big UGH for someone as lazy as me. So I started using a mild benzoyl peroxide cleanser. &#x27;Twas OK...acne decreased after 3 months but post-acne redness still lingered around. Then a year later, I decided to add this Alba toner to my regimen (for reasons I can&#x27;t remember). I have sensitive acne-prone skin and I was very relieved it was gentle on my face. I run it around my face, jawline, and neck TWICE with 2 cotton balls every night...and boy can I see the dirt! You&#x27;d think the cleanser took care of that already! I have to say that using this toner made any acne I still get go away slightly faster. The redness has also dramatically decreased after 2 years of usage (though not completely gone, darn it). And the overall feel of my skin is smoother than with using BP alone. You do have to use moisturizer because toners generally dry out your skin, but I don&#x27;t mind because most skin care professionals recommend people to use facial moisturizers anyway.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been battling redness and dryness for a while now. I use this toner twice a day as part of a skin routine and it seems to be helping. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after application or dry. The solution dries quickly so I can put my moisturizer on afterwards. It does have a light fragrance but its pleasant.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as described. However, the product broke my face out and I have discontinued using it</li>
    <li> Gentle, cleans my face deeply, even after a good wash!</li>
    <li> i LOVE this stuff.  it doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin, it removes the makeup residue that anything short of a super-drying face wash would leave behind, i can even use it for the eye makeup residue.  i originally bought this to try to help with my pores (they&#x27;re a little larger than i would like).  i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping yet, but i know it DOES get rid of the excess crud on my face.  i use the night cream as a moisturizer afterwards because i have very combination skin, and parts of my face get very dry.  i don&#x27;t mind the smell at all (i actually like it a lot).  my only complaint is the packaging - the bottle top could be a bit easier to use...  possibly a pump or a round flip-top?</li>
    <li> I love Alba products. I use most of them so I ordered the toner to try it out. Its so light and feels clean and nice. The smell is soothing and its not strong at all. I think it might be helping my acne too. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It really helps the skin to retain moisture. Sadly, my skin became immune to its effects, but the first 2-3 weeks that I used it I noticed a reduction in acne.  My older sister&#x27;s been trying it out, and she says she&#x27;s noticed a difference in her skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it contains alcohol and fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this skin care line. It works well and can not beat the price. Fast shipping! Getting ready to order some more so I will have back up!</li>
    <li> My skin -- sightly oily, but sensitive -- likes this toner very much, although I can only use it once a day.  (More than that, my skin gets a little cranky.)  With once-a-day use, my skin tone is brighter &amp; my undereye circles less dark....</li>
    <li> I have used this product before an loved it. However this time it smelled foul and rancid. Im not sure if I was old stock or a change in the formula. Either way I will not use it again.</li>
    <li> Love this toner. It is refreshing and preps my skin perfectly for day and night moisturizer. It balances my skin, I am less oily throughout the day, and skin is not dry when I wake up in the morning. I definitely recommend adding it to your daily routine!</li>
    <li> I love this toner, it is the only toner I will ever use again. It never burns and does it job.</li>
    <li> But It made my skin red and cause some skin problems as well. Maybe this is good for other people, I am sure it contains something allergenic contents.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and applying this after a shower made my face sting badly and break out in little red bumps.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an allergic reaction but so much for trying to buy a cheaper natural toner...now I have to spend a couple hundred on a facial to help calm and clear up my skin.  Product isn&#x27;t worth the &amp;#60;$10 price, sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while it&#x27;s okay. I don&#x27;t feel like it does much for my skin but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
    <li> good price and good quality!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;soft and soothing toner,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Alba products at market(I forgot the name). but the price is more expensive than Amazon&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This toner has worked miracles and I love to use it at night and wake up with soft skin.  I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in one week with my skin&#x27;s tone.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t allow me to use a lot of toners. This works great, smells great, and I had NO irritation. I can even get it close to my eyes without worrying. Also ordered Alba Botanica&#x27;s night cream which I love. Think I&#x27;ll be buying the whole line!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male over 40 and I use this in the mornings after I shower and shave just for another level of facial care.  I&#x27;m always surprised at how much &amp;#34;funk&amp;#34; is on the cotton after I use this since I just washed my face in the shower.  This also is good to soothe the face after shaving.</li>
    <li> Happy to finally receive this  bottle of toner. Love it. Use it after I exfoliate, and before I put on my day cream.</li>
    <li> I really like this toner; it smells great and I like the Alba Botanica brand, particularly this line. I cant say its a must have in my cleaning ritual though.</li>
    <li> it seems  to be a good facial toner for those with normal skin</li>
    <li> I bought this toner along with cleansing gel and daily facial cream from this product line. Everything about all three products is great except for the fragrance. It&#x27;s overpowering. Smells like a strong men&#x27;s cologne. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just too strong for me. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s not bothering anyone else. I can actually smell it on my face towel after I use it to dry my face from using the face wash. I can also taste the product if I lick around my lips. I smell it on my face for a couple of hours after applying it, it irritates my eyes. I wish I could return it for a full refund, but of course it can&#x27;t happen since it&#x27;s been used already. I&#x27;ll just have to suck it up and keep on using it... not looking forwards to that. But as I said, other than the smell it&#x27;s actually nice product, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
    <li> This toner is the best I searched for it at CVS and Rite-Aid( that once sold it) I guess they discontinued selling it. This stuff is great. My face feels refreshed everytime I use it. I have oily skin this works for me its gentle on my skin. Leaves skin nice&amp; clean to touch, especially in the warmer months of the year. Try it!! And the price is GREAT</li>
    <li> The much much more expensive toner I used changed their ingredients so I decided to try this, as I like the Alba mask I use.  I really do like this toner. It does the job at a fraction of the price.  I did have to move it into the mister bottle of my other product.  This should be in a mister bottle, though because I already have a fine mister bottle, it&#x27;s not worth knocking off a point.</li>
    <li> I just started using this toner; it gives my skin a clean refreshed feeling and not tight.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really starting to like this line from Alba&#x27;s. After purchasing the night cream from this line (which is by the way fantastic) I decided to give this toner a chance. I&#x27;m glad to say I am very satisfied with this toner. I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. Which it&#x27;s safe to say I have to be very picky in what products I put on my face. After using this for the past few weeks my skin has actually cleared up and my acne marks are slowly fading to the point where i am able to use less make up on my face. I highly recommend this toner!</li>
    <li> I never believed in toners. Don&#x27;t really see a diff after I use it but I follow the beauty regimes. This makes me satisfied since I know the ingredients aren&#x27;t as bad as other products on the market. Hopefully I&#x27;ll find a toner that will show a diff,  but for now I&#x27;ll stick to this. I almost finished the product too.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find an Alba product I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I wish more people knew about these products. I&#x27;m telling you, there&#x27;s no miracle products out there, but this sure is nice. I use it before I go to bed, and when I wake up my redness is reduced.</li>
    <li> good price. i always use this toner. recommend it. alba is gentle enough for my skin. i use other alba products</li>
    <li> I was rather disappointed.  I don&#x27;t feel that it is much better than water.  There is very very little fragrance and no sensation on my skin when I applied it.  It just feels like water.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the Alba Botanica Pineapple Enzyme cleanser, I used it a few times, nothing special. It&#x27;s sitting somewhere under the sink.</li>
    <li> This stuff works okay, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.  It has an astringent smell that reminds me of fresh kitty litter.  After suffering through half a bottle in the hopes I&#x27;d eventually stop wrinkling my nose, I finally switched to Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner, which has a tolerable smell and has done a much better job of evening out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I am sad to say i am unable to use this product due to the scent. I reacted almosy instantly :(</li>
    <li> I love this toner! I use it with the even advanced gel cleanser and my face feel baby soft! My skin tends to be on the dry side but this line leaves my skin silky soft without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I found this at the store.  Never tried Alba products before.  My skin is a sensitive mess with redness and harsh dryness around the nose area, general redness and oily parts by the end of the day.  Several toners, even alcohol free have dried my skin out and I&#x27;ve had to give them up.  The Alba Sea Kelp Facial Toner has allowed me to use toner once again with no drying effects.  It goes on with no strong smell, cleans up the oil and makeup, and hydrates your skin all night or day.  Mostly, I just feel like cleaning my face with this alone because it&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;ve had no breakouts and no harsh redness like I had with some other toners.  This is excellent if your skin is terribly sensitive.  I just wish the bottle came in condo size.  Oh well, the price isn&#x27;t bad.  I believe it was more expensive at the store, so sticking to buying it online might help you out with a few bucks.</li>
    <li> Love this toner!&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on my very sensitive skin and leaves my skin feeling soft as if I applied a light moisturizer... not dry at all like some toners.&lt;br /&gt;I actually use this toner as a light moisturizer due to my sensitive skin... typical moisturizers seem to lead to breakouts.</li>
    <li> This toner is great, but it arrived and had leaked all over the bag it was in.  And having to mail it back to get a new one seemed like such a pain I just kept the half empty one.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous, as are most Alba Botanica products. It&#x27;s gentle but effective. I will certainly be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels after using this product.  I also use the Alba Sea Mineral Cleansing Gel and Alba Sea Moss Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> For the past few years I had been getting painful cystic acne.  I never had this problem until I got into my late 20&#x27;s.  I have tried several different products and this is by far the best.  I use it on my face and back twice a day and It has completely eliminated my acne.</li>
    <li> ordered it as an alternative to the neutrogena drying toner.  i find the smell a little strange but i guess it is ok since it is supposed to smell like natural sea kelp and not perfume.  the toner picks up the residue and leaves my skin brighter.</li>
    <li> It has a lot of good things in it.  It is not harsh on your skin like some other toners.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered more.</li>
    <li> Use this wonderful product morning and night...It is extremely refreshing.  Scent is slightly strong but I like it...leave skin feeling slightly moisturized and clean...</li>
    <li> This toner is the most suitable for my skin. No matter what kind of irritation I have on the skin or just dryness, this toner soothes and softens the skin. I always need to have it. The smell is pleasant too.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne skin and felt this toner worked better than others that use traditional acne-fighting ingredients like benzol peroxide and salicycic acid.  My skin looks dewy and not over dry and its helped to keep my pimples at bay.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  it is a gentle toner.  I even skip the cotton ball swiping &amp; pour a little into my hands, rub together, &amp; apply.  I use this after microdermabrasion &amp; after micro-needling.  &amp; I use it nightly.  it freshens.  I have normal skin.  no major problems- so I can&#x27;t speak to those issues.  this product smells wonderful &amp; does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Love the product but was packaged so poorly that only a fourth of the liquid was left in the bottle by the time it got on my door step.&lt;br /&gt;The package smelled great though.&lt;br /&gt;I buy at Kroger for a couple dollars more.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the way it smells.</li>
    <li> This really is a quite excellent toner. It&#x27;s not too expensive and it has a nice smell. Unlike many toners I&#x27;ve used before, it&#x27;s quite gentle on my skin, and while I do feel a little dry after using it, that&#x27;s kind of the point. My skin feels clean and fresh after use. Keep to your t-bar and it&#x27;ll hold you in very good stead, and use a nice moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week or two and my skin is noticeable clearer. I have adult acne and this really helps with the rest of my routine (cleansing and moisturizing). There is hardly any smell and there is no film left behind that you feel like you need to wash away. It is a life saver for those lazy nights when you don&#x27;t feel like washing your face.</li>
    <li> Feels clean and tingly without drying out your face. Does a great job,smells nice and clean. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I havent seen the best difference in my skin because i have acne on the side of my cheeks which i hope would help soothe them. I havent seen much difference but i like it as a toner. Very gentle and i like the smell</li>
