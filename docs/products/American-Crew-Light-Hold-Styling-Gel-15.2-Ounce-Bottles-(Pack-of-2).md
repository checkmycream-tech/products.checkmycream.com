### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Price is good!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This product is great for my hair.  </li>
      <li>It does have a pleasant, understated scent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and this was a good price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this stuff and am stocking up on it.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells!</li>
      <li>The downside is that as it&#x27;s become more popular the price continues to rise.</li>
      <li>Received quickly and in good shape in the mail.  </li>
      <li>It just looks and feels better.  </li>
      <li>It costs more than the others brands</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>I tried &amp;#34;Grecian&amp;#34; formula for more than 6 months, but have seen no improvements in my hair&lt;br /&gt;color</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t find a better smelling and holding gel.</li>
      <li>Glad I no longer have to purchase this over-priced from the barber.</li>
      <li>This product would best for people with relatively compliant hair.  </li>
      <li>American Crew makes an excellent light hold gel.</li>
      <li>But the American Crew light hold is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to clean off the sticky residue from the tape used to package the bottles together.</li>
      <li>In this day and age I hope you come up with an amazing new innovative product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Crew Light Hold Gel for over 15 years.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping my hair would feel and look silky smooth..</li>
      <li>I like to use light hold gels for precisely this reason</li>
      <li>Importantly, your hair doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;gelled up\\&quot; after use.  </li>
      <li>so pretty soon will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>This gel does a perfectly adequate job of holding your hair in place provided</li>
      <li>44 year old daughter uses it on her hair as well and is quite satisfied.</li>
      <li>It helps hold hair in place but my hair has a softer more natural texture compared to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>It looks more natural than a lot of others.</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve aged (now 70 years old).these factors are even more important with the tendency toward dryer</li>
      <li>I thought most hair gels were pretty much created equal.</li>
      <li>Could you possibly add light oil and some mild medium&lt;br /&gt;brown hair conditioning color, specially for grey hairs..</li>
      <li>I started buying on Amazon because it&#x27;s much cheaper than Walmart or drugstore.</li>
      <li>The light gel is more natural than the firm gel</li>
      <li>I totally rock the light hold.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>If you have thicker hair that is occasionally stubborn and doesn&#x27;t want to go where you want it to, this product is most definitely not for you.  </li>
      <li>(what&#x27;s left of it) controlled and looking good, without a stiff</li>
      <li>you can get your hair pretty much the way you want it without much actual assistance from the gel.  </li>
      <li>I am a man with  curly hair and find that it keeps the frizz way down and gives just enough clumping to make my curls look nice and natural.</li>
      <li>My husband really likes this as it is not REAL stiff.  </li>
      <li>The light hold actually holds very well, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair at all.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if they sent me very old expired product or put something else in the bottle</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, and this gel is the only one I&#x27;ve found that won&#x27;t just knock my hair down and still leaves my hair feeling</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clear and somewhat sticky.  </li>
      <li>The Firm hold comes in a Liter size, I wish the Light hold di as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using but a bottle still last a long time and the quality is worth it.</li>
      <li>so I am quite happy when I find it less expensive.</li>

<li> does not leave any falky residue and will keep the hold all day long.</li>
<li> This was pearl white and had absolutely no stickiness to it.  </li>
<li> but this is clearly not the product I have been using for over 15 years.  </li>
<li> Hair stays too dry after application..</li>
<li> This offer was for two bottles which made it be priced well below what salons charge for a single bottle.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s quite thin, and is much more water-like than it is gel-like, making it just a little messy to use.</li>
<li> I like the fact that I can purchase this product for less than I would at a local salon.</li>
<li> As a balding guy, it has become harder to control my hair.  </li>
<li> Very few companies make any gel products that are not super sticky when wet and rock solid and flaky when dry.</li>
<li> I had tried a few different ones over the years and never noticed a lot of difference between less expensive and higher priced brands.</li>
<li> The product comes with the caps taped over as if to keep them from popping open, but the bottles were covered in thick hair gel because the lids weren&#x27;t on tight.  </li>
<li> My other half swears by it!</li>
<li> He&#x27;s been using it for a few years.  </li>
<li> I like the product and use everyday</li>
<li> What a waste.</li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t hold with that thick, stiff gel hold.  </li>
<li> I thought I was ordering the Hard Hold Styling Gel.  </li>
<li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t entirely crazy about was the consistency.  </li>
<li> This is pathetic, especially since it&#x27;s preventable.</li>
<li> , each bottle lasts quite a while, so it is not that expensive.</li>
<li> I hate it what I don&#x27;t pay attention to what I&#x27;m doing or at least preview my order.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The product comes with the caps taped over as if to keep them from popping open, but the bottles were covered in thick hair gel because the lids weren&#x27;t on tight.  As a result, about 10% of the product leaked out.  This is pathetic, especially since it&#x27;s preventable.</li>
    <li> I thought most hair gels were pretty much created equal. I had tried a few different ones over the years and never noticed a lot of difference between less expensive and higher priced brands. But the American Crew light hold is the best I&#x27;ve used. It helps hold hair in place but my hair has a softer more natural texture compared to others I&#x27;ve used. It just looks and feels better.  I&#x27;m sold from this point forward.  It costs more than the others brands I&#x27;ve been using but a bottle still last a long time and the quality is worth it.</li>
    <li> My other half swears by it! Price is good!</li>
    <li> I totally rock the light hold. I don&#x27;t need my hair to stay crunchy in milk. Crew comes through.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t find a better smelling and holding gel. I love the way it smells! And it holds my hair in place all day without drying it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years.  The light hold actually holds very well, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair at all.  It also doesn&#x27;t hold with that thick, stiff gel hold.  It looks more natural than a lot of others.</li>
    <li> As a balding guy, it has become harder to control my hair.  This Crew product does the trick.  It keeps my hair (what&#x27;s left of it) controlled and looking good, without a stiff feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, each bottle lasts quite a while, so it is not that expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair gel my friends and I use.  I&#x27;ve tried others and nothing comes close to Crew.</li>
    <li> I like it  and I am running out of it so pretty soon will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as described. The downside is that as it&#x27;s become more popular the price continues to rise. The Firm hold comes in a Liter size, I wish the Light hold di as well.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I can purchase this product for less than I would at a local salon.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this as it is not REAL stiff.  He&#x27;s been using it for a few years.  I started buying on Amazon because it&#x27;s much cheaper than Walmart or drugstore.</li>
    <li> This gel does a perfectly adequate job of holding your hair in place provided you can get your hair pretty much the way you want it without much actual assistance from the gel.  It does have a pleasant, understated scent.  Importantly, your hair doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;gelled up\\&quot; after use.  I like to use light hold gels for precisely this reason (I can&#x27;t go to work looking like Yu-Gi-Oh).  This product would best for people with relatively compliant hair.

    <li> This is the only hair gel I will buy.

    <li> American Crew makes an excellent light hold gel. Very few companies make any gel products that are not super sticky when wet and rock solid and flaky when dry. This product has none of that.
