      <li>I love this lotion!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This lotion smells super good!</li>
      <li>As a tan intensifier, it worked nicely.</li>
      <li>but I would recommend alternating it with another lotion for best tanning results as it doesn&#x27;t really do much to accelerate your tan...</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS LOTION, IT SMELLS GREAT AND LEAVES MY SKIN  SMOOTH.</li>
      <li>Goes on very easily.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is very light</li>
      <li>OK, fine!</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell and bow that comes on the cap.</li>
      <li>The scent is a lovely one and calming.</li>
      <li>I just bought it because it was cute, the description sounded like it would help me tan, and it was Designer Skin.</li>
      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than the $13.00 on this.</li>
      <li>The scent is a nice, light tropical flavor.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite intensifiers.</li>
      <li>This product smells great, is easy to apply and overall I loved it.</li>
      <li>Great new lotion for just being an accelerator.</li>
      <li>I TAN EASILY</li>
      <li>and I saw a HUGE difference from one session.</li>
      <li>it really helps you get a nice tan.</li>
      <li>I tried a packet and liked it enough to buy it on Amazon</li>
      <li>People in other reviews said it smelled good.</li>
      <li>Smells great and really works to get u dark!!</li>
      <li>If you are not an avid Designer Skin user then this product is NOT for you.</li>
      <li>I just tanned for the first time in three years and grabbed this on the way in.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of the kind of perfume smell that comes in a little girls dress up set.</li>
      <li>It is very perfumey and it lingers after you are done tanning.</li>
      <li>so your tan remains natural &amp; not fake</li>
      <li>For some reason I believe this particular product does not meet Designer Skin standards.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this because normal bronzers don&#x27;t work on me.</li>
      <li>I tanned in a higher level bed for over a week and barely saw color.</li>
      <li>There hasn&#x27;t been any reviews since it&#x27;s new for 2013.</li>
      <li>I love them, usually.</li>
      <li>I will also continue to purchase from this seller as long as the prices are right</li>
      <li>I began using this lotion early in the tanning season &amp; found it moisturizes evenly &amp; leaves your skin feeling soft for hours after visiting the salon.</li>
      <li>This particular lotion left my skin tanned and soft.</li>
      <li>This bottle is much smaller than their normal 13.5 fl oz bottles.</li>
      <li>The lotion is thick &amp; covers easily.</li>
      <li>It also makes my skin feel soft and hydrated all day long.</li>
      <li>As somebody who tans easily, this wasn&#x27;t my favorite product but far from the worst.</li>

<ol>
    <li> This lotion smells super good! It works well to help enhance your tan and moisturize, but is not a bronzer.</li>
    <li> This lotion was double the price at my tanning salon!! I love it! This was a great bargain and a steal!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and really works to get u dark!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite intensifiers. I LOVE the smell and bow that comes on the cap. Goes on very easily. This always gets me tan too whenever I start to plataue I like to use this it really helps you get a nice tan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner tanner, well I haven&#x27;t tanned in over 20 years.  It&#x27;s good.  I do not like the bronzing tan boosters makes me feel like a fake tan but thats just me.  The lotion smells great and keeps you hydrated, (for me) I think that is what a tanning lotion is suppose to do it&#x27;s very important to take care of your skin!</li>
    <li> Great smell. Great new lotion for just being an accelerator. No heat or cooling just great tanning lotion.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The scent is a nice, light tropical flavor. The lotion is thick &amp; covers easily. I began using this lotion early in the tanning season &amp; found it moisturizes evenly &amp; leaves your skin feeling soft for hours after visiting the salon. I would highly recommend it for beginners who are looking for a less expensive introductory potion. It hardly contains any bronzer so your tan remains natural &amp; not fake looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using for a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great. Last awhile. Definitely cheaper to buy here than the salons. Smells wonderful. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an intensifier and like Designer Skin products. People in other reviews said it smelled good. I disagree. It is very perfumey and it lingers after you are done tanning. It reminds me of the kind of perfume smell that comes in a little girls dress up set. As a tan intensifier, it worked nicely.</li>
    <li> Great price, cheaper even with shipping</li>
    <li> I am devoted to Designer Skin&#x27;s tanning lotions. I love them, usually. This bottle is much smaller than their normal 13.5 fl oz bottles. For some reason I believe this particular product does not meet Designer Skin standards. Maybe it&#x27;s a fake. The labels are different. I have not noticed an even color after laying in the bed or out-door. If you are not an avid Designer Skin user then this product is NOT for you. Go with &amp;#34;Believe in me&amp;#34; for a color booster or &amp;#34;Hero&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re looking for a builder.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes in my salon for almost $60.00. I tried a packet and liked it enough to buy it on Amazon but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than the $13.00 on this. It&#x27;s a great lotion if you are looking for something that doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t have any bronzers or tint but I would recommend alternating it with another lotion for best tanning results as it doesn&#x27;t really do much to accelerate your tan...which hello...is why we are here people.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION, IT SMELLS GREAT AND LEAVES MY SKIN  SMOOTH. THE BOW COMES OFF THE BOTTLE AS A HAIR TIE SO ITS PERFECT FOR PULLING MY HAIR UP WHILE TANNING. I TAN EASILY SO  THIS IS A PERFECT LOTION FOR ME.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  The smell is great before, during, and after tanning!  It also makes my skin feel soft and hydrated all day long.</li>
    <li> I just tanned for the first time in three years and grabbed this on the way in. I&#x27;m AMAZED how dark I am in a single use!! Very happy and will purchase a full bottle now!</li>
    <li> OK, fine! I&#x27;m a Designer Skin kinda girl, I haven&#x27;t used one of their lotions that&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t fond of. This particular lotion left my skin tanned and soft. The scent is a lovely one and calming.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because normal bronzers don&#x27;t work on me. This was recommended to my sister by her tanning salon and she recommended it to me. After using it just once in the tanning bed I was noticeably darker and you could see tan lines. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want the fake tan of a bronzer that is just going to wash off in the shower. This product actually tans you.  Will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion solely on what the description read. There hasn&#x27;t been any reviews since it&#x27;s new for 2013. Lotion is not great at all. I tanned in a higher level bed for over a week and barely saw color. I decided to buy a sample at the salon and I saw a HUGE difference from one session. I&#x27;m trying to just finish the bottle and purchase Luminary or JWow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I did not know that this is a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; lotion. I just bought it because it was cute, the description sounded like it would help me tan, and it was Designer Skin.</li>
    <li> As with all tanning lotion, everyone has a different opinion. As somebody who tans easily, this wasn&#x27;t my favorite product but far from the worst. I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t like a lot of bronzers. Fragrance is very light</li>
    <li> This product smells great, is easy to apply and overall I loved it. I will also continue to purchase from this seller as long as the prices are right</li>
