<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> to my suprise all the wigs i got were wrong i oredered all real human hair wigs and i got sythetic hair wigs</li>
    <li> the wig is very cheeply made, the wig cap does not stay in place, the front will not stay out of my face and if i try to pull it back it looks terrible</li>
    <li> I really like this wig .. I did amazing things to it.. Example : flat ironed it (on low), high ponytail, curled it.. I got so many compliments</li>
    <li> I love this wig it&#x27;s very soft.It could be a little shorter but overall I love it.</li>
    <li> Love it. And it&#x27;s really soft.</li>
    <li> This wig isn&#x27;t very good. The ends get nasty and the bangs are parted wierd and you have to pin them to get them out of your face . It&#x27;s also very small on the head and it&#x27;s too shiny . If you have a lot of hair or a large head I don&#x27;t suggest buying it . Also it&#x27;s quite thin and doesn&#x27;t look that great.</li>
    <li> Received a nice strawberry blonde wig. DID NOT RECEIVE WIG PICTURED. I was pretty bummed because the dark color is close to my natural color and I needed it for work. I have an olive skin tone, so the red didn&#x27;t look that bad, it looked nice usually, but it didn&#x27;t look natural, which was what I was wanting when buying this wig. Sheds a lot and becomes tangled very easily.</li>
    <li> was great right out of the bag</li>
    <li> The wig was in perfect condition upon receiving. Pretty much the color as shown, but the hair does get matted easily when you try to style or wear it more then twice unfortunately.</li>
    <li> the photo doesn&#x27;t do it justice, and its a bit more red but I love it for play, and people think its real! Great price and fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Really bad looking!! So different from the picture!</li>
    <li> My husband like this wig.  He must like Ginger from Gilligan.  Little redder than I thought it would be but I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> This hair wasn&#x27;t anything like the model pic. You can&#x27;t part the wig anywhere and the color I ordered which was a 1b(off black) turned out to be a dark brown with like hints of burgundy in it. I tried it on and the color actually fit my face good but I had difficulty styling the wig. I had to wear a head band to hide the tracks. The curl pattern is great but that&#x27;s about it. The wig pretty much has to be cut into a bang to wear. Overall I&#x27;m not satisfied with the hair but it was 8 bucks so I didn&#x27;t loose much.</li>
    <li> Was  a ok wig, doesn&#x27;t hold up over time.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really happy with this wig. It just looks like a wig once on.  I gave it to a neighbor who wore it with a scarf tied over the front of it and it looked a lot better that way.</li>
    <li> Overall, and for the price, this is a good wig.  I purchased it for a mannequin for a holiday display wit the intent of styling it up and around a tiara.  The way the wig is constructed, all the the top layers are made to fall towards the face so it was very difficult to style the way that I wanted, however it turned out fine.  The color and feel of the hair was Perfect, and would wear well in the down style for which it was designed.  Overall a good wig for the price.</li>
    <li> I understand the lighting is going to be different from what you receive, but this was way off! Even the cut of the wig on the model is different from the style you actually receive. It&#x27;s still a great buy, just expect a lighter caramel brown with honey to gold tones.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful. I wear it everyday. I will be ordering again. Great price and quality. Thanks a bunch. Kiddos to the persons that made it.</li>
    <li> Hair started falling  as soon as I opened the package.</li>
    <li> I never going to buy this again is very  fake looking but what u spect for this price and is not even cut like the pic show&#x27;s and I can&#x27;t not managed the hair to get away from my face</li>
    <li> Loved this wig, got tons of compliments and looks natural . Kind of small butstill fit perfect. A little on the thin but still thick enough to cover</li>
    <li> Hair came as promised it looks nice it&#x27;s nt as light as I thought it would be but I like it better hair has nice soft texture it just took forever to come Idk y bt over all I love the hair and of course the hair sheds and tangles</li>
    <li> I wish it had combs to be held in place. The hair gets tangled very easily and also dry. Could be better</li>
    <li> I ordered this to wear to a renaissance festival. I ordered it a month in advance, and it still didn&#x27;t arrive on time. :( It came a week after I needed it. I guess I&#x27;ll save it and use it next year. It looks good - better than most wigs I&#x27;ve seen for the price, although you can still tell it&#x27;s fake. I would suggest wearing it with a hat to hide the part... it makes it look like real hair. :) Also, make sure to order this AT LEAST a few months before you need it. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I made!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this wig at all. Looks and feels so fake. Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture. Very disappointed. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> I thought the quality was good. It was very soft and realistic, the color was a very soft brown. However, I looked and the bangs were nothing like the picture. They are shorter and have a bulky and less wispy style to them. I am having a difficult time in the returning process. Instructions not clear so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with them and unfortunately can&#x27;t use it because of the style-cut.</li>
    <li> Who ever made this wig needs to go to to chiol and rethink there career choice it was a hot mess it had no type of part and looks nothing like what they advertise it will be a jacked up hollaween costume at most</li>
    <li> it was a little bit shorter and a little bit wavier than i had expected but it came in on time and is soft to the touch and i bought it a few months ago and still can wear it to this day.</li>
    <li> After more then 2 months waiting for this wig( and regretting ever buying it by reading the reviews) my fear became true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never got this wig(yes they refund me. But I haven&#x27;t checked it yet on my statement so it&#x27;s possibly they didn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone even for this price. You&#x27;re most likely not going to get it</li>
    <li> Excellent price for this item, life like and fits well.</li>
    <li> I love the price, length and the color, the color looks pretty natural and everyone loved it thought is my real hair. First I struggled to wear it because of my original hair is about that long. But after trying a few times, I know the trick to wear it right and tight. I like it and may be order another one soon.</li>
    <li> I received this wig just recently. I noticed that it is not very full, but very long. It looks like the model in this picture has all of the hair pushed forward to make it look like there is more hair than there actually is. Also, there is no part, so all of the hair is in your face. You have to hold it back with a clip or bobby pin. The hairs also fall out. This is my first wig, so as a first wig it it a good one, but if you buy wigs and expect them to look real, this probably isn&#x27;t the one to get. lol I like it though and it&#x27;s super cheap for a prop.</li>
    <li> It is a bit thin but the color is super pretty</li>
    <li> It tangled easily, didn&#x27;t lay like the style shown, and the hair felt more like a Barbie doll grade. I was utterly shocked by this wigs texture, look, etc., because I had ordered wigs from this seller previously, and was completely satisfied with the other purchases.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty light and I absolutely love it and it cut just like in the picture. it does shed but what hair doesn&#x27;t?  I would recommend this hair</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig, I used it for a costume (cosplay) and a lot for just every day out wear. People complimented it and thought it was actually natural because it looks so natural. In the sun it has a SLIGHT copper tint to it and looks gorgeous. Not just a flat colour, has roughly 3 different colors of brunette in it. :)</li>
    <li> I got this wig a while back and no longer own it, as I tend to doctor up my wigs, cut them shorter lengths or just end up throwing them away. I remember taking this wig out of the package having mixed feelings (I am experienced with wig shopping), and when I shook it out it was already shedding. I was not sure about going back to this brand until I tried it on. It took some time to style it in a way that suited me; the center part looked terrible on me so I had to push a wad of hair to the side and spray and clip it to set to that side. I didn&#x27;t wear it very often as I wasn&#x27;t sure about the wig and how it made me feel, but I do appreciate the effort that was put into the wig.</li>
    <li> So ugly and tangled very very easy! Barbie like hair doesn&#x27;t look natural at all beware !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews say it isn&#x27;t natural or real looking. But the wig I received looks EXACTLY as my real hair did before losing it! It has an amazing, healthy, natural and real looking shine to it. I ordered light brown (on accident) but I think I got dark brown delivered, which makes me happy because its&#x27; the one I wanted. The only downside is it does seem to shed easily, and as others said -it DOES tangle very easily. Trying to brush it out is a nightmare, and styling it seems daunting. But overall, as it is my first wig, I am very excited at how amazing it is!</li>
    <li> This wig Came in the mail extra early! I am super happy with it. My only complaint is that it sheds just a little bit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just terrible. It&#x27;s not done properly you can&#x27;t style it at all tried to fix it but it&#x27;s just a mess! It&#x27;s a nice color it is soft but gets tangled fast!! It came on time n I was excited I tried it on right away n it&#x27;s nothing like the pic! RIGHT NOW ITS IN THE TRASH I COULD OF USED THAT MONEY FOR MY CANCER TREATMENTS!</li>
    <li> A cute wig I needed for a performance...fit the bill nicely...will purchase again...Thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent Seller and Product!!!</li>
    <li> It is great looks great. looks natural. feels like real hair, beautiful hair color. Thank you so much, Good luck in the future</li>
    <li> Very disappointed---it&#x27;s way too shiny to even resemble human hair and it&#x27;s impossible to wear with any type of clothing because for some reason the hair clings to fabric and tangles horribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This wig was beautiful, and looks and feels like real hair. Perfect! My granddaughter wears it constantly, and she gets lots of complements</li>
    <li> Very pretty color. Nothing was quite like the pic to me. But I love it, and I won&#x27;t be returning it. Very very well made, and a lovely brown color. Well cut, too.</li>
    <li> Very much like human hair, not so shiny. i love it! Very natural curl and wave. High quality too and surprising for the price. Very happy buyer!</li>
    <li> i purchased 2 different wigs for my grilfriend and she loves both of them she always gets really good comments from coworkers and customers ...i really love how it looks on her  .,so any guys outthere looking at this one and whant 2surprise grilfriend or wife this one will make her happy ...and she will look sexy 2 ..</li>
    <li> When I first got it it was great. But it soon got all frizzy and tangled and I had to braid it to look descent. It is still useable though, so buy on your own risk.</li>
    <li> Looove it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The bangs ended up being difficult so I just cut them a bit and I&#x27;m in even more love with it. Really easy to take care of and really pretty! I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and even though I washed it the curls are still there just loose which isn&#x27;t a big deal because it&#x27;s still really nice. I also love the fact that I can straighten it!&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it gets tangled easily, but other than that its a nice wig.</li>
    <li> Terrible wig looks super fake obivious hair line doesn&#x27;t cover the full hair line and also tangles very easily and did bit</li>
    <li> For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much. I am very happy with the wig. You can brush it out without much snarl or losing hair, and it looks and feels like real hair. Wore it in public and no one saw it as a wig. It isn&#x27;t quite as full as I would like, but if I wanted more fullness, I could and would buy another like it and wear them together. Thank you. -Michelle</li>
    <li> This wig was very cute for the price - the hairline/part was not very natural-looking, but when I styled it into a braid it looked great! Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> When my girlfriend want the real long hair do she uses this wig and even can wear it in a pony tail or with hat.</li>
    <li> Got tangled within two wears, looked beautiful out of the package. Idk what happened I hung it on a wig stand. Next day it was more ratty, next day unwearable.</li>
    <li> The wig looks great and it parts juts like the photo. My two complaints are that it sheds a lot and it could be more realistic.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to wear with my Rennasaince Fair costume. The wig is soft...and pretty nice for the price..but the one I received is NOT as pictured. I specifically chose this one as it&#x27;s pictured without bangs! Luckily...I&#x27;m wearing a hat that day. :/</li>
    <li> Ordered this as part of a Halloween costume. Excellent product for the price. I can&#x27;t speak on how well it would hold up if being used on a more permanent basis, though. I only wore it for one night.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s really good...but it isn&#x27;t something you would want to wear normally</li>
    <li> This wig is super nice for the price. I am not personally a fan of the bangs on this one, they are about chin length and tend to fall in my face. I plan to get those trimmed to frame the face better. The color is more of a golden brown, it&#x27;s really pretty. It&#x27;s wearable right out of the box like others mentioned, but the ends do tangle easily. I used a bit of dry shampoo to take the shine out. I wear this with a scarf or a head band to look more realistic since the part in the middle makes me look kind of fake.  My only complaint is that there are no instructions in the box on how to wear it. I am a first time wig wearer (lol) and I have no idea how to make this fit better.  Looks super cute in pictures though and once I figure out how to make it fit better I will wear it out in public. I&#x27;ll be ordering more wigs from this seller just bc they are affordable.</li>
    <li> No the right color, not as expected, doesnt look like the picture displayed on the ad.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig that fits great. Comes with a mesh wig cap. Delivery was much faster than anticpiated and the packaging was perfect for the contents. Thank you, Cool2day, for your great customer service and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> i had to wait for this but it came. its long. i checked the light brown box, but it looks more dirty blonde. it was kind of tangled but once brushed, its really nice.</li>
    <li> The wig I got is way different from what was shown on the advertisement ... I guess you get what you get when buying really cheap wigs</li>
    <li> This wig doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture. It is very dark brown and curly. It is also not adjustable.It was delivered fast, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing I can say. I also ordered a couple of wigs from X&amp;Y Angel and even though they took much longer to get here they were completely worth the wait. Gorgeous and much better quality.</li>
    <li> This wig just wasnot my style. I was not happy with the at all purchase. I will not be buying another.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Its quite frankly just another cheap synthetic wig, way too shiny. The color is way off, its more like a fusion of red and brown. Bad quality everything. Do Not Buy.</li>
    <li> this item arrived on time. the item was not the color in the picture but it was as described, it has a bang and is different style from the pictured item. it looks nice still</li>
    <li> The wig I received does not match the description/ pictures that are shown. The one that I received has full bangs and the color is not light brown. Not sure if they sent the wrong one or their pictures/ descriptions are all messed up.. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This wig is always in your face. It gets knotted very quickly and it isn&#x27;t for those who doesn&#x27;t have a stylist to help you cut the wig. It&#x27;s very itchy as well. Not a good product at all.</li>
    <li> It took over a month to recieve my product, then one of the items was not what I ordered, and the other wig has already started to look ratty and fall apart. However, it took so long to recieve the product, I am very uncomfortable sending it back for the refund/exchange. Do NOT order from them.</li>
    <li> This wig sheds so much!! The part in the middle look so unnatural and it tangled as soon as I took it out the package. You get what you paid for considering it was so cheap...This will be my Hat wig meaning I&#x27;ll cover half with a hat.</li>
    <li> I ordered this month&#x27;s ago and still haven&#x27;t gotten it. If it&#x27;s still stuck on &amp;#34;shipped&amp;#34; status next month I will be sure to make a formal complsint. I really wanted this too.</li>
    <li> I wish it was as pretty as it is in the picture but it&#x27;s okay. Looks nice with a beanie on.</li>
    <li> Sorry, if possible, I would give this 0 stars :( When I first got it, I carefully pulled it out of the bag it was in. from the roots to about an inch under the chin looks beautiful, silky, and above all-real. But below is a hot mess, it is a bunch of knots that terribly stick out. its not like regular, its like Barbie doll hair, in the knot category anyway, if you brush it out, it looks worse, if you don&#x27;t mess with it, still looks bad, and very annoying because if you try to push your hair back, you push back a BIG knot, not individual hair, NOTHING like real hair. than there are the long bangs, the bangs gave away the little realness it contained. it gets in my face every time. and it is not HALF as curly as it looks. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I must say, this product is awesome! It shipped fast and was a great price. The wig is really long, about 24-26 inches; it is soft and adjustable (it comes with a center part but I adjusted mine to be a bit more on the side). It is more of a warm caramel color, my friends and husband all loved it. I honestly couldn&#x27;t say anything negative about it... Highly suggest!</li>
    <li> Not ombre like photo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for what you pay.&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;The color is much blonder than specified, I wouldn&#x27;t even label it as brown, it&#x27;s sort of honey colored.&lt;br /&gt;It sheds pretty bad, but not as bad as some other cheap wigs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very shiny and even the regular shine removal treatments aren&#x27;t taking the plastic look out of it.&lt;br /&gt;The curls fall immediately after taking it out of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is smaller than most.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thinner than you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are cut wrong, basically the bangs are what give it away as a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;It was very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It has a fake scalp where the part starts (would be better if it went all the way to the hairline but then again this wig is so inexpensive.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not wear this every day, but it would make a good cosplay wig.</li>
    <li> next time dont put the description on the outside package i dont want my family to know what i order from amazon..but the wig is good perfect..</li>
    <li> I was incredibly disappointed with this wig when I put it on and noticed that the mesh netting under the hair shows in the back. At first I was really happy because the front was cute and the color was gorgeous but then I felt lumps of the mesh sticking out in the back. I have tried to make it not show but its just something about how its made. There isn&#x27;t enough hair in that section and some of the hair is going the wrong way. I have asked a couple people for their opinions and they say it is really noticeable so unfortunately the wig is completely unwearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy a lot of wigs and this is the only wig I have ever had this problem with. Maybe just mine was defective but buy it at your own risk because they wouldn&#x27;t let me return or exchange it.</li>
    <li> it looks fantastic, but it sheds horrifically, too bad cause it really does look great. the shedding problem can be hazardous as if enough of this fiber falls on the floor, if you dont sweep the carpet first, it will plug up your vacuum cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;too bad cause it really does look nice</li>
    <li> Will serve my daughters purpose just fine.</li>
    <li> Where do I begin?&lt;br /&gt;The cap is too tight.&lt;br /&gt;The hair is not good quality AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;I know its cheap but I&#x27;ve gotten wigs that are a million times better from the same company for the same or lesser price.&lt;br /&gt;I had trouble actually getting the wig and would honestly love a refund.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture. It&#x27;s bright orange-copper.&lt;br /&gt;Just skip it, It&#x27;s my first BAD wig EVER.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got bangs cut in. Not even good bangs. My 5 year old could cut better bangs.</li>
    <li> I noticed that this product had spots that was missing some hair and it shed a lot of hair when I tried it on.  I just wanted to send it back, but they wanted me to take pictures and send it to  them.  I would not buy from this company again and if I were you, I would save my money and time and buy some where else.  It&#x27;s a hassle to get a refund/return.  Don&#x27;t buy from them!!!</li>
    <li> hair looks good and looks real for being fake hair but it was a bit thin for my liking - still nice</li>
    <li> The product arrived timely, packaged well with no bad smells. It has a reddish look to it (unexpected), which I&#x27;m okay with because I&#x27;ve had so many people tell me I&#x27;d look great as a red head, I&#x27;ve been tempted with permant color to find out &amp; am glad I didn&#x27;t as I disagree that I look good as a red head. The wig is of good quality &amp; I intend to give it to a relative who can pull it off.</li>
    <li> it looks nice all I had to do was fluffy it a bit and it looks wonderful, very much like the picture. im happy.</li>
    <li> First, let me say if you are looking for a quality wig then go spend $100 or more on a human hair wig. That said, this wig is very real looking and feeling. The fiber shines like real hair and has a nice bounce to it too. I don&#x27;t think a person would be disappointed at all, more surprised at how good this wig is for the price. I don&#x27;t know how well it will stand over time to being brushed out, but straight out of the &#x27;bag&#x27; this is a keeper. The color is a little more brassy, with more red undertones to it than shown, not the blondish ends as the photo has, but still in the brown range. I would have bought two if I had known. Delivery is a little slow so keep that in mind when ordering and when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE(10/13)&amp; OPINION: Let me direct this to all these negative people out there who can&#x27;t write a real review. So many grips about this wig and similar from same company. Are these people this negative about everything or do they just want a $100-$400 human-hair wig and expect to pay only $15.00 total, delivery too and when it isn&#x27;t the $100-$400 wig they want it is gripe, gripe, gripe. The reviews are either \\&quot;great wig for the price\\&quot; or \\&quot;terrible, don&#x27;t waste your money.\\&quot; I think that is why, too high of expectation and not enough willingness to pay top dollar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this wig has held up well since purchase and I highly recommend it again if you are not looking to pay nothing for something really high priced. Go get the high-priced 100% human hair item if that is what you want, but don&#x27;t gripe when this isn&#x27;t that item.</li>
    <li> Good quality wig. It had a nice soft feel &amp; smooth flow.  It was very pretty &amp; held up nicely.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 wigs so they will last longer, instead of wearing the sane wig everyday. They arrived on date estimated along with a pair of socks, wig cap for each one and a bonus braided headband in the exact color of the wigs. I absolutely love the style and color. They are the same color my hair used to be ( I have no hair from my thyroid and other medical conditions) and I can&#x27;t wait to start wearing them. They look and feel like my real hair.&lt;br /&gt;After wearing the wigs for awhile, the part does not look natural at all, and pulling the hair back exposes the cap. It looks great at first but cheap after awhile. Kind of disappointed.All I can say is do not buy SKIN TOP wigs, they look fake.</li>
    <li> This wig is gorgeous does not have the blond highlights that are in the picture. Looks natural &amp; is very pretty! Great price too!!</li>
    <li> could wear it out my house once. Was vary fake and messy. uncomfortable to wear. All in all just a bad product.</li>
    <li> First off, I love the color of the wig and it&#x27;s easy to put on. Plus, it comes with a wig cap, so thank you to the seller. I didn&#x27;t expect that when I purchase this product. I like the length of it, it&#x27;s perfect and it looks real on top of that. My only concern is the parting on this wig. It looks a bit fake and the this wig doesn&#x27;t have bangs but I&#x27;m having a hard time parting the hair in the middle and keeping it into place. I would have to use hair pins to part it to the sides. Looking at the model for this product. It&#x27;s very misguiding but not in a bad way... They probably style the wig prior to putting it on her head but there has to be an easy way to style this wig to make it look more natural. I would like some suggestions from the seller or anyone that has purchase this product before. I would greatly appreciate it. Again, thank you to the seller.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my mom and I just to play around. This is super cute and after a few light brushes to get the loose hairs out and a bit of a style. There is no bad seam you can see and the only part of the &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; you see is flesh toned. Feels real and super soft. No body can tell it is faux hair.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the hair to part, the wig completely covered my face no matter how I tried to style it, SO I cut some bangs into the wig and now it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...hint: you should always get a wig trimmed by a cutter you trust, to shape it to your face and head!</li>
    <li> It Looks &amp;&amp; Feels completely fake, Its Really Shiny, &amp; Tangles easily ! I do not like this company one bit</li>
    <li> it doesnt look anything like the pic it sucks and i wish i never bought it i want my money back</li>
    <li> Used this for a stage production and the wig held up very well to multiple uses and changes each performance.  Brushed out nicely and didn&#x27;t have that fake hair look.</li>
    <li> i suffer from alopecia n got this wig to see if i liked it. not really every time i try to touch it up hair falls from this easily too. not worth money. not recommended..</li>
    <li> Other than the bangs it&#x27;s a beautiful wig! It&#x27;s thick, the colour is pretty accurate! It seems to be holding up pretty well. So yeah I love it!</li>
    <li> my own hair keeps falling out due to a medical problem&lt;br /&gt;and some of my meds.i thought the wig was really pretty&lt;br /&gt;an looked easy to take care off but I was in for a big surprise&lt;br /&gt;when the wig came it was so tangle up I tried brushing&lt;br /&gt;with a wig brush it was falling out.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy again waste of money</li>
    <li> It has good waves, the back is beautiful. The front is a bit much in my face, I am going to play with it more.</li>
    <li> The model here looks awesome! But I wished the wig itself looked more like the actual one the model is wearing. I had a hard time getting the wig to look nice. It took more time then fixing my own hair.</li>
    <li> I will not buy anymore from them period because they did not send what the pictures states does not look professional or even workable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy at all</li>
    <li> It arrived 9 days ahead of the first scheduled delivery date :) the color is excellent, a blend versus one flat tone.  Marvelous bouncy layers.  I am quite pleased.  And I look stunning.  (An old friend said that.)</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am broke, it had great reviews, and honestly sometimes I wish I had long hair and not a pixie cut.  I am so glad I did!  It&#x27;s really long, beautifully wavy (not curly, I have naturally curly hair and this is much less dramatic!), holds styles beautifully, and honestly looks really real!&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that yeah, it&#x27;s a little shiny, but it&#x27;s more of a natural shine than a greasy wig shine.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this wig nuff said</li>
    <li> What I got is not what was described.  The description says light brown but I got a black wig.  I would like to get what was advertised.</li>
    <li> This wig is awesome! Very well made, looks like the real thing!! I purchased it to wear for a 70&#x27;s party &amp; it was a huge success. Everyone had to try it. Very comfortable to wear for long periods too.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and I got more than I payed for! The wig was a bit more red than the picture showed but it still looked beautiful. I had no problem making it look real. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feeling about this wig. It is very easy to care for, but I ended up having to cut the bangs because they were too long. It also looks a bit strange because there is no volume to the hair. But overall this is a fun wig that is easy to care for.</li>
    <li> The wig arrived secured, tangle free amazing color and the feel of the hair is just incredible. Its extremely soft, the bouncynes  of the curls is really nice i brushed them out but they didnt loose the original shape. I was able to flat iron it and recurl a section just as a test. its not shiny as in oily but more as in well conditioned hair. Im extremely pleased and will be ordering from them some more.</li>
    <li> Do Not Buy wigs from China...all cheap and not worth the stress or wait. So unhappy with all these products coming in from china .</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected. It looks nothing like the picture.  I ended up giving this wig to my 5 year old so she can play dress up with. I will not buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in this wig. It seems like somebody just took some weave and just put it together. I doesn&#x27;t fit like a wig should. Oh! I received the wrong color the pictures definitely don&#x27;t do the wig any justice. Shipping was long but that is to be excepting with out of country shipping but save your money.</li>
    <li> i orden this wig is not the same  we see here in the picture i will set back  bad cuality</li>
    <li> Received wig today, hair is already falling out, hair falls out with just touching it. Plus it looks super fake . Looks like something you would wear to a costume party . The wig looks nothing like the picture .</li>
    <li> Great wig for a very low price. I used it for a costume, and it was WAY better quality than what you find in costume shops. And it was cheap. But order early, it takes a long time to ship.</li>
    <li> Does not look like in the pic and it comes apart easy and tangels fast wish u did not get it</li>
    <li> I liked the style and ordered from the company two more times, but the clasp are weak and way too much shedding.</li>
    <li> The wig is nice but it  very shiny and its noticable that its a wig , alot of tangling ,shedding is narmal like any other sythetic wigs . I had to do alott of styling to frame my face .</li>
    <li> It shreds bad it gets very tangled would not recommend this wig for anyone I&#x27;m wish it could be replaced for a better one i feel very ripped off by this wig do not buy this wig but it was really soft</li>
    <li> Terrible and if u ask for another one they won&#x27;t even give it to u!</li>
    <li> Over a year ago I brought one and have been addicted to.the wigs by this merchant. They are worn daily and lost at least four months.</li>
    <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t look like the picture [I expected that] and it was hard to part. Other than that, it fit well and the hair didn&#x27;t feel like straw. It was really soft and decent quality, especially for the price. It was a lot thinner than expected as well, but it still looked nice.</li>
    <li> I like the thickness but it for sure needs to have bangs cut into them. And it doesn&#x27;t look like the picture colorwise.</li>
    <li> Thin, and Brown/red. Dont waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Complete different to the picture, , bad quality</li>
    <li> Just got it yesterday, and im totally in love its great! soft, shiny, long and it looks really great. I just throw a beanie on with it and no one can tell!</li>
    <li> Received this wig yesterday.  Right out of the package it looks great.  Love that you can adjust it to fit.  I plan on using this for Halloween this year, but it&#x27;s one that I will definitely reuse.  Quality is great.  Unlike another wig I bought, there is no visible cap &amp; looks almost like real hair.  Came with a wig cap &amp; a cute pair of socks.  I will definitely buy from this seller again come the opportunity.</li>
    <li> The hair is lovely - not the cheap tangled stuff of costume wigs. The bangs, however, are pretty weird. I bought this for a costume and will have to try to work with the bangs. They&#x27;re so thick and heavy and don&#x27;t look as nice and tame as in the photo. But I&#x27;ll figure something out.</li>
    <li> The hair on the front is not cut into bangs, it&#x27;s the same length as the rest of the wig and will need to be cut before wearing it, but after doing that it makes for a lovely wig. One other complaint was that the inside of it, the part touching your wig cap, is very small and if you have an even slightly larger-than-average head, it might give you headaches after a few hours.</li>
    <li> When i opened the package i immediately thought...doll hair :/ a complete let down. Don&#x27;t waste your money invest in a better high quality wig.</li>
