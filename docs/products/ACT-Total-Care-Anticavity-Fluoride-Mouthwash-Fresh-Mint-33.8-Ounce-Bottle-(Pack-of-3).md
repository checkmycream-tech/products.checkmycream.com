      <li>Love how it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth.  </li>
      <li>It is so much better than using products that burn your mouth.  </li>
      <li>like before I get on the computer. :)</li>
      <li>I just tried it again to be sure before writing this, and</li>
      <li>I prefer more of a mouthwash type &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; and this doesn&#x27;t sting at all to me.</li>
      <li>This was recommended to me by dentist as having the most over the counter fluoride.</li>
      <li>I have since fell in love with this product and recommended it to many of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Read about keeping teeth healthy in &amp;</li>

      <li>Except that you are basically paying more for water.</li>
      <li>A 3 pack HAD to be a good deal right?</li>
      <li>It has a great taste and leaves my teeth feeling clean, health, and fresh.</li>
      <li>exactly as described!!!</li>
      <li>We solved this by having our own bottles instead of sharing so that we could sip from the full container at the start.  </li>
      <li>The best mouthwash as it is alcohol-free which is a must for people with a dry mouth.</li>
      <li>It is not as strong as some mouth washes but my teeth and mouth feel much better after using this product.</li>
      <li>Nice mild minty flavor&lt;</li>
      <li>Good stuff, no extreme burn, a good flavor, and it does help protect your teeth which is important.</li>
      <li>those who fear the ubiquitous mouth-burn of popular mouthwash brands, you have nothing to fear here: this is as easy to use as rinsing with plain water, but much more delightful if you have a taste for &amp;</li>
      <li>It has a great flavor, doesn&#x27;t burn the heck out of one&#x27;s sensitive mouth tissues but still does the job, and with the price on Amazon, it&#x27;s a no-brainer!</li>
      <li>what so ever which makes it very easy to swish around in your mouth for one full minute.</li>

      <li>HUGE quantity.</li>
      <li>It is important to use a product like this to reach areas you couldn&#x27;t reach with a toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing better than having fresh breathe</li>
      <li>Kids enjoy it.</li>
      <li>ADA has a Cochrane database that provides detailed studies about the effects of fluoride mouthwashes.  </li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
      <li>Teeth and gums are so far doing good with the add on of this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product which leaves my mouth/breath freshened and my teeth with a slick, super-clean feel.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the same product you could get anywhere at a very good price.  This product is eligible for subscribe and save making it easy too.  Like a breath of fresh air.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to use this mouthwash. It smells good. I guess it does its job well insidet the mouth.</li>
    <li> I am not a mouthwash person but had to give this a try because my teeth needed some help -- namely fluoride.  I was a kid in the 50s when the great debate about fluoride was raging and my parents decided against it.  My teeth tell the tale - bridge, implants, crowns.  So in an attempt to save the rest and on the advice of my dentist - Act Total.  And I like it.</li>
    <li> Great mouth wash for reducing plaque.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Doesn&#x27;t burn and feels fresh.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviewers comments that the flouride is half the amount in this 33oz bottle compared to the 18oz bottle.  So of course me and google were off to investigate this shortage of flouride and found the comments below on the ACT company page [...]  This should clear up things for those who might want to but this product.  As for the product itself I brush twice daily so it works for me.  In terms of price, especially with my luck, you will find that everything somehow is cheaper after you buy it even if you shop around.      &#x27;For ultimate flexibility and convenience, ACT Restoring Anticavity Mouthwash is available in both 18oz and 33oz bottles. The 18oz bottle is formulated for once-a-day usage, while the 33oz bottle should be used twice daily. So, no matter how you choose to include ACT in your daily routine, there&#x27;s an ACT Restoring Anticavity Mouthwash that&#x27;s right for you.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I thought that I made sure that this ACT product contained .05% flouride.  It is plainly stated under \\&quot;Product Description\\&quot; that is does have .05% flouride.  Upon receipt of my ACT I read the flouride content as stated on the bottle and it says .02% (60% less than described by Amazon).  I am very disappointed since I believed the Amazon Product Description and now I have a large supply of an inferior product (my dentist recommended the .05% product not the .02% product).</li>
    <li> Product was well packaged and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> stopped using because it is full of scary ingredients like propylene glycol - this is used in antifreeze. I don&#x27;t need this in my kids&#x27; mouth.</li>
    <li> This stuff has some of the highest amount of fluoride of any mouthwash on the market.  My wife had no cavities until birthing a first child which used up much of her bodies calcium.  Regularly using this ACT helped prevent any cavities on the second child.  Works great and is not too strong taste wise.  Also no alcohol helps prevent drying out mouth.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. A bit pricey for this brand, but it is at every store. Worth the additional money for your teeth.</li>
    <li> The product is fine really. Except that you are basically paying more for water. The original (smaller) ACT has more flouride content than this. The rest of it is just water. No there&#x27;s nothing else special about this. Both restore your teeth the same way. Both are good for your teeth, breath, etc.&lt;br /&gt;So what about the price? I was stupid. A 3 pack HAD to be a good deal right? Not really. Breaking down to $8 per bottle is actually more expensive than you would pay in the store. But oh well, I won&#x27;t make the same mistake again.</li>
    <li> Great service and price</li>
    <li> We aware that this is not the standard Act mouthwash at 0.05% sodium fluoride that my dentist recommended. Instead this is a half-strength version. To be fair the percentage was listed in the fine print but I had no idea there were multiple strengths and didn&#x27;t know to look for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally the bottle is huge, unwieldy, and made of very flimsy plastic that buckles in your hand when you try to pour it. It&#x27;s like the new plastic water bottles which tout how they&#x27;re saving the earth by using less plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m all for saving the earth but when you&#x27;re holding a 33 oz bottle of liquid it needs enough structure not to collapse in on itself.</li>
    <li> If you check the product labels, ACT flouride doesn&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;ADA seal of approval&amp;#34; labels on the bottle, rather they use a label &amp;#34;#1 Dentist Recommended&amp;#34; etc. instead.  ADA has a Cochrane database that provides detailed studies about the effects of fluoride mouthwashes.  While this ACT product has no labels about ADA approval, the ADA database states both the ACT 0.05% once daily and 0.02% twice daily rinses are ADA approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, there are copies of this mouthwash that are also ADA approved, and can be reviewed in the the ADA database, see link in the comments.  The Walmart branded Equate mouth wash, for example, is ADA approved, uses the ADA labels on its bottles, and cost under half the price of ACT.  Other generic brands maybe similarly competitive.</li>
    <li> I like using this product. It doesn&#x27;t burn like other products (this rinse wash does not have alcohol in it). It leaves your breath fresh.   What I didn&#x27;t realize was that the 33.8oz bottle contains much less fluoride. I found this on their website:  \\&quot;All ACT products in an 18oz or smaller bottle, contain 0.05% sodium fluoride, which is equivalent to 0.02% of the fluoride ion. Our 33oz bottles contain 0.02% sodium fluoride, which is equivalent to 0.009% of the fluoride ion.\\&quot;   I feel a bit scammed here since this means I bought less fluoride and more water.... and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mouthwash out there and also gives you the fluoride needed to prevent cavities. I like buying it in bulk like this bc it can be very expensive at the grocery stores even for smaller bottles. Brush twice daily, floss daily and use this mouthwash and you&#x27;ll never get cavities.</li>
    <li> I really like this product; however, I wish it had a higher fluoride content. It is, though very refreshing and does not sting the inside of my mouth, as some other products.</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash as it is alcohol-free which is a must for people with a dry mouth. My husband tried it and gave up his 30 year Listerine habit.</li>
    <li> The best parts of this are the price for a three pack and its alcohol free.</li>
    <li> Satisfied better offer than local</li>
    <li> Does the job as advertised!!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that i use a mouthwash with Fluoride ,so i searched the stores and online and this was the only one that had it as a ingredient.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product which leaves my mouth/breath freshened and my teeth with a slick, super-clean feel. I can&#x27;t go to sleep without using it.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery thanks</li>
    <li> I returned this item in favor of listerine antiseptic mouthwash. ACT is better for cavity prevention, but Listerine is better for people more at risk for gum disease than cavities.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash.  Just don&#x27;t forget to brush , floss etc. otherwise this is just throwing your money away.  It is so much better than using products that burn your mouth.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I will only use alcohol-free mouthwash and, believe it or not, that is very hard to find.  This ACT fits the bill, but it can be hard to find... Amazon subscribe-and-save to the rescue.  I don&#x27;t have to remember to order it and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> It is not as strong as some mouth washes but my teeth and mouth feel much better after using this product. I wish it came in cinnamon flavor</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t have to buy this product again for a while; this is a lot of mouthwash folks!</li>
    <li> Although I have great oral hygiene &amp; good bacteria keeping the cavities away, my dentist recommended this fluoride rinse and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now. It has a great flavor, doesn&#x27;t burn the heck out of one&#x27;s sensitive mouth tissues but still does the job, and with the price on Amazon, it&#x27;s a no-brainer! I&#x27;d recommend buying one of the smaller bottles at Target or wherever, though, and use this size as a refill, as it&#x27;s a large bottle to find room for in a medicine cabinet or counter. Great price for delivery right to my door!</li>
    <li> It works. This is going to be one of those annoying fill in the required amount of space reviews. Bah.</li>
    <li> Really helps our teeth.  Keeps the tartar down.  Keeps the gums healthier.  My teeth feel stronger.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with gingivitis since we started using this.  My husband and I have been using this for 3-4 years now.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using ACT for years (per my dentist&#x27;s recommendation) and don&#x27;t plan on changing brands anytime soon. The combination of fluoride content, taste, effectiveness, and price is unparalleled (in my opinion) and I have yet to find a brand that can beat ACT. I use it daily before leaving work and it quickly gets rid of morning breath for most of the day. I occasionally use it before bed but don&#x27;t do it religiously. This is the only item that I have subscribed to on Amazon and will continue to do so. The price offered on Amazon blows the store price out of the water and I have plenty of cabinet space in the bathroom so ordering in bulk isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> This helps with my hot/cold sensitivity more than any of the other mouth washes.  There is no burning sensation and no after taste.</li>
    <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
    <li> This is so much better than other mouthwashes out there. It has a nice taste and doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth!</li>
    <li> I have always used alcohol based mouthwashes in the past, which gave you that burning sensation after a few seconds. If that&#x27;s what you like with the risk of cancer in years down the road, then continue to use them. Surprisingly, ACT has no alcohol and feels even fresher!</li>
    <li> i have been using it for years. not sure if it has slowed down the&lt;br /&gt;decay process but certainly can&#x27;t hurt and taste good.</li>
    <li> great flavor and not as stingy as others. It has good concentration of flouride and other things that kill bacteria, best pack to save money.</li>
    <li> Love that this is available in the Subscribe &amp; Save program ~ Good flavor of mint ~ Read about keeping teeth healthy in &amp;#34;Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye&amp;#34; &amp; have been using to rinse my teeth after using Listerine ~ Definitely feel an improvement in the cleanliness of my teeth ~ Everyone in my family uses it now</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for 8 years and since then haven&#x27;t have any cavity. My dentist recommended me to combine using Braun-OralB electric teeth brush though.</li>
    <li> Love how it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth.  Also has a nice scent and taste of peppermint.  omg four more words :P</li>
    <li> This helps big time get rid of that coffee after taste!</li>
    <li> Great value, tastes good, clean mouth - good dental checkups.</li>
    <li> Deceptive… ACT total care 33.8 ounce bottles contain 60% less sodium fluoride than the 18 ounce bottle. And as stated by another reviewer the 33.8 ounce size is not ADA approved like the 18 ounce size is. I feel it was misrepresented and I am now going to have to buy the 18 ounce bottles to achieve the cavity protection I thought I was getting.</li>
    <li> Mild mint, not overpowering. Kids enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Good for a 2-3x daily mouth wash but &amp;#60;1/2 the Fluoride strength of the 18oz  bottle. Will not purchase the 33oz size again.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash! It was recommended to me by a friend a few years ago. It goes to WORK on cavities BIG TIME! It almost feels as if as long as your tooth is roughly 75% intact, it will bring it back to 99% within a few months with regular rinsing and, well, less sweets. I don&#x27;t REALLY know the ratio, but it has significantly reduced, if not eliminated, many of my toothaches with regular use. I will confirm with the dentist the next time around on actual cavity count. Before I used this product, I had more cavities than teeth last I checked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who fear the ubiquitous mouth-burn of popular mouthwash brands, you have nothing to fear here: this is as easy to use as rinsing with plain water, but much more delightful if you have a taste for &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.  Nice to get it through Prime.  Less costly and easier than lugging bottles from store.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist, so I got it. Even though I brush three times daily and use a water pik, he stated this will add another level of warding off cavities, since not just food particles are the only contributors to tooth decay.</li>
    <li> Trying to heal our teeth like Dr. Ellie Phillips says in her book, Kiss your Dentist Goodbye. So far, we all love the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is the &#x27;mouthwash&#x27; vs the more flouride-concentrated rinse.  However, review of research re. flouride benefits/risks and corporate interests and influence, we are content with the concentration and cost, let alone convenience.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash. Best flavor on the market. I&#x27;m glad I found this online.</li>
    <li> trip to dentist will determine if i buy it again. i had a couple of soft spots last time.</li>
    <li> My teens use this ever since it was recommended by their dentist.</li>
    <li> taste like it&#x27;s watered down</li>
    <li> I started using Act Total Care several months ago at the recommendation of my dentist. So far it seems to be helping - I have less tooth sensitivity than before when I was using only a sensitive formula toothpaste. Adding Act to the mix has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands that offer similar benefits (such as Crest and Listerine) but much prefer the Act since I can get it in an alcohol free formula. It does not burn my mouth as others do, but still leaves it feeling fresh and clean. The mint taste is not too pronounced, but enough that it leaves a pleasant taste after use. Not having it burn my mouth is a big deal since you have to swish this in your mouth for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in the 18 oz bottle and the 33 ounce bottle. The 18 ounce is formulated to be used once a day. It has double the fluoride as the 33 ounce, which is to be used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no deception on the part of Act as to the different formulations. Some people prefer to use it once a day since it&#x27;s ideal to use this before going to bed (you&#x27;re not supposed to eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes after use for maximum benefits). On the other hand, the twice-a-day formulation is better for improving your breath since you&#x27;re killing germs twice as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of which formulation you select, this is a great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
    <li> On the advice of my dentist, I purchased this for our household.  While it seems to work fine and my 11 year old son willingly yses it, it is a little on the sweet side for me.  I prefer more of a mouthwash type &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; and this doesn&#x27;t sting at all to me.</li>
    <li> Another product that I would not be without!  There&#x27;s nothing better than having fresh breathe and I don&#x27;t feel toothpaste does all the work.</li>
    <li> As described, works good!</li>
    <li> i like this stuff why i don&#x27;t know. plus the price was good at the time 15.00 for 3 shipped.no store could beat that i checked.</li>
    <li> The product meets my needs but the bottle is too large for easy handling.  I prefer the smaller size bottle with a dosage reservoir for easy use and handling.</li>
    <li> A very good non-alcoholic mouthwash.  My dentist recommended this.  The three-pack is the way to go.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in two days with the subscribe and save and it has exceeded expectations. It has a great taste and leaves my teeth feeling clean, health, and fresh. I will definitely re-order this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the few mouthwashes out there that still has fluoride in it. It does what your dentist wants for your teeth in between visits</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, I like the non-alcohol version (a good Washington State Red Blend Wine is better for drinking purposes!) , and have not been able to find it anywhere in town or nearby.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I had a tooth that hurt when I chewed on that side.  I used this and it went away after 3 days for now.  I keep using it twice a day now.  I should probably see a dentist, but the pain stopped and I can chew on that side again.  I hate the dentist.  This stuff does something.  Also freshens breath so that it a plus.</li>
    <li> + Much less harsh than alcohol based mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;+ Good price/quantity&lt;br /&gt;+ Seems to be working&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to update this after my next dentist checkup, but this seems to do everything I&#x27;d want. This was recommended to me by dentist as having the most over the counter fluoride.</li>
    <li> no harsh flavor-mild mint w fluoride to help w gum disease, cavity prevention, etc--dentist recommended for my wife whose gum separation from the lower portion of her teeth is causing tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Does a great job keeping your mouth clean.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended this and we use it twice a day.  My only problem with it is that when the bottle is full it can easily squirt out of the top.  We solved this by having our own bottles instead of sharing so that we could sip from the full container at the start.  Rinse out the cap after using it so that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess on the counter.  I was never a fan of mouthwash but the taste of this is mild and so there&#x27;s no harshness.  We&#x27;re using it for the fluoride but sometimes I might use it to rinse my mouth before going out somewhere so must be making my breath feel fresh too.</li>
    <li> Tastes good and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> It is important to use a product like this to reach areas you couldn&#x27;t reach with a toothbrush.  If you think about it, you could be scratching your teeth when you brush.  By using a product such as Act, you have a better chance to loosen microscopic debris.  Yuck, I know.  But true.  It&#x27;s a product you use before brushing.</li>
    <li> A fine tasting mouth wash .. complete with fluoride treatment.  My dentist recommended it and it seems to work!  Sure beats the smell of Listerine in my book!</li>
    <li> The husband and I were pretty strict Listerine users for several years. I tried this on a whim, and we&#x27;re sold. The &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; is great, and I like the added benefits without the burn. I can definitely tell the difference in both of our teeth.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Mint taste is mild compared to the alcohol based mouthwashes.  My mouth feels minty all the way to the car in the morning,  I use it after my last cup of java before the drive to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves fluoride, so follow the instructions.  1 minute rinse</li>
    <li> Good value for mouthwash. It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth at all. It seems like it&#x27;s working though. Hey, at least I won&#x27;t have to buy another one for a long while.</li>
    <li> Would use nothing else!</li>
    <li> This is great; I don&#x27;t know why anyone would buy anything plus this or plus that, I think that the original is great.  Great for freshening breath, but more importantly, great for helping dry mouth (so much cheaper than the erst of the stuff out there).</li>
    <li> Act has not alcohol.  Act makes easy for a product to be used on daily basis.  Already put ACT in my cart for a new delivery.  Love Amazon for the ability to shop sitting in my armchair.</li>
    <li> It seems to do the job. Only problem is you can&#x27;t eat or drink for an hour after you use it.  Hard to remember to do it at a convenient time--like before I get on the computer. :)</li>
    <li> After I discovered research suggesting that the alcohol in Listerine can increase the risk of oral cancers, I decided to change my mouthwash to ACT. While I preferred the antiseptic quality of Listerine (I already use fluoride toothpaste), ACT does not contain any alcohol and was recommended to me by my dentist. I decided to go with the Total Care variety, as it purports to \\&quot;kill bad breath germs\\&quot;, which is something that appeals to me, even though I don&#x27;t have any serious halitosis problems. Upon trying this product I noticed immediately that something didn&#x27;t taste right and I&#x27;ll be blunt about this: it was something fecal. I just tried it again to be sure before writing this, and yep, something in this formula smells and tastes really nasty and not even the mint can cover it up. I think I&#x27;ll go back to the cancer wash...</li>
    <li> As advertised. HUGE quantity.</li>
    <li> great product. use it twice a day as directed and you follw a good brushing/flossing routine and you will be free of cavities and gum diseases. life saver.</li>
    <li> First time I used this I thought it was a bit gross to be honest. After a few more rinses with it I really like it. Better than scope, and maybe just a step under listerine</li>
    <li> Good stuff, no extreme burn, a good flavor, and it does help protect your teeth which is important. I highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of most mint dental products, but this one is very mild and I will not shudder at the thought of using it frequently.  I put this product in dispensers similar to those for soap in all bathrooms and it&#x27;s really handy to use that way.  Now if it only works as it advertises.</li>
    <li> I really like this mouthwash.  Doesn&#x27;t burn like th others that contain alcohol and has a great taste.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Act Total care was suggested from my dentist after years of not taking so much care of my teeth, way prior to this purchase, say 2009. Teeth and gums are so far doing good with the add on of this mouthwash. And most importantly, brushing your teeth daily.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn and my dentist said the &amp;#34;fluoride&amp;#34; kind is the only kind that actually fights cavities - not just bad breath. Definitely recommend. Off brand is good too though, I just selected ACT because it was available here for subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Recommend by my dentist because of the anti-cavity ingredients.  Tastes great and it seems to be working.  I just started using it about three months ago.  My next check up is in October so I will update my review then.</li>
    <li> Good price for 3 bottles of this and a good product. I just wish they had a different flavor in the three bottles. I don&#x27;t care much for mint flavor.  I like the cinnamon flavor better.</li>
    <li> This is my fave daily mouthwash, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> First, I hate mint flavored mouth wash it reminds me of the floride treatments I was forced to do in public school growing up.  It has a very youth-like mint flavor.  That said, it you don&#x27;t mind the taste this Is a great product.  My husband loves this stuff.  It has prevented cavities in our house.  I wish they would make less juvenile flavored of this wash.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash.  It has a great taste, but doesn&#x27;t burn so much as other mouthwashes.  It still has a little sting to it, but it&#x27;s a lot easier to get through that 60 seconds.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by my dentist. I have since fell in love with this product and recommended it to many of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not dry up the mouth like Crest, nor does it cause sensitivity like some of other alcohol-based mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Get it on subscribe and save and what an excellent value! My dentist highly recommends all her patients swish for 1 minute in the AM and PM with this.</li>
    <li> I bought this mouthwash at the recommend of my dentist. This mouthwash has a very slight minty flavor to it- unlike most of the other minty mouthwashes on the market. There is absolutely no burn what so ever which makes it very easy to swish around in your mouth for one full minute. This particular mouthwash contains fluoride which helps my sensitive teeth tremendously (I use in conjunction with Sensodyne toothpaste). I would highly recommend this mouthwash as it leaves your mouth fresh, clean and protected by fluoride. A bonus: since there is no burn, I would imagine a child could use, although I would check to see if they have a bottle specifically for children. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. No burn from alcohol!&lt;br /&gt;2. Contains fluoride which helps protect sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;3. Nice mild minty flavor&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. None!</li>
    <li> I like this ACT the best - it doesn&#x27;t dry your mouth out like the icy mint - taste is refreshing - you can leave spearmint in your mouth longer so that your teeth absorb the maximum amount of the anti cavity effect.  This product along with flossing twice daily has given me 8 years without one cavity.</li>
    <li> I noticed that you will not get the sensitive tooth with this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the other mouthwashes and had sensitive tooth because I used them.</li>
    <li> Use it daily along with Listerine. I never have cavities</li>
    <li> This a good, mild mouthwash.  The packaging is a little sub-par, as the bottles has no good gripping points and slide out your hands easily, so hold it underneath.</li>
    <li> I love never running out of my favorite mouthwash! and I get to save money with &amp;#34;save and subscribe&amp;#34;! Bonus!</li>
