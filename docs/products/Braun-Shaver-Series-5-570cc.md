      <li>Great shaving machine, not bad</li>
      <li>I think the razor looks great, however, the most important thing is to get a close shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Pulsonic and, on my face, the Series 5 does as good of a job in most spots, and a wee bit better on the neck.</li>
      <li>and I have to say that it&#x27;s by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.    </li>
      <li>Right out of the box I got a great shave.  </li>
      <li>In a word, it&#x27;s perfect - no other cleaning system comes close.</li>
      <li>The shave is very smooth with no irritation at all.  </li>
      <li>The razor is very light</li>
      <li>I liked this product, it fealt easy to use, it never pinched, and all in all</li>
      <li>Safe for the razor - the tip is in the user&#x27;s manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But at about $6 for a one month supply, this works out to more than I would spend on blades.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update 2: Been over a year now, still love it.</li>
      <li>and I am glad this is NOT one of them because this design works much better.</li>
      <li>I will update this post with more information after I have owned this shaver for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you want to start a cleaning cycle, make sure you have a cleaning cartridge installed, then just press the \\&quot;clean\\</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t like having to spend more time.</li>
      <li>I have very coarse hair, thus a razor would be best.</li>
      <li>He seems to love it, so</li>
      <li>shaver feels solid in your hand and results in a good to great shave.</li>
      <li>Cannot ask for a better shaver.</li>
      <li>While I like the shave from the Series 5 (more so than the shave from the Pulsonic), I have to say that I prefer the shave from the Norelco Arcitec</li>
      <li>Maybe the Series 7 would be better, but I have no way to compare.</li>
      <li>I like the shave from the Series 5 (more so than the shave from the Pulsonic)</li>
      <li>but I always wished the grip was better.</li>
      <li>, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It is an outstanding electic razor.</li>
      <li>It works better than the 3 head shaver I used for many years.</li>
      <li>Been over a year now, still love it.</li>
      <li>B001P5HCKU Braun Shaver Series 5 570cc]]I am fairly satisfied with this shaver.</li>
      <li>Better than the 7526.  </li>
      <li>I was told if I was anything but 100% satisfied with the razor that I may return it.     </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly in original packaging and is the best shaver Ive used so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a worthy improvement over the very good Smart Foil found on earier models like this 570CC.</li>
      <li>If you can score a great deal on the older Series 5 versions, it is still recommended.</li>
      <li>then this is pretty good.</li>
      <li>He loves it and is able to get a clean shave very quickly!</li>
      <li>I comes with a nice travel case, though not as quick or convenient as cap.</li>
      <li>I like that it is very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>As far as performance, I am truly happy about my purchase.</li>
      <li>Good merchandise, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re easy to hold, have quick-charging Lithium-Ion batteries, and work well.</li>
      <li>The sideburn trimmer is seperate from the foil and easy to deploy and use.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit strong smelling, but it adds a bit of glide for the shaver when shaving.</li>
      <li>The new shape takes some getting use to, but once that happens, you are good to go.</li>
      <li>Using a bit of water and the provided brush cleans it up just fine while away from the base.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Holds a charge fine by my standards</li>
      <li>The unit worked fine for two years until the rechargeable AA batteries powering the unit died.  </li>
      <li>The shave is close and comfortable, effortless</li>
      <li>The differences are in the overall shape - Braun has done a great job with the re-design.</li>
      <li>They refused to make that part available for purchase.  </li>
      <li>, I have to say that I prefer the shave from the Norelco Arcitec - it&#x27;s a rotary shaver, but still quite comfortable, and excels at getting those pesky neck hairs.</li>
      <li>Thought I would upgrade to a Braun since they had such a great reputation.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s a rotary shaver, but still quite comfortable, and excels at getting those pesky neck hairs.</li>
      <li>I use it every day, and every day I am amazed at how smooth my face is after shaving without any irritation whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>It is a good product and you should try it for yourself, even if you have a fairly heavy beard, as I think the Braun does a superior job compared to Norelco.  </li>
      <li>Found it did not do as good a job as my old one, and returnedit to you via UPS,    </li>
      <li>The cleaning station is also very convenient for helping clean the razor and giving it a nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>far, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for over 20 years and the last one I had while still running great was looking worse for wear, it was an old 4500 series flex control shaver and all the little rubber dots on the grips had fallen apart so I was sad to get rid of it but decided to buy a new shaver. After reading many reviews online on the new shavers I settled for the 570. It has mostly all the bells and whistles as the high end 590 except for some extra lights for the charge indicator. As far as performance, I am truly happy about my purchase. I like the way it shaves, it does a great job. I really like the way the trimmer slides up the back and I use it frequently to trim my sideburns and mustache. I know Braun uses some designs where the trimmer flips out and I am glad this is NOT one of them because this design works much better. As some of the other reviews noted, I don&#x27;t wash my shaver every day and I keep the clean and renew tub closed and in my drawer until I actually need to use it. I have a fairly heavy growth and even with just a once a week cleaning the shaver so far looks great. I run it as suggested with the foil half off daily and use the little brush included to brush all the hair off daily and so far this seems to work just fine. I like the design of the handle and got used fairly quickly to the new shape of the head and handle. All in all, I am very satisfied with my Braun and though a little nostalgic about my old shaver I spent so many years with, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this shave system. I did expect a closer and cleaner shave without having to go over the tough areas several times, but that really isn&#x27;t the case. I have to go over the tough areas several times that I didn&#x27;t have to with my previous shave system. Maybe the Series 7 would be better, but I have no way to compare. The Clean and Renew system works very well and recommend it. I would consider a Braun in the future but not without more research of other shave systems.</li>
    <li> This was very good value for the price. Was exactly what I was looking for and fit perfectly Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more!!</li>
    <li> As expected, this product exceeds my expectations &amp; is a pleasure to own, this product was given as a replacement for a series 3 that kicked the bucket, wish I could&#x27;ve afforded the series 7, maybe next time!</li>
    <li> Simply put this is the best electric shaver I have ever used, I am very happy with this purchase.  This shaver even performs well without the use of a pre-shave prep product that i always needed to use with other electric shavers.  The cleaning/charging base works great!!  To save money re-cap the cleaning solution between cleanings, this will help with the natural evaporation that will take place, due to its high alcohol content.</li>
    <li> I have owned 4 different Braun Electric Razors over the years.  The Braun Series 5 570cc and its unique cutter and foil system cut as close as a blade. It is an outstanding electic razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target for about $[...] after rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am upgrading from a Braun 7526 and this shaver has definitely improved over the past few years.  The razor is very light it seems compared to the older one but feels well built.  The shave is very smooth with no irritation at all.  The sideburn trimmer is well placed, on the back of the razor and extends far enough from the razor to be very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the razor is a lot smaller or at least narrower than older models but this ends up really helping with ergonomics.  You can almost hold the razor in your fingertips, like a pen or other precision instrument, especially with it being fairly light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best improvements over the older model I had is that charging in the base is SEPARATE from cleaning.  On my 7526, if you wanted to charge in the base, you had to start a cleaning cycle.  On this model you just drop it in the base and it&#x27;ll charge.  If you want to start a cleaning cycle, make sure you have a cleaning cartridge installed, then just press the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes with a semi-hard case that fits snugly around the razor for travel.  As someone else mentioned it does not come with a plastic cap for the foil but the one from my 7526 fits just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might seem like a lot of money, but considering what cheap razors do to your face, the face that you and your wife or girlfriend will have to live with for the rest of your lives, its worth it.</li>
    <li> These new braun shavers work like CRAP compared to the older ones.  I had a Braun 7680 shaver, and thought I was trading up to a series 5 Braun.  How wrong I was.  It takes multiple slow passes over the same area of the face to cut remotely close to just one or two passes from the old one.  Also, I have no idea what Braun was thinking when it came to ergonomics, but this shaver is the WORST.  It is much harder to hold on to, and the shaver head is at a weird angle.  If this is how Braun is improving their shavers, then I will have to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried twice before to switch from a blade to an electric razor and both times, tried Braun razors. I could never quite feel that I got as close a shave with electrics, and kept coming back to blades.     I decided to try again and purchased this highly rated Braun Series 5. It is a very nice razor, well constructed, but after two weeks of shaving exclusively with it, I&#x27;m almost ready to switch back to a blade.     After about five minutes of going over my face, I notice small areas around my cheekbone, my chin and around my adams apple that just don&#x27;t feel or look neatly shaved. Five minutes is quite a bit longer than it takes me to lather up and shave with a blade, so this is certainly no time saver. Once or twice, I fired up my older model Braun shaver and removed the remaining stubble - with a shaver that is 25 years old with the original cutting block in place!    But the part that really gets me about Gillette&#x27;s acquisition of Braun&#x27;s shaver business is that they&#x27;ve built some continuing revenue stream for themselves into this razor. They want you to purchase cleaner that you put your shaver into every day. It supposedly cleans and lubricates the system for you, and does seem to make for a comfortable shave with a faint lemon fragrance. But at about $6 for a one month supply, this works out to more than I would spend on blades. Nice try Gillette, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m gonna play this game too much longer. I&#x27;m heading back to my SCHICK blades!</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for decades.  Decided to move up to this one because it was highly rated.  Found it did not do as good a job as my old one, and returnedit to you via UPS,    As a matter of information, I have in my file an email from you stating not necessary to return shaver - keep it or dispose of it !</li>
    <li> This shaver is expensive but worth every penny. My husband loves it. He said it is the closest shave from a razor.  I would highly reccommend.</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas gift. Shaves good, but the battery runs down in only 14 minutes of shave time. The manual says it should last for 45 minutes. Amazon will not take it back because of their stupid return policy. Called Braun customer service (India, of course)and all they said was to return it, at my expense for a refund to Genco/ Proctor and Gamble in Pottstone, Pennsylvania. They aren&#x27;t the same Braun they used to be. They could give less than a crap whether or not their product has disappointed a customer. Just return it and in 8 to 10 weeks, at their discretion, you may get a refund of the original purchase price, minus all the shipping charges of course. And Amazon&#x27;s stupid no return policy is not listed anywhere that I can find.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve never had great luck with electric shavers in the past, I&#x27;d much rather the convenience of one.  So when my wife asked me what I wanted for Christmas, I told her I&#x27;d like one of those fancy Braun shavers.  She got me the 570cc and I have to say that it&#x27;s by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.    In the manual it says to give your skin a couple of weeks to adjust, and that&#x27;s definitely true.  The first couple of times I used the shaver I had some razor bumps on my neck.  But after about a week and a half that stopped happening.  So if you experience something like that early on don&#x27;t be discouraged, it should go away after a few uses.    The cleaning system is nice, although I&#x27;m not as crazy about paying for the refills.  But that is a small complaint because as I said, the quality of the shave is outstanding.  Even in spots like the neck and chin which I&#x27;ve always had trouble with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for nearly 2 months now.  Before buying it, I was concerned I&#x27;d be wasting my money on yet another electric razor.  In the past, I&#x27;ve used both rotary and foil electric razors.  Never have I had one that performed as well as the Braun 5 570cc.  I use it every day, and every day I am amazed at how smooth my face is after shaving without any irritation whatsoever.  Like it was suggested here, I clean my shaver daily using just hot water.  Then once a week I use the cleaning system.  The best part of the cleaning system is indeed how fresh smelling the razor gets.  It&#x27;s like a brand new shaver each week -- and always a close shave.</li>
    <li> Braun&#x27;s Series 5 shavers are excellent electric shavers. they&#x27;re easy to hold, have quick-charging Lithium-Ion batteries, and work well. They&#x27;re all made in Germany too, not China like some less-expensive Braun models. Recently, Braun has refreshed the Series 5 offerings with new colors, and most importantly the brand&#x27;s OptiFoil. It&#x27;s a worthy improvement over the very good Smart Foil found on earier models like this 570CC. See my earlier review of the Series 5-550cc4 for more details. If you can score a great deal on the older Series 5 versions, it is still recommended. But all else equal, I&#x27;d go for the newer 550cc4 or 590cc4.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box I got a great shave.  Not as close as a razor shave but very very close.  Holds a charge fine by my standards, I went on a 3 day vacation and never even had the low charge light come on.  My only complaint is that the cleaning is a little loud but it beats manually cleaning.</li>
    <li> I am a Braun guy ever since I first started shaving.  These new ones are really nice.  Nice narrow, easy-to-grip design, close shave.  That cleaning system is really amazing, too.  Right now I am re-sealing the cleaning cartridge after each weekly cleaning, to minimize evaporation.  I wish it did this by itself, which is my only complaint.  Despite this, it&#x27;s a wonderful, well designed shaver.</li>
    <li> I was told if I was anything but 100% satisfied with the razor that I may return it.     Amazon is now refusing to take back the razor and refund my money. Beware to all who shop Amazon. In my opinion, Amazon will steal your money. In my opinion, Amazon will make false claims to you in order to make a sale. In my opinion, Amazon is not a trustworthy compamy. Beware!!!</li>
    <li> I received a Braun 360 as a gift 6 years ago, and after the two week adjustment period, it worked great.  It did not survive when I moved a couple of years ago, and, after unsuccessfully using a Norelco rotary shaver, I went back to manual shaving.  I was finding myself skipping a day in between shaves to make it through the winter, so I decided to go back to a Braun.  This razor is similar to the defunct 360 Complete, except Braun has made some improvements.  The self-cleansing station keeps the razor in top condition and it was not a huge added cost, as it seemed to be six years ago when I got my first Braun.  Also, the fact that you can rinse it under water saves SO much aggravation as compared to trying to use the lousy hand brush they always throw in.  One can make the cleaning fluid last longer by only cleaning it in the station once a week.  I am less than one week in and the adjustment period is almost complete; having the ability to shave every day is much appreciated.  I opted for this model, as opposed to the slightly newer one in black due to the huge savings.  It is a good product and you should try it for yourself, even if you have a fairly heavy beard, as I think the Braun does a superior job compared to Norelco.  But hey, if you ask two people, it seems one with prefer Braun and the other Norelco.</li>
    <li> Salvation for My Coarse Hair&lt;br /&gt;I have just purchased this product and it is great. I have been using it for about two weeks now, but I will update this review as time goes on. I was initially going to purchase the previous version, but I held off and I am happy I did. Before using the shaver, I went out and bought Lectric Shave by Williams as many other users have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with everything you need to get started. It took about 2 hours to completely charge. I have looked into an additional plastic cap for the head while in the travel case, which would run about $10, but it is not necessary. Just make sure to be careful of the head, and you are fine. I have resolved to clean the shaver 2-3 times a week, so save a bit on the cleaning solution. Using a bit of water and the provided brush cleans it up just fine while away from the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver feels solid in your hand and results in a good to great shave. I usually keep the swivel head locked or nearly locked, but I have been experimenting with it. I have very coarse hair, thus a razor would be best. However, I was not blessed with clear skin and thus shaving traditionally has been very painful. I have experienced minimal shaver burn as a result of the Lectric pre-Shave. It is a bit strong smelling, but it adds a bit of glide for the shaver when shaving. To my current experience, it does not clog pores, as it gets a bit greasy but then dries out as it is alcohol based. After I shave, I usually then wash my face with a cleanser and apply cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side burn trimmer is also great. It is at a 90 degree angle, but I have to say it is very useful and has great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am very pleased with my purchase. I will update this post with more information after I have owned this shaver for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: I really would like to give the 570cc 4.5 stars. It is not the best shave you could ever get, it takes a couple passes (both are expected with this type product), and it does not come with a protective head cap cover, only a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using the shaver for a couple of months, I can definitely say, BUY THIS PRODUCT. As expected, my skin has become used to the shaving...both with and without pre-shave. The battery still holds a charge and with using the cleaning function once a week it has been great. Walmart has the cleaning  cartridges on sale, if not Amazon has a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: Been over a year now, still love it. I use it once or twice a day and it keeps up. I usually charge it every two or three weeks when it goes in for its deep clean. I am going to buy a new foil/blades/etc. Not much else other than how happy I am with this product. It basically took a problem, resolved it, and has me good looking in the mix. Decided to test the goatee and it works great to trim it up nice and clean.

    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, he is extremely hard to please and very specific about gifts.  I knew that he liked Braun shavers and the idea of the Clean and Renew system, but he had never actually had one before.  So I did some research online and this model seemed to be a good deal for the price.  He seems to love it, so thanks Amazon :)</li>
    <li> I liked this product, it fealt easy to use, it never pinched, and all in all it did it&#x27;s job fairly well, until the batteries started to go.    I contacted the customer service department, and they told me to pound sand, and would not sell the replacement battery, here is my complaint with the FTC.  \\&quot;I purchased a Braun 8985 5 Series Razor from Amazon.  The unit worked fine for two years until the rechargeable AA batteries powering the unit died.  The AA batteries inside the unit were ordinary consumer grade AA Nimh batteries.  These were however GLUED to the unit by the manufacturer those rendering them NON-REPLACEABLE.  Ordinary consumer Batteries rendered NON-REPLACEABLE by deliberate action of the manufacturer.  I contacted \\&quot;Braun\\&quot;, a brand name operated by Proctor and Gamble. Where I requested the to purchase a replacement part for the unit the batteries were glued to.  They refused to make that part available for purchase.  They referred me to a Braun service center where I could pay for diagnostic, and they would not necessarily be able to replace the battery, that was not guaranteed.  This whole process seemed to me to be deliberately designed to wear me down and encourage wasting the existing unit and purchase a new unit.    It struck me as very shady that a company would deliberately render an easily consumer replaceable AA battery non-replaceable by gluing it to a circuit board, and then not even offering a replacement part.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001P5HCKU Braun Shaver Series 5 570cc]]I am fairly satisfied with this shaver. It took some time to get used to it, even though I have been using Brown shaver for the past 30 years. The \\&quot;architecture\\&quot; of the cutting blades and foil are quite different and I am not sure that this is an improvement over the older models.</li>
    <li> I have never used electric shavers before. The first time I ever tried one I remember it pulling more than cutting so it was a painful experience. I decided to see if things had changed more than 20 years later!  I purchased the BRAUN and I was pleasantly surprised. It works very well considering my beard is pretty \\&quot;stiff\\&quot;. It provides a smooth shave as long as my beard is very short. If I let it go for 2-3 days it is uncomfortable and a bit painful as the pulling occurs. Once I&#x27;m done shaving I do feel I need to \\&quot;retouch\\&quot; especially around the neck with another machine as there are some small hairs still poking out!  I like that it is very easy to clean. Even if you run out of the cleaning solution all you need to do is just rinse it under a bit of water and you&#x27;re good to go. It holds the charge for a long time.  For a quick shave of a short beard (if your hair is like mine) then this is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Braun shavers over the years, I usually just went with the entry level models to save money; and as result I hated shaving with a passion because it hurt so much.  The entry level shavers would pull the hair so much, that my skill would crawl at the thought of shaving.  I finally had enough and decided to spend the money and get a nicer one.  And by Thor is this shaver amazing!  It didn&#x27;t even pull one of my hairs.  Every time I used this shaver, it&#x27;s a completely painless process..  I&#x27;ve never even got razor burn once from using this shaver.     This shaver was definitely worth the money, and I now actually look forward to shaving everyday.  Extremely recommend!</li>
    <li> Good merchandise, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Been using other shavers such Remington for many years. Thought I would upgrade to a Braun since they had such a great reputation. I think the razor looks great, however, the most important thing is to get a close shave. Unfortunately as other have mentioned you have to constantly go over areas to get a decent shave. I noticed when I first got it that the center head was sticking. It has since loosened up although the shave has not improved. To summarize the quality of shave; the new Braun is equivalent to the Remington when the heads need replaced. I have been using the Braun for over 4 months now and it has not improved. The only reason I still use it is because I paid so much for it. The best thing about the Braun is that it does have a good trimmer. Just looking forward now to when I can buy another shaver and it will not be a Braun.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this product.</li>
    <li> The Series 5 is a re-design of Braun&#x27;s popular 360 Complete. It uses the same cutter, so the shave is the same as the 360. The differences are in the overall shape - Braun has done a great job with the re-design. The shaver is easier to grip and has the same basic form factor as the top of the line Braun Series 7 (Pulsonic). Unlike the 360 Compete, the Series 5 is washable under the tap. It&#x27;s NOT submersible or a wet shaver, but you can safely use water to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model lacks the pulsating action of the Pulsonic, but don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying it. I&#x27;ve used the Pulsonic and, on my face, the Series 5 does as good of a job in most spots, and a wee bit better on the neck. I also find the \\&quot;push up\\&quot; format for the sideburn trimmer to be better/easier to use than the \\&quot;flip out\\&quot; format on the Pulsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of any Braun shaver is the cleaning system. In a word, it&#x27;s perfect - no other cleaning system comes close. Works well, and leaves the shaver spotless and lemony-fresh. The down side, of course, is that you need to purchase refill cartridges. If you clean every day, expect about 4 weeks per cartridge. I get mine to last about 4-5 months by cleaning once a week using the cleaning base, and cleaning the rest of the time with water. You have to remove the cartridge and re-cap it so you don&#x27;t lose solution via evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neat trick for quick cleaning - just click the head release button but don&#x27;t remove the head. Then turn on the razor and let the stubble fall out. Gets about 75% of the whiskers out in about 2 seconds. Safe for the razor - the tip is in the user&#x27;s manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Series 5 comes in two models (760 and 790) - the only difference is the number of lights to show you the battery charge, so look for whichever is on sale. It also comes without a cleaning base (the \\&quot;cc\\&quot; models have the cleaning system, those without the \\&quot;cc\\&quot; in the model do not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you favor a gentle shave over a ultra close shave, the Braun is for you. While I like the shave from the Series 5 (more so than the shave from the Pulsonic), I have to say that I prefer the shave from the Norelco Arcitec - it&#x27;s a rotary shaver, but still quite comfortable, and excels at getting those pesky neck hairs. My absolute favorite foil shaver is the Panasonic Arc IV - 90% as comfortable as a Braun, but closer and faster. Check all of them out - all are great shavers with unique features.I like the shave from the Series 5 (more so than the shave from the Pulsonic), I have to say that I prefer the shave from the Norelco Arcitec - it&#x27;s a rotary shaver, but still quite comfortable, and excels at getting those pesky neck hairs.

    <li> I&#x27;m coming to the 570cc from the Braun 7000 series which was effective but I always wished the grip was better. The 570cc appeared to solve that problem with the ruberized grip. Upon using it, however, I find that the benefits of the 570cc textured grip are countered by the angled head. I expect that in time I&#x27;ll adjust but after the linear 7526 model I&#x27;m finding it difficult to get comfortable using this 570cc.  The shave is close and comfortable, effortless it seems. Better than the 7526.  The noise is slightly louder than the 7526 model, still not a problem though.  The sideburn trimmer is seperate from the foil and easy to deploy and use.  The cleaning device is perfect. Greatly improved from the 7000 series and gone is the sliding post which was prone to breaking.   I do wish the electrical cord had not changed so that I might be able to use my previous models as a backup.   It doesn&#x27;t come with a plastic protective cover on the foil, as my previous model had, which is sad as I like to shave on the go and the cap is necessary to prevent damage to the foil. I comes with a nice travel case, though not as quick or convenient as cap. I still use the previous models plastic cap as it does fit this 570cc.  One other complaint, minor, when disengaging the foil to clear the cuttings I notice this 570cc unit does not vibrate as much as my previous 7526 model and it is therefore a bit harder to dislodge the cuttings after a shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver is excellent and came at a great price.  It arrived quickly in original packaging and is the best shaver Ive used so far.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver three years ago. I&#x27;ve replaced the cutter head once since these wear out periodically. It still works great and shaves me smooth in 2 minutes. The cleaning base is totally unnecessary because you can simply snap off the cutter head and hold the shaver and cutter head under running water. Thus you&#x27;ll never have to buy the replacement cartridges for the cleaning base. I&#x27;ve done this for over 2 years now and the shaver is still very clean and works great. The cleaning base is really just an invention of the Gilette company which wants to sell you those cartridges.</li>
    <li> Great shaving machine, not bad however all ready change it to the 7000 series way better lol lol lol lol</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun razor for as long as I can remember. Bought the 5 series as a replacement for my 7680, which needed to say goodbye as the side trimmer broke on it. My main reason for buying the 5 series over all others was for the side trimmer. This is the most vital part of a razor for me. The trimmer is a good improvement over the previous razors, as it slides up differently, though feels more plasticy. Most reviews do not talk about the trimmers, but I feel this is the best side trimmer I have used on a razor. It is a 90 degree angle, unlike others that use a 45 degree angle. This Braun performs similar to every other Braun I have had. The new shape takes some getting use to, but once that happens, you are good to go. It has a nice grip to it and you are less likely to drop it by mistake (you know those kind of mornings). The performance is a little lack luster compared to my previous razor and I seem to have to go over spots several times to get the close shave Braun and others claim. There is a lack of power to the razor and the reason for its under performance, however is the quietest Braun that has been in my hands. The battery life is shorter than the 7680, but still lasts several days between charges. One perk to this series is the fact that you can rinse the blades with water, making you save a few more bucks on the cleaning solutions. Overall I am satisfied with this razor, though still consider it lacking a little for the price.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for Braun and 1 star for Amazon...  My mother and I both ordered this shaver as a holiday present for my husband. He loves it and is able to get a clean shave very quickly! Also - it self cleans, so no more do I hear \\&quot;bang bang bang\\&quot; of the shaver against the sink each morning as it is being cleaned!    Unfortunately, he does not need two of them, though. Apparently, this ITEM CANNOT BE RETURNED to Amazon, so it looks like we are stuck with two. We were not able to find on the order page that this is a non-returnable item (even if unused/unopened). Please beware of Amazon&#x27;s return policies before ordering!</li>
    <li> I gave this a one because zero is not an option.  I bought this shaver for my husband because we thought the \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; name stood for something special. I could not believe it when my husband told me the battery would not hold a charge. The longest it has gone so far is 18 minutes. He called the Customer Service department in INDIA (no suprise there) and they told him he could get his money back but we would have to pay to ship it across the country! That is outrageous, to have to pay to ship something that doesn&#x27;t do its job right out of the box! The closest Braun authorized repair shop is 200 miles away. And because I was stupid enough to buy it online from Amazon I can&#x27;t return it because of the HAZARDOUS alcohol. They shipped it to me but I can&#x27;t ship it back. Makes sense to me! I should have bought it from Target at least then I could have returned it.  Bottom line is don&#x27;t buy anything online until you read the return policy and research the company&#x27;s policy on repairs and returns.</li>
    <li> Shaves great! I think the cleaning/charging stand is somewhat of a gimmick. They bought to sell that as an option.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of a Braun Shaver. I have the best luck with these. My last one I had for 7 years. Cannot ask for a better shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun&#x27;s for years and all have been exceptional.  This one is no different.  The charge stays long, the closeness of the shave is terrific and its light, durable and the travel case makes it a home run.  Thank you</li>
    <li> It works better than the 3 head shaver I used for many years.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close. I end up using a Gillette Mach 3 in the end.</li>
    <li> Have always used the Braun shavers  they last a long time and are very durable my last Braun razor lasted for 10 years</li>
    <li> Braun razor series 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor exceeds any razor that I have ever owned or used.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone that wants a close clean shave in a short period of shaving.</li>
    <li> The shaver is very reliable. not very much maintenance. It is very gentle on my face as I have tender skin</li>
    <li> It preforms quite well and shaves pretty close.  The cleaning station is also very convenient for helping clean the razor and giving it a nice clean smell.</li>
    <li> Ive heard great things about Braun Razors, after buying one I was a little disappointed with the shave it gives! My 10 year old  Norelco gave a equal shave in a lot less time. You have to go over and over and over the same spot to get a decient shave.</li>
    <li> Very poor shave have to keep going over and over again which is causing burning very very disappointed Iam having to clean up with hand razor leaving to much stubble</li>
    <li> Have to spend aditional time to get the closeness I want. Don&#x27;t like having to spend more time. I wish I would have kept my Norelco.</li>
    <li> Very pleasantly surprised with the closeness of the shave. The cleaning solution is too expensive and I&#x27;m continuing to try and find an alternative for making my own.</li>
