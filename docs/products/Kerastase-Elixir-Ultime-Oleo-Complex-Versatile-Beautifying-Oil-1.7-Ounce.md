      <li>OMG, the scent is beautiful.</li>
      <li>great</li>
      <li>Beautifully scented like amber and wood, its musky scent lingers gorgeously for hours.</li>
      <li>This is the best oil I&#x27;ve ever had, even better than morrocon oil.</li>

      <li>so I will never know if it&#x27;s any good.</li>
      <li>My hair is bleached and very fine and after buying this my hair feels amazing!</li>
      <li>The very best product I have ever used on my hair, straight or curly!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite non - rinse product!</li>
      <li>you will get AMAZING</li>
      <li>and I loved it, but this Kerastase serum is even better.</li>
      <li>If needed, you can put more on as needed between shampoos, to add more shine and to refresh the scent, which is amazing!  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product .</li>
      <li>Love the miniature</li>
      <li>My wife uses this product on a daily basis and purchased this as it is a perfect size for travelling.</li>
      <li>I love it very very much!</li>
      <li>It is effective and works really well to soften and condition my hair</li>
      <li>so I can travel light.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend this much on a product I would probably regret buying, but I&#x27;m glad I splurged.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product is original.</li>
      <li>I sent an email to the seller and they said me that this product is original from Kerastase</li>
      <li>It smells good, prevents frizz and my hair seems stronger in general.</li>

      <li>Now, after using the Cleansing Oil shampoo by Kerastase, (I should have given that a 5 stars now that I&#x27;ve used it several more times) and the Elixir Oleo Serum</li>
      <li>I like it so much!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just like any other regular serum picked up off the shelf from a cosmetics store, except the faintly pleasant smell, which evaporates rather quickly.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t think I would have much to say about a hair product.  </li>
      <li>I live in S. Florida,</li>
      <li>Kerastase is a professional line of luxury hair products from Loreal.</li>
      <li>Soft and shiny, manageable and I&#x27;ve had zero frizz since using this.  </li>
      <li>I have healthy, relatively lustrous, thick hair, and am not able to feel a very noticeable difference in the hair smoothness and shine after using this product.</li>

<li> (spray in before you blow dry or flat iron, after applying the Kerastase)</li>
<li> It will give you natural looking shine without being greasy or heavy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product is original. It smell like coconut oil. I sent an email to the seller and they said me that this product is original from Kerastase but I &#x27;m not sure. The size is perfect and the price is excellent.</li>
    <li> I have used Kerastase Oleo-Relax for years and I loved it, but this Kerastase serum is even better. It will give you natural looking shine without being greasy or heavy. (I have fine, fairly straight hair that is damaged by years of coloring/bleaching.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Elixir Ultime Oleo is used in combination with the Davines Defining Texturizing Styling Spray (spray in before you blow dry or flat iron, after applying the Kerastase) you will get AMAZING hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together they cost about $50. To save money buy the smaller, travel sized version of this Kerastase. It will last a long time.</li>
    <li> The very best product I have ever used on my hair, straight or curly!  Love the miniature so I can travel light.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this product . Non greasy and immediate shine and healthiness appears to the hair strand .</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I would have much to say about a hair product.  I have bought soooo much in the last few years.  My hair has changed over the years after having children.  Unmanageable and thick, curly and dry to now thinning, which sucks. But my hair is still dry and frizzy.  Now, after using the Cleansing Oil shampoo by Kerastase, (I should have given that a 5 stars now that I&#x27;ve used it several more times) and the Elixir Oleo Serum, I can honestly say my hair has a new feel to it.  Soft and shiny, manageable and I&#x27;ve had zero frizz since using this.  I live in S. Florida, the humidity here is awful, as most would attest.  This beats it.  I would recommend it.  I do want to say, though, it is not cheap.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend this much on a product I would probably regret buying, but I&#x27;m glad I splurged.  However, cost aside, I also wanted to comment that this product will go a long way.  Only a few drops are needed after shampooing.  If needed, you can put more on as needed between shampoos, to add more shine and to refresh the scent, which is amazing!  OMG, the scent is beautiful.</li>
    <li> The product came on time, but its in a spray bottle, and the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work.  It just comes out in a big drippy glob.  Very disappointing.  It can&#x27;t be used as intended so I will never know if it&#x27;s any good.</li>
    <li> Smooths and hydrates my very dry, frizzy hair without weighing it down! As long as I can afford it, I will buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the only thing I use post shower to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is addictive!</li>
    <li> My hair is bleached and very fine and after buying this my hair feels amazing! It smells good, prevents frizz and my hair seems stronger in general. This is the best oil I&#x27;ve ever had, even better than morrocon oil. I love it very very much!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product on a daily basis and purchased this as it is a perfect size for travelling.</li>
    <li> Kerastase is a professional line of luxury hair products from Loreal. These two are my favorites:&lt;br /&gt;Oleo-complex: Kerastase&#x27;s crown jewel hair oil. It has a very silky texture and a heavy finish. Beautifully scented like amber and wood, its musky scent lingers gorgeously for hours. It is effective and works really well to soften and condition my hair but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d need to have this AND the Chi Silk Infusion. They essentially feel the same and I get the same results, the only difference is the scent.</li>
    <li> I am still using it, smells really good and it really help to make my hair smooth and shinny. great</li>
    <li> I have healthy, relatively lustrous, thick hair, and am not able to feel a very noticeable difference in the hair smoothness and shine after using this product. It&#x27;s just like any other regular serum picked up off the shelf from a cosmetics store, except the faintly pleasant smell, which evaporates rather quickly. Overall, did not blow my mind.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite non - rinse product! I like it so much!  My hair looks much better, smooth, soft, sparkling!!!</li>
    <li> I use two pumps of the serum because my hair is long.  Usually hair products smell weird or make my hair too greasy so I don&#x27;t use them.  The Moroccan oil in this product does the trick!</li>
