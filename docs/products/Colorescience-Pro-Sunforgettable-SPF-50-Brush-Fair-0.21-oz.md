### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it protects your skin perfectly.</li>
      <li>This is the best sunscreen I have used to date.  </li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m dressed up in makeup at an outdoor gathering this is great!</li>
      <li>It is without a doubt the best sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Great on the go sunscreen!</li>
      <li>Perfect.  </li>
      <li>I just bought the Colorescience highlighting primer which will go perfectly under this.  </li>
      <li>I have a very fair skin tone</li>
      <li>Works great for babies.  </li>
      <li>Does not cause breakouts, great for the face.</li>
      <li>that said, I think this product is great.  </li>
      <li>my wife is happy with this product</li>
      <li>I had great expectations for this product</li>
      <li>Best sunscreen available, and easiest to use.</li>
      <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t think you can wash it like a good powder brush.</li>
      <li>Provides good sun protection without making your face greasy.</li>
      <li>I ordered the lightest shade and the color was a good match for ne.  </li>
      <li>These are not sun wrinkles, and they weren&#x27;t there before: they are because of incredible dryness in the top layer, and it looks like they are going to be around until that layer finishes turning over</li>
      <li>Amazing stuff ...</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even feel that I&#x27;m wearing this powder, and it looks nice as well.</li>
      <li>Nice finishing powder</li>
      <li>so I can use my own brush to apply, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying again.  </li>
      <li>Feels light on the skin, provides some coverage, good sun protection.</li>
      <li>but it was too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>then the straight chemical sunscreens, but the EWG rating isn&#x27;t great - [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to be done with sunscreen lotion on my face and neck.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>You can wear makeup &amp; protect your skin what could be better</li>
      <li>LOVE.</li>
      <li>My kids don&#x27;t mind putting it on their faces, I love that my face, ears, and neck are not greasy.</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>no burns :).</li>
      <li>and I like that you can reapply it on top of makeup throughout the day without messing it up.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this is MINERAL sunscreen--no chemical sunscreen in it at all.</li>
      <li>the best type of facial sun protection for your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to spend more money trying to get one when I may end up with another refill.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this product, it is well worth the price!!</li>
      <li>It is not so easy to use...</li>
      <li>easy to apply and carry in purse.</li>
      <li>The tinting is wonderful and the active ingredients are zinc and titanium...</li>
      <li>I do make sure to clean it after every two or three applications though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited about this sunblock.</li>
      <li>I added a star because it was a very good sunscreen before it dried the bejeezus out of my skin.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure: I managed to graduate college with honors, but could not figure out how to operate this</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
      <li>I also apply another powder on top of the Colorescience and really like the look and feel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and soft, but the hairs are always coming off onto my face.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly (so smoothly that because it blends right in</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
      <li>And I found out that if, like me, you have very delicate facial skin, that this product, while very good at preventing sun damage -- and it is very, very good at that -- may severely dry out the top layer of skin.</li>
      <li>It is a very light powder and provides such a huge spf of 50.  </li>
      <li>And finally, as far as ingredients go, it is certainly more natural and safe</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that it keeps your face well protected for several hours</li>
      <li>I was concerned about the price, but it is so well worth it.</li>
      <li>If you have tough skin that doesn&#x27;t lose moisture way too easily, this is most likely a very good sunscreen.</li>
      <li>So three weeks after buying it I probably could have returned it for the right item or a refund</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and reapply and then there is the protection that it offers!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s translucent, not heavy, easy to use, you don&#x27;t need mirror to apply it</li>
      <li>This is a great way to protect your face from sun damage daily especially when wearing makeup.</li>
      <li>I like how it feels but would like a bit more coverage, possibly I&#x27;ll try another color.</li>
      <li>I am extremely fair skinned and HAVE to wear sunscreen everyday.  </li>
      <li>my skin looks very dry, and is covered over with tons of very fine wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Loved the ease in using it and the small size that fits in my handbag.  </li>
      <li>, it feels like my face has become some kind of black hole for lotions and oils.</li>
      <li>Works very well at keeping the burn away.</li>
      <li>I can put this on as much as need to and blocks sun.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I like the idea of this, it does work really well.</li>
      <li>It protects better than any other sunscreen out there.</li>
      <li>I think next time around I will see if I can purchase the loose powder and use my own brush</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the applicator, I think oil gets trapped in the brush head</li>
      <li>for sun coverage, I think it&#x27;s working really well, but I always wear it on top of my Ayurmedic sunscreen, so I&#x27;m not sure which one is protecting me from the sun.  </li>
      <li>I live in a hot and humid region, and the lotion-style mineral sunscreens make you look zombie-clown white, and then &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; off once you really start sweating.</li>
      <li>- moisturizer helps significantly, but doesn&#x27;t fully make them disappear, much less go away, and I need to reapply so much</li>
      <li>It applies easily, is not heavy and protects beyond my expectations...</li>
      <li>I boight it early to see if it worked and it does.</li>
      <li>what really bothered me was that the product left my skin shiny rather than matte.  </li>
      <li>A very practical way to prevent burns all day long.</li>
      <li>I have very sun sensitive skin and reapplying sunblock in the middle of the day has been a conundrum, especially on days where I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  </li>
      <li>This Colorescience really knows how to mix the colors to present basic shades, but to blend to multiple skin types.  </li>
      <li>: If you have preexisting overly dry, extremely sensitive facial skin, you should probably look elsewhere.</li>

<li> Unfortunately, the product they sent me wasn&#x27;t the full applicator as shown which I paid $44.50 for, it was the refill which sells for $22.55.</li>
<li> The only problem, and it&#x27;s a minor one once you get used to applying the powder, is that it&#x27;s hard to know when you have enough on.</li>
<li> will be a lifelong customer for the product.  </li>
<li> It was supposed to arrive a few days in advance but didn&#x27;t get there until the day we left.</li>
<li> Exactly as expected.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best sunscreen available, and easiest to use.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Exactly as expected.  Great on the go sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this, it does work really well. I&#x27;m not in love with the applicator, I think oil gets trapped in the brush head &amp; I don&#x27;t think you can wash it like a good powder brush. I think next time around I will see if I can purchase the loose powder and use my own brush so I don&#x27;t break out.</li>
    <li> While very expensive this product excels at what it is intended to do. It is without a doubt the best sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.....very overpriced!  This isn&#x27;t Chanel!!  It is convenient, small, lightweight. I wish the brush wasn&#x27;t synthetic.  It arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen.  Got it for my kids because they always complain that the lotion sunscreen burns their eyes.  This doesn&#x27;t bother them at all and I like that you can reapply it on top of makeup throughout the day without messing it up.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels but would like a bit more coverage, possibly I&#x27;ll try another color. Does not cause breakouts, great for the face.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this is MINERAL sunscreen--no chemical sunscreen in it at all. The only problem, and it&#x27;s a minor one once you get used to applying the powder, is that it&#x27;s hard to know when you have enough on. It&#x27;s a little easier if you&#x27;re putting it on over makeup that&#x27;s a bit darker than the shade of Sunforgettable SPF 50 that you&#x27;re using, though.</li>
    <li> It is a very light powder and provides such a huge spf of 50.  Never cakes on me or gathers in my lines</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to be done with sunscreen lotion on my face and neck. No more shiny face or irritated skin. I can&#x27;t even feel that I&#x27;m wearing this powder, and it looks nice as well.</li>
    <li> I used this alone as sunscreen. And I found out that if, like me, you have very delicate facial skin, that this product, while very good at preventing sun damage -- and it is very, very good at that -- may severely dry out the top layer of skin. I am still dealing with this effect -- using moisturizers and oils beforehand didn&#x27;t work, because I noticed the drying effect soon after i started using, and tried very hard to work around it in order to keep using this product. I added a star because it was a very good sunscreen before it dried the bejeezus out of my skin. I live in a hot and humid region, and the lotion-style mineral sunscreens make you look zombie-clown white, and then &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; off once you really start sweating. So it&#x27;s pretty disappointing that this one is a no-go for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several days of use -- even with various moisturizers applied and soaked in beforehand, and removal at the end of every day --  my skin looks very dry, and is covered over with tons of very fine wrinkles. These are not sun wrinkles, and they weren&#x27;t there before: they are because of incredible dryness in the top layer, and it looks like they are going to be around until that layer finishes turning over - moisturizer helps significantly, but doesn&#x27;t fully make them disappear, much less go away, and I need to reapply so much, it feels like my face has become some kind of black hole for lotions and oils. I&#x27;d use a peel, but my facial skin is extremely tender in general, and is especially so at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: If you have preexisting overly dry, extremely sensitive facial skin, you should probably look elsewhere. If you have tough skin that doesn&#x27;t lose moisture way too easily, this is most likely a very good sunscreen. Just try not to inhale it while applying.</li>
    <li> Nice finishing powder but need to apply regular sunscreen if your going to be outside long</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34;, as described in the headline for the item, but I received medium.</li>
    <li> Loved the ease in using it and the small size that fits in my handbag.  I ordered for daughter also</li>
    <li> Works very well at keeping the burn away. Versatile in that you can use it anywhere from your hands and arms, chest, face shoulders, and even in your hair at the part. A very practical way to prevent burns all day long. I will continue to use this product, it is well worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get the powder to come out into the brush. when applying it to my face I just end up removing my foundation with the brush instead of applying the powder.</li>
    <li> Feels light on the skin, provides some coverage, good sun protection.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing it protects your skin perfectly. You can wear makeup &amp; protect your skin what could be better</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and reapply and then there is the protection that it offers!  I no longer wear a liquid foundation and have had compliments on my skin.  I also apply another powder on top of the Colorescience and really like the look and feel.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product. It is amazing. My kids don&#x27;t mind putting it on their faces, I love that my face, ears, and neck are not greasy. We went to Disney World and wore this everyday and never had an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I will be a lifelong customer for the product.  I was concerned about the price, but it is so well worth it.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the powder and the color but it&#x27;s hard to tell if you&#x27;re using enough.</li>
    <li> my wife is happy with this product</li>
    <li> Not sure  it is hard to know if you have enough on so I worry about getting color on my face and neck</li>
    <li> Works well.  easy to apply and carry in purse.</li>
    <li> Provides good sun protection without making your face greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to protect your face from sun damage daily especially when wearing makeup. I wouldn&#x27;t use it  alone if out at the beach for several hours or other outdoor activiity. I have a very fair skin tone so I woud use this along with regular sun screen. If I&#x27;m dressed up in makeup at an outdoor gathering this is great!</li>
    <li> It is not so easy to use... Really hard to put enough powder on my face, I still get tanned</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the brush doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and attempted to get the powder to release and it will not.&lt;br /&gt;The only way I can use it is by unscrewing the cap and dipping the brush in. Not only is that a pain but it also is messy. And the product is way too expensive to spill/lose because you have to unscrew the bottom constantly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy on Amazon, either. If this happens to you the terrible customer service reps from Colorescience won&#x27;t exchange or refund because it didn&#x27;t come from their site. Buy it from their site or don&#x27;t buy it at all.</li>
    <li> Works great for babies.  My little boy doesn&#x27;t mind it being applied at all.  Last a long time as well.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product.  This travel with me anywhere a go.  I can&#x27;t be without it.  Loveeeeee it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t give me the protection I needed on a week long tropical vacation in the sun. It worked. Amazing. Goes on smoothly (so smoothly that because it blends right in I didn&#x27;t know if I was getting coverage). Never burned, never broke out. Unlike creams/lotions I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it running  or stinging my eyes. Yes it is pricey but a little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t feel it, you don&#x27;t see it but you&#x27;re protected. Finally found a sunscreen that works and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s translucent, not heavy, easy to use, you don&#x27;t need mirror to apply it and it is not masking or changing in any way underlying makeup But I don&#x27;t know it it helps or not. Because I don&#x27;t have any idea about the amount I&#x27;ve applied. As I mentioned before, it&#x27;s translucent. We&#x27;ll see in summer.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this sunblock. I have very sun sensitive skin and reapplying sunblock in the middle of the day has been a conundrum, especially on days where I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  This solves all of that!  It fits conveniently in my bag and gives me that extra sense of security when I know I will be spending time in the sun.  Plus, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out.  Woohoo!!  I do make sure to clean it after every two or three applications though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for sun coverage, I think it&#x27;s working really well, but I always wear it on top of my Ayurmedic sunscreen, so I&#x27;m not sure which one is protecting me from the sun.  Maybe both?  I definitely haven&#x27;t burned since I&#x27;ve been using it, so I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I don&#x27;t give five stars is because the brush is falling apart.  It&#x27;s nice and soft, but the hairs are always coming off onto my face.  Also, it can leave my skin looking a bit powdery.  And finally, as far as ingredients go, it is certainly more natural and safe then the straight chemical sunscreens, but the EWG rating isn&#x27;t great - [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I think this product is great.  I might transfer it to another container so I can use my own brush to apply, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying again.  I just bought the Colorescience highlighting primer which will go perfectly under this.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff ... I hate reapplying sunscreen after I put my make up on.  I can put this on as much as need to and blocks sun.  My skin is prone to break outs but have not had issues with this.  I am very pale and wore this all summer with no issues.  This is my second bottle. Only downside is it is pricey but lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I had great expectations for this product but it was too good to be true.  Not only was the the powder too dark and  yellow for my porcelain skin, what really bothered me was that the product left my skin shiny rather than matte.  Not what I expected from a powder, certainly not at this price.</li>
    <li> I am a golfer and this products works well for me so I don&#x27;t have to wear a hat.  I brush it on my hair part and no more sunburn.</li>
    <li> I ordered the lightest shade and the color was a good match for ne.  I have medium blonde hair.  We are traveling out of the country and I wanted a powder sunscreen because of the TSA limit on liquids.  This fit the bill.  I like the retractable brush, too.  I would have given 5 stars but it was hard to tell if the powder was actually coming out at first.  Glad I boight it early to see if it worked and it does.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice that it keeps your face well protected for several hours</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to use on a long cross-country move. It was supposed to arrive a few days in advance but didn&#x27;t get there until the day we left. Unfortunately, the product they sent me wasn&#x27;t the full applicator as shown which I paid $44.50 for, it was the refill which sells for $22.55. Since we were leaving that day I had no choice but to pop it in my purse and go. It was a long trip and when we finally arrived I was pretty sick for about two weeks. So three weeks after buying it I probably could have returned it for the right item or a refund but I was still overwhelmed from the move and being sick and a new job etc. We were also in the process of buying a house so it just slipped my mind entirely. By the time I remembered it was in the bottom of my purse, a month had passed and I thought it was probably to late to return it. I can&#x27;t evaluate it&#x27;s efficacy because I can&#x27;t use it without the applicator and as expensive as it is I&#x27;m not going to spend more money trying to get one when I may end up with another refill. I&#x27;ll contact the seller and see if I can still return it for the correct product and then I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> LOVE. It protects better than any other sunscreen out there. Even swimming or sweat.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I managed to graduate college with honors, but could not figure out how to operate this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I twisted, pulled, and tugged this product until my hands were sore, but nothing more than a hint of powder appeared on the brush. And then the tube cracked. Yeah, threw this away.</li>
    <li> Unlike other mineral make up I&#x27;ve used, this did not sweat off - in the Florida sun!  It covered and kept me from burning!</li>
    <li> Purchased this at the recommendation of my esthetician and a couple of friends. It applies easily, is not heavy and protects beyond my expectations...no burns :). Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have used to date.  I am extremely fair skinned and HAVE to wear sunscreen everyday.  This Colorescience really knows how to mix the colors to present basic shades, but to blend to multiple skin types.  The tinting is wonderful and the active ingredients are zinc and titanium... the best type of facial sun protection for your skin. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
