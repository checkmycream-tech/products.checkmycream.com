<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Send to be working, will give more time</li>
    <li> Sadly I am starting to age and was looking for a good anti wrinkle cream. I came across this and decided to give it a try. I was surpised at the results. My skin has soften a bit and have yet to see any reduction in wrinkles but I hopeful because I do notice a difference in my skin already.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price. Only been using it for a few and have already noticed a difference. This one is not going to the \\&quot;wrinkle cream graveyard\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these before, I do love this; so oriduct gets 5 stars,however; I can&#x27;t get it out of the container ...hence the one star, shipping was quick gotta love that!.  I have tried hitting it in my hand, sticking a little pin in the hole in the bottom and I can&#x27;t get it to work....so in the meantime I have started using an inferior product...hope this can be resolved</li>
    <li> not nearly as smelly as Roc and great pump bottle lets you know that you are using all of the product. Sent with 3 smaller trail size of other sroducts which i have enjoyed using. I use this every night and have enjoyed the benefits. no flare ups or burns around top of cheeks like some retinols give me, and i barely notice any fragrence.</li>
    <li> It works well and my skin is younger looking and moisture has continued to increase.</li>
    <li> Really liked the feel of the cream.</li>
    <li> Tree of life beauty has no physical address published on their website like any reputable company does. People, be very weary of miracle products sold by anonymous companies, especially if you put this on your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this. I used for 2 weeks and REALLY noticed a difference.  The free samples of the other products definitely make you want to buy the other products!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is lightweight and goes on smoothly. It is not greasy at all! I generally have normal to dry skin, and this product has been sufficient in eliminating my dry skin. I have only been using it for about two weeks, but I already feel like it is diminishing the appearance of my fine lines! I have also had two pimples on my chin for MONTHS and they are gone now! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> so far so good.... seems to be helping the ole skin ageing thing :O)</li>
    <li> Love this cream!!!  Definitely can see mild results and prefer the more natural approach!</li>
    <li> I have been using this over 2 months. I only use this at night. It moisturizes my face all night. Even though I don&#x27;t wash my face next day all day because I have a baby, so sometimes, I am lazy to wash my face, I never feel my face dries. However, every time, I put it on my face, it makes my eye lids itchy. It is not serious, but my skin on eye lids peels off with scratching. Then, I can grab some remain on my face after I put it on my face. That means that its particles doesn&#x27;t absorb on my face. Also, I&#x27;ve used this with Vitamin C serum, so I thought it keeps brighter my face skin, but when the C serum ran out of and I only used this moisturizer on my face, my face skin turned  dark. That means it doesn&#x27;t work well. Will I buy it again??? Heck!!! NOooooooooooooooo..  I forgot telling this that I found some whiteheads and pimples on my forehead and chin. How do I know because of this moisturizer?  I only used this at middle day, then I slept. Next day, I found them. Uhhhhhhhhhh... not happy with this product. Also, I found this product&#x27;s price. Wow, it went down to $ 26.00. I am so mad now because I paid $ 39.99 for it.    Updated: I didn&#x27;t expect I got a full refund without returning my used moisturizer. Thank you for your great customer service. I will look forward to have another business soon. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have been using it for about a month now and I can notice a huge difference in my skin. I use it in the morning and night, the fine lines have smoothed out and my skin is soft.  I love the way my makeup goes on.  I will definitely continue to use the Tree of Life products.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I am very pleased with the results I am seeing after a month of use. I will be ordering more of your products. Would love to see a cleanser! My reason for giving it only 4 stars is that the pump stopped working, have tried everything to get it to work, had to resort to unscrewing the entire top and trying to get the cream out that way, but it&#x27;s really hard to do that. Any suggestions on how to get the pump to work?</li>
    <li> Works well.  Will buy it again.  Also bought the daily moisture and recommend it.  I am a young 72 with some sun damage and can see a change in skin since using these products.  I have tried other similar products but none have worked as well.  Give these products a try!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an economical way to continue using Retinol Cream and this is it!  This product works far better than one I was paying over three times as much for.  I look to continue using Tree of Life Best Retinol Cream Anti Wrinkle Moisturizer for a long time to come.  Not only is it more economical but it came quickly and was exactly as advertised.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> So thankful to have something that goes on so smoothly, yet is helping my skin to look so soft.  I love the way this absorbs so quickly and yet leaves my skin feeling so soft and the lines to appear less  noticeable.  My makeup goes on so nice afterwards and I&#x27;m a happy camper.  So grateful that I can still look soft and smooth at 60!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until I bought this a second time how much it is drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, In the past I have paid $40 to $50 for products that never work. This product does what it says and I will keep buying. Highly recommend good choice.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After 4 or 5 weeks of daily use around my jowl lines there is a noticeable softening of the lines - the lines are less pronounced.  I would say the product is working for me.  I have had no rashes or reactions to the cream.  I also shake the tube vigorously before each use as directed.  All in all I would recommend this wrinkle cream.  It definitely has made my skin softer.  It is kind of difficult to judge the results but it appears this product is doing a good job of softening my skin and decreasing the depth of my jowl lines.  I would recommend this product.  Oh I&#x27;m a guy if that matters.</li>
    <li> This is actually Jon&#x27;s wife writing this review : ). This moisturizer feels really good (not greasy) and does the job (I have dry skin). It works well under sunblock and has very little smell, which is a big plus for me. I feel good about the addition of the retinol as well as the other ingredients.  The company has also gone out of its way to make sure I am satisfied with their product and the order, emailing me preemptively and asking for feedback. I&#x27;ve bought this product twice already and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a short time,but it seems like my fine lines around my eyes have already improved.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have been fighting a dry ice burn on my hand and thumb for a little under three years. After using this for a little over a week, the results are amazing!  I have been to the doctor and the dermatologist, both giving me prescription cream, and this product by tree of life IS amazing. I would recommend this product to everyone.  Thank you tree of life!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  I&#x27;ve used many anti ageing products over the years without seeing any visible results.  This product delivers what it promises.  I used this every night and noticed results in about 2 weeks.  My skin feels way firmer, softer, and not at all greasy.  The price is excellent for the quality.  The results feel like when I would have facials at the spa.  I have used all the other products from Tree of Life at the same time and have been so happy with the results.  This seller was fantastic to deal with and quick to deliver.  I would highly recommend the product and the seller.  I will definitely be back.</li>
    <li> This Retinal Moisturizer was great for my skin after the damage that had been done from using products with harmful chemicals to my face for years. I used this in the morning after washing my neck and face; I mixed this product with the Anti-Aging  Super Skin Rejuvenating Cream from Tree of Life and my skin responded well to the combo. I highly recommend it especially for people looking for a chemically safe product for their skin. Tree of Life is a great company that I trust!</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived earlier than stated, and has turned out to be my new favorite over the name brand depart store product I have bought for years!</li>
    <li> I noticed a huge difference in how rejuvenated my skin looked after sampling this product for only a week. Not only did my skin look great, but it felt great too.</li>
    <li> Very high quality product! Creamy but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily. Luxury product for your face!</li>
    <li> OK so I&#x27;ve been using this system for the past 3+ weeks, and I&#x27;ve gotta say that I really love it! It&#x27;s a really generous size and I absolutely LOVE the trial sizes they included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retinol cream was really gentle - I was a little nervous at first because my skin can be so sensitive, but I was able to use this consistently without issue. My skin feels soft and I do think I see a difference in my fine lines!</li>
    <li> 2oz is a rather small quantity. I find it &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; how none of the advertising photos for this product on this site show the model holding the bottle thereby showing it&#x27;s size relative to the user. How long should the bottle last, when used as recommended? And what is the recommended usage (quantity, frequency)?</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of the Tree of Life Retinol Mousturizer free for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Looks: When the bottle arrived I was a little iffy as it&#x27;s &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; 2oz but a little bit goes a long way!  2 squirts is enough for my face and neck!  Perfect!  I&#x27;ve been using it every night since I received it and haven&#x27;t made a sent in the bottle!  The label feels almost sticky but I thinks it&#x27;s just the type used and the actual bottle looks very nice with a couple of different silver finishes.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: The smell is probably my least favorite part...though it doesn&#x27;t smell Bad...it just doesn&#x27;t smell great either.&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  I&#x27;ve only been using for about a week...week and a half but I say YES.  For the past year or two I&#x27;ve struggled with dry patches between and under my eyebrows (under and in actuly under the hair).  I&#x27;ve tried tons of lotion with no improvement.  In the small amount of time I&#x27;ve been using this it appears to be gone!  I do have a couple of small red dry spots on my face that are still there but they&#x27;re light anyways and they don&#x27;t feel so dry now!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> I bought anti aging and retinol moisturizers on Amazon based on the good reviews and have used them for more than 6 weeks. I have a very sensitive skin and specially my eyes easier to get red from facial  lotion or cream. Therefore, I am very careful when buying different skincare products. However, after trying these products from Tree of Life Beauty, I have no problem with it so far. To be honest, after the second week of using them, I only feel my skin so soft and smooth.  Then, after a month, I can see some of my brown spots from the old acne lighter and the skin turns more radiant and brighten. I was so excited when seeing it!  Then the 6th week passing by I can see my skin improves more every day as the skin turns out so soft, more radiant and brighten. The brown spots  and some small wrinkle lines lighter and lighter.  I was about to purchase another set, but lucky that I got a free 2-oz retinol moisturizer sample last week.  I think we should be patient when using skincare products. We should give it a try at least 6-8 weeks as everyone has different skin types and textures. Someone may do better within 3-4 weeks, someone else may find improvement after 6 weeks or 2 months.  I think Tree of Life beauty produces great skincare products with a great price. I wanted to try anothe skincare product skin rejuvenating cream.  Just wanted to let you know I am using daily clean scrubs to wash the face, then applying anti-aging, then retinol moisturizers on, then applying sunscreen (only for day time). I think, finally I have found good products with great price from Tree of Life Beauty :-). The only thing I am worrying about, their products are good, soon they will increase the price :-(</li>
    <li> This is truely the BEST EVER anti-agine moisturizer with retinol I have ever tried. I have tried many different brands but Tree of Life is without the best choice. So many that I have tried with retinol have been very harsh on my skin causing redness or the next&lt;br /&gt;day extreme pealing. I am very pleased with this product because it is gentle on my shin and I have noticed a beautiful softening&lt;br /&gt;of the wrinkles on my forehead which other brands have not done so quickly. I highly recommend this to anyone. It is a wonderful product for young women to begin to use before many wrinkles begin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.... now it is kind of sticky so I just put it on at night and it takes a little while for the stickiness to go away....after using it a few days my fave has a glow and a few dark spots have gotten lighter... I have recommended this to friends and coworkers.... This will definitely be something I purchase once I use up what I have</li>
    <li> IS A GOOD MOISTURIZER ...</li>
    <li> I love this product. I tend to get dry flakey patches on my face.  Since I have been using Tree of Life, my skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> I cannot attest to how well the product itself works, as I have used it only one time. However, if the product works as well as the customer service, I would think it would be a wonderful product. I initially had a problem with the dispenser. I e-mailed Tree of Life. I had a response within an hour detailing what the potential problem could be and how to fix it. The fix worked. They also stated that if the correction failed to work, they would send me another bottle at no charge.</li>
    <li> Appears to be doing good things to my face  Have not noticed any significant changes yet</li>
    <li> After consistent use my skin did not feel or look different.</li>
    <li> I am almost done with the bottle and so decided to write the review now. It&#x27;s a good basic moisturizer for the price point, thus 4 stars. If I had paid more, it would received three stars.  I didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my skin tone or texture, but it was an effective moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am not looking 30 years younger...lol....but it does help with the fine lines and helps smooth out my face. I have used similar products, but this one works well without my skin feeling dry.  Will purchase again....</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product. Order arrived a day earlier than expected to that was a bonus</li>
    <li> I have been using the Retinol moisturizer for several weeks now. I love the velvety feel as it glides on. My skin drinks it up! There has been a noticeable difference in both my skin&#x27;s texture, glow, and fine lines. I have deeper lines around my eyes (crow&#x27;s feet) that I truly believe only injections or fillers will solve completely. I have tried many expensive department store products and this works just as well if not better. I will definitely re-purchase!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give it a 5 star. Product arrived very quickly.  Nice thorough information sheet and added samples included.  Very personable service. Thank you</li>
    <li> Works really well, I started seeing results in less than 3 days. Other Retinol products usually make me break out but this did not irritate my skin at all. It is fragrance free and you get a lot of product for what you pay for. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> using now..waiting to see effects..my daughter recommended it..she has beautiful skin..looking for cheaper alternative to skin medica HNS</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this retinol cream! As a smoker, I started noticing premature wrinkling around my mouth and eyes. Within just two weeks of using this cream they are completely gone! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and how quickly and effectively it worked. I recommend this moisturizer to anyone of any age. It&#x27;s a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> I really would like to know how much retinol is actually is in this formulation.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this moisturizer.  It goes on thinly and it&#x27;s a nice enough moisturizer, but after well over a month of use, I have seen no change in the appearance of my skin.  If you have dry skin, I don&#x27;t think you will find this moisturizing enough.  If you prefer a lighter moisturizer, then this is a good choice.  If you really want an antiaging product, then I&#x27;d try one that states at least 1% retinol and work your way up to daily use.  How fast you can start using a 1% formulation daily entirely depends on your skin type.  I have a tube of 1% retinol that I started using a while ago starting with just my forehead.  I found it a bit drying (flakiness) at first, but persisted, and now I can use it daily with no problem.  I am also starting to notice positive changes in some fine lines that have become shallower in less than a month. My skin is smoother and more even too.  I may have a way to go, but I&#x27;m a determined gal-good luck  Update:7/1/15-Despite my wondering if this Retinol Cream had enough of a percentage of Retinol in it, I have continued to use it.  I even bought my second bottle a while back.  I have discovered over time that it seems to be working.  I don&#x27;t think I gave it enough time to do its thing since it is a milder form of retinol.  What I did find out was that in my using a 1% retinol on certain areas of my face (forehead, between the eyes) last winter, that I was having an increased problem with dryness and flakiness in those areas.  So now I am only using the Tree of Life Retinol Moisturizer and finding that my face is showing improvement (except when I do have a Rosacea flare, I don&#x27;t use it then).  I&#x27;m seeing some decreases in fine lines on my forehead, between my eyes, and on my upper lip and upper chin areas.  I&#x27;m still not seeing any changes in the marionette lines. I especially like using it on my neck &amp; chest area asmy only moisturizer. I do use an additional moisturizer on my cheeks &amp; temples where my skin is very dry.  In my t-zone this moisturizer is sufficient in the summer months.  It has a nice consistency--smooth, very spreadable, soft feeling.  And my favorite fact about it is that there are no silicones at all (such as dimethicone) in it which tend to cause me plugged up pores.  It&#x27;s also loaded with other great ingredients for the face too such as aloe and hyaluronic acid (holds 1000X it&#x27;s weight in water thus keeping the face plumped up and moist). Yes, my opinion has changed for the better, so IMO it is better to watch your progress over a longer period of time than 1 month to really see results.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m not so old that I should have wrinkles, but I scowl a lot, so that causes wrinkles. I also suffer from some sort of dryness that I still need to go to the doctors to check out. My go to moisturizer has always been B&amp;B triple moisturizer, but for some reason it hasn&#x27;t been helping my dry patches. With this product I&#x27;ve noticed that my dry patches stay softer longer than my regular lotion does. I think I should also probably try and get a routine together that works best for me. I also don&#x27;t use a whole lot at a time because I like it to last and plus I myself don&#x27;t really need to use a whole lot of the product at one time. I was also surprised to find out I also received a bonus trial sized item! It really made my day when I opened my mail. This is honestly the best retinol moisturizer that I&#x27;ve used and I plan on staying with it.</li>
    <li> so far this product has been really good for me but has only been a week or so ,,</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t take before and after pics or anything but honestly I am almost through the bottle and I do believe I see a real difference. Plus the package included several other sample sizes of different skin creams. Great value!</li>
    <li> My face had been breaking out with a sunscreen moisturizer I was using before so I had to find something that that would work with my sensitive skin.  Tree of Life Retinol Moisturizer was the perfect fit.  No more breakouts and it is quickly absorbed so no greasy look or feel.  Can&#x27;t say it has miraculously wiped away my wrinkles but, I believe, they might be a little less noticeable.  Anyway, it is a product I will be using from now on.  And you just can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I felt immediate effects from this product. It tingles after application, which is nice. And my skin feels tighter and smoother even after just a few days. I recommend using it with their Super Skin Rejuvenating Serum.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, I do not recommend it. It made my face feel like it was on fire. I broke out immediately with a rash. I had such high hopes.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I put it on nightly and it shrinks my acne. I also find that my skin is smoother. They also gave me a little sample of moisturizers and vitamin c gel for the eye area. I am OBSESSED with the gel. Completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love the Tree of Life Retinol cream. I love all there products. My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Cream feels lovely - I have been using morning &amp; night for only a few weeks &amp; as advised by Tree of Life the benefits may take time so will continue forward.  Really enjoy the convenient container too - lightweight for traveling &amp; cream is protected from the air &amp; contaminants  ( a sexier label would be a bonus !)  - didn&#x27;t receive beauty  ebook though which I believed was part of the purchase perhaps I missed something ?</li>
    <li> very pleased with product and customer service.</li>
    <li> Works just like it said</li>
    <li> This moisturizer absorbs well into the skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave it dry.  I love the smell (very natural!) and my make-up goes on easily afterwards, and doesn&#x27;t run.  It&#x27;s a perfectly balanced, very nourishing moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This has amazing ingredients that work! And such an excellent price!! I love that it is refineing my wrinkles and evening out my skin tone WHILE it also is moisturizing. I&#x27;m not left with dry sore skin.  I&#x27;d recommend combining this with other Tree of Life products. They are all AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for two weeks. My skin feels and looks much better. I don&#x27;t look so tired. I also, have very dry skin and using the  Retinol Moisturizer my skin always feels smooth and soft and my makeup seems to go on better as well.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you are 40 something maybe it does the trick........really don&#x27;t think there is a cream out there that makes a difference.  It is genetics or&lt;br /&gt;a plastic surgeon that makes the difference.</li>
    <li> Made no difference, other than dries out my skin. No wrinkle reduction at all.......</li>
    <li> I am an Aesthetician and spent over 4 years in the luxury skin care industry in NYC. This is LOVELY, lightweight and velvety. It increases skin cell turnover which gives the skin that fresh brightness. It&#x27;s a must for any regimen at this price!</li>
    <li> Works fast, improved tone and texture for you skin. Helps you look your best.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this and it was not as great as I thought it would be. It made my skin red as soon as I put it on. I have very sensitive skin so I would advise if you do as well not to try this product. Other than that this is a really good product just not for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My skin feels softer and smoother after using this product. I have very fine lines and that are barely noticeable and I can tell that with continued use they will go away. I like that it absorbs quickly into the skin and doesnt feel greasy. I use it every day and sometimes twice a day</li>
    <li> Not sure product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but nothing magical. Won&#x27;t order again. It sure didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Can&#x27;t tell any difference. Guaranteed?????  Huuummmmmm.......</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product! I have been looking for a good moisturizer and anti aging cream for me and this stopped me from searching. Thank you. I will order another one</li>
    <li> Great for wrinkles, use at night. As it can dry your skin if you wear it in the sun. Make sure you use sun block</li>
    <li> I really do love these products in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using them.  The serums are my favorite.  And I&#x27;m excited to try the Scar Cream on my acne scars on my face and I want to see if it works for my strech marks on my belly from my prenancies.  I started using all of these products on my belly a couple of days ago to see if they help reduce the appearance of my stretch marks and help the sagging belly skin from my pregnancies as well.  I also love how these help keep my skin clearer from acne and blackheads, my pores are starting to look smaller, my skin isn&#x27;t as oily and my dark spots are fading.  I can almost go out without any face powder cover up now.  My skin is looking more even and my deep forehead lines seem to be getting less noticable.  Best skin care I&#x27;ve ever used so far, and I&#x27;ve used a lot!  Plus, I LOVE the price of these, especially when there are these kinds of discounts and discounts for buying multiple products, since I always buy in bulk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had acne prone skin that has a lot of texture and that gets super oily.  I took accutane as a teenager but I still get hormonal acne and I&#x27;ll be 40 next year!  I started getting age spots as well and deep wrinkels in my forehead (expression lines) that I wasn&#x27;t too happy about on top of the acne.  This whole skin care line is so great and makes my skin look and feel amazing!  I LOVE it and am so glad I found it!</li>
