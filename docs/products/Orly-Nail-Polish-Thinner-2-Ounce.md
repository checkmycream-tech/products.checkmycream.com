### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have used Orly thinner before, and it works beautifully.  </li>
      <li>Works great, even on non-Orly polishes.  </li>
      <li>I have polishes that are ancient, and a couple of drops,  and they are good to go.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>Plus, this thinner does NOT contain heptane, an ingredient that can dissolve any shimmer/glitter particles in many popular polishes.</li>
      <li>It has a dropper top</li>
      <li>The dropper tip makes it easy to use, too.</li>
      <li>I had ordered this item before and it works fine for me.</li>
      <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like my last nail polish thinner (from another brand).</li>
      <li>perfect for bringing life back to older nail polishes</li>
      <li>Have you ever bought a polish where you loved the color but the polish itself was so thick and gooey that it was hard/impossible to apply nicely?</li>
      <li>gave 4/5 because, based on having to use more, this may not stretch as far as you think it will.</li>
      <li>I saw this thinner and bought it right away.  </li>
      <li>However, the product works well and made the polish the right consistency without affecting pigment or drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You need to use a lot more of the product to get the results you want and it seems like the polish doesn&#x27;t stay thinned out for more then a few weeks.  </li>
      <li>Helped to resurrect several of my favorite nailpolishes.</li>
      <li>My local beauty shop had a polish thinner that didn&#x27;t have a dropper top...</li>
      <li>This absolutely did not thin out any of the 5 polishes i used it for.</li>
      <li>Works great -- a couple of drops brings gloppy, thick nail polish back to life.</li>
      <li>I can put it away in a high place in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
      <li>The nail polish I used it with is high quality and isn&#x27;t excessively old, it just needed to be thinned.</li>
      <li>I love this brand because I have tried it in the past.</li>
      <li>It has allowed me to revamp and use nail polishes that I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use anymore as it got all dried up!</li>
      <li>I have a couple of old polishes that I wish I could bring back to life.</li>
      <li>and if you buy quality polish this is worth it and will last for years as you only need a few drops now and then.  </li>

<li> Seems to work without watering down the polish like some do.</li>
<li> Your polish will have reacted and will move with less viscosity like it should.</li>
<li> This has helped me out a lot with some polishes that were unwearable because they had dried out a bit while sitting on the store shelves.</li>
<li> I have used nail polish remover to thin a thick polish but this is easier with the pointed tip that makes no mess.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t throw away your slow flow nail polishes.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not available in drug stores and expensive in cosmetic stores.</li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t acetone, I read that it&#x27;s a bad idea to thin with acetone.</li>
<li> Bad hopeful purchase for me</li>
<li> This product is quality and the price tag is not that bad.</li>

    <li> I saw this thinner and bought it right away.  I have used nail polish remover to thin a thick polish but this is easier with the pointed tip that makes no mess.  Way to go Orly another winner.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Polish remover is not a substitute for thinner and if you buy quality polish this is worth it and will last for years as you only need a few drops now and then.  It&#x27;s not available in drug stores and expensive in cosmetic stores.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t throw away your slow flow nail polishes. Use this to revive. It&#x27;s like Floetrol(R) for paint.  Didn&#x27;t seem to affect color. This isn&#x27;t acetone, I read that it&#x27;s a bad idea to thin with acetone. It has a dropper top so it&#x27;s convenient. I can put it away in a high place in the medicine cabinet.  My local beauty shop had a polish thinner that didn&#x27;t have a dropper top...</li>
    <li> Seems to work without watering down the polish like some do.</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like my last nail polish thinner (from another brand).</li>
    <li> perfect for bringing life back to older nail polishes</li>
    <li> This product is quality and the price tag is not that bad. You need to learn a trick though. Put in double the drops that the bottles says to and then let it sit for a night. Your polish will have reacted and will move with less viscosity like it should.</li>
    <li> This absolutely did not thin out any of the 5 polishes i used it for. It made it clumpy. I thought i was adding enough but it turns out it just doesnt work. Bad hopeful purchase for me</li>
    <li> I love this brand because I have tried it in the past. It has allowed me to revamp and use nail polishes that I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use anymore as it got all dried up!</li>
    <li> Have you ever bought a polish where you loved the color but the polish itself was so thick and gooey that it was hard/impossible to apply nicely? Try thinner. This has helped me out a lot with some polishes that were unwearable because they had dried out a bit while sitting on the store shelves. (Or maybe the manufacturer just made them too thick in the first place.) Plus, this thinner does NOT contain heptane, an ingredient that can dissolve any shimmer/glitter particles in many popular polishes. The dropper tip makes it easy to use, too.</li>
    <li> Have only used it a couple of times, but it did the job!</li>
    <li> Works great -- a couple of drops brings gloppy, thick nail polish back to life.</li>
    <li> I am giving this a five, even though I have not yet used it.  I have used Orly thinner before, and it works beautifully.  I have polishes that are ancient, and a couple of drops,  and they are good to go.</li>
    <li> Does what&#x27;s expected. I wish it was a bit stronger. I have a couple of old polishes that I wish I could bring back to life.</li>
    <li> The recommended usage is &amp;#34;1-2 drops&amp;#34; but I ended up having to use about 7 or 8. The nail polish I used it with is high quality and isn&#x27;t excessively old, it just needed to be thinned. However, the product works well and made the polish the right consistency without affecting pigment or drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4/5 because, based on having to use more, this may not stretch as far as you think it will.</li>
    <li> You need to use a lot more of the product to get the results you want and it seems like the polish doesn&#x27;t stay thinned out for more then a few weeks.  I will probably try another brand next time.</li>
    <li> Works great, even on non-Orly polishes.  Helped to resurrect several of my favorite nailpolishes.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this item before and it works fine for me.</li>
