      <li>Thanks for a wonderful product :0</li>
      <li>Like the scrub better than salt scrubs.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use moisturizer after scrubbing my face with this product -- and it&#x27;s genuinely organic!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>Love that it is USDA organic without any chemicals, pesticides or junk in it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this scrub.  </li>
      <li>I actually did taste it once, and it was delicious...</li>
      <li>Smells great and appears to work well on my skin, so far, but is a bit &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>It is very oily, but good oils and</li>
      <li>CALIFORNIA&#x27;S WATER IS NOT THE BEST FOR THE SKIN,THE SCRUB REALLY HELPS YOUR SKIN TO STAY SMOOTH AND SOFT.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite sugar scrubs---love this fragrance----very clean and light.  </li>
      <li>super natural and super cheap for the ingredients, best deal out there, and super oily</li>
      <li>Smells great and makes my skin super soft.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s available to auto ship</li>
      <li>Just use it like a normal body scrub, it smells amazing and makes you feel clean.</li>
      <li>which is great for dry skin</li>
      <li>I love the smell, it smells up the whole bathroom.</li>
      <li>You can really smell the lemongrass the most.</li>
      <li>My Favorite sauna salts so far!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam or bubble as I recall, but natural, organic HEALTHY cleaners do not all get bubbly.</li>
      <li>well so you won&#x27;t slip, but worth it for how well it works.  </li>
      <li>Definately worth the money</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s greatest let down is the formula has too much coconut oil, a cleansing oil, and not enough moisturizers.</li>
      <li>it in hot water first.</li>
      <li>and it makes my skin feel super soft and hydrated!</li>
      <li>Very unsatisfactory and unusable product.</li>
      <li>I really like this sugar scrub.</li>
      <li>It left my skin feeling rejuvenated, smooth, and well hydrated.</li>
      <li>It was not as fragrant as i thought it would be-i love lemongrass, but this did not have as much scent as the other brands i have used</li>
      <li>My only word of warning: one of the ingredients is an oil that solidifies below a certain temperature.</li>
      <li>For one it doesnt sting the skin at all, gentle enough for the face as well.</li>
      <li>oh so soft.</li>
      <li>My skin is sooo soft after using it.</li>
      <li>I think it should last a longer time than my other sugar &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; because it is more solid.  </li>
      <li>I love the subtle quality of the smell which wakes me up, but does not overwhelm my lotions and perfume.</li>
      <li>This makes it difficult to scoop out of the container unless it is really warm or you \\&quot;thaw\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I use it for my face right now as I&#x27;ve been having trouble with dry skin</li>

<li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of sugar scrubs, but this won&#x27;t be in my bag of goodies!</li>
<li> /&gt;However, as mentioned above, the sloshing is messy and stressful when you use it in the bath; especially when all you have is a shower.</li>
<li> The sugar was too corse making it a bit rough on my skin.</li>
<li> so you have to be careful and rinse the shower floor</li>
<li> I spent a ton of energy plunging my tub drain</li>
<li> i dont even have to use any other lotions or oils.</li>
<li> This one leaves you feeling slightly</li>
<li> Also, the container leaked oil in the shipping box, making quite a mess.</li>
<li> If you get overly aggressive with your scrubbing it can burn a little.  </li>
<li> This leaves your skin moisturized and gets rid of any dead skin cells.  </li>
<li> The lemony citrusy scent is intoxicating, when used correctly, on dried skin and then rinsed, makes your body feel like silk.  </li>
<li> I learned the hard way last winter that the oil can build up and  solidify in your pipes when it is cold outside.</li>
<li> but I am not sure what scrub you will find that isn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Kinda messy!</li>
<li> at least the after effects aren&#x27;t as cloying as the Burt&#x27;s Bees one.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s about 82F now, and this scrub just keeps sloshing around; very messy in the bath!</li>
<li> becaue I hate bending to put on lotion.</li>

    <li> One of my favorite sugar scrubs---love this fragrance----very clean and light.  This leaves your skin moisturized and gets rid of any dead skin cells.  Great for my sun abused skin :0  Thanks for a wonderful product :0</li>
    <li> I picked this product solely based off the reviews. I&#x27;m so glad that I did. I tried it this morning and was amazed.  It wasn&#x27;t too abrasive. The scent is wonderful.  It left my skin feeling rejuvenated, smooth, and well hydrated. I used it all over. I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;m sticking with this.</li>
    <li> The packaging on the product that I received was different than picture here.  If you get overly aggressive with your scrubbing it can burn a little.  All in all a good scrub.</li>
    <li> I really like this sugar scrub. For one it doesnt sting the skin at all, gentle enough for the face as well. It is very oily, but good oils and i like that.I love the smell, it smells up the whole bathroom. You can really smell the lemongrass the most. Once you towel off the product, you still feel incredibly moisturized, and i like that the most about the product. i dont even have to use any other lotions or oils.</li>
    <li> super natural and super cheap for the ingredients, best deal out there, and super oily which is great for dry skin</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT,I GREW UP IN THE ISLANDS THEN MOVED TO CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA&#x27;S WATER IS NOT THE BEST FOR THE SKIN,THE SCRUB REALLY HELPS YOUR SKIN TO STAY SMOOTH AND SOFT.</li>
    <li> I have started using this during the last trimester of my pregnancy becaue I hate bending to put on lotion. This stuff has been my life saver in the shower. Yes it is slippery but I am not sure what scrub you will find that isn&#x27;t. Definately worth the money and this is my second time ordering.</li>
    <li> I use it for my face right now as I&#x27;ve been having trouble with dry skin and it makes my skin feel super soft and hydrated! I don&#x27;t need to use moisturizer after scrubbing my face with this product -- and it&#x27;s genuinely organic! I will definitely stack up on it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so organic you can eat. I actually did taste it once, and it was delicious...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it is for your skin. Just use it like a normal body scrub, it smells amazing and makes you feel clean. It doesn&#x27;t foam or bubble as I recall, but natural, organic HEALTHY cleaners do not all get bubbly. Bubbles are a really the result of harsh chemicals, such as Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which is NOT in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST!</li>
    <li> Very unsatisfactory and unusable product. The coconut oil separated and solidified. Stirring did not reconstitute it to a sugar scrub. The effect was like smearing shortening on my skin.</li>
    <li> The sugar was too corse making it a bit rough on my skin. However, it&#x27;s greatest let down is the formula has too much coconut oil, a cleansing oil, and not enough moisturizers. I&#x27;m a long time fan of sugar scrubs, but this won&#x27;t be in my bag of goodies!</li>
    <li> Kinda messy! It&#x27;s about 82F now, and this scrub just keeps sloshing around; very messy in the bath! It&#x27;s also quite sticky.... but hey.. at least the after effects aren&#x27;t as cloying as the Burt&#x27;s Bees one. This one leaves you feeling slightly moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as mentioned above, the sloshing is messy and stressful when you use it in the bath; especially when all you have is a shower.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it every day. Grateful it&#x27;s available to auto ship so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells great and leaves my skin silky smooth. My only word of warning: one of the ingredients is an oil that solidifies below a certain temperature. This makes it difficult to scoop out of the container unless it is really warm or you \\&quot;thaw\\&quot; it in hot water first. This also poses a problem in the winter with plumbing. I learned the hard way last winter that the oil can build up and  solidify in your pipes when it is cold outside. I spent a ton of energy plunging my tub drain and I will only use this product during the summer months now.</li>
    <li> contents solidify and can not be used until warmed up....usually not usable even by the end of my shower.</li>
    <li> My Favorite sauna salts so far!</li>
    <li> Smells great and appears to work well on my skin, so far, but is a bit &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;.  I think it should last a longer time than my other sugar &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; because it is more solid.  It does make for a slippery shower though!  I love the subtle quality of the smell which wakes me up, but does not overwhelm my lotions and perfume.</li>
    <li> Like the scrub better than salt scrubs. The scent is great and I was worried about it be weird or too strong. My skin is sooo soft after using it. I scrub before I shave my legs and they come out smoother. Great product, I will buy again. Love that it is USDA organic without any chemicals, pesticides or junk in it.</li>
    <li> The oil separates from the sugar scrub and has to be stirred/mixed every time I use it.  Also, the container leaked oil in the shipping box, making quite a mess.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my skin super soft.  I use in the shower so you have to be careful and rinse the shower floor well so you won&#x27;t slip, but worth it for how well it works.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> A luxury product with a wonderful scent.  A gift for she and he, purchased 3 Fiji products all are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!  I pair it with the organic coconut oil. I use the polish weekly and it keeps my skin oh so soft.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this scrub.  The lemony citrusy scent is intoxicating, when used correctly, on dried skin and then rinsed, makes your body feel like silk.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> It was not as fragrant as i thought it would be-i love lemongrass, but this did not have as much scent as the other brands i have used</li>
