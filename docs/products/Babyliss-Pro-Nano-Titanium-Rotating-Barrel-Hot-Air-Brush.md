      <li>What I was seeking with this implement was more body and a way to control my cowlick.</li>
      <li>I do love this thing.  </li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m not the most coordinated of people.  </li>

      <li>your money and find a  better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I loved it so much</li>

      <li>And it is really easy to clean and easy to get the hair out.</li>
      <li>I also recommend the Solano Supersolano hair dryer (which, if you buy the black/red combo of the BaByliss, matches nicely), which dries your hair extremely fast (two minutes with that, three or so minutes with this, and chin-length hair is DONE).</li>
      <li>took to smooth my hair out.  </li>
      <li>And really, it is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I got the same great styling tool.  </li>
      <li>While I was certainly happy with this model, it was not quite up to par with its European counterpart, hence the 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
      <li>Now she looks fabulous too.</li>
      <li>Blowouts are fabulous but expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush makes the process so easy and quick.  </li>
      <li>super easy to use....</li>
      <li>I like it, quick and easy to use.</li>
      <li>My wife was really excited about this item and uses it every day.  </li>
      <li>I am pretty sure</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have the Conair one as well, but I like this one better if I am in a hurry.  It seems to be a little more powerful.</li>
    <li> This product does not work for my coarse, thick, curly hair.  I thought that the barrel would be hotter and that it would help in straightening my hair.  For me, it only combs it out and makes it frizzy.  I&#x27;m sure this works much better for someone that has thinner, less curly hair.  I will say that the rotating barrel is strong and it has not tangled in my hair.  That it a true sign of the integrity of the item.</li>
    <li> The heat is not strong enough to hold my style</li>
    <li> Ooh, I love it!  I didn&#x27;t have high hopes but I learned how to use it in like 5 seconds.  I could never do a round brush and hairdryer by myself,  but I can do this. I dry my hair with a hairdryer part way then use this.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> This is great for a volume boost. Makes my hair a bit greasy, but I spray it with dry shampoo before using and it works great!</li>
    <li> My hair is big. My hair is a lot. It takes me a long time to comb it. This does the work for me! Very helpful.</li>
    <li> Omg I am in love with this dryer! I have thick coarse/curly hair and for the first time ever I just blew my hair straight in the same time it took to dry curly! No more flat iron for me! This is awesome! Just have to practice with the rotation feature to make sure I don&#x27;t get it stuck again lol! :-)</li>
    <li> This Hot Brush was definitely a good purchase! It is a good combination of brush and hot air. I chose this model since I thought it would be the most similar to the Babyliss Big Hair hot air brush which I had in Europe. While I was certainly happy with this model, it was not quite up to par with its European counterpart, hence the 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
    <li> Great air brush. I love how easy is to do my hair every day. So easy to use and makes my hair shiner.  Definitely a great product to buy</li>
    <li> It takes a couple of times to get good at using it. It is great at keeping those flyaways tamed. My hair is thick and fine. It is shoulder length, maybe a bit longer, and I love the salon blowout look it gives me. I never like using the brush and blower at the same time. I used to just blow it dry, then style it with rollers or the blowdryer. With this, I just turn my head over and blow dry all the hair next to my head and leave the ends damp. It takes just about 15-20 minutes to finish it with this hot air brush. It feels so bouncy and moves so easily. My flyaways are gone and if I then roll it, it looks so nice. It feels just the same as when I leave the salon. I love this brush!!!!!! Just twirl it around and give it a cool shot. And it is really easy to clean and easy to get the hair out.</li>
    <li> I love what this product does - and it works well, but the barrel is enormous. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t read more of the reviews to determine this, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t do much more than my hair dryer and I still want to use a curling iron after I&#x27;ve used the hot air brush, and this tool was supposed to help me cut down on tools. Oh well. Do yourself a favor and buy the red one. No idea how the blue one can be worth $30 more...</li>
    <li> This rotating hot air brush is wonderful to make your hair appear fuller &amp; more in control.  I love it.  The rotating brush is wonderful.  Is does snarl or kink your hair.  It is well designed &amp; made.  I have naturally curly hair &amp; it brings it under control.  My daughter has wavy hair &amp; gives her the body she desires.  If you have a lot of hair that needs managing, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Took a few days to get the hang of it. Now it&#x27;s very easy to get fab looking hair in less then 10 min.  No fear of getting burned either!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not so much powerful so I have to spend more time on doing it</li>
    <li> I wore out my wrist using a large brush while blow drying my long hair.  This brush makes the process so easy and quick.  No more wrist pain.</li>
    <li> it was not hot enough for thick hair, does not work well....a regular blow dryer works better...will keep looking... dont waste your money on this</li>
    <li> super easy to use....if u have thick hair don&#x27;t get this the brush is soft so you will have to work in small amounts and what he point in that but it does work really well.</li>
    <li> To start off, let me say that my hair is very fine and in a chin length bob. It generally dries quickly and smooth enough with whatever dryer I use. What I was seeking with this implement was more body and a way to control my cowlick. I am having relative success, though not &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34; as others are experiencing. I have had a couple of practice sessions now and here are my observations: (1) though lightweight and fairly easy to hold, you must maintain a certain pressure to keep tension on the hair and not let it roll tightly in a snarled knot. This is not a difficult move to master, but it does cause fatigue after a time. (2) It sure isn&#x27;t intuitive to me which way to spin the barrel at any given point, but it doesn&#x27;t matter much -- one can easily correct their mistake with no style harm done, then keep working in the same area with the same spin. (3) Dry time was a disappointment to me. Even with my fine hair and a good towel dry, it takes longer to dry my hair than other hot air brushes I have owned. I suppose that is due to only using 500 watts. But the result is better, so a fair trade-off. (4) Unless your hair is very long, this isn&#x27;t an implement for curling. The diameter of the barrel is too large. But with practice and a dab of styling product, I think exceptional volume is achievable. (I am almost there.)</li>
    <li> i had conair rotating air brush but i gave to my mom. she likes conair air brush. i like it alot.&lt;br /&gt;i need a new rotating brush so i order babyliss. this one makes funny noise . sounds like you cutting metal i am thinking should i return or keep it. other than the noise it works same as conair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this one after my old one (different brand) burned out.  This works better as a styling tool than as a real hair dryer</li>
    <li> Bought this quite a while ago, but it still is working great.  Especially nice for smoothing curly hair</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but work well!</li>
    <li> I had the Conair Brush, however they changed it, the brush roll too tight and tangled by hair. Not only that it heats is to hot and created major static. Why do they change a product that worked so well. Anyway then I had find another this one is even better. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Tangles and does not have enough power to curl or dry hair which is only slightly damp.  The Rowenta is better but cannot be used&lt;br /&gt;in US.</li>
    <li> I dont like because the rotating is staked</li>
    <li> I have a conair spin which I love ,(have used for a year)  and thought this one whould be even better as a name brand you can only buy at high end stores. When I went to use it screeched and bogged down with my hair wrapped around the brisles. I could not use , went back to my old faithful conair and sent this one back.</li>
    <li> I needed a new one since the first one I purchased I have had for about 3 yrs.  It is getting worn out, so I thought I would &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; from the Conair.  These products are exactly the same.  Nonetheless, I do not regret my purchase since the price wasn&#x27;t any worse &amp; I got the same great styling tool.  I do love this thing.  It is my favorite slyer as it is very simple to use &amp; it cuts way down on styling time in the morning.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Revo hairstyler. The battery did not charge after using it for many many years and seeking a replacement proved to be a scam so I tried the Babyliss Pro. Excellent. I use it with a blow dryer. One hand holds the Babyliss and the other hand holds the blow dryer. I have thick, medium length, naturally curly hair and it is straightened to perfection with this tool each and every time!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Styling my hair take half the time with this rotating barrel dryer. I semi dry my hair with a blower and then use the Babyliss Pro Nano and it curls both ways and if you don&#x27;t try to do too big sections at a time it doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair at all? Great product!</li>
    <li> I like it, quick and easy to use. Good for Daily styling.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have a little longer than shoulder length hair, thin. It give me body and a little curl without the curling iron! Trick is to leave it rotating in one section at a time and be sure your hair is already almost dry. Like get out if the shower, get dressed, do your makeup then your hair. I give it four stars because I wish the barrel was a little smaller</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Couldn&#x27;t be more happy with how May hair looks after using it.  Would highly recommend .</li>
    <li> love this brush curler thingy, it makes my mornings go so smoothly, and its great for my hair too</li>
    <li> just for the first day using this product, it had given me bad impression on this product.&lt;br /&gt;first the barrel moves too slow..and sometimes it didn&#x27;t move at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it had a funny noise like a metal going to burst out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today marks the 2 weeks ive used this product and in less than 5 times using it.. this hot air brush finally &#x27;meet its creator&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it stops all of a sudden. GONE AND DAMAGED. I am pretty sure ITS NOT MY FAULT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not even bother looking at this BABYLISS product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and find a  better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I SHOULD HAVE TRUST THOSE EARLIER REVIEW ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use it to straighten and style my wavy hair instead of using my flat iron hoping it would cause less damage. This thing is a waste of time and doesn&#x27;t give you the results. It pulls on your hair and causes them to break. It doesn&#x27;t provide enough heat to style your hair either. I returned mine and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really loved the way my hair looked after using it. However, my hair is long fine and curly and breaks easily. Every time I used it and cleaned the brush I had to much hair loss. Just to much pulling broke off my ends. Also, it takes to long to dry. Need to use a regular dryer and then finish with the nano. It straightens nicely and my hair stayed sleek for days. IF MY HAIR DIDNT BREAK SO MUCH I WOULD OF RATED HIGHER AND KEPT IT.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair that responds well to styling tools, but tends to fall flat throughout the day. I was looking for something to add volume that lasts. I used this twice and was a little disappointed because it seemed to have the same effect as blow drying with a round brush, until I watched a YouTube tutorial and realized I wasn&#x27;t using it on each section of hair for a long enough time. I tried again and va-va-voom! I really like it, but will probably need more practice until I achieve the results I&#x27;m after. But so far, I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> The Best&lt;br /&gt;Purchaser and price</li>
    <li> I USED TO COMPLAIN about Frizzy hair all the time but not anymore! &#x3D;) this babyliss Pro Nano brush is amazing does all the work for you it spins and drys leaving your hair super soft and shiny my hair in coarse and naturally curly it used to be a pain trying to comb it and do anything with it, now I have it down to about 10 minutes!</li>
    <li> The basics: I don&#x27;t have much patience for hair. I keep mine in a blunt bob that is slightly longer than chin length and has bangs. Usually I let my hair air dry, then flat iron the frizzy parts into submission. It looks presentable, if a bit limp. I don&#x27;t care enough to spend more than five minutes styling it and any tool I use has to be fast and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hot air brush is exactly what my hair needs. I let my hair dry 90% of the way, then lean forward and run the hot air brush through it a few times with my hair hanging down. Unbelievable volume! My hair went from &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; to a Pantene commercial. The bounce! The shine! The lack of frizz! When I first used it I cursed so loudly in amazement that my husband ran upstairs, thinking I&#x27;d hurt myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is fine with loose, natural curls. I am petite (5&#x27;1&amp;#34;) with very small hands and had no trouble holding or manipulating the brush. The controls are simple and easy to use. I have the red model, which I bought locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note: this is not a hair dryer. It is just for finishing.Your hair has to be mostly dry already before using it.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to figure the spinning but I like how easy and fast to dry my hair now.</li>
    <li> It works great, however, I bought it as a backup to a blue BaByliss I bought locally. My hair seems to get caught more on this version. The blue BaByliss is definitely smoother. This one works great though as long as you take it slow.</li>
    <li> even on long hair it didnt work very well</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of it - it works great.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love that it dries my hair, while rotating the brush at the same time, leaving it very shiny and static-free!! I loved it so much I bought a second one to have in my gym locker to use after my workouts!</li>
    <li> I love it - now if they would only make this with a battery and also one with a eurpopean plug for travel!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair dryer/brush! I get so many compliments on how full and soft my hair is now!  Works great without pulling my hair. I do notice a lag in the speed when in reverse, but it doesn&#x27;t change the end result. Wish it came in a 1 &amp; 1/2 in barrel, that would be great too!</li>
    <li> Too big a barrel for my hair. Will give to someone who can use it seeing I didn&#x27;t save the package to return it. I have one similar with a smaller barrel and it works great. This one was just too big for my hair style.</li>
    <li> I returned this item because i received a defective one, it would not rotate on low. I used it on high and the my hair is fine and layered... shoulder length, which just spun my hair straight, could not get volume at the roots of my hair. A two inch diameter brush is not suited for my hair style. My hair did not get tangled in this dryer and it was easy to switch hands and angles. With this said with the right hair length this would styler would work okay.</li>
    <li> My hair was a nightmare, thick, coarse, wavy, colored, and very long.  Blowouts are fabulous but expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes my hair look just like I have had a blowout in 1/4 the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never tangles or damages my hair.  I just towel dry my hair and let it dry then use this for 10-15 minutes to make it look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even bought one for my mom.  Now she looks fabulous too. Now I only need this for travel.  Bye Bye flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this hot air rotating brush -- works fast and there&#x27;s no frizz when you&#x27;re done!</li>
    <li> Babyliss Rotating Hot Air Brush Nano Titanium Technology comes in two colors red $34.68 &amp; Blue $54.99, and is identical in every way to the Infiniti Pro by Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler $39.05, with the exception of the barrel technology (Nano Titanium versus Ceramic-Ionic respectively). I just would like to understand why such big difference in the price tag? Yes I know Babyliss and Conair is just one thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy both the Babyliss Rotating Hot Air Brush Nano Titanium Technology in red $34.68 (amazon.com), and Infiniti Pro by Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler in black $39.05 (wal-mart), because I need to test which technology (Babyliss Nano or the Conair ceramic/ionic), works better for my naturally curly hair.  During the test I&#x27;ve used the same hair shampoo/conditioner/heat protector, after 2 months I could figure out that the Rotating Hot Air Brush Babyliss Nano technology leaves my hair very smooth/shine and works better when the humidity is low, and the Infiniti Pro by Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler ceramic/ionic technology is really good for the high humidity days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like both rotating hot air brush, because straight my hair pretty good without the need of perform repeated motions with my wrist (I have tendency to develop RMDs). However, I give it a 4 star because the wattage of both spin air brushes is away to low (500 W). Normally, right after uses any rotating hot air brush to straight my hair, I need the final touch of a powerful 2000 Watts hair dryer to really remove all the moisture.</li>
    <li> I use this tool to straighten my baby fine, highlighted hair instead of a straightener.  I find it to be more gentle on my hair and it give it more lift at the roots which I prefer.  I like to blow dry my hair at the roots and then use this took to smooth my hair out.  I rarely wore my hair straight before I discovered this tool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for over a month and I was super excited to use this product, BUT there are some issues I have with this hot air brush. 1) Your hair should be 95%-100% dry for this tool. To me, this is more of a finishing tool, like a flat iron.  2) In my opinion the air doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. I started using my blow dryer and this brush at the same time. Kinda defeating the purpose of this hair tool...... 3) the bristles don&#x27;t really grab the hair very well. I have below shoulder, above bra strap length, normal to thick, semi wavy hair and even with small sections of hair, my hair seems to glide on top of the bristles. I purchased the red version and I think I&#x27;ll be returning. I&#x27;m really sad, not too many options for a barrel this size.</li>
    <li> Very very crappy, slow and not powerful at all hair dryer, complete waste of time and money, what a joke.</li>
    <li> Purchased this brush for my wife and she didn&#x27;t much care for its huge handle.  Her small hands couldn&#x27;t properly hold the brush for styling her hair.  It did get the job done even if it was too hard to handle.  It worked but is only really good for people with larger hands to handle this behemoth.</li>
    <li> This air brush works OK and makes your hair shine like stated. It helps keep the hair from being so fly away. The head &amp; handle are large and very bulky so is a bit hard to use if you have hands that are older. I would not return it as I like it well enough when I have time to do my hair but would not get another one for a friend</li>
    <li> So, I think this one is the same as the blue one.  It&#x27;s a 2 inch barrel.  First of all, let me start out by saying I have long, thin hair that frizzes easily and lots of hair.  Thick, but thin. Also, I&#x27;m not the most coordinated of people.  When I had shoulder length, layered hair, I could use a round brush with skills.  Now that my hair is longer, my arms aren&#x27;t long enough :-).  So, the first time I used this, it took me a while to get used to spinning the brush the right way.  The second time, I used a clip to hold my hair up that I wasn&#x27;t spinning and I did a little better.  It really doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair very well, so I definitely have to get it almost fully dry with the blow dryer first.  But it does do a good job of picking up my hair and smoothing it out just like a round brush and blow dryer would.  It doesn&#x27;t really provide waves for me, but it does smooth the frizz, while giving volume and turns the ends under slightly.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s a great back up to a flat iron with a lot less damage.  It&#x27;s not going to give you completely stick straight hair, but it does seem to eliminate the frizz for me and give it a little body.</li>
    <li> A bit spendy (why the 4 stars) -- but I really like this rotating brush.  I also own the Conair one.  They look identical and both are good.  This one grips my hair tighter, seems to be hotter, and has the titanium barrel -- but it is more difficult to control because of its &amp;#34;trigger&amp;#34; action. Without learning to control this, there is a risk of pulling out or breaking some hair.  However, by allowing it to spin briefly in short spurts and not continuously, I can control it.  The result is excellent. The titanium barrel truely does get more of the friz out than the Conair brush.</li>
    <li> I have fine, shoulder-length hair and need all the volume I can muster.  The large circumference of this hot air brush does wonders to add great volume without curling too much.  I lack the manual dexterity to hold both a round hair brush and blow dryer, so I prefer a hot air brush.  After killing my 3rd Conair, I choose this brand because my hairdresser recommended the BaByliss Pro titanium series.  This product would probably not work if your hair is longer than shoulder length or if you had very thick or coarse hair.  The motor is quiet and, most importantly, doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
    <li> I like it, and it no damage the hair.</li>
    <li> I love this rotating brush/blow dryer!  It sure beats holding a rolling brush and a hair dryer!  Clip hair up, start at the bottom sections of hair and dry a small portion of your hair at a time. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I do not have a lot of patience when it comes to beauty.  If it&#x27;s not comfortable or fast, I don&#x27;t do it.  But I have a chin-length bob and was sick of it looking terrible all the time.  I have never been able to master the salon trick of using the round brush with the hair dryer (and the stylist always pulls my hair anyway, which hurts), so was mostly resigned to looking unstylish/sloppy most of the time.  Until I found this thing.  And really, it is fantastic.  I spend five minutes, total (that&#x27;s with the real hair dryer AND this brush), no styling products at all, and I look as good as I do when I walk out of the salon.  You have to be careful with how you hold it, or your hair can get stuck between the part that spins and the part that doesn&#x27;t, but given that you can choose whether or not it spins, and the direction of the spin (which enables you to use it equally between your two hands on both sides of your head), that&#x27;s pretty easy.  I also recommend the Solano Supersolano hair dryer (which, if you buy the black/red combo of the BaByliss, matches nicely), which dries your hair extremely fast (two minutes with that, three or so minutes with this, and chin-length hair is DONE).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very adept at doing anything with my hair so I thought this would be another product that sat in the cabinet. Not so - this has changed me from a ponytail girl to a woman who &amp;#34;does&amp;#34; her hair!</li>
    <li> Must have for short hair that doesn&#x27;t require a lot of styling. Perfect for quick touch-ups on a bob style cut.</li>
    <li> Love this.  cant do my hair without it.</li>
    <li> My wife was really excited about this item and uses it every day.  She first experienced the use at her Beauty Shop.</li>
    <li> At first, I was very excited to try this. It takes a little time to get used to the forward/backward curling.  I have to say, this product works for those who have lots of layers and need a little soft curl. you can not curl your hair with this product like you would with a curling iron.  It is also very heavy, so after holding it for a while and doing little bits of hair at a time,it gets very tiring.  The hot air it emits is also very warm air and curling your hair on a warm day is just not pleasant.  I have gone back to using my 2&amp;#34; curling iron instead.</li>
    <li> Really love this product and the ease of using it.  was scared it was going to get tangled in my hair but the rotating brush prevents that.  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this at first, but I mainly use this to blow out my bangs because I do not like curly bangs (I have naturally curly/wavy hair). This is very quiet and I love that and it doesn&#x27;t overheat. The brush on this tool grips my hair nicely without pulling on it.</li>
