      <li>Absolutely love this stuff!</li>
      <li>A marker would work better!</li>
      <li>It works great &amp; shampoos out easily.</li>
      <li>My wife liked this...</li>
      <li>Extends the life of a colour by about 10 days, and adds a nice bit of body to the root as well.</li>
      <li>This handy item is easy to use and works well!  </li>
      <li>Easy coverage - price is good as compared to others but still way overpriced for the product.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t apply with comb provided very easily.</li>
      <li>After waiting for more than 20 days for my Marker, I get one that is desiccated.  </li>
      <li>and it is much better for your roots to color again  </li>
      <li>and I like it better.</li>
      <li>It works ok.</li>
      <li>why pay more?</li>
      <li>This is a great product highly recommend it i have been using this for a while its safe clean and easy to use love the price on amazom A++</li>
      <li>Easy to use, does not rub off.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be easy</li>
      <li>Product is conveniently packaged, i.e. in a marker form and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>The product works fine.  </li>
      <li>and it still makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy to use compared with the original version ColorMark.  </li>
      <li>Great for touch up until I can get the grey dyed again.</li>
      <li>I tend to need to use a q-tip to clean up the areas I get the color on.</li>
      <li>It seemed  good enough, not perfectly great, but it covered pretty good, made me happy.</li>
      <li>Sooooooooooooo, it totally defeats the purpose of even using this product to &#x27;tide you over&#x27;; when you can&#x27;t color as soon as you would have liked; because this list of directions says you have to use the product....</li>
      <li>Works pretty good on my goatee but not absolute coverage.</li>
      <li>Coverage on grey roots is great and matches my natural brown color.</li>
      <li>The color does stay put pretty well without rubbing or flaking off.</li>
      <li>I like these, but they are higher priced than the style edit spray.  </li>
      <li>both arrived, I used this one first.</li>
      <li>It also has a funny odor.</li>
      <li>This product does the job but first application doesn&#x27;t always cover the gray, also comes off before shampooing.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
      <li>Works exactly as described - total cover, no flaking, easy to use.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s pretty much all I like.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered dark brown which is very dark brown and matched my hair color perfectly.</li>
      <li>My Mom wants one too and I&#x27;m waiting to find that price again.</li>
      <li>Thanks,  BELL</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, however, it doesnt&#x27; stay long, the grey roots show up next morning, but I am ok re-applying it....</li>
      <li>Really works to cover the gray, which means a longer time between professional hair coloring.</li>
      <li>I have tried a few of these types of cover ups and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I would still recommend this product over others because others tend to dry up quickly.</li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>w/the separate small wand, like this better.</li>
      <li>and hence I apply several times to the same spot to get adequate cover up.  </li>
      <li>but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing, worth it if you&#x27;re in desperate need of covering grays ASAP.</li>
      <li>The product is simple, fast and works just like it states it does.</li>
      <li>No mess.  </li>
      <li>It covers the grey really good especially when your hair is wet, it lets me wait a little longer before I go to salon</li>
      <li>It makes your roots like &#x27;stiff as a board&#x27; when dry, but that is actually ok I guess, BUT here&#x27;s the BIG problem.</li>
      <li>waited so long to rec&#x27;d it, I was very excited to use TouchBack Temporary Dark Brown Color Marker”; however, the marker was all dried up and wasn&#x27;t adding any brown color to my roots/hair.  </li>

<li> Also the dark brown looks natural</li>
<li> I would not recommend this to anybody with white hair rather than grey.</li>
<li> Lasts a few weeks then time for a new one</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t last on my gray roots - even with careful application.  </li>
<li> Not natural looking.  </li>
<li> They grey was still there after shampooed out.</li>
<li> I tried two other products before I found this one and have used it now for several years.</li>
<li> you have to color your hair when its dry</li>
<li> I am almost totally gray and dye my hair dark brown</li>
<li> It is a big mess &amp; rubs off on your clothes.</li>
<li> Wanted to touch up gray hair on my side burns &amp; other areas of hair while leaving some gray.</li>
<li> Prefer other products.  </li>
<li> The color runs if your hair gets wet!  </li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> And also not sure if it wirks on grey!</li>
<li> and then wash it out and then &#x27;look even worse&#x27; for at least 2-3 days ( go into hiding, haha)</li>
<li> My finger tips were black everytime</li>
<li> Scalp gets black.  </li>
<li> my black hair</li>
<li> It also stays on your scalp a little which I like.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s VERY dark.</li>
<li> am so angry because I wanted to sent it back</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
<li> and it is very messy.</li>
<li> It is hard to apply without getting on your scalp...</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t cover well, the tip of the marker is too hard.</li>
<li> I sent emails to the seller about the late delivery and the defective product.</li>
<li> I am a guy in his late 40&#x27;s.</li>
<li> The product is poorly designed, it is very hard to get hair roots colored, not worth to buy.</li>
<li> when  your hair is &#x27;dirty&#x27;, not freshly cleaned.</li>
<li> Shipping was very slow.</li>
<li> Waste of money!!!</li>
<li> , I find the liquid too thin</li>
<li> it is not easy to put on and I am afraid it will get on everything.</li>
<li> The worst of all is the total neglect by the seller.</li>
<li> I saw it advertised on the dr. oz show and said ill give it a try.</li>

    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work at all. They grey was still there after shampooed out.</li>
    <li> The product is poorly designed, it is very hard to get hair roots colored, not worth to buy.</li>
    <li> It works ok. It does rub off if you brushed or touch. Doesn&#x27;t flake off as claimed.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cover gray roots that well. You have to keep applying. Works like how mascara would anyway.&lt;br /&gt;So why pay more?</li>
    <li> Product is conveniently packaged, i.e. in a marker form and easy to apply.  Even though I like the product and it is a good cover up, I find the liquid too thin and hence I apply several times to the same spot to get adequate cover up.  I would still recommend this product over others because others tend to dry up quickly.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I saw it advertised on the dr. oz show and said ill give it a try. WOW!!!!!!!!! A product that actually works and works well. I feel and look ten years different. The product is simple, fast and works just like it states it does. I wont ever be caught without it. Thanks,  BELL</li>
    <li> I got a product that does this for 5$ on amazon and I like it better. I bought  both at the same time, because I def wanted the best thing . both arrived, I used this one first. It seemed  good enough, not perfectly great, but it covered pretty good, made me happy. It makes your roots like &#x27;stiff as a board&#x27; when dry, but that is actually ok I guess, BUT here&#x27;s the BIG problem. The directions said: wash this out BEFORE you color your hair. that  is impossible. you have to color your hair when its dry and it is much better for your roots to color again  when  your hair is &#x27;dirty&#x27;, not freshly cleaned. Sooooooooooooo, it totally defeats the purpose of even using this product to &#x27;tide you over&#x27;; when you can&#x27;t color as soon as you would have liked; because this list of directions says you have to use the product....and then wash it out and then &#x27;look even worse&#x27; for at least 2-3 days ( go into hiding, haha) before you can re-color.</li>
    <li> This handy item is easy to use and works well!  when you make your color selection, keep in mind that it dries a bit lighter than the color shows.</li>
    <li> This product is HORRIBLE. It smells like shoe polish.  It did not color my hair despite of all the times I applied it to my roots. It also left my roots stiff.&lt;br /&gt;I am so angry because I wanted to sent it back but the seller does not accept products that have been used. How would you know if the product is any good unless you try it!!!</li>
    <li> Great for touch up until I can get the grey dyed again. I tried two other products before I found this one and have used it now for several years.</li>
    <li> Did not like it at all.  Scalp gets black.  Not natural looking.  Prefer other products.  Couldn&#x27;t apply with comb provided very easily.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, easy to use, gives great coverage and doesn&#x27;t stain bedding etc. Can be used on keratin treated hair as well. Extends the life of a colour by about 10 days, and adds a nice bit of body to the root as well.</li>
    <li> I like the cob idea, which prevents the color from getting on your scalp. But that&#x27;s pretty much all I like. Applying the color is time consuming. And contrary to the product description the color comes off when you brush your hair or sleep. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am a guy in his late 40&#x27;s. Wanted to touch up gray hair on my side burns &amp; other areas of hair while leaving some gray. It works great &amp; shampoos out easily.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described - total cover, no flaking, easy to use. I need to keep an extra in my purse!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  My Mom wants one too and I&#x27;m waiting to find that price again. Hers will be a different color but I&#x27;ll keep check. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The color runs if your hair gets wet!  It also has a funny odor. Would not buy again.Very expensive! Not worth it.</li>
    <li> The color does stay put pretty well without rubbing or flaking off. It is hard to apply without getting on your scalp...I tend to need to use a q-tip to clean up the areas I get the color on.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few of these types of cover ups and this is my favorite. Its like a thich pen marker. It also stays on your scalp a little which I like. You can blend it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Difficult to use and not enough ink comes out of pen!  A marker would work better!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good on my goatee but not absolute coverage. Lasts a few weeks then time for a new one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to hide some gray hair, but didn&#x27;t want the hassle of the every 6 week coloring.  This I can just apply before work and go. I don&#x27;t have to hide all the gray just the majority and it still makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> My wife liked this...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered dark brown which is very dark brown and matched my hair color perfectly. It&#x27;s easy to apply, however, it doesnt&#x27; stay long, the grey roots show up next morning, but I am ok re-applying it....</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> The product works fine.  However, be advised that it will ruin any clothing or bed linens that it comes in contact with.  It will not wash out.  Buyer beware . . . ..</li>
    <li> I thought it would be easy it is not easy to put on and I am afraid it will get on everything. It is back to touch ups for me!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it covers the gray that well and it is very messy.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, did a great job,and was easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the Marker on Feb 3rd and it wasn&#x27;t delivered until the 26th.&lt;br /&gt;After waited so long to rec&#x27;d it, I was very excited to use TouchBack Temporary Dark Brown Color Marker”; however, the marker was all dried up and wasn&#x27;t adding any brown color to my roots/hair.  I sent emails to the seller about the late delivery and the defective product. I asked if they can ship me another replacement (one that can actually color my roots/hair).  I rec&#x27;d no response at all from the seller. After waiting for more than 20 days for my Marker, I get one that is desiccated.  The worst of all is the total neglect by the seller.</li>
    <li> Really works to cover the gray, which means a longer time between professional hair coloring.</li>
    <li> Easy coverage - price is good as compared to others but still way overpriced for the product. Good in emergency until I can dye</li>
    <li> Does not work well. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I like these, but they are higher priced than the style edit spray.  I started buying style edit.</li>
    <li> This product does the job but first application doesn&#x27;t always cover the gray, also comes off before shampooing. Maybe I&#x27;m not applying it correctly but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing, worth it if you&#x27;re in desperate need of covering grays ASAP.</li>
    <li> Works great between hair appointments.  Quick and easy to use compared with the original version ColorMark.  No mess.  No oder.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover well, the tip of the marker is too hard. I&#x27;d return it but don&#x27;t have the packing slip anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a great product highly recommend it i have been using this for a while its safe clean and easy to use love the price on amazom A++</li>
    <li> Easy to use, does not rub off. I was using their colormark w/the separate small wand, like this better. Also the dark brown looks natural w/my black hair, it&#x27;s VERY dark.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last on my gray roots - even with careful application.  Shipping was very slow.</li>
    <li> It didnt dye my white hair at all. It is not working!!!! Waste of money!!! I would not recommend this to anybody with white hair rather than grey. And also not sure if it wirks on grey!</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work so well. It is a big mess &amp; rubs off on your clothes. My finger tips were black everytime I touched my hair.</li>
    <li> It covers the grey really good especially when your hair is wet, it lets me wait a little longer before I go to salon</li>
    <li> The color stained my clothes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff! I do not have to color my hair as often! Coverage on grey roots is great and matches my natural brown color.</li>
    <li> Just like a magic marker - it is so eay to use! I am almost totally gray and dye my hair dark brown so I have to start using my marker around a week after I color it. It covers beautifully and no water needed.  Looks very natural.</li>
