      <li>But within a week I became very comfortable using this close shaving razor!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good razor but nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>but I can now say that my first use of it was very successful.</li>
      <li>Enjoy great razor where you decide how aggressive or not you want it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The price on this web site is out of the realm of belief.</li>
    <li> I tried Merkur&#x27;s adjustable after experimenting with over 50 razor blades, two safety razor, and a handful of straight razors, and this is the best option out there so far. If your beard is tricky or your skin nicks easily, this is a great place to start. The quality and craftsmanship is excellent and you can adjust it to your personal needs.</li>
    <li> Shaving with the Merkur Progress is like driving a Mercedes after getting out of dump truck. I really look forward to shaving now, even though wife thought I was crazy to spend that kind of money for a razor.  It was worth every penny I spent... a clean shave and don&#x27;t bleed like a stuck pig.</li>
    <li> This is a handy little DE razor, nice heft. As one gains experience in DE shaving, one can &amp;#34;flatten&amp;#34; the blade out from it&#x27;s original 30+ degree angle and work on a closer shave. As others have mentioned, the texture of this handle makes it slippery when your hands are soapy. I was able to correct by placing my thumb under the yellow base for more support, and rinsing my hands and the stem a little more often than the rougher-textured razor.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to go back to the old fashioned double edged safety razor and chose this one for my first.  Well, my first in about forty years.  I chose this one because it is adjustable and not much more money than the ones that are not adjustable.  I like the fact that it came with 10 Merkur blades so I could give them a try.  The blades are good but I am looking forward to trying some different blades recommended on Badger &amp; Blade.  Also, if you go to youtube and watch the shaving videos by Mantic59 (very helpful for beginners) this is the razor he recommends.    I almost dinged the razor for the plastic adjustment knob but it seems well made and works fine.  One tip, be sure to line up the marks when replacing the blade otherwise one side could stick out farther on one side than the other and lead to a nasty cut.    Good luck</li>
    <li> I have gone away from cartridge based shaving systems for about 8 months now, and I am glad to say I will never go back. It started with the Merkur HD, which was leaps and bounds above the quality you get from cartridge systems.  After shaving a while with the HD, I realized that I was still missing something. The ability to adjust my shave. I did my research and settled on the Progress from the same company. Wow, what a difference. I discovered that the distance from the safety bar to the blade was just too shallow for me. I tend to let my facial hair grow 2-3 days before I shave. I do this because of sensitive skin. With the setting at hair passed 2, I get a shave that I have been waiting for since I started shaving. That was 15 years ago!   After I switched from Merkur blades to Feather blades, this is now my pride and joy. I now get one pass hair removal, there is no razor burn, and most importantly, no ingrown hairs. With cartridge systems, my neck looked like I was a leper!  Aside from the plastic adjustable knob (which can be modded, if you know who to ask). The quality of this safety razor is top notch. I hear one minor complaint being the lack of a textured handle. This would be a nice improvement, however I still have yet to drop my progress.  Overall this has to one of my favorite purchases in the past 6 months, and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Razor is great I have several merkur&#x27;s and this one takes the cake. I finaly found the correct settings for myself and dial up razor on my last stroke to get thoese hard stubble and it take it right off. Case came cracked but vender gave me a $10 off discount which was fair but I really would of liked the case. or well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend this product. The germans lost the war but they sure one the razor debate.</li>
    <li> Well made but I prefer my Schick 3 blade disposable.</li>
    <li> Just a note: this razor covers medium to heavy beards, it just barely adjusts down to cover sensitive skin or fair or sparse beards. I have a light beard that is not thick and this razor teeters on the edge of being too aggressive to shave with comfortably.  I originally had a cheap discount razor that was very comfortable and shaved well until it broke (handle snapped) so I figured I&#x27;d try out this adjustable razor which was so well reviewed.  This is a very well constructed razor that I have been using for around 6 months. At first I tried to play with the settings and ended up with a lot of razor burn and cuts, after a week or two and a variety of different types of blades I just pushed it all the way to the lowest setting (less of a gap for less aggressive shave) and found a level that I could live with, but its a close thing... if this was any more aggressive on the lowest setting it would not work for me. As it stands it still shaves a bit too aggressively when I first change the blades and I feel a bit of burn with that first run, but that settles down after the first use. I use Derby blades.  I give it four stars because it is working for me but I would not recommend it for anyone with a light beard or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd razor (the first one was lost on a business trip). This razor has a perfect balance of weight and length. Other Merkur/Solingen razors have a longer handle and in my opinion, are too light. I prefer this model because it&#x27;s short (almost stubby) and heavy. It feel like I am a master sculptor using a fine tool when I shave my face. Love this and will never go back to the disposable stuff.</li>
    <li> Shaves much better than the Futur.  The long handle would have been even better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor expecting something similar to quality razors that I used in the 60s and 70s.  It is heavy, and apparently durable, but I expected a butterfly loading mechanism and the adjustment knob is plastic which seems odd for a razor of this price.  It is also shorter than any razor I have previously owned so I am returning it without trying it.</li>
    <li> I recently moved to a traditional safety razor after using a straight razor for my daily shaves.  I made the transition because of the amount of time that it takes to do a straight shave.  I have not stopped my straight shaves, just moved them to the days that I have time to enjoy them.  Be that said I am very happy with the quality of the razor and the type of shaves it gives.  I am esp. happy with the progressive adjustments available on the blade.  Being a refugee from modern multi-blade razors this gives me the convenience of a quick shave while giving me a close shave that places me in the proper mood for work.</li>
    <li> love this little thing...the right weight...i know the adjustment is not across the board...cannot complain in that...it is totally understandable...but it works so great that i will never try other razor...i cannot recommend it enough...a must have razor and nothing else...</li>
    <li> I used to use and old Gillette for years, then went to Disposables. Bought this and remembered why I like safety razors so much. Clean close shave. Only complaint is handle is a little short.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this razor is one of the best on the market.  It is very well made, sturdy and hefty.  Improvements I would like to see... Make the index marks contrasting so they can be seen by us older guys more easily.  There are 6 different blade adjustment settings on this razor. I&#x27;m not sure why as opening it up to anything past 2 would be dangerous.  Still, it gets 5 stars for quality and craftsmanship alone. The Merkur blades included are ok if you just can&#x27;t wait to try out this razor.  If you can wait however, buy a couple packs of Feather blades and enjoy the full beauty of this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought the Merkur razor with the hope that I would get a close shave, save some money in the long run and save our landfill from more un-needed plastic. Unfortunately, due to the nicks, scrapes and cuts from the razor, I&#x27;ve finally given up after four months of use.     This is a well built razor, no doubt. The design is beautiful, the razor are simple to install, no issues. But I have used this setting on every level and I continued to get cut. Now, in the morning, when I&#x27;m getting myself ready for work, I don&#x27;t have time to stand in front of my mirror with a styptic pencil or with bloody tissue paper attached to my face. I especially had issues on my neck and chin. I always tried to let the well balanced head do all the work, but either I would miss spots or cut myself anyway. And it just took too long.     Yes, I pre-soak my beard, I use only the best shaving creams (no supermarket stuff), pre-shave oil at times, etc. Did not matter.     So last night, with a nick under my nose and another under my chin I went out and bought a new razor with a changeable head. Consider this experiment over.</li>
    <li> Solid Razor. I like the case. I wish it was a butterfly open though. As for the settings I keep the bad boy locked on a mild 2.5 pretty much all the time. The short handle is much more to my liking than my long handle Merkur. This has become the razor I now use every day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. I use it set to &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; (a lot of razor blade exposed) and the difference compared to my old Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor is a huge improvement (just due to the greater amount of exposed blade, I believe). I personally haven&#x27;t had any issues with nicks or cuts even on the &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; setting of 5. From the photo, the handle of this razor looks like it might be slippery but I haven&#x27;t had any slipping issues.</li>
    <li> This razor was great, being adjustable is a great feature. Unfortunately the chrome finish on one side of the head flaked off after less than a year of use. Shaving with just one side of the razor is not what I paid a premium price for. I also own the long handled Merkur razor which gives a great shave also.</li>
    <li> He loves this razor.  Sturdy and solid, well made.  Fits great in his hand, and adjusts smoothly and easily.  He prefers this short handle to the long handles.</li>
    <li> I shaved for the first time with a DE razor tonight! I used the Long Handled Progress with a Derby Extra blade. I&#x27;ve used Gillette Fusions most of my life so I did not know what to expect of the Progress but I can now say that my first use of it was very successful. The first pass I did shaved as close as my Fusion and I didn&#x27;t even cut myself one bit!     I prepped by taking a hot shower to soften up my whiskers. Then I rubbed a very light coat of grape seed oil in(I think I&#x27;d have to recommend it to somebody starting because the grape seed oil will help the razor glide better, less chance of cuts when just learning?). Then I used some Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood soap(Which smells awesome! and was more slippery than the cheap Walmart stuff) and then I went to work. Short soft strokes while keeping the razor aligned against your face seemed to work the best. I did 2 passes and it got my whiskers shorter than the Fusion would have done in one pass. I think I might want a cooling aftershave of some sort.. I did not cut myself at all and my face was nice and soft afterwards, but it had a bit of a warmish feeling and I bet a cooling aftershave would have felt great.    I am quite happy with my first try and am looking forward to using it a lot more!    Tips: Don&#x27;t press into your skin! Just gently set the razor against your face and let the weight of the razor pull it down. By pressing in or pulling down you are not going to be shaving closer, you will just cut or irritate the skin. Go lightly and if you want it smoother, lather up and shave it again. Oh and be sure to lather again. Don&#x27;t shave dry!</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Adjustability starts at hardly cuts at all and goes up to cuts you if you look at it funny. Something in between will work. Well made, Biggest problem is remembering to align the index marks on the top cap and razor body. Handle looks like it should be slippery, But is isn&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t dropped it yet. This razor works very well and is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> If you love using a safety razor and want closer, more advanced shave, this is the razor to get. Compared to what I have read and seen between all three Merkur adjustable(progress,futur,visin), this was the winner. I had a parker twist safety razor wanted to take the extra step to an adjustable. I almost considered buying an old Gillette adjustable, but after doing my research between the Progress, Futur, Vision, and Gillette adjustable,I went for the Progrss:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Least mechanically complicated&lt;br /&gt;2. Best price(48 dollars at west coast shaving)&lt;br /&gt;3. Extensively reviewed and well liked&lt;br /&gt;4. high range of setting (Gillette adjustables like the fat boy are not very aggressive compared to Merkur adjustable razors and all vary on ebay)&lt;br /&gt;5. Does have a grip(small learning curve)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some gripes with this razor, but go to mantic59 shave videos, he has a clip about Progress Annoyances, but are easy fixes if you need it. My adjustment scale has not been reading a little off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After few weeks owning it, I love it! I use Gillette Platinum blades or Feather Blades and both work great. With my Proraso Green Tea and Aloe soap combined with Kiss My Face Mint shave cream, I get one of the closest, almost no irritating shaves. Almost didn&#x27;t need to use aftershave(usually cornhuskers hand lotion). It takes time to find what adjustments work, as I like the more agressive shaving, going 3.5 to 4 on first pass, the 2.5 to 3 on second and third pass, and finally on my last pass going against the grains I go back to 2, relather, redo pass at lovel 3 or higher. If I keep this up, I can only shave every 36 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you want to take next step in shaving and upgrade to an adjustable, get this guy. Its my everyday razor, cheap, practical, effective, and fun.</li>
    <li> I would stick to the modern Gillette products although they are pricey you will not end up possibly butchering your face as with these types of razors.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t spend a lot of time of why I&#x27;m switching back to DE shaves...others have accounted for cost, quality issues previously. All I know is that I became increasingly dissatisfied with crummy, expensive shaves from electric and Gillette that left my face burning all day long.  Enough.  Started doing some research on the internet, ran into the re-surging movement to DE wet shaving and ultimately Merkur.    First adjustment after reviewing product evaluations here on Amazon, was to move to a good shave cream and brush.  That change alone made a huge difference even when using a SensorExcel razor.  Conditioning the face properly and getting the \\&quot;goo\\&quot; out of the routine made a huge difference.    As a first pass into the DE world, I started with the Merkur 180 long handle thinking I would need the long handle because of big hands.  After spending a week of trying to get the guts to try it out (thinking I would slash myself and not realizing that the other key operative phrase in DE shaving was \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot;...HELLO?) I gave it a shot and got the best shave I&#x27;ve had in 40+ years. Then I took a look at UTube and found Mantic 59 and really got going.    While the 180 was doing a good job, I came across Mantic&#x27;s videos on the Progress and other adjustables and ordered the Progress based on Mantic&#x27;s assertions that \\&quot;while not recommending the razor (yeah, right!), it was his daily razor and that you would \\&quot;have to pry it out of his cold, dead hands\\&quot;.  Was a little concerned about its size and other issues but I just had to try this and ordered one right here on Amazon...yes the shaving supply acquisition dis-order had already set in.    Received it last week and have never looked back. Much more aggressive than the 180 while not shredding my face.  The \\&quot;short\\&quot; version works fine with my large hands.  And for the first time, I&#x27;m able to get those stinking spots under my neck without burn or bumps.     JEEEZ! What a difference!  May make a change to a \\&quot;Mergress long handle\\&quot; that has solved some of the issues with dial-in calibration and replacement of the knob with one that is stainless steel and a longer handle, but right now I am perfectly happy. Those changes, when they occur, will be marginal. The switch to a Progress is different.  Now you will have to pry it out of my hands when I&#x27;m dead.  Great little razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it simple,  *I no longer have bumps on my neck!  the blade cuts the hair at the surface and not below like those expensive Gillette Fusion ProGlide (which i no longer use).  *no more razor burn! I use the feathers blades which are super sharp, one pass of the blade is all its needed for me.  *Its costly up front, but it will pay it self off with the inexpensive blades.  **Im so happy I got this Merkur Progress, im recommending it to all my buddies.  I hope i helped you decide</li>
    <li> If the handle pulls out, you cannot insert it without compressing a wide split ring near the bottom of the handle.  My advice is just to yank that ring out or pry it out with a small flat-bladed screw driver.  This turns the Progress into a standard 3-piece razor while preserving its adjustability.  This sometimes misbehaving C-ring is why I give this razor a four.  Other than that, blade alignment and so on is fine.</li>
    <li> This is my first attempt at safety-razor shaving, I thought this would be a good beginner razor since it&#x27;s adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a very solid build, appears to be very well made, and the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; is a good deal with the hard-plastic case and starter pack of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On first use, I can see where there is a bit of a learning curve, going from a standard &amp;#34;cartridge&amp;#34; razor to a real safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great right out of the box, but I do have an issue with the total lack of instructions.  OK, there was a little sheet that points out the arrow/marks on the side to make sure it&#x27;s assembled right, but what does the adjustments do, and what are they for?  Do you need to take it apart to clean after every shave, or just rinse it, etc?  No help at all.  And the manufacturer&#x27;s web site is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the internets to the rescue.  There are multiple shaving forums (who knew?!?!?) and videos to show how to use safety-razors in general, and even specific knowledge about the Progress.  Nice to see there is an on-line community who can help out newbies like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this razor?  Yes, but for this specific reason:  Kit Price.  Prices for these types of razors vary quite a bit, seems like they are such a niche product, and are made by only a handful of companies (but they are well made), the starting price can be quite high.  For a well-respected name brand, and a kit with case and razors, this is a good price for a well made product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I got caught up in the hype of the multiblade razors...mach 3, quattro...didn&#x27;t get the fusion though. I remember an old sensor excel and it seemed to work better for me than more blades. Prices can add up and due to the spacing of the blades they can become caught with hair easily.    So I searched and read about other forms. I decided on the progress because it is adjustible and pretty simple to use.  This is obviously a different form of shaving. But at least for me I do get a better shave and it does cost less money. Blades can be found online for as little as 13 cents each (granted in large packs).Blades from major manufactuers from what I see start at $1.50 a blade at best.    Also like a previous reviewer said the amount of time between shaves can somewhat grow. I would say a blade runs me around a week. Yes it is a bit of a learning curve to learn to use the razor but as long as you take your time you&#x27;ll be fine. Definatly recommended.</li>
    <li> Well I had this Razor for a few months now ever since December of last year.    This razor is pretty good and everything but there are a few annoyances but that is for later.    The Pros.  1.It is mechanically simple so if you drop no real biggie.    2.It produces nice shaves with the ability to change the aggressiveness of the razor.  You can change the settings from an aggressive high setting shave for your neck to a lower aggressive setting shave for your mustache area.    3.It does have a bit of weight to it so you do not need to pull the razor down your face you just let it slide down your face.     Now for the Cons.  1. The handle has a smooth finish so if you are not careful about it you can slip with the handle, but rinse it under water and it keeps a nice bit of grip to it.  Yes it does have a good bit of grip to it even wet.    2.The setting dial can be off a bit.  As in it doesn&#x27;t go all the way down to one or goes below one when you dial it down.  Mantic59 has a fix for that on youtube, but this is rather an annoyance than an actual bad thing. Just start with the lowest you can go then go from there.    If you have good technique, razor blade, shaving lather, and shave prep.  This razor and wet shaving method will be for you, but if not do not expect the best.  Refer to mantic59 on youtube on how to wet shave and other aspects of wet shaving.</li>
    <li> A little difficult to get used to, but does a very good job, especially if you have a thick growth of facial hair.</li>
    <li> So, this razor shares space with my 180 long handled Merkur . I have tried this razor opened up to about a 6, and got a pretty close shave with a few small nicks. That may be attributed to my shaving technique though. I have used this numerous times set at about a 3, maybe a bit more, and have no nicks or cuts at all. The build quality seems very solid, and the numbers are aligned correctly, and are still correct after about 7 shaves with it.  The case came in good shape as well, with no broken parts at all. I typically shave every 1-2 days, so I have no experience with the razor with very heavy growth. It is very compact, and if you chuck in your luggage for travel, it would fill the role very well.</li>
    <li> I have 2 Edwin Jaggers and decided to give Merkur a shot. This is the best shaver I have ever had . However, I would have liked some directions in the box because I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to align the + to the marker. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> (skip to Pros for meat of review), first some context:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using only this razor for 1 year and 6 days so far. This was/is my first safety razor. My approach was to try it exclusively, learn to use it properly, then review the product. Unfortunately I cannot compare to other razors, but I can give my experience as a first timer, which I hope helps other first timers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a popular first choice for newbies like me since it&#x27;s adjustable. For the newbies, quality of shave soap/gel/cream matters. Quality of blades matters, and one brand doesn&#x27;t fit all. Try a brand for half a dozen or more shaves before deciding. two-pass shaving is really worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using feather blades and Mike&#x27;s Natural Shave soaps. On to the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- I love being able to adjust this. At first I didn&#x27;t know what gap to use being new to DE razors, and I was afraid to slice my face open, so I started conservative and worked up. I have a sparse beard and sensitive skin, I found 4 was the perfect gap for a first pass. If I haven&#x27;t shaved in a week, I might go to 5. For the record, you won&#x27;t slice your face open.&lt;br /&gt;- I can close the gap to almost nothing, and shaving against the grain gets me baby smooth skin and no cuts.&lt;br /&gt;- Construction is good quality. I have accidentally dropped this twice and I can&#x27;t see any damage.&lt;br /&gt;- After a year, I have zero issues with chrome flaking or other quality concerns. I always rinse, and hang on a rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I noticed that there is the slightest difference in the gap between left and right sides, like it&#x27;s just two hairs slightly off center. Could be the blades. Others have noted this as well.&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the adjustment knob was also chromed metal and not plastic&lt;br /&gt;- The case (which you won&#x27;t use) is not very good. It&#x27;s that type of acrylic plastic that breaks easily, and doesn&#x27;t feel of any quality which seems odd for this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product. I had to use a regular cartridge razor on a trip recently, and I was surprised by how much less I liked it and missed the DE shave. DE is more time, but having stuck it out for a year, I&#x27;m a lifelong convert, and will expand my collection soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the cons in my opinion impact the quality of my shave, so they do not subtract from my rating, and it stays at 5 stars. I am comfortable to recommend this product. Razors are personal and &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; is your choice, I fully intend to try others.</li>
    <li> Worked gread good shave. Took a few times using it to get used to it but once you try these you&#x27;ll never go back to expensive disposables. I almost look forward to shaving now and a lot less ingrown hairs...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d always been curious about using the old double edge style razors, as I&#x27;d been raised in the era of 2-10,000 bladed ultra-razors that sell extra blades in packs of 3 for $10+, while all along I&#x27;d see the 10 packs of double edged blades for $2-3 sitting collecting dust. I attributed this fact mostly to the difficulty in acquiring one of these \\&quot;Grandpa Razors\\&quot;, as they&#x27;re not sold in many stores anymore. But this past birthday I finally got one, and have loved it since. Coupled with using the brush and bowl method of lathering up, I&#x27;ve gotten a closer shave than ever, and spend tons less on new blades (these blades even last longer!).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, yes, buy this, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome adjustable with a nice weight to it, quality safety razor.  However the case the progress comes with was completely demolished.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was sent this way or happened while being shipped.  At any rate would have given it a 3 star but the performance of the progress evened things out a bit.</li>
    <li> This was my fourth DE razor.  My first was a different murker (180), second was a cheapo, third was a different cheapo.  I liked the third but it was starting to rust after a week of use.  It made me realize what the difference in the aggressiveness of the razor actually meant.  So i decided that the progress would be a good fit as I could adjust the blade exposure.  I started with the setting at what would be 0 and am now on 1.  The idea is that I can then increase untill it is too much then back off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;The razor seems to be VERY solidly built.  I have yet to need to clean it so i may have to edit this when that time comes.  won&#x27;t be for another month or so.</li>
    <li> I choose four stars because I have gotten great shaves with this razor. Also, the blades are extremely cheaper than the multiple razor blade type. I also have control to how close I want to shave rather than have no adjustment at all. The two things I would change would be a less slippery grip and better marking of the adjustment knob. I have used this razor for about a month and love it.</li>
    <li> The Progress is a well balanced and slightly heavy razor. It is highly adjustable (I have mine set at 1.5 most of the time). Because of the way the head angles the blade you have to hold the handle parallel to your face instead of angled out about 45 to 60 degrees, which takes a bit of getting used to, but once you do you can get a baby bottom smooth shave!  The Merkur blades are terrible. Junk them and get some Red Personas, Feathers, 7am, Wilkinson, or Lord blades.</li>
    <li> Bought this old fashioned safety razor to save money on blades. Gillette Mach 3 Blades were running me about 120/yr. With this razor I should be able to get by on about 10/yr. Still learning to use it. Takes awhile to get as close a shave as I get with the cartridge style blade. Like the adjustable blade depth of the Merkur Progress. First pass on 5 last pass on one. Really like the ability to completely disassemble the razor and thoroughly clean and dry it after each shave - impossible with a cartridge style. I guess my criteria of cheap blades, close shave, easy to clean could be best met by a straight razor but I&#x27;m too chicken.</li>
    <li> I like this. I never use the adjustable. However I prefer a long handle so I sent it back for the long handle. If you have not used a double edge before be careful as this provides a close shave.</li>
    <li> Heavy weight razor that provides an extremely close shave.  Four of 5 star rating.  Would have rated 5 but the adjustment knob is plastic.  Why plastic?</li>
    <li> I also have the Merkur 34C, which was my favorite razor...until I got this one. This is a nice heavy razor, but feels well balanced in the hand. I don&#x27;t have problems with it slipping out of my hand. Mine is calibrated perfectly, but if I did have one complaint it would be that it tends to keep on adjusting itself to slightly higher settings the longer I hold it. I use it primarily to shave my head. A three works great, anything higher and it gets too aggressive, at least for my taste. I haven&#x27;t had the nerve to push it to five.</li>
    <li> Whish I would have got one years ago.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t just shaved my face I shave my whole head its the best resort I&#x27;ve ever had the blades are a lot less expensive than multiplate cartridges and I get a better shave I have it set at the number 5. 5 setting and is very comfortable I shave every other day and I have had no problems what a great product thank you</li>
    <li> This is probably the best adjustable razor currently on the market; I have also tried Futur and Vision and wasn&#x27;t impressed with either. I use it on setting 3 and can&#x27;t be happier with its performance.</li>
    <li> Excellent little razor. You adjust it where your comfortable. I go with 4 on up with and across grain. But on against grain dial it down to a 2 to 3 depending on type of blade I&#x27;m using. Like anything you have to get used to it. First time I used it I sped up a bit and the blade bounced on my chin. Nice little surgical divot of skin taken off. Since then no problems. Take it slow till you get the hang of the more aggressive settings. Then it&#x27;s pretty much second nature. Enjoy great razor where you decide how aggressive or not you want it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality razor that is adjustable to allow for a very safe shave -- all of the way to an aggressive shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and recommend it to all of those looking for a good quality DE razor.</li>
    <li> This is by far the closest and comfortable shave I have ever had.  This is a true work of art!</li>
    <li> After 30 years of shaving with plastic disposables with their ridiculous features like multiple blades, moisturizing strips, and vibrating heads I thought about using what my Dad has used since the Eisenhower administration.  I briefly thought about a straight-razor, but wanted there to be a limit on how deeply I could slice into my neck.  I picked out the Merkur and am pleased with it thus far.  You can actually rinse it clean for one thing (and not have to look at crusty hairs stuck between the multiple blades).  Shave&#x27;s really close as well.  Stop paying for expensive disposable blades or cartriges with celebrity endorsements. Tiger Woods has enough money.</li>
    <li> The blade was not straight unless it was tightened all the way down. I bought a long handle one and it was perfect. Been using it daily with great shaves.</li>
    <li> Much closer than cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors that I have ever had. Very good quality, classic, glides smoothly on my skin, BETTER than Gillette for sure. Get one.</li>
    <li> I switched from the modern standard, multiblade cartridge razor about 4 years ago after dealing with painful razor burn and poor shaves that wouldn&#x27;t last pass lunchtime.  I couldn&#x27;t even shave every day without TERRIBLE irritation.  On top of that I was spending about $50 a month on cartridges since my beard is so coarse it dulls the cheap blades they use in those cartridges within one or two shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered the world of wet shaving and double edge safety razors!  After doing my research I decided on this razor and I got an assortment of blades.  I have found that for me the Merkur blades work best, giving me a SMOOTH, close shave with no irritation or cuts.  Other blades tend to cut me more easily and I don&#x27;t always get the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the handle:  This razor is weighted nicely, looks wonderful, and shaves great.  The adjustable blade gap is a great feature that you sometimes don&#x27;t see (or you see a stepped adjuster rather than stepless, limiting your options a little.  I usually start off with a small gap and then after a shave or two I open it up a little bit.  This razor feels great in your hand and is a joy to shave with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried one other handle, an old Gillette butterfly design, and I don&#x27;t get as good a shave out of it.  The body is much lighter and doesn&#x27;t feel quite as good in my hand either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just about to make the plunge into the world of DE safety razors after years of unsatisfactory results with cartridge razors then I highly suggest this razor!  The price of this handle may seem steep compared to how cheap the handles for the cartridge systems are but remember:  They under-price those handles so they can get you hooked on their over-priced cartridges!  You can find great deals for Merkur blades in bulk if you look around, and if you find you can get a good shave out of some of the cheaper blades I&#x27;ve seen them as cheap as $17 for a hundred blades!  You will save money in thelong term by spending a little bit more now!  (And you will feel so much more luxurious using this finely crafted razor than a cheap piece of plastic!)</li>
    <li> IT TAKES SOME GETTING USE TO , VERY SHARP RAZOR AND THE COST PER SHAVE IS MUCH CHEAPER. THE FUSON POWERGLIDE HAS BECOME TP EXPENSEIVE TO USE OVER A $1.50  A BLADE COMPARED TO A SAFTY RAZOR IS IS A $0.20 PER BLADE ..</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving about a year and a half ago and I don&#x27;t ever want to go back.  This was the second razor I bought and it works flawlessly.  It&#x27;s a good, solid build that will last, get a good shave, and have had no problems with cuts due to how it positions the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering getting into wet shaving, I would recommend this blade to someone just starting out since it is adjustable, therefor you can start out on as low of a setting as possible, so that very little of the blade is exposed, then as you become more comfortable you can open it up so that you can get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this razor is after taking it apart to put in a new blade/clean it.  It can be a bit challenging to get the bottom of the handle (the part you screw to adjust the blade gap) to line back up with the measurements properly since you have to unscrew it to the point that it comes completely free in order to take the top guard off to replace the blade or clean thoroughly.  I found that I need to make sure the teeth catch with the mark at about &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; on the bottom dial in order to make it line back up with the smallest measurement when it finally fully tightens.  Certainly not a deal breaker, but was a bit frustrating at first.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent seller, a real asset for Amazon</li>
    <li> The Mercur Progress is one righteous razor! When I initially started shaving with the Progress, it felt there was a fairly stout gap between the razor and the razor blade even when it was set on a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;. But within a week I became very comfortable using this close shaving razor! The only thing that prevents me from giving the Merkur Progress a full 5 stars is its relatively thin plating. Be that as it may, this has become my #1 razor, and the Derby blades compliment it nicely!</li>
    <li> My first DE razor and I love it! I wish it had a metal knob instead of the plastic one and the numbers on the adjustable handle do not remain &amp;#34;calibrated&amp;#34; to the reference mark. I never adjust it anyways. I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Great value, great razor.....Definitely worth the buy for those who get ingrown hairs, irritation, have sensitive skin, or just want to save money from traditional razors and replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Out of the box and on my face. Very close shave and easy to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m shaving I think of all the money I have wasted on the &amp;#34; newfangled razors&amp;#34;, and wish I had gone back to the double edge sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Great price , great quality, great shave!</li>
    <li> I received the product from SimplyBeautiful and noticed right away that the case the razor comes in is cracked down the middle of the clear top part and the clasp is broke off so the lid will not stay shut by itself.  The top head of the razor has a manufacturing error where the metal tapers off on one side.  This leaves a corner of the blade sticking out on one side since the head plate is not pushing the razor blade down  to conform to a nice arch at this particular spot.  It is not that noticeable with out close inspection.  I have used DE razors for about a year and have not had any problems with a Merkur 180 log handle classic and an HD 38C, but this one kept nicking me.  After about a week of use and receiving small nicks I closely examined the razor and found that the head is leaving the blade sticking out on one corner.  I can not return the razor because SimplyBeautiful only allows 7 days after receiving the package to return.  They also do not except a used Item.  I can understand that there is a hygiene worry about a used Item but after spending $70 on a razor I believe that you should be able to return it free of charge if you find a manufacturing defect.  After contacting the Merkur company (Dovco) they are going to send me a generic head for the razor.  This will be missing the line marker that allows easy assemble to assure the caliber will match up.  I also can not get a working case that I was hoping to use for travel.  This is a large waist of money.  I highly recommend ordering the Long handle progress directly from Amazon.  This would allow easier return of defected products.  I will have to give the company 2 starts for bad quality control for such expensive merchandise that is so simplistic.  With the company SimplyBeautiful and not excepting returns mor than shifts by review below one start.</li>
    <li> I got the Merkur Classic and Merkur Slant. The classic do not get along with my face. As for the slant, I have been using it for a few years now. It needs full concentration and I do get an occasional razor burn.    The Merkur Progress exceeds my expectation. My sweet spot is just a click and shaving time has been reduced. I noticed my face does not break out in raw splotches as before.    That said, DE razors and multi-blades will get you the same shave, except that the disposable single blades are a lot cheaper. I use Feather brand safety razors which last me a week per razor. Not recommended are electric shavers which just whip your whiskers like a lawn mower. The \\&quot;pull back and whack your whiskers\\&quot; Philishavers are even worse, the shattered ends of hair sometimes causing ingrown hairs. The affected spots would weep pus and specks of blood can be seen on the pillow. I thought it was due to my diabetes illness and or air pollution until I stumbled on the cause while surfing the internet. Which is why I went to traditional DE (double edge) shavers.    In addition, I didn&#x27;t use shaving soap due to my sensitive skin. Instead I use Cetaphil skin cleaners which is so mild that you can just wipe dry from your skin. It also acts as moisturizer which soften the hairs also. My wife uses it to clear her makeup so its one less clutter on the mirror shelf.</li>
    <li> I just went back to using this type of razor after being &amp;#34;taken to the cleaners&amp;#34; over the last 25 years buying those outrageously over-priced cartridges. I used to have a Gillette &amp;#34;Black Beauty&amp;#34; Adjustable, but since Gillette hasn&#x27;t made a safety razor since I believe 1987, I bought this German-made model. I&#x27;m not sorry I bought this model, it shaves like a dream. Cuts through my beard like a hot knife through butter. There isn&#x27;t a cartridge I have tried that can compare to the quality of shave that this (and probably most) safety razors can give. Even after 25 years, going back was like &amp;#34;riding a bicycle&amp;#34;, you just don&#x27;t forget. I&#x27;m done with rip-off cartridges, permanently! Why not 5 stars? Well, I still prefer my old Gillette simply because I like the fact that it was a one-piece TTO, and the calibration was always perfect. This one does need to be put together with the marker and the triangle always aligned, and even so, it still might be slightly off. That being said, the numbers being perfectly calibrated or not does not effect the quality of the shave in any way. I still might go &amp; see if I can find a &amp;#34;good ol&#x27; Gillette on eBay though, just to have it as well.</li>
    <li> I found this razor to be quite cumbersome, out of balance and heavier than expected. Having used an old Gillett Adjustable for many years this razor was a disappointment. It is small and travels well in it&#x27;s case but that is all I found that I liked.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite razors, glad I bought it I bet you will be too.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. In my world, an absolute win for travel. The adjustable blade angle is created by tensioning the blade between the cap and body. This is safely done with the adjusting knob at the bottom of the handle. Weight is a firm presence in the hand and this works well for control and smooth no pressure shaving. The adjustability of blade angle makes for easy blade burnishing if you&#x27;ve developed the technique.  My stars rating is based upon my comparison of this instrument with Merkur&#x27;s Futur, and Vision systems.</li>
    <li> Based on a lot of the reviews here and other internet research, I bought this razor as my first one for finally getting away from cartridges and going to the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; safety razor.  I know that most of the tutorials say that you should go with a standard razor when you move in to the safety razor world and get an adjustable when you feel that you are ready.  Well, the main reason I went to a safety razor was long term cost.  I was tired of paying $60 for a pack of 16 razors.  If after a couple of months I had to buy another razor, the long term effect was 2 razors at close to or over $100 instead of one.  That being said, I also shave my head, so I wanted a razor that I could adjust to deal with the thicker stubble for my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.  Safety razor arrives and I take it out of the box and examine it.  Doesn&#x27;t look very intimidating.  I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days, and watched enough youtube videos, I figured, I&#x27;d dive in.  Washed my face.  Lathered up my brush, put the blade on, and set it to the lowest setting.  Face covered, and away I went.  I get done my first pass on my face, and I still feel some stubble.  As expected.  I rinse, adjust it up a notch and repeat.  After the next pass, my face is nice and smooth.  Only a few minor nicks.  The toughest part was figuring out the angle to get the blade to work.  Once that was done.  It was easy sailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face is now done.  Time for the head.  Washed, rinsed and lathered up the head.  Since my head stubble is much denser then my face, I kept it at the setting I used for my second face run.  Again, nice small strokes and did my first pass.  Rinsed, checked it out, and as expected, still a little stubble.  Dialed it up another notch, lathered up again, and did a second pass.  Head is nice and smooth when I&#x27;m done.  Used my standard after shave care on my face and head, and am ecstatic.  Aside from a minor cut, probably one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever done myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have avariety pack of blades coming in soon, and I will try all of them to find out which type I like the best.  Since I shave my head and face, I only got 3-4 shaves out of my cartridges, and I&#x27;m expecting 2 out of these blades.  When you do the long term math, this is going to save me a TON of money and I&#x27;m going to get great shaves for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> The best shave I have ever got, was with this razor. But I don&#x27;t care for the Merkur blades.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I was expecting for this price point. It&#x27;s a good razor but nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used! Buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this! Definitely a great buy!!</li>
    <li> The adjustment is a bit finicky and the markings are not easy to read, with the result that it is easy to inadvertently mount the razor head backwards, thus rendering the calibration dial useless. This does no damage, but it is an unnecessary inconvenience in the early morning hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the plastic adjustment dial at the bottom is a bit disconcerting for a razor at is price level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the wide degree of adjustability of this razor doesn&#x27;t really accomplish much in the long run. Most people will quickly compensate for the attack angle and depth of any razor, so the ability to adjust becomes superfluous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I far prefer my Merkur \\&quot;barberpole\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I loved this razor when it was new, but over time this razor increasingly annoyed me. Its complex design makes it hard to clean, quick to corrode then break. Full lock down was the only adjustment setting I could use without slicing my face up. The adjustability was an unnecessary, unusable, complication that lead to a short use life. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I used to hate shaving till i bought this. Love the product.  Would highly recommend to anyone. Works best with a good shaving soap and brush. Merkur blades are so so but the razor is awesome.</li>
    <li> Funny how razors go. When I first started using it I was not impressed. I pit it away for a couple of weeks and decided to try again. Very good razor. Almost as good as my Gillete Slim but shinier!</li>
    <li> I fondly remember, many decades ago, watching a ritual my grandfather would go through.  He would have a cup, and I&#x27;d see the steam of hot water rising from the sink.  He&#x27;d take a brush he&#x27;d soaked in the sink and magically whip up what looked to me to be a sumptuous froth of whipped cream.  I wanted to eat it.  Grandpa would tell me this isn&#x27;t for eating; it&#x27;s for cleaning and getting ready for the day.  I&#x27;d watch intently from my lower perch by the floor--after all, I was a little boy--as he&#x27;d carefully paint this delicious-looking white foam around his face.  Then he&#x27;d take his golden Gem safety razor, which I still have to this day, and begin his daily ritual.  I can still hear the patient, thin scraping of hairs as he&#x27;d carefully work his way around his cheeks, mandible, chin, and neck.  When he was done, he&#x27;d rinse and dry off with his washcloth, give me a warm smile, bend down, and let me feel it.  It felt as smooth as my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then ventured into my father&#x27;s bathroom to watch him, but he did it differently.  He had a can of Barbisol that he&#x27;d toss in hot water in his sink.  The sink also had steam rising from the water, but dad had a different razor.  This one had many blades--two, in fact.  He&#x27;d take the can out of the sink, squeeze the foam from the can, spread it around, and then start shaving and swishing the soap off the razor into the sink water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I learned to shave, using my father&#x27;s technique.  I never forgot how my grandfather shaved though, and every day of my life I see his razor sitting on my dresser next to his picture knowing that very razor is the one he used in the picture in 1909 and also in his bathroom when I was a child in 1969.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am, reviewing the Murker Progress adjustable safety razor.  Why, you ask?  Because of the egregious price of replacement blades from typical store-bought razors.  I&#x27;ve tried them all over the years and most of them cause me real problems.  For me, I found the Gillette Fusion works very well, but a pack of twelve blades costs upwards of $50.  I&#x27;ve been stretching a blade out to last a month for economic reasons.  This was way too long!  I can comfortably get two weeks out of one, shaving every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ran out of my annual supply of blades and, looking at my grandfather&#x27;s razor on my dresser, I decided to research safety razors.  I was really amazed at what I learned and how a 100-pack of quality safety blades costs about $20.  Wow!  That&#x27;s $.20 a blade, as opposed to over $4 a blade that I&#x27;m paying now, and I could replace the blade weekly.  I decided to switch and research which razor would be good for me.  I selected the Murker Progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about this razor that others have pointed out: there are no instructions.  There is a little piece of paper in the case, but nothing that explains how to use the razor.  Safety razors are not what the young generation use or are exposed to in advertising, so why do they eliminate the instructions?  I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You twist the bottom plastic collar to loosen the top and the top comes off.  The razor has indicators on the side of the top and on the razor housing.  When you put the top back on, be sure it is positioned properly, otherwise the numbers at the bottom where you twist won&#x27;t align properly.  This totally confused me, until I figured it out.  If the top is on reversed, the numbers won&#x27;t bottom out at \\&quot;1\\&quot;.  You want the number to start at the \\&quot;1\\&quot; setting.  This is the lowest blade setting.  Put the top on, twist it until it won&#x27;t twist anymore, and the top is secure.  The number will be \\&quot;1\\&quot;.  Back it off to the setting you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is nicely weighted.  As you may already know, you let the razor&#x27;s weight do the work for you, so a quality razor will have a little heft to it.  The Murker Progress has this heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you place the blade in the blade housing, be certain it is aligned straight.When I first received the razor and installed the blade, I received some nasty nicks.  It wasn&#x27;t until I was done that I noticed the blade was a little eschew and not perfectly straight, so on one end, the blade protruded out more than the other end.  This caused that protruded end to sink into my face, which left a mark or two or three or four.  Lesson learned with this razor!  When putting the razor top with blade on the razor housing, make sure the razor is straight while screwing the knob at the bottom of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle itself is not appreciably long.  This may or may not be important to you.  I have big hands and find it acceptable, but in some positions, it does feel a little short.  I chalk it up to getting used to something new, and I&#x27;m sure, in time, I&#x27;ll adjust my technique and learn to use this handle just fine.  For me, the entire process of using a safety razor is new, so I didn&#x27;t expect I&#x27;d feel comfortable with everything the first time I used it.  With that said, if you think you might be annoyed by too small a handle, you might want to consider a razor with a longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word about the Murker blades that come with this razor: I&#x27;ve read from others that these blades are low quality and \\&quot;suck\\&quot;.  I agree, wholeheartedly!  I used them for a week before receiving a sample pack of twenty-five different high-quality blades from different manufacturers around the world.  Wow, what a difference!  Now, it&#x27;s possible the Murker blades they&#x27;re supplying with this razor are not representative of the quality you would receive if you purchased a pack of Murker blades separately; I don&#x27;t know.  What I do know is, purchase a different set of blades.  I found the stock Murker blades that come with this razor provided a terrible shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend searching Amazon for a sample pack of blades that will allow you to try the blades from many different manufacturers.  That way you can compare and contrast the difference in quality and decide which blade works best with your beard and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the Murker Progress.  It&#x27;s a quality razor with nice weighting that allows the user to adjust the razor bend to their exact specification.  The plastic twist knob on the bottom seems a little cheap, but it works fine.  This razor does require attention when inserting the blade to ensure it is situated straight in the blade housing, and careful attention should be paid to which direction the top is inserted into the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish my grandfather was around to try it.When I first received the razor and installed the blade, I received some nasty nicks.

    <li> I love that it&#x27;s adjustable. I use 1.5 most days but can turn it up a couple if I don&#x27;t shave for a day or two. My ingrown hairs have all disappeared and I don&#x27;t get razor burn any more. I will never go back to a cartridge razor. This thing is well built and will probably last as long as I live.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to have something a little more advanced than my Merkur Classic (33c).  The Progress is somewhat more massive (especially the head); the higher inertia actually makes it easier to control.  This version has a short handle, which I always prefer; you can rest your little finger on the end to give a secure and steady grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the least aggressive setting, the index dot is just above the \\&quot;+\\&quot; symbol on the adjustment knob.  I believe this is the correct calibration of the scale.  I find the aggressiveness to be about the same as the Classic when adjusted to 2-1/2.  I guess that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for me this razor is just right - simple styling, rugged build, good functionality, and reasonable price.  It&#x27;s a good looking object that is made - and priced - to be used, not to be collected and admired.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor but I prefer the long handled version over this one. I typically wear XL-XXL gloves so I have longer fingers than others so this smaller handle is a little harder for me to get a hold of in my hand right when shaving. For those with smaller hands this might be a great razor but I have found that I like the longer handled versions of these razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the best design as far as I&#x27;m concerned for how it holds the blades though. It really just holds the blade at a little more of a bend which just makes for a perfect angle for holding the blade to your face, it just feels more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good handle and have smaller hands then you should seriously consider this handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for about a month now. It took a little tinkering to figure out how to get everything aligned to make the adjustment work properly. The directions, for changing the blade leave a lot to be desired. Once I got that down I started using it regularly. The razor itself is just okay.  I don&#x27;t like the plastic end on the handle. At this price the entire razor should be metal. The plastic makes it look cheap. The grip and weight of the razor is good. The head of the razor had a bit of flaking on it that exposed the steel beneath. I clean and dry each part after shaving so this should not corrode. Again, at this price I did not expect any finish problems. Loading a new blade can be hassle. I have to adjust the blade so its centered in the head several times. It seems as though the blade shifts as I adjust it from one to five or in between. It gives a decent shave once adjusted. You just have to plan on taking more time to change blades and ensure that the blade does not slide inside the head when adjusting.</li>
    <li> Nice balance with the size and weight. No issues with the adjustments. The travel case is certainly a great bonus.</li>
    <li> A friend had recommended getting into safety razors, and this particular one was recommended by mantic59. After using this razor for over a year now, I can see why. Compared to multiblades, shaving is now less painful and I have fewer razor bumps. Even if I go a week or two without shaving, this razor, coupled with Feather blades, can handle by beard on a single shave with a single blade without getting all clogged up like the multiblades do.</li>
    <li> My favorite razaor.  I have a fat boy but like this Merkur better.</li>
    <li> I really was expecting something far better than I received.  What I got was a razor in a broken case that was smaller than I expected.  Maybe it was the broken box, but it seemed that even trying to install a blade was difficult.</li>
    <li> This gave me a good shave like a straight razor</li>
    <li> Good razor, mild to aggressive shaves, a little hard to hold with wet hand.</li>
    <li> Knew this was a good product &amp; the shave I&#x27;m familiar with; using other razors is so poor I was quite amazed. I just need to figure out the right angle to shave with. The one problem I have (&amp; its not much of a problem) is finding the right aftershave product for me, skin seems a bit dry when I&#x27;m done</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used. Took a week to get used to but I&#x27;m glad I did. Very adjustable, very comfortable. Would highly recommend this item to any one. Glad I&#x27;m not spending $40 a month for my old gillette razor blades!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son. He is happy with the item.</li>
    <li> This is now the 3rd Merkur razor I own, the first is a long handle non adjustable, the second is the one styled after the Gillette 1909, and then this one. I have shaved with all many times, and while they are all great, this one to me personally is just a little better for my skin type. What makes it better is that I can adjust it to a little more aggresive shave than the others, this works well for me. I usually just shave with it set at 2 or 2.5 all the time. After owning this for 7 months, the razor still looks brand new with just a wipe of a cloth, have had no issues with the chrome plating coming off or anything like that. I use feather blades only because that is what I like the most. I am happy with the razor and would recommend to anyone. Hope this helps you make a decision if you are on the fence or are new to safety razor shaving. Make the investment and give yourself some time to get used to it, try different blades and soaps or creams. I think you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Fit and finish are perfect on this razor.  Excellent quality, it shaves beautifully through the whole scale and it has zero issues reported by others such as,  \\&quot;adjustment scale changes from day to day\\&quot;, \\&quot;gap on one side is bigger than the other\\&quot;, \\&quot;chrome finish flakes off\\&quot;, \\&quot;plastic knob cracked\\&quot;, \\&quot;slippery handle\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own the Merkur 34c HD and it shaves just like it but you get a full range of adjustment so you can go from fast cut thick beard to sensitive neck area with a twist of the knob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a nice razor and well worth taking a chance to see if you get a good one.</li>
    <li> Out of all the adjustables I have tried this one gives me the nicest shave.  There are not a lot of options for modern adjustables.  You have the futur and the Vision along with this Progress.  The futur gives a good shave but the blade is not bent enough and the angle is harsh.  Very hard to dial in the razor without doing surgery.  I have not used the vision but I always loved my edwin Jagger but wished it was slightly more aggressive.  The head of this razor bends the blade similar to the edwin Jagger and therefore is an extremely smooth shave.  Brought out the true potential of my polsilver blades and absolutely the smoothest BBS shave without a single cut.&lt;br /&gt;So why not 5 stars?  Well the razor&#x27;s build tolerances are not tight.  There is slight unevenness in the blade gap but not a deal breaker but YMMV.  I was lucky and got a well made one.  But if Merkur tightens up its design nothing beats the shave with this razor!</li>
    <li> He used to shave with a 3 blades razor and would never go back to it. He has a very difficult beard, sturdy and hard to shave. His skin is less irritated after he shaves and he has less ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> Bye Bye to the new age razors ,This razor gives a shave that is just not comparable to the more advanced razor&lt;br /&gt;Its simple ,easy to maintain and guess what the blade are cheap OMG they are not $30.00 a pack !!!</li>
    <li> Decided to made the switch from ridiculously expensive disposable Gillette Mach 3 back to this double edge - I just got tired of spending all that money for minimal results.  This Safety Razor by Merkur got excellent ratings so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Along with the excellent Feather blades, this razor/blad combo gives me undoubtedly the closest and best shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Note that there is a learning curve - after about 1 month or two of trial and error on the settings and angle and proper shave cream and you&#x27;ll never go back - and I use it to shave my head as well.  Great razor.</li>
    <li> This Razor feels great in my hands. Now shaving is something I don&#x27;t hate to do anymore. One thing if you have never used a double edge razor before the blade you pick will make a difference between getting allot on nicks or just having a nick free shave. Also when you start out the angle you hold the razor will make a big difference in the shave. With me I hold the razor at about a 45 degree angle and that seems perfect</li>
    <li> i bought it for its adjustability. little difficult initially to understand how much to crank the adjustment screw at the bottom. watch youtube vids. this razor replaced my parker 22r because it can reach the hard to get ares like right under my nose whereas the parkes head size and angle didnt allow the blade to reach that area. im in the military i have to shave everyday, classic shaving like this made the mundane and dread of shaving into something i can enjoy and take my time with. excellent razor.</li>
    <li> I like the shine, I like the feel but having to untwist the bottom to remove the upper blade guard is a little much,And yo have to match the side after changing blades,. I would pref a hinge top-style more.. My bad, I should have look further</li>
    <li> I decided to try a double edge because of the increasing cost of the multiple blade razors.  The handle is a little&lt;br /&gt;short even for me with average size hands, but shaving with this only needed a very short adjustment period,&lt;br /&gt;2 - 3 strokes and now it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve always used it.  The shave is close and comfortable, would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this razor to anyone.  The only negatives are finding replacement blades and the shorter handle.</li>
    <li> Everything that Merkur is known for. I paid a bit more for this brand but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband.  Can not find blades locally.  Blades he has dulls rather quickly, goes through them very fast compared to a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor except the plastic knob.  I recommend getting it converted to a Mergress.  It costs a bit more but it will get a stainless steel knob and the numbers on the adjustment will line up correctly.  Google it and U&#x27;ll know what i mean</li>
    <li> I thought the head was going to be adjustable and not the handle, so it wasn&#x27;t what I was wanting at all.</li>
    <li> This is actually my favorite razor but with a major caveat--the metal components are constructed of nickel plated zinc alloy.  The finish should be fairly durable unless there are any flaws in the plating, in which case moisture will cause the underlying zinc to corrode into a zinc oxide white powder and the plating will bubble off.  That&#x27;s what happened to mine, and once it really took hold, despite my attempts to stave off the corrosion, the razor was no longer usable.  While it was functioning, it gave excellent shaves and even the cheap plastic adjustment knob didn&#x27;t bother me, but to spend $70.00 on a razor that has a lifespan of less than a couple of years is, to me, foolish. I&#x27;m using a non-adjustable solid brass/nickel razor now but still looking for a better quality adjustable.</li>
    <li> Amazing Razor. Easily adjusts for long or short hair. Much closer shave than one of those multi-blade pieces of junk that cost an arm and a leg. Just a note...doesn&#x27;t come with any blades. You will have buy them yourself. But, these type of blade last months, rather than days.</li>
    <li> this is the only affordable modern adjustable double edge safety razor on the market... mine arrived w/a slight crack in the plastic case, but the razor was fine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fortunately, i also received a razor that was &#x27;zeroed&#x27; out of the box - in other words, with the blade fully tightened, the indicator and &#x27;1&#x27; lined up (actually just a tad to the left of the &#x27;1&#x27;)... this means i can reliably adjust from a more aggressive shave (&#x27;5&#x27;) to a very mild shave (&#x27;1&#x27;) easily... it&#x27;s just as well, as the handle wouldn&#x27;t budge for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for my beard, i start with a 4- to 4.5 for the first pass, then a 2 for the touch-up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a razor you can use in a hurry - it won&#x27;t bite, unlike a Fatip, Razorock Jaws, or surprisingly, my Parker A1R travel razor (i&#x27;ve since swapped heads on that razor with the mid-aggressive, but quite nice Utopia Silver - a bargain 3-piece DE for about a Hamilton!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i enjoy this razor - it disassembles easily - i only wish that the handle came off separately to make it easier to clean (you can simply pull off the plastic knob to clean inside, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that too often, as the &#x27;clip&#x27; band that holds it in will render the razor useless if stretched too often)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the head is also a tad hard to clean, but if you keep an old toothbrush on hand, you can scrub out the blade edge channels on the head as needed - and anyway, you should always keep your razors in tip-top shape, right gents?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this razor works well - a bit overpriced for what it is - but it should last you a number of years - and by the time you go to replace it, it will be a classic</li>
    <li> Shaves pretty close but you can&#x27;t go as fast as a disposable razor. Handle doesn&#x27;t give you a good grip.</li>
