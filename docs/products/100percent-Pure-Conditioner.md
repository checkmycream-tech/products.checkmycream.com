      <li>The smell is incredible, too.</li>
      <li>conditioner works incredibly well.</li>
      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>I am washing twice per week and my hair looks great.</li>
      <li>since i often select on the basis of a great-smelling shampoo (NOT the best indicator of a good product) i would wish for more</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product with great results.</li>
      <li>in a good way, if i use conditioner, it gets rid of build up.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to get really good conditioning that made a noticeable difference in my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its not quite as good as I thought it was going to be.</li>
      <li>The original version was wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this in June 2013 and was very pleased with the effectiveness and the quality of the product.  </li>
      <li>I have to say I absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>This conditioner is more like a concentrate, where you just add water in your palm, then lather up and go!  </li>
      <li>100% Pure is a great product!</li>
      <li>light, great smelling - good product... will know more after I&#x27;ve used for a couple of months.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m thrilled to have found these.  </li>
      <li>great product, and it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>also nice to know you are using something that is healthy for both your body and your environment.</li>
      <li>I still purchase this product and like it fairly well, but I will be looking for something more like the original.  </li>
      <li>It feels more whipped and creamy, and the conditioning is still pretty good, but I love the old formula best.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like oils for your hair.</li>
      <li>Safe for me, my unborn child, and it works, too!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>They changed the formula to follow what I thought makes a better business plan.  </li>
      <li>I would think the company would blend more water in and make a greater profit, but instead, you are getting a lot for your money.  :)</li>
      <li>but it does have a nice, clean smell which is more than acceptable.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s all natural and feels soooo good!</li>
      <li>It smells great and it does leave my hair soft but it feels more like a body-butter than a conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I love 100 pure and the yuzu &amp; pomelo version is amazing but this honey coconut dries my hairs out</li>
      <li>After that, it came out easily.  </li>
      <li>Even when she uses fine com</li>
      <li>and my hair is silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic stuff.</li>
      <li>So far so good...</li>
      <li>I also felt like I got more for my money, because I didn&#x27;t have to use very much.  </li>
      <li>This combined with the shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean</li>
      <li>so i switched to this one as it had similar ingredients and good reviews to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But still not a bad product</li>
      <li>Now I go through a bottle quickly trying to get the same results as before; however its still not as good.  </li>
      <li>My scalp feels clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>I am just thinking to buy different smell to see which one we will like more :)</li>
      <li>Well worth the price to get ingredients this clean.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering another, and I&#x27;ll just poke a pin-sized hole near the top before I start using it this time.</li>
      <li>believe when a conditioner has more natural ingredients ur hair tends to become good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was right.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money on this, especially in time for my hair (and skin) to look amazing for my wedding.</li>
      <li>probably more on a once-a-week-deep-conditioning basis rather than for daily use.</li>
      <li>(so you can work it into your scalp), smells incredibly good (but not like chemicals or synthetic fragrances), and leaves my naturally wavy/frizzy hair in much softer, smoother condition than other products, even the ones full of harmful chemicals.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how rich this stuff is my hair is left smooth and the the slip is  unreal and all natural too!</li>
      <li>My hair feels super soft but not oily at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted 100% Pure to find out what might have happened and received this response from them:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank</li>
      <li>My hair was fried on the ends due to chemical coloring, and I applied most of the conditioner to the ends and the rest ran my fingers through my hair, and within the first wash I saw improvement.</li>
      <li>great and only a little bit is needed.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely get shampoo AND conditioner tho, the shampoo strips oils away...</li>
      <li>I Have a wavy hair which is still close to straight</li>
      <li>I have naturally unruly wavy/frizzy hair and using this tends to help calm it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really dissatisfied for the price</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very dissatisfied with the product I received.</li>
      <li>This conditioner not only made my hair baby soft, but it also does not give me a rash like most products do</li>
      <li>In my efforts to get it out, I popped a tiny hole in the side near the top of the tube.</li>
      <li>but it feels great and a little goes a LONG way.</li>
      <li>it slides through hair as hot knife through soft butter.</li>
      <li>do apologize, but we have changed the formula of this conditioner because we received many comments from customers about our previous formula.  </li>
      <li>oh so very soft!</li>
      <li>I normally end up with an oily feeling and buildup after my hair dries.</li>
      <li>I live in a desert climate.</li>
      <li>which is super strang because it&#x27;s for dry, damaged hair.</li>
      <li>Has a nice subtle scent.</li>
      <li>It took me several months to work through the last one because the consistency was like paste and was very effective in small amounts.</li>
      <li>The only fully organic hair products I have found thus far that actually make my hair feel clean.</li>
      <li>I really wish the company would change it back!  </li>
      <li>I bought this one as Christmas gift for my 9 years old daughter.</li>
      <li>It nearly dissolves as you put it on your hair.</li>
      <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the all natural ingredients, I would have already moved on.</li>
      <li>Here is the deal, this is very thick and takes a little effort to squeeze out, BUT more important is that it is all natural and makes my hair behave well and feel soft.  </li>
      <li>It is super thick and kind of hard to spread onto my hair.  </li>
      <li>It was very thick and left my daughter&#x27;s curly dry hair soft and silky, and I loved it on my normal hair.  </li>
      <li>Once I dried my hair, it smelled nice, but was frizzy, yet weighed down.</li>
      <li>New formula feels nicer in your hands, but result is a little less conditioned with use of more product.</li>
      <li>It rinses well, leaves a light fresh scent, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with organic.</li>
      <li>I found it to be very thick and even hard to get out of the tube, but worth the effort because it was free from dangerous chemicals and so effective in helping my hair become softer and free from frizz.</li>
      <li>so I only used a quarter size amount because my hair was already soft after the coconut/honey shampoo</li>
      <li>Much less conditioning than I had hoped but would be fine for unprocessed hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month, still have less than half the bottle left</li>
      <li>about half is grown out now and ALL my hair now feels as soft as the new growth with this shampoo/conditioner combo.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how rich this stuff is my hair is left smooth and the the slip is  unreal and all natural too! The scent is delish too No complaints this is it for me no more searching...There lip gloss is the bomb too...</li>
    <li> The only fully organic hair products I have found thus far that actually make my hair feel clean. I am washing twice per week and my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> i review about one out of every 25 purchases on amazon - only those that are incredible (or horrible as a warning to the unsuspecting!).  i find this shampoo &amp; its matching conditioner to fall into the &amp;#34;incredible&amp;#34; category.  i try every shampoo looking for &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; - drugstore, salon, those of &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; lists.  i quit coloring my hair a year ago when it was like STRAW.  about half is grown out now and ALL my hair now feels as soft as the new growth with this shampoo/conditioner combo.  very little scent - since i often select on the basis of a great-smelling shampoo (NOT the best indicator of a good product) i would wish for more but it does have a nice, clean smell which is more than acceptable.  i&#x27;m thrilled to have found these.  check two things off the list!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product with great results. It rinses well, leaves a light fresh scent, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with organic. 100% Pure is a great product!</li>
    <li> Its not quite as good as I thought it was going to be. But still not a bad product</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful. However, it does NOT feel silky on your hair in the shower. Once I dried my hair, it smelled nice, but was frizzy, yet weighed down. Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I&#x27;m returning it.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have thick, shoulder length, wavy hair. I live in a desert climate.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is perfect! I have long, thick, colored hair. I&#x27;m always wary about buying organic/all-natural hair products because they never condition like they&#x27;re supposed to for me and they&#x27;re expensive. This conditioner not only made my hair baby soft, but it also does not give me a rash like most products do (I think I&#x27;m allergic to synthetic fragrances). The smell is incredible, too. I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money on this, especially in time for my hair (and skin) to look amazing for my wedding. The only negative is that it only lasted me for a little over a month. Still, I am a repeat customer and bought another bottle.</li>
    <li> For purists. Well worth the price to get ingredients this clean.&lt;br /&gt;Works great and only a little bit is needed.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely get shampoo AND conditioner tho, the shampoo strips oils away... in a good way, if i use conditioner, it gets rid of build up.</li>
    <li> The original version was wonderful.  It was very thick and left my daughter&#x27;s curly dry hair soft and silky, and I loved it on my normal hair.  I also felt like I got more for my money, because I didn&#x27;t have to use very much.  Now I go through a bottle quickly trying to get the same results as before; however its still not as good.  I really wish the company would change it back!  I still purchase this product and like it fairly well, but I will be looking for something more like the original.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the all natural ingredients, I would have already moved on.</li>
    <li> I have to say I absolutely love this product! Not only does the smell of the conditioner smell like something out of a spa but it feels great and a little goes a LONG way. My hair was fried on the ends due to chemical coloring, and I applied most of the conditioner to the ends and the rest ran my fingers through my hair, and within the first wash I saw improvement. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month, still have less than half the bottle left [so don&#x27;t be fooled by its size] and my ends are no longer damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also nice to know you are using something that is healthy for both your body and your environment.</li>
    <li> Here is the deal, this is very thick and takes a little effort to squeeze out, BUT more important is that it is all natural and makes my hair behave well and feel soft.  This conditioner is more like a concentrate, where you just add water in your palm, then lather up and go!  I would think the company would blend more water in and make a greater profit, but instead, you are getting a lot for your money.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on formula change 4/14....  They changed the formula to follow what I thought makes a better business plan.  It feels more whipped and creamy, and the conditioning is still pretty good, but I love the old formula best.  We used to go through a tube a month, and now it is used up in a couple weeks.  Still ordering, but wish they would go back.  New formula feels nicer in your hands, but result is a little less conditioned with use of more product.</li>
    <li> I love 100 pure and the yuzu &amp; pomelo version is amazing but this honey coconut dries my hairs out which is super strang because it&#x27;s for dry, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Much less conditioning than I had hoped but would be fine for unprocessed hair.</li>
    <li> Edited review: I ordered this in June 2013 and was very pleased with the effectiveness and the quality of the product.  I found it to be very thick and even hard to get out of the tube, but worth the effort because it was free from dangerous chemicals and so effective in helping my hair become softer and free from frizz. Therefore, I ordered another tube of this, but received a dramatically different product, although the name was the same on the bottle.  The only change to the previous bottle appearance was that the cap was a clear plastic rather than tinted pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very dissatisfied with the product I received. This version was extremely liquid and watery. It nearly dissolves as you put it on your hair. It rinses out in seconds, leaving my hair feeling only slightly softer than it was before, even after five minutes on. My hair is extremely frizzy after using this version and it&#x27;s very hard to get a comb through it. Plus, because the product is so runny, I&#x27;m almost halfway through the bottle in a couple weeks. It took me several months to work through the last one because the consistency was like paste and was very effective in small amounts. I&#x27;m definitely unsatisfied with this version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted 100% Pure to find out what might have happened and received this response from them:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for contacting us, we appreciate your interest in 100% Pure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do apologize, but we have changed the formula of this conditioner because we received many comments from customers about our previous formula.  We have been working on launching a new line of hair products in the near future that contain very thick and moisturizing conditioners though!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review, refers to previous version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Five Stars] Safe for me, my unborn child, and it works, too!&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner works incredibly well. It&#x27;s thick, stays on your hair (without dripping off) if you leave it on for a couple minutes, is easy to thin outwith water (so you can work it into your scalp), smells incredibly good (but not like chemicals or synthetic fragrances), and leaves my naturally wavy/frizzy hair in much softer, smoother condition than other products, even the ones full of harmful chemicals. The only drawback is that it&#x27;s very thick, so hard to get out of the tube. In my efforts to get it out, I popped a tiny hole in the side near the top of the tube. After that, it came out easily.  I&#x27;m ordering another, and I&#x27;ll just poke a pin-sized hole near the top before I start using it this time.</li>
    <li> I read comments and I think I never met another formula. I bought this one as Christmas gift for my 9 years old daughter. The cup was white so I think I got formula #2. Even being a formula #2 it is perfect for my daughter&#x27;s hair. No more pain to brush. Even when she uses fine com it slides through hair as hot knife through soft butter. I will definitely buy more. I am just thinking to buy different smell to see which one we will like more :)</li>
    <li> I have used all of 100% pures shampoos and conditioners and I find this one to be the best smelling and leaves my hair feeling the healthiest. The smell of honey and coconut lingers throughout my hair for the next day or so and my hair is silky and smooth. I have naturally unruly wavy/frizzy hair and using this tends to help calm it. I do use actual honey as a pre conditioner with avocado and coconut oil that I mix up myself before hand, it seems to go well with this shampoo and conditioner. Honey is great for the scalp and hair, so this is an excellent buy. No harmful ingredients to worry about, and it lasts long as well.</li>
    <li> It smells great and it does leave my hair soft but it feels more like a body-butter than a conditioner.  It is super thick and kind of hard to spread onto my hair.  I will definitely use it but probably more on a once-a-week-deep-conditioning basis rather than for daily use.</li>
    <li> light, great smelling - good product... will know more after I&#x27;ve used for a couple of months.  So far so good...</li>
    <li> Let me clarify why I&#x27;m Giving it one star.  The product itself smells an an worked on my hair&lt;br /&gt;I only used it once, after doing a little my investigating this shampoo an conditioner, are not natural&lt;br /&gt;Like the company is saying . There using other plant names that are just the same as synthetic brands&lt;br /&gt;An if you wash your hair every day an it&#x27;s long hair you will a lot of this an it will be hard on your wallet.</li>
    <li> I Have a wavy hair which is still close to straight and i was using Hair rules Quench ultra conditioner. It went temporarily out of stock so i switched to this one as it had similar ingredients and good reviews to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe when a conditioner has more natural ingredients ur hair tends to become good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas i am really dissatisfied with this it doesnt smoothen out my hair it feels really dry after usage(I use abundantly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really dissatisfied for the price</li>
    <li> My hair is literally thanking me for this product. My scalp feels clean and fresh. My hair feels super soft but not oily at all. I have seborric dermatitis and have been going through different shampoos/conditioners and to no avail haven&#x27;t found anything that I can truly feel like their is relief. I&#x27;ve tried argon/morrocon oil and that stuff makes my hair seem oily after I blow dry and all. I don&#x27;t feel any residue build up so that means less dandruff. This product quality to me is like spa-like. I have shoulder length hair with bangs so I only used a quarter size amount because my hair was already soft after the coconut/honey shampoo so I didn&#x27;t think I needed a lot and I was right. The only complaint I can think of is the price. I haven&#x27;t blown dry my hair yet so that&#x27;s why there are only 4 starz. I normally end up with an oily feeling and buildup after my hair dries. So we shall see if that happens or not until then, I would say try it, you may like it. I did...it&#x27;s all natural and feels soooo good!</li>
    <li> This combined with the shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and oh so very soft! Has a nice subtle scent.</li>
    <li> Since this conditioner doesn&#x27;t have silicone it doesn&#x27;t have that slip that my hair needs. It&#x27;s more like oils for your hair.</li>
    <li> great product, and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get really good conditioning that made a noticeable difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But, I don&#x27;t notice a difference or improvement.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic stuff. I was doing the no shampoo method and wanted something to use occasionally. Smells great. Arrived on time</li>
