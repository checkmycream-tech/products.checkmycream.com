    <li> The best neutral shade ever. Been wearing this for years.</li>
    <li> I purchased all 14 bottles of this color when I thought the local beauty supply that I purchase from said that this color would be discontinued. This color does for your nails as the perfect nude pump does for your legs. Makes your hands/nails look sexy, sleek and sophisticated.
