      <li>it&#x27;s too sickly sweet smelling,</li>

      <li>As with other Palmer butters this is a great product too.  </li>
      <li>This product is nothing like the old formula that smelled so good, this new version reeks</li>
      <li>I used to love the old formula with coconut butter in it</li>
      <li>The only downside is that it will feel greasy to the touch, but I&#x27;ll take that any day to have a product that&#x27;s so effective.</li>
      <li>I love how it hydrates all day, and the perfume is subtle but pleasant.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>and though it feels greasy going on, when you wake up it&#x27;s gone and skin is soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>I am willing to try other products from Palmer&#x27;s now as this one was surprisingly effective!</li>
      <li>It also has a very easy to open container for use.</li>
      <li>My family loves the warm cozy scent and how smooth their skin is in the morning.  </li>
      <li>this is a great product, hard to find in the stores.  </li>
      <li>Great product and hard to find on the shelves.</li>
      <li>Did exactly what it said it will do.</li>
      <li>I have used many different Shea products.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty greasy.  </li>
      <li>It is really great for dry skin especially during the winter months.</li>
      <li>Nice smell - really works on dry skin</li>
      <li>Unless you put gloves on right away, the cream does not soak into your hands, it remains very greasy........</li>
      <li>I love the shea butter formula, goes on smooth not greasy , no strong odor and keeps my feet smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s shea butter LOTION, but thought I would try this for my dry winter hands.  </li>

      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>i have only good things to say about this product, i throw out my other lotions</li>
      <li>We use this mainly on feet, particularly heels.  </li>
      <li>This is another high quality Palmer&#x27;s product...worth the money.  </li>
      <li>She has not complained at all</li>
      <li>Great for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to find at local stores</li>
      <li>Oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll have to find a new maker.</li>

      <li>My wife can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
      <li>This product can be hard to find at times, so I&#x27;m glad to see it at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Living in a drier climate, it keeps my skin soft and it clears up adult acne.</li>
      <li>There is a very slight greasiness to the skin after applying, which can be removed if blotted lightly with a towel and doesn&#x27;t change the absorbency of the formula to the skin.</li>
      <li>Several weeks later he called to tell us that for the first time in years, he can walk without pain.  </li>
      <li>and I dislike the former as much as I like the latter.</li>
      <li>It is heavy but absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>After some basic rehab, we sent him home with a jar and clear instructions on how to care for his feet.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this formula on my feet after taking a shower.  It makes them nice and smooth.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the stores so I&#x27;m happy that Amazon&#x27;s got it at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This product did not met my expectations. Furthermore, the product I was expecting was not the one that got delivered. The product I was expecting was suppose to be Palmer&#x27;s Shea Butter Formula Cream 7.25 oz. I have enclosed a picture at the bottom of the product I was  expecting.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this moisturizer in any local drug stores - only the cocoa butter version, which is not my preference.  So I will keep this stuff on my Wish List for next time.  I used Palmer&#x27;s during my 1st pregnancy, and I&#x27;m using it again for my 2nd. I love how it hydrates all day, and the perfume is subtle but pleasant.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over six months now. I can tell you that it met all my expectations. My skin looks definitely softer. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS</li>
    <li> As with other Palmer butters this is a great product too.  Great for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to find at local stores so I&#x27;m glad I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product goes everywhere with me. In my car, I put a little on my nails, hands and feet every day. It is the most healing cream for those cracked fingers that I have ever come across. You can also put a little on your lips and the ends of your hair.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my psoriasis! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product is nothing like the old formula that smelled so good, this new version reeks it&#x27;s too sickly sweet smelling, just awful. Won&#x27;t be buying again unless I can find away to remove the perfume.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, moisturizing, smells good and the whole family can use it.</li>
    <li> I loooove this! Excellent for people with dry skin!</li>
    <li> I keep this big jar by my bed and use it on my hands and feet every night. It is heavy but absorbs quickly.  It only take a small amount so the jar lasts a long time.  The smell is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product. It is really great for dry skin especially during the winter months.</li>
    <li> I have used many different Shea products. This is by far the best. Use it after showering and prior to drying off for best results.</li>
    <li> I was so very disappointed when I received this Palmer&#x27;s  Raw Shea butter with Vitamine E and read a long list of additional ingredients not mentioned on Amazon. I gave it to a friend rather than return it, but I will be returning the three jars of Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter since I cannot use it for the same reason I cannot use the Shea butter. Please list ALL ingredients in products in the future.</li>
    <li> I love using this stuff as an overnight moisturizer. It can be a tad greasy for during the day, but it definitely does the job. Makes my skin feel so smooth. As a dry skin sufferer, I don&#x27;t have to scratch my skin with a hairbrush after I put this on!</li>
    <li> i have only good things to say about this product, i throw out my other lotions i just want this stuff nothing else. thanks annie hamilton.:)</li>
    <li> Works great! Very smooth</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer. though a bit heavy for day use.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for nighttime and for legs, knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;Caught hubby moisturizing his leather banjo strap with it...he&#x27;s a fan too...</li>
    <li> Nice smell - really works on dry skin</li>
    <li> Great product and hard to find on the shelves. Reasonable price and recommend Amazon to purchase hard to find products</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t live without this. A great product.</li>
    <li> Have always liked it just can&#x27;t find it at walmart or any store anymore cost more on line but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for someone who needs thicker moisturizer. I use this on my feet and elbows.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I must use this product daily because of my extremely dry skin. I find this product does the job without being too oily or ruining clothes like baby oil.</li>
    <li> This product is solid shea butter, not a lotion.  It will absorb into your skin, just not right away.  Overnight it is wonderful!  Put it on your feet or hands, go to bed, wake up with much softer skin.  We use this mainly on feet, particularly heels.  We&#x27;re big fans of the lotion for during the day applications to our hands, but the solid butter in the jar has been a lifesaver for my husband&#x27;s feet.  His heels get thick callouses and crack.  Happens to many, many soldiers and laborers.  This butter has been a great addition to our weekly pedicure routine.  A dear friend came to visit whose feet were cracked and bleeding.  After some basic rehab, we sent him home with a jar and clear instructions on how to care for his feet.  Several weeks later he called to tell us that for the first time in years, he can walk without pain.  I&#x27;m not saying this is a miracle product, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s a great tool to have in your skin care program.  The only downside is that it will feel greasy to the touch, but I&#x27;ll take that any day to have a product that&#x27;s so effective.</li>
    <li> Works great to smooth out dry skin, even eczema patches.  Only drawback is the granular bits that take a little while to melt.  Be sure to let product sit in palms until liquified, then rub hands together to fully melt the grainy bits.  My family loves the warm cozy scent and how smooth their skin is in the morning.  Minus 1 star for the grainy bits.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions I have used. Living in a drier climate, it keeps my skin soft and it clears up adult acne. I leave it on overnight and though it feels greasy going on, when you wake up it&#x27;s gone and skin is soft and smooth! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used Parmers shea butter before, that is the reason for ordering it, because I like what it do for my body.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it said it will do. Worked better than any moisturerizer I used before. Will purchase over and over again.</li>
    <li> Too greasy, stains fabric, Good thing I was able to find an alternative use for this product...I use it to moisturize my dogs paws</li>
    <li> Not easy to find in stores. My whole family has dry skin and eczema, and this butter has been wonderful. Even cleared up my sons acne on his face</li>
    <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s shea butter LOTION, but thought I would try this for my dry winter hands.  Unless you put gloves on right away, the cream does not soak into your hands, it remains very greasy........I still love the Palmers shea butter formula lotion in the pump!</li>
    <li> leave my skin nice and smooth</li>
    <li> Life is not the same without this product. I use it daily on my ethic skin.</li>
    <li> This product has been a terrific help for reducing scars from stretch marks. I wish I had taken before and after photos, but applying regularly to severe stretch marks has resulted in about a 70%reduction in the overall appearance after about 30 days. The thick formula feels smooth once applying or can be heated slightly to absorb faster. There is a very slight greasiness to the skin after applying, which can be removed if blotted lightly with a towel and doesn&#x27;t change the absorbency of the formula to the skin. This product has also been great for dry skin and excema also.</li>
    <li> This is another high quality Palmer&#x27;s product...worth the money.  It also has a very easy to open container for use.</li>
    <li> This product can be hard to find at times, so I&#x27;m glad to see it at Amazon.  Nothing better to use for intense moisture at a fantastic price.  Best used on feet with a thick pair of socks in winter months.  I take mine with me to use after every pedicure as well.  Great price, great product.  I hope it&#x27;s always on the market.  Thank you Palmers.</li>
    <li> Using this on my mom...age 94.  She hates creams and lotions most of the time.  Uses only water.  She has not complained at all and her skin is gorgeous.  The aide who helps bathe her cannot stop talking about it and has informed all of her patients.  I bought it for myself originally...but, guess, I need to order a separate one for myself.  I am willing to try other products from Palmer&#x27;s now as this one was surprisingly effective!</li>
    <li> this is a great product, hard to find in the stores.  I love the shea butter formula, goes on smooth not greasy , no strong odor and keeps my feet smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  Few brick and mortar stores carry it any longer so thank goodness for Amazon!  Great for feet, elbows, and dry hands, though for hands it&#x27;s pretty greasy.  During gardening season I apply it prior to putting on my gardening gloves.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes so well ! I love the scent too ! Been using this for years, but I can rarely find it in stores now !</li>
    <li> leaves behind solid pieces on my face its difficult to take off and takes up too much of my time.</li>
    <li> The pictured item is great but twice now Amazon has sent Palmer&#x27;s Shea Formula; Moisturizing Shea Balm instead Palmer&#x27;s Shea Butter Formula with Vitamin E. They&#x27;re totally different and I dislike the former as much as I like the latter.</li>
    <li> Why do companies think they have to change a winning formula?  I used to love the old formula with coconut butter in it but now they&#x27;ve changed it.  The new one has cocoa butter in it.  Awful sweet smell.  It looks like they must have the market on cocoa butter because just about everything they make has it in it.  Oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll have to find a new maker.</li>
