    <li> I used to work for a dr and we sold jan marini and I absolutely loved all the products and glad to find someone who is able to sell online because you could only get from a physician. I helped a lady in her 40&#x27;s w/acne scars that nothing she tried work and when she used jan marini and saw a difference in her skin and scars, she starting crying and thanking me for introducing these products to her because she felt pretty again before the scars. Thumbs up to these products</li>
    <li> Purchased this product based off a recommendation for Acne purposes!! I&#x27;ve been suffering from horrible cystic hormonal acne breakouts (mind you i&#x27;m 37 YRS OLD) for the past 2 yrs and resulting in pretty bad scarring.  I can&#x27;t say 100% this is what is clearing it up since i&#x27;m taking herbs (to help the internal issue), Oz Naturals vitamin C serum, the Jan Marini Skin Zyme Papaya cleanser, Jan Marini Bioglycolic face Cleanser  &amp; use the Derma Logic 1.0 mm Derma Roller but i can say i believe in combination w/ everything else I&#x27;m VERY, VERY happy w/ the results so far- i&#x27;m totally loving it! My skin has totally cleared up - i&#x27;m hoping providing the detail will help anyone who has had my acne problems - good LUCK!</li>
    <li> This product was used on me at the salon I worked for. It will clear off dead skin without burning. Follow directions and don&#x27;t  overdo it. I have mature skin and this product removes surface loose skin without the temporary peeling look of other products. I always use a moisturizer with sunscreen on a daily basis too.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It is gentle on the skin and leaves it amazingly smooth.I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love love love. This is the second time I have bought this mask and it won&#x27;t be the last! If you haven&#x27;t used it before, you should start today!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Thank you for not selling expired products.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended.  Im 43 years old and have already had my share of botox, etc...Jan Marini line is afforable and it works.  Helps maintain healthy younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and how my skin feels after I use the mask.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Love this. Got it first from my phenomenal facialist and was glad I could find it cheaper here than I could in the spa. I use it in conjunction with the CleanZyme cleanser and Phyto.  Has done wonders for my hormonal adult acne.</li>
    <li> Only need to use a little each time for your mask and skin feels great.  Not drying like other products.</li>
    <li> This mask is AMAZING! I use it 2-3x a week before my usual regimen of jan marini cleansers and moisturizer. This mask takes away redness after any acne extractions, reduces pore size and makes your skin GLOW and so so soft! Came perfectly packaged, no leaks or breaks, on time and for a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this product, works great with the enzyme cleanser</li>
    <li> this stuff is great......just like all the Jan Marini products!!!!  will be buying this again for sure....thanks a lot!  Awsome</li>
    <li> Works really well - as all Jan Marini products do, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and smells really nice.  Has made a positive difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is like a mini facial!  I use it a coupe times of week keep it on for about 20mins.  Great for clearing up skin.  I use it before a night out and my skin is glowing!!!  Way cheaper to buy on Amazon then at the spa!  Not over drying and great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC!!! I absolutely love this Jan Marini Skin Zyme Papaya Mask. I highly recommend this product, but be sure you check to see how many ounces you&#x27;re receiving. Some places over charge others are fair and honest.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It isn&#x27;t harsh on your skin and helps digest all the clogged pores. Highly recommend</li>
