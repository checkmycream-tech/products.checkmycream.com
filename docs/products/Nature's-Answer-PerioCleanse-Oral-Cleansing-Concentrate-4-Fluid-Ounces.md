      <li>Nice tasting and stronger mouth wash that is very concentrated</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> excellent product, must make another purchase</li>
    <li> I like it, and put a little in my hand then massage into my scalp.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll find out more on my next dentist visit.&lt;br /&gt;Gums and teeth feel very clean after using this!!!</li>
    <li> This is my third order.  It works great in my Water Pic and the taste is fine.  My gums feel really clean after using this and I&#x27;ll do anything to prevent problems.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the amazing reviews here, I made sure to order PerioCleanse for my Waterpik. It&#x27;s an expensive product, but I was hopeful 9given all of the hype) that it would drastically improve my oral irrigation experience. It did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for a little over a week and while I certainly have not experienced any negative effects from use, any positive effects have been negligible. In addition, using two pumps (as instructed) per use will result in an empty bottle very quickly - I&#x27;m already 1/4 of the way through my first bottle. Thus, I think the price of this product greatly outweighs any value that regular use would provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love this product, but find myself saying &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34; Back to regular water in the WaterPik for me.</li>
    <li> I use the mouthwash version of this all the time and I love it. I bought this concentrate to use in my water flosser and it works wonderfully. It really helped with some tooth pain I was having. I used it twice a day for about a week and haven&#x27;t had any pain since. I&#x27;m saving the rest in case I start having pain again, at least until I can have the tooth professionally taken care of. I still continue to use the mouthwash version. The gel rub that they make for tooth pain is also great. I will continue to purchase products from this company. They are a lifesaver if you are having serious mouth issues and don&#x27;t have the bucks to go to a dentist right away.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for almost two weeks now and my gums are healthier. I do not bleed any more and the dentist saw the change in four days. I don&#x27;t know the benefits in the long run nor the side effects it may have. Do some research on your own. It says in the bottle it is 100 % natural (botanical) , and there are many dangerous herbs so do not just buy things because it Natural.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive $20  a bottle. Is it worth it ? The first bottle as an experiment, absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure yet if I am going to buy a second bottle. Most likely, no.&lt;br /&gt;I mix the water on my \\&quot;Toothpick\\&quot; with Listerine or Toms of Maine mouth wash and works extremely well.</li>
    <li> The pump of this product is leaking. I use the product with my waterpik. First I clean my teeth with the waterpik only with water, brush my teeth and then use the waterpik again with PerioCleanse. It tastes good but I do not use it every day.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting this product to also help with dry mouth.  Strong flavor but not objectionable .  I would absolutely recommend this.  Leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and CLEAN!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what exactly it is that is in this but it makes me gag and I cannot use it! I don&#x27;t even like the smell... ugh!  Wasted my money on this product... will stick with mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Just started using an irrigater for use with braces and wanted to put something in the water that would help clean and freshen at the same time.  I use only 1 squirt and it it does the job. It makes my teeth and mouth feel fresh, and I know it&#x27;s great for my mouth&#x27;s health. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a long time. Soothes gums and makes a difference overall. Tastes good. Pretty strong if you don&#x27;t dilute it. I even use a half pump on my toothbrush from time to time just to massage it into the gums a little better.  My only issue would be that I wish they would make this available as a refill rather than giving you a brand new pump with every bottle.  Perhaps there is a reason, but it seems unnecessary and wasteful to me.</li>
    <li> Mucked up my waterpick horribly! Had to replace the receptacle (because it ruined the seal, making it leak), as well as the wand (because it gunked up the flow stop button, resulting in having to pry it to open again).</li>
    <li> I have been using Nature&#x27;s Answer PerioCleanse for three weeks and I am already impressed with its results.  It is not an abrasive liquid and it does not taste bad.  My gums have felt exponentially better and I have been able to delay LANAP gum surgery.  My dentist appears to think I may not even need the procedure and I owe it to this product.  In the fourth week, I also purchased Nature&#x27;s Answer Perio mouth wash, which is also a fantastic product.  This line is great for your gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Does a great job and doesn&#x27;t taste that bad.</li>
    <li> This review might not really be helpful to anyone since I never used it long enough to expect to see a change...I just couldn&#x27;t get past the taste. And I&#x27;m a person who loves spices. Turns out that love doesn&#x27;t extend past food. The other reviewers described it best...minty oregano. Except it&#x27;s more oregano than mint. And not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I had to go back and brush my teeth and gargle with mouthwash, because no way did I want to go to work first thing in the morning and have my breath smell the way it felt...icky. I decided that I&#x27;d just use it at night time, but turns out I don&#x27;t like that taste in my mouth when going to bed either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Periorub, made by this same company and I love it and the flavor of it. I add the periorub to my toothpaste on my toothbrush and it seems to give it a kick. The result is a lovely and intense mintyness and my gums (I think) are looking healthier. I gave this product 3 stars since the base ingredients are the same that are in the Periorub, I expect that it will work just as well in promoting better oral health, the two star subtraction was based on the taste of this product. If they change that, they&#x27;d win me over.</li>
    <li> Fantastic  been using it just a week or so. I liked to have been using this for years! I will try some of your other products</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mouth wash - this is more for adding to a water pik. I couldn&#x27;t use this product after all, so I gave it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;This may work for others, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I just got back from the dentist and she saw massive improvements on my gums. She asked if I&#x27;d &amp;#34;actually been flossing?&amp;#34; and I told her I&#x27;d bought a waterpik and some solution. She sad I should keep this up, but also add flossing every other day to really break up that plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 justbecause the pump drippeda fewt times sitting on the couter and as the bottlegets low, you have to unscrew it and poor directly from the bottle. Minor issues&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m nota huge fan of the price, but I&#x27;ll justuse less and make it last longer</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and great for my dental irrigation</li>
    <li> This product it&#x27;s Ok  just because they said it&#x27;s natural, but is not a  miracle for  ill gums. I used everyday solution with waterpik, first filling was clean, but I saw some yellow spots on my teeth I reduce using  2-3 time per week, but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes  to my gums. Maybe  if using for a long time, I&#x27;ll see some  improvments .&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I order this product again.</li>
    <li> While buying my second waterpik, I saw this product and decided to try it.  It tastes and smells a lot like tea tree Oil.  Not a bad thing, but suspect since tea tree oil is not listed as an an ingredient.  The problem I have with it is that you&#x27;re supposed to &amp;#34;shake it well before using&amp;#34;.  Well, with the pump spout, when you shake it you get little brown spots of periocleanse all over your bathroom walls, mirror, and sink.  No thanks.  My Listerine works just fine, and I don&#x27;t need to shake it well before using.</li>
    <li> Super answer to brushing my teeth!</li>
    <li> I love this product- it makes your mouth taste really clean and fresh.  Sure it&#x27;s doing wonders for gums too.</li>
    <li> After amalgam removal, my teeth throbbed so much it gave me an ear ache. Liquids of any kind seemed to set off the pain more. 1 rinse and swish of 1/4 teaspoon in 2-3 oz room temp water for about 2 minutes, and 80 percent of the pain was gone.  I will keep swishing into the new fillings every day. Great product!</li>
    <li> This helped heal an inflammation in my gums, and adds significant boost to my waterpik regimen. It leaves a natural minty aftertaste. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR YOUR TEETH AND GUMS</li>
    <li> Periocleanse seems to be working.  It has a refreshing taste in the mouth.  I use it in my electric flosser</li>
    <li> Since getting PerioCleanse, I am rinsing more. I use this along with the other products from this line. I am very pleased with the way my mouth feels and teeth look.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Bugs don&#x27;t like it though.  Used it in bug home made mosquito spray for front and back porch.</li>
    <li> I returned this after trying it a couple of times. It taste bad and the taste stays for a long time.</li>
    <li> If you are lucky to never get itchy throat or ears, this product along with the rest of the Periocleanse line will probably be the most healing solution for your gum disease. However, for the rest of us who have allergies and get itchy throat and at risk of ear infections, think twice before you use it. I bought the whole line. I like that this is very antiseptic and natural, but unfortunately all these products contain way too much peppermint, eucalyptus and rosemary oil. These oils irritate mucus membranes. Think of your throat as an organ covered in protective mucus just like your eyes. You wouldn&#x27;t put peppermint oil in your eyes, would you? Of course, for healthy people the concentration of these oils won&#x27;t cause a problem. I sent these products to my my family and they never complained. However, if you have compromised ENT-related health, this can irritate your throat and cause problems.    I had a horrible allergic reaction to nuts within 3 weeks after starting using these products. My ear became itchy. This irritation lasted for many months and left me with only 80% of my original hearing ability in that ear. I&#x27;m yet to find a way to reverse that. And I had been eating tons of nuts all my life prior to this incident. It very much feels like the essential oils in this product irritated my throat and ear canal, which reduced their defenses a great deal.    If you do decide to buy this product, make sure to stop using it if you notice any irritation in your mucus membranes.    Good news is that there are a lot less irritating alternatives. You can swish your teeth while drinking antiseptic teas such as green tea, tulsi or chamomile. If you really need a natural treatment, you can just get some oregano and/or myrrh oil, dilute it in any base oil and apply it to your gums. It&#x27;s not necessary to have dozens of ingredients that you might happen to be allergic or sensitive to.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Easy to use and makes your gums feel good.</li>
    <li> This really helps my gums and teeth. My gums were swollen and sore last night, but a good shot of this in my water pick and today they are pain free and no longer swollen! Used regularly, it really helps my perio issues.</li>
    <li> use it to wash my mouth out when I use water pick</li>
    <li> Goes well with the water pic</li>
    <li> Far better than expected! Gross looking and does the job. Makes teeth feel really clean almost all day ... very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> As described and effective. Love the taste. Far superior to commercial mouthwash. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Developed by a dentist that I was introduced to. Very knowledgeable fellow with an active knowledge of the microscope and he knows his pathology &amp; bacteria.  My kind of guy!</li>
    <li> Leaves the mouth feeling very fresh.</li>
    <li> Works well with the oral water pick. Blah blah blah blah why do I have to write so many words.</li>
    <li> Adequate, but a little pricy.</li>
    <li> This product works..  i used to use the pescription stuff but read the warning on that &amp;#34;can stain teeth brown&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does NOT stain teeth...  2 pumps into the waterpik and your gums get nice and heathly .. no more bleeding, no more rotten bacterica smell..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy gums mean you keep your teeth and you might get more kisses if your mouth doesnt stink like the cat box</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  PerioCleanse contains CoQ10 and various extracts that have been shown to improve oral health. I use it as the final step in my oral hygiene routine. First I waterfloss with plain warm water in my waterpik, then brush (using Dr Collins toothbrush and Jason&#x27;s Oral Comfort toothpaste). After my teeth are fully cleaned, then I use PerioCleanse in a slightly unusual way: 2 squirts in 10 oz warm water like the label says, however, I keep recycling the mixture, catching it in a cup, and pouring it back into the waterpik. In this way, I&#x27;m able to continuously massage my gums with the mixture for 2-3 minutes. When I&#x27;m done, my teeth and gums feel fabulously clean and their circulation stimulated. I had some deep pockets from back when I didnt take good care of my teeth, now all my 5&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s have become 3&#x27;s and 4&#x27;s in less than a year. I fully believe I&#x27;ll never have dental problems again now that I&#x27;ve discovered PerioCleanse and Waterpik.</li>
    <li> So far so good. has a mint taste</li>
    <li> Love this product so glad I found it for my water pic.</li>
    <li> After researching and choosing a waterpic for gum care, I felt like a cleaning concentrate would add more healthy benefits to the routine. This is refreshing and makes my mouth feel extra clean. I use a pump or 2 to the water tank. Seems better than just using plain water.</li>
    <li> I use this with my waterpik every day.  I love that it is natural ingredients and leaves a fresh taste in my mouth and I don&#x27;t use artificial ingredients.</li>
    <li> Only two weeks into using it so I can&#x27;t vouch for gum restoration/repair but I can easily say this stuff makes my mouth feel &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have gum disease and have had problems with bad breath from time to time, and this in my waterpik in combination with TheraBreath Perio Therapy, and Jason toothpaste seriously keeps my breath under control all day long. I&#x27;ll report back after my next cleaning in regards to my pockets getting smaller. I love the fact that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I switched my review from 5 stars to 3. It seems the ingredients/recipe for this may have changed. The second bottle I ordered isn&#x27;t nearly as strong/fresh as the first. The first bottle I ordered would leave my breath fresh for hours, this second bottle only lasts about 30 minutes or so. Bummer, I really liked the first bottle!! I also asked my Dental Hygienist if she had seen any gum restoration/repair since my last visit. She didn&#x27;t notice any difference, but I&#x27;ll check in with her again on my next visit in 3 months.</li>
    <li> I got great reviews from my hygienist.</li>
    <li> Very effective for dry mouth discomfort.</li>
    <li> If you use it via irrigator it becomes really diluted even double strength. The irrigation solution washes out of your mouth much to quickly to retain any of the beneficial properties. I recommend using the regular oral swish and gargle solution. You can hold it longer to reach all areas of mouth and retain the benefits, also its more concentrated.</li>
    <li> Nice tasting and stronger mouth wash that is very concentrated so it lasts a while. I would recommend I buy again</li>
    <li> I was surprised how what smells like just herbs could make my teeth feel like they had just had a dentist clean them. Plus used with a jet pic to clean between the teeth, after a few weeks the sensitivity that was between my teeth telling me I was not flossing well enough or often enough cleared up. Pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Great taste and convenient packaging. It does exactly what it is designed to do. If using in an oral irrigater such as the Viajet, I would advise running one tank full of very hot water after each usage - 2 if you are using the maximum dosage to avoid clogging the device.</li>
    <li> Regret the leak of the pump, letting staining drops escape at each use (keep a little saucer underneath). Might have well enhanced my oral care routine, I&#x27;m not sure since i use it with the complete hygiene routine prescribed by Periocleanse (toothbrush, toothpaste, topical rub).</li>
    <li> An excellent oral irrigation supplement. All natural with no synthetic colors or flavors or other chemicals. Use with water pick type irrigator. Leaves a clean fresh feel.</li>
    <li> PerioCleanse is an oral concentrate, that is part of Nature&#x27;s Answer&#x27;s oral care line. I Switched to the Perio line over 7 months ago and have been extremely pleased ever since. PerioCleanse is an herb rich formula that does not contain any alcohol, synthetic chemicals or solvents, sodium laurel sulfate, artificial sweeteners, colors or dyes. It does contain a wonderful mix of herbs, including CoQ10, Folic Acid, Aloe Vera, Green Tea, Olive Leaf, Echinacea and other beneficial wildcrafted herbs. This soothing mix helps to soothe and heal irritated gums, discourage microbes (that cause bacteria, leading to periodontal issues) and promote healthy teeth and gums for better oral health. I have used Sensodyne for over two years without helping my sensitivity issues. The Perio line, (I use the PerioBrite toothpaste, PerioWash oral rinse along with this) and it has made a tremendous difference in my oral health. Simply add 2 pumpfuls (4 if you have sensitivity or perio issues) to warm water in your Waterpik and rinse. I do this before I brush my teeth. Don&#x27;t eat or drink anything for 10 minutes afterwards. The concentrate has a fresh herbal smell and your gums may tingle slightly. It is a soothing effect. My gums and teeth are stronger and feel much better. I highly recommend PerioCleanse and the attendant toothpaste and mouthwash. They all contain the rich, natural healthly herbal mix that is better for your teeth, gums and overall oral health. I don&#x27;t miss all the additives that the major brands contain, the natural herbal formation is far superior. Try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS... I USE IT FOR MY BRACES IN AN WATER FLOSSER THIS MY 2ND BOTTLE AND ITS ONE OF MY AUTOSHIP ... DOE WHAT DO ... NO COMPLAINTS  AND IT SHIPPED IN A TIMELY MANNER...</li>
    <li> Leaves a fresh feel and clean feel to my mouth.</li>
    <li> This concentraded mouth wash is easy to use and keeps my mouth fresh.  I travel a lot and like not having to lug around big bottles.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by this one.  I expected another hoax, like snake oil.  I saw immediate results with this product.  This was a good buy</li>
    <li> Very good product and I love it.</li>
    <li> not the best taste but used as they say you will notice the change in your mouth within a few weeks. Don&#x27;t need a water pic just put a few drops on your tooth brush</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I had been using another product for months and not seeing any real results.  One of the problems I had was that a tooth that was crowned had a red bubble above it like there could be infection in there and the gum had drawn up so you could see the root or area of the tooth that was under the gum line.  This was a couple of teeth over from my two front teeth, so I wanted it fixed.  I was very diligent with the other product and very disappointed.  So I decided to try something different.  This formula sounded good and it was.  I used it about three weeks and the swelling went down, redness gone, and the gum has moved back down over the root of the tooth.  I&#x27;m very impressed!  I&#x27;m sure the rest of my gums are happy also.</li>
    <li> need bigger bottles so I don&#x27;t need to order as often and whats up with the pump, it is a shame they don&#x27;t make a refill bottle!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used Perioclense, along with Periowash for about 6 months. My dentist and periodondist checkups have gotten better since I&#x27;ve added the Periocleanse to my hydro flosser</li>
    <li> I use this in my Water Pik flosser.  Just mix a few drops with the warm water in your tank.  It does do a good job of removing plaque from my teeth and my teeth are whiter since using.  It just tastes funky which is the reason for the 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> This leaves your whole mouth refresh and clean. I would recommend this mouth cleanser to anyone,who wants to improve their dental health.</li>
    <li> works well, one pump into water cleanser and it does the job.....</li>
