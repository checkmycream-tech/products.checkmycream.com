<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> would get 5 stars except cleaning stand tells me to replace cartridge after only 1 cleaning. You need to remove and re-insert to use it again (every time).</li>
    <li> I have had such a terrible experience with the warranty service on this shaver that I don&#x27;t know where to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great razor, until the base stopped cleaning and charging the razor. Well within the warranty period I contacted customer support, and it appeared as if I would have no problem sending this back for repairs or a new unit. However, now that they&#x27;ve had my razor for 2 months, it&#x27;s a different story every time I talk to them. I&#x27;ve called 5 times over the past two weeks, and right now I&#x27;ve been on hold for 45 minutes waiting for a supervisor. I don&#x27;t know if Panasonic is the problem, or this other company called Accent Online (who perhaps handles the warranty?) They clearly have no intention of doing anything for me without extorting a sum of money within 10% of the original purchase price of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that it&#x27;s a fine razor, so long as you plan to toss it after 18 months and buy a new one. I think I&#x27;ll just go back to a real razor, any time I saved shaving with the electric has been negated trying to get it fixed.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a month and I really like it. With this product I almost don&#x27;t need a mirror to shave myself, I consider it a waste of time. And after the shaving it is (almost) every time perfect. The reason why I decided to buy this shaver is because I got acne from my last shaving machine and I had heard good stories of this one. And yep, no more acne from shaving (give it some weeks, it needs that to get justified to your skin or vice versa). It has really long battery time and you can see it on the display as well, no dust are getting in the shaver since you put it up-sidedown in the cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Good shaver &#x3D; high price.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about switching from a razor to an electric because I have very sensitive skin, especially around my neck.  At first, it was not as close as a shave but after a month now, it is close and smooth without any irritation at all around my neck.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier and is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!  Spend the extra money for a pain free and fast shave. I don&#x27;t even need to use it with shaving cream but it is a nice feature to have if I would want to.  Amazing product!!!!!</li>
    <li> He liked it but in the end found that it was not much different than what he already had.  It is pretty noisy and takes a long time for the cleaning process to take place.</li>
    <li> Bought this from that largest brick and mortar retailer because I can return it there without paying return shipping charges.  I also had Braun Series 7 (790cc) to compare.  In terms of design Braun wins hands-down.  This Panasonic just looks and feels cheaply made, the shaving head is huge, and trimmer is flimsy, although it gets the job done as well as the well-designed Braun.  The cleaning station is far inferior to Braun&#x27;s as well, with no advanced options or quick clean mode.  Also, while the shaving head can move side-to-side and back-and-fro, it&#x27;s not as smooth of motion as the the Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Panasonic wins hands down is shave quality.  Braun doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close.  In fact, the Arc4 is so close, it&#x27;s a bit rough on the skin, and I don&#x27;t exactly have a baby face.  All it takes is some three passes, and it&#x27;s done.  The shaver has a timer, and I timed under a minute for shave!  The foil/blade design is so good that it catches onto the hair if you just run it over the face when it&#x27;s turned off, so I guess their nano-blades aren&#x27;t just a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, really wish there was a way to get Panasonic&#x27;s shave quality and Braun&#x27;s built and design quality in one unit.  I was inclined to give it 3 stars because of the cheap plastic construction, oversized shave head, and mediocre cleaning station, but that wouldn&#x27;t be fair in light of superior shave quality.</li>
    <li> Yes in more way than one.  I no longer have in grown hairs and I get a clean close shave</li>
    <li> I had the same shaver for the past five years. It finally stopped giving me a fast, close shave so I replaced it with this new one. It is excellent.</li>
    <li> hAD A nORELCO SHAVER THAT TORE UP MY SKIN WHEN SHAVING, THREW THAT PIECE OF CRAP AWAY AND GOT THIS ONE TO REPLACE IT. SO FAR  THIS SHAVER HAS DONE A GREAT JOB.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a shaver that would not succumb to the riggers of my head and face. I&#x27;ve tryed probably 30 different shavers and I&#x27;ll never cheat myself again. If your a man who&#x27;s beard does crazy growth paterns like my head and face do, look no further.  This is not for the tutti fruit, lolli pop beard. Boys get out of the way, you might get hurt. All i can say is this unit gets the job done. Do yourself a favor and make your old lady get this thing for you on valentines day. Don&#x27;t listen to any excuses.</li>
    <li> IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO GOOD ELECTRIC SHAVERS OR THAT YOU THINK THAT YOU OWN THE BEST, I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU!!!  NO BLADE OR STRAIGHT RAZOR CAN OR WILL SHAVE YOU CLOSER OR WITHOUT FACIAL OR NECK BURN THAN THIS GEM.  IF YOU ENJOY THE CURSE OF SWIRLING NECK, FACE, OR CHIN HAIR, YOUR WORRIES ARE OVER!!! TAKE THIS INTO THE SHOWER, USE WITH OR WITHOUT SHAVING CREAM, OR JUST GRAB THIS BEAUTIE AND SHAVE WHILE WATCHING YOUR FAVORITE SPORTS SHOW OR MOVIE...VOILA!!!! WELCOME TO BEARD VALHALLA.  I HAVE USED EVERY BLASTED SHAVING ITEM AND THIS WITHOUT QUESTION IS THE BEST.  DON&#x27;T THINK TWICE-BUY IT. YOU WILL REAP THE DIVIDENDS FOR YEARS.  GIRLS WATCH OUT HERE YOU COME!!!!!</li>
    <li> Panasonic Vortex Shaver, the best shave you can get.  After being a loyal Braun customer for over twenty-five years I made the switch to Panasonic.  Why. Some history.  I had owned three Braun Pulsonic shavers in the last 1 1/2 years. I had the same corroding issues with all three shavers, pitting under the foil head, cracking and pealing, flaking of the finish and fading of the engraving. I cleaned my shaver daily using only the Braun cleaner following the Braun instructions. From all the postings and threads on the internet this is not an isolated case. Before Braun was acquired from Proctor &amp; Gamble I was very happy with products from Braun. Its either that they are avoiding correction the design problems that are reported on the internet or they look at the cost benefit analysis and do not see the need to correct what appears to be a common problems with their braun shaver design. Customer service says the same thing over and over....we have not heard that before please send the razor in for evaluation. These issues should have been addressed in the poduct development and testing phase or corrected when brought to light. THE BRAUN PULSONIC SHAVER IS MY LAST BRAUN PRODUCT AND I HAD BEEN A LOYAL BRAUN CUSTOMER FOR OVER TWENTY- FIVE YEARS. With that being said, I researched and liked what I found on the internet regarding the new generation Panasonic Voetex Shavers.  Its form meets function. Its the closest shave to a blade shave you will ever get.  Cleanup is a breeze and eliminates the corroding related issues of alcohol based cleaning systems.  The Panasonic system uses a water based cleaner refill (you can find these priced very low if you do a quick search on Amazon.com) that  filters the cleaning solution.  The Panasonic Vortex Shaver fits well in the hand and feels very natural to use.  The onboard trimmer is easy to use, trim sideburns well and is hidden when not needed.  As a plus the Panasonic Vortex can be used in the shower or with shave cream for a barber shop shave.   The fit and finish of the Panasonic Vortex Shaver is outstanding.  And as a added benefit the shaver is made in Japan, no outsourcing to outside vendors that can effect the quality of the product.  I have been very impressed with the Panasonic Vortex Shaver and would highly recommend this shaver.  And this comes from someone who judged Braun shavers as the industry benchmark for many years!</li>
    <li> PROS:  -Very smooth close shave  -No razor burn  -No rough patches  -Works well on a beard that grows in different directions or is a mix of coarse and fine or curly and straight.    -Somehow manages to navigate my acne scarring and still give a smooth shave.  -Face feels great afterwards  -Can use in the shower and with shaving cream.  -Shaves better than a traditional razor- at least for me!  -Easy to clean.    CONS:  - Cleaning Unit may not be necessary if you want to save a few dollars.  - First day with the shaver.  Will check back to let you know how it holds up after continued use.    REVIEW    I just got the best shave of my life-- from an electric razor. I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful this Panasonic is!  I used it today in the shower with some JASON shaving cream and was absolutely blown away by the results.  My face feels smoother than it&#x27;s ever been after shaving-- with any razor regular or electric.  But best of all, I have no pain, no razor burn, and no rough patches. My face feels great!      And that&#x27;s a big thing to say, because up until now absolutely nothing has worked for me. My beard grows in all different directions-- I have extremely coarse hair in some places, and extremely fine hair in others.  I&#x27;ve got a little bit of scarring from cystic acne I had as a teenager.  And I&#x27;m prone to ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;m like the perfect storm for a painful shave.    I&#x27;ve tried just about every regular razor-- from Gillette Fusion to Bump Fighter-- and every kind of expensive shaving cream and have had no luck.  Shaving for me has always meant cuts, nicks, bumps, razor burn, and all kinds of other unpleasantness.      Electric razors have been even worse.  Most of them leave a bumpy stubble from my coarser hairs, while leaving the finer ones nearly untouched.  And until now none of them have been able to navigate the acne scarring without leaving big rough patches.      Unlike other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried, the Panasonic shaved my whole face in just over twominutes, without a lot of back and forth over the same spots and with no irritation at all.  There&#x27;s not a rough spot anywhere-- even around the the areas of acne scarring that I&#x27;ve always struggled with.  Because it&#x27;s water proof, you can clean it right under your faucet with a little bit of soap and water.  It even has a high speed vibration mode to make cleaning easier.  It takes about 40 seconds to get the razor completely clean in this way.      Because of this self contained cleaning feature, if you want to save a few dollars, it may not be necessary to invest in the top of the line model with the cleaning unit. However this razor is so good, it&#x27;s certainly worth the cost.</li>
    <li> First off this is a beautiful piece of machinery that seems to be well built.For the size of the shaver you would think it weighs 5lbs but it is very light for its size and sleek piano finish  a nice touch. Very easy to use and very easy to clean    The first day I got it in the mail I was very excited to use it. It took me 10 min to skim the manual and to set it up.  The next morning  I turned it on with the surprise as to how loud it was, kinda sounds like the clippers they use at the barber shop. About half way through the shave it nicked me pretty good and started to bleed. That was the first and only time this razor has nicked me or cause any other irritations and i think it was lack of experience or a imperfection in my face. For the most part this razor over the last 2 months has cut as good or better than my  mach3 I have been using for years but with out the irritation and cuts. With the mack3 I could only shave every other day or so but with the Panasonic i walk out the door with that baby face look every morning. The only time I have trouble shaving with the Panasonic is when it is humid outside and the razor sticks to my face but when that happens I just take it in the shower with me. In the shower it feels like I am getting a closer shave but when I look in the mirror after I am done the dry shave does a much better job.I am absolutely astounded by the fact that it gets close to my face with almost no razor burn. Their are some spots on my face that are a little hard to cut and require me to stretch my skin to get that close cut but it is worth it.    The cleaner and charger has it pros and cons  I looked at many reviews before buy this razor and found one thing consistent with all reviews is how loud  the cleaner is. I though to my self, how loud could this thing actually be. This cleaner sounds exactly like a tire filling station that you find at a gas station that coast 75 cents to fill your tire. Maybe not quit as loud but definitely sounds the same. The function of the cleaner and charger work flawlessly. I like the fact that you can wash and dry or just dry if you clean it yourself. I only wash and dry maybe once a week to conserve the  detergent cartridge which in my mind is not really needed.I put a little body soap on it while it is running and add a little water and wala.    As for the price, there is no way I would have paid 499.99 for this razor but with the price drop it put it in the good price range for what you  get. In my opinion if you like to pamper yourself and look good than this razor is for you if you can get past the price and small imperfection.     When I clicked the button to complete my order I stared to second guess myself, thinking  I was a smuck for paying that much for a razor that  probably worked just as good as the cheap ones. If I could do it all over again knowing what I know now after using it for 2 months their would have been no second guessing.</li>
    <li> I have two other older panasonic shavers and this is even better than they are.  Why would anyone purchase a Braun?  Being able to use the shaver in the shower gives the smoothest shave possible,  Fantastic.</li>
    <li> Had been a blade guy for years.  Thick (well not that thick) Indian Man&#x27;s Beard and failed attempts with 80&#x27;s $20 Braun machine had me decided on not going back.  But XMas came and well I got this king of shavers.  Well so far so good.  Still using some shaving creme (though) not lathered.  On the fence but if things stay like this after the &#x27;one month&#x27; trial period per the manual I will be satisfied.    Rajiv</li>
    <li> My brother recommended me and I was originally skeptical about the hype of technology. I had tried the Braun and Philips brands in the past and was okay with them. However after trying the Panasonic for almost a month now and I have to say it was one of the best I have tried so far. The only negative about this shaver is that there is no indicator about the power that have unless it is in turn-on (at the first 30 sec) or in the charging mode. Also the bright blue blinking LED backlight display remains on if you leave the shaver in the charging/ cleaning station. The cleaning and drying of the shaver does take a while (over 2 hrs) and it makes some noise that drives the cats crazy. Apart from this little short comings I would definitely recommend it to my friends. It does take sometime for your skin to adapt to the new shaver especially for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father in law on advice of a friend. He hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple of weeks due to an illness. The shaver did an excellent job on long hairs without pulling, then gave a very close shave. Don&#x27;t know about durability yet, but seems like good quality.</li>
    <li> My husband has used Norelco for the fifty-nine years I have known him, and has never been satisfied with Norelco. He says that the first time he used the Panasonic ES-LA93-K shaver was also the first time he ever got a really close and totally comfortable shave. He says, \\&quot;I shave dry, I shave wet, in the shower or out, with only water or with a shave cream, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference, it&#x27;s always a wonderful, close shave.\\&quot; No negatives, though he does not clean the shaver with the little cleaner, preferring to do the whole thing by hand. It&#x27;s not that much noisier than the Norelco, but the speed of the Panasonic more than makes up for the increase in sound. And I enjoy the ultra-smooth feel of his skin after the shave, with no five-o-clock shadow at all! Thank you, Amazon, for offering this razor to us.</li>
    <li> I had given up on close shaving years ago due to skin irritation with Norelco&#x27;s rotary shaver and of course blades.   So for years I have used trimmers as my shaver.  Well I recently was encouraged to try foil shavers and after the first try I was hooked.  I first started using Wahl&#x27;s 5 star foil shaver which is very good by itself.  But later I decided to upgrade to a more advance and elaborate tool and choose the Panasonic based on a litany of positive reviews.  It is indeed all that others have suggested.  For me, it shave as close as I remember getting with blades some years ago.  I recently tried the wet method (i.e. shaving cream) and am extremely impress with the closeness and comfort of that shave relative to the dry method, but note that I was also pleased with the dry method using Remington&#x27;s face shaver powder.     As for wet vs dry, wet is more comfortable and slightly closer in some areas, while dry is quicker and more convenient.      The most notable observation is that I have had absolutely no skin irritation and needed no break-in period--comfort from day one.    Final conclusion is that this is indeed an outstanding tool for shaving and definitely is ranked as the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The price of this shaver on Amazon was substantially less than at my local mall.  Quality is excellent, shave is excellent.  Even the charging cleaning base is excellent, once you close the bathroom door and let it whirr away during cleaning and drying mode.  When the cleaning process is over, the shaver AND the charging base are like new; all hair gone.    What is dumb, and was very close to being a deal breaker for me, is a ridiculous flashing blue LED light on the shaver&#x27;s handle that never turns off (except when you are shaving).  The flashing blue light is bright enough to illuminate the hallway outside the bathroom door, and it flashes endlessly.  The whole idea of the charging base is you plug the base in, and drop your shaver in between shaves.  I now keep my base unplugged, and only plug it in to charge.  I know it is fully charged when the annoying blue flashing light flashes endlessly once again.     In my view, save $$$ and get the next model down, and skip the charger base.  Since the shaver is waterproof it cleans very easily under running water.  Skip the base,  but buy the shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with high-end Braun shavers for over 20 years--this is my first Panasonic shaver.  After reading the lackluster reviews on the latest Braun self cleaning shaver, I decided to try this highly rated model.  Ultimately, I have decided to return this shaver and try a new, but older model Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High Points:&lt;br /&gt;- Very close shave, slightly better than the top of the line Braun from 3 years ago&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent \\&quot;soap and water clean function\\&quot;--cleaning it with a bit of soap, water, and it&#x27;s special vibrate mode is very quick and effective.  Almost as clean as the hour long mode in the base station, though I&#x27;m sure this does not provide sterilization of the shaving surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low Points:&lt;br /&gt;- Poor ergonmics; the shaver has a very unwieldy shape that makes it hard for you to know if you&#x27;re actually hitting stubble, so you have to constantly feel your face to see if its working.  Because the shaver head is so large and chunky, it&#x27;s very hard to get a close shave under your nose.  I cut myself twice under the nose while shaving because of this.&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning cycle is VERY loud and long (about an hour).  I have been using \\&quot;self-cleaning\\&quot; shavers for over 8 years, and this one has double the volume of any I have used previously, actually waking up my wife in the next room.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a blade since day 1.  I have one of those beards that grows in many different directions.  My cheeks are easy to shave with no problem with the blade.  However my neck is a different story.  I would only shave 1-2 times per week otherwise my neck would bleed and be irritated for days.  I had tried Norelco electric shavers in the past and was very disappointed because they neither shaved well and the irritation was twice as bad as the blade.  So recently I decided to look for another electric shaver.  I came across the Braun Series 7 and the Panasonic LA-93.  I decided on the Panasonic for 2 reasons.  1. The reviews and 2. The fact that you can shave with shaving cream.  I am happy with my decision.  But you have to know what to expect.  My upper face is very easy to shave with the Panasonic.  It is exactly the same as shaving with a blade.  But the neck leaves something to be desired. Although it doesn&#x27;t shave that great on the Neck area it does not GIVE ANY IRRITAION it also gets about 95-98 percent of all the neck.  For the balance 2 percent I just touch up with a blade that takes like 30 seconds.  I haven&#x27;t tried to shave dry because it does such a great job with the cream.      The quality of the shaver is excellent!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the cleaner is the smell of the cleaning liquid.  Otherwise I just shave and when I am done I put in the charger and it cleans and ready for the next use.      Overall I would definitely recommend the system. It&#x27;s about 97 percent effective and that works for my situation.</li>
    <li> Just to let you know that I have tried lots of shavers over the years and without fail they all shaved the top half of my face ok, but   never did under the chin very well .S0 I thought that I&#x60;d give it one more try.Glad I did as this shaver is very good all over .The only suprise was the sheer size of it.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor 6 months and, overall looking back, I would never buy it again.  I think it can shave closer than my old rotary type, but you have to work much harder to get a complete shave (many more passes).   The biggest drawback is the foil screens are so thin, the foil in my shaver developed a sizable hole after only a few months.  Your first indication is the shave begins to hurt and your face is scratched and red.   Looking into the warranty after such a short period, I was told the foil and blades are not covered.  Replacing screens and blades every 6 months or so is an expensive proposition.  I have to say this never happened in the 15+ years I owned a rotary shaver.    The ability to wet shave feature is nice.  Another drawback is the on/off button is where you tend to put your thumb while shaving and easy to accidentally press, so I often turn off the shaver in the middle of shaving.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES-LA93-K shaver about a month ago and have used it several times since. The shaver produces a good clean shave which is all I wanted anyway but it is not as close a shave as I get with my old Gillete mach 3.  The pro&#x27;s, it gives a good clean shave which will last most of the day if done in the morning. It is quicker than using a standard shaving razor at getting the job done which is good if you are in a hurry to go somewhere.  The con&#x27;s, it&#x27;s expensive and it with the gadgets that come with it take up a good bit of counter space at the bathroom sink.  Good machine but not super shaver.</li>
    <li> This product is astounding.      For years I have been purchasing the \\&quot;latest\\&quot; electric razor in hopes that I can throw the cost, inconvenience, and pain of razor blades out.  Electric razors (Norelco, Remington, Braun, and older Panasonic models) fell far short of Gillette&#x27;s finest blade technology.  No longer.  I receive a closer shave from the Panasonic ES-LA93 than Gillette&#x27;s latest blade technology (Fusion Pro Glide).      Observations:  The ES-LA93 is expensive.  But when I compare what I&#x27;m paying annually for blades against what I paid for the shaver, it pays itself off in about a year.  And in year 2, I expect to pay about $18 total (the cost of a set of replacement shaver blades).  If the shaver holds out for 3 years, I expect that I&#x27;ll be ahead about $600.    Slippery when wet.  Panasonic has done a great job designing and manufacturing a sleek unit, but for my comfort it is a little too slippery.  I am overly careful because I don&#x27;t want to drop it in the shower.  We&#x27;re talking about something that costs as much as a 64gb iPod Touch.  It may sound ridiculous, but an optional lanyard around fastening the razor to my wrist would be a plus.    A few things I recommend: 1) Let the blades float across your face rather than applying a lot of pressure.  2) Tighten skin.  3) Wet shave in the shower with shaving cream.     Bottom Line:  If you like the closeness of razors and have tried moving to electric shavers without success, your time has come.  Welcome to the future of shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the fastest electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, faster motor means less shaving time, and I have less rashes on my face using this than my Philips architect, which is much slower in comparison. Not sure if that cleaning base is useful though, it works like a mini water gun shooting at the blades and a small fan blow dry it afterward. And the kit only comes with ONE soap tray, i guess you&#x27;ll have to order more soap from them if you want to have it washed regularly. Price is good on amazon, can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> I switched from using blades (40 yrs) to electric about a year ago. My first electric was a cheap Panasonic. I had little to no skin irritation but I had to go over and over an area to get anywhere close to a blade cut. Also, it missed those tricky long hairs that grow from your neck area.    This LA93-K has a high-quality feel and build and shaves much closer with less effort but it&#x27;s not perfect. The head gets quite hot after a minute or so of use. I don&#x27;t like the bright blinking LED after fully-charged, so I remove it and lay it on the sink. This means alot of sink area is used up by the large cleaning base and the shaver itself. The shaver doesn&#x27;t lay flat like my old one did and requires you to lay it on it&#x27;s side (no big deal).    The cleaning cycle is LONGGGG (hours) and is quite noisy - don&#x27;t do this before bedtime!    I got a super deal on this shaver system and would never pay full retail for it.</li>
    <li> I went from using a cheap disposable battery shaver to this fantastic facial hair trimming device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts close but never close enough to cut skin. It&#x27;s a great product and I suggest you buy it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product through Amazon and I was very pleased with the prompt service and received the shaver on time. Because I live in Australia I purchased an adapter and it has worked well. I think I am getting used to it now. It shaves really well under the shower just with soap. I have tried it with shaving cream and that worked well also. I have cleaned it under the shower each time I use it which is good. It shaves down 4 days of growth easily. Product is less than half the cost of buying it from an Australian store even when on special.    I&#x27;m not sure of the value of the cleaning/charging unit. The first charge was completed just with the lead. I have since used it on the cleaning/charging unit and it worked well and is easy to just place in the unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years. Recently I found the only way I could get a new one was online. And reviews I read suggested if I was going to order anything online I should consider the ES-LA93-K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best leap of faith I&#x27;ve ever made. This shaver shaves at LEAST as well as the Braun if not better.. The shaver comes out CLEANER than the Braun after the cleaning cycle AND there&#x27;s no alcohol to wear out the plastics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only grievance is that I can&#x27;t buy these in my local stores!</li>
    <li> This shaver is very good at handling my beard when I have not shaved for 2 or 3 days. I also own the Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver. I have owned both for more than 6 months and in the compare and contrast I would give the Bruan points for close shave and would give the Panasonic points for being able to handle a tougher and longer beard.</li>
    <li> I have been using high end electric shavers forever.  This shaver is everything Panasonic claims it to be and more.  I get the closest, cleanest, painless shaves ever.  I have a beard that is more like steel wool than human hair and this shaver cuts through my beard like peach fuzz.  Purchasing through Amazon was seemless.</li>
    <li> I have quite sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m not satisfied with [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]], because I had irritation when I use the Braun.  I thought Norelco [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]]might be better for sensitive skin, and looked review in Amazon.  Panasonic ES-LA93 lookd like having best review for sensitive skin, so I bought it.  That is amazing!  4 blade shaver is very gentle to skin, in addition, you can use the Panasonic one under shower!  That has wet and dry function.  You can put shaving cream when you use it.  Double motor system seems like helping close shave.  I can not go back to other shaver.  I think that is the best shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used electric, never been a manual razor guy.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand with similar results.  I have sensitive skin and am prone to razor bumps and irritation.  This Panasonic is perfect for my skin.  It&#x27;s a very strong cutter, and really gets almost everything in one pass. This razor has cut my shaving time almost in half.  It doesn&#x27;t leave me irritated at all.  THe quality of materials seems really good so far, as well. The cleaning seems to take a little longer than it should, but thats no big deal. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking to upgrade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m what you would call a man who is very serious about shaving. Believe it or not, I own a braun series 7, a Norelco 1280xcc, and a panasonic ES-LA93-K. Of these 3 shavers, the panasonic in my opinion gives the closest, most comfortable shave. I like a wet shave, so this shaver is perfect for me. I have problems shaving my neck with the Braun and the Norelco, but not with the Panasonic. The norelco can be used with shaving cream or gel, as is the panasonic, but it irritates my neck a little. All in all, the Panasonic is my favorite of the three.     It&#x27;s been about a week since I made my first review. Since then, I have been switching back and forth between the Norelco 1280xcc and the Panasonic LA93K. The norelco definitely shaves just as close as the panasonic. I use shaving soap with both shavers.  The cleaning station on the norelco is a better design than on the panasonic, so for that reason, I would have to rate the norelco above the panasonic. The cleaning station on the panasonic is a joke. There is no indicator on the panasonic to inform you when the refill cartridge needs replacing, so you have to guess or keep track of how times you use it. Bottom line is that I would take either of these shavers over the Braun series 7, with the norelco being one notch above the panasonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating the review to a one star because I&#x27;ve not been able to get a response from Panasonic regarding the constantly failing cleaning unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is not holding up as well as the older 2-bladed unit I still have. I typically replace the foil after about a year but don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s worth doing with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be time to take a look at the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Panasonic Shaver. I bought the older double bladed shaver in 2007 and still use it when I travel. The ES-LA93 shaves a bit closer than the previous model but is a little more cumbersome to use because of the large head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the product 2 stars because the new Vortex cleaning system does not seem as well designed as the older one. Mine stopped working after 6 months and would only blow-dry the shaver. I changed the cartridge, reset the unit and it still stubbornly kept blinking a red status light at me. I called customer service who told me I would have to ship both shaver and cleaner back for repair/replacement. Unless you live in Texas, be prepared to wait a couple of weeks. They also wanted me to pay shipping costs and I had to escalate to a manager before they would send me a return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving my replacement, the cleaning unit worked for about 3 months before packing it in with the same symptoms (blinking red status, blow-dry only). The unit also spills over when cleaning and left a green/brown residue on the bathroom counter. The old unit did neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to contact Panasonic one more time to see what they can recommend. As of now, the cleaning unit is a waste of counter space.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect razor for years as I hate shaving (usually go 2 to 3 days in between each shave). I have used Philips and Norelco shavers in the past, but have never found a razor that didn&#x27;t take 20 passes to get every hair. I finally decided to go for the Panasonic given its high ratings on Amazon, and I have to say, this is most likely the last razor I will ever need.  2 Minutes and 15 seconds. That is the amount of time it now takes me to shave. It used to be around 4 minutes with my Norelco - especially with the stubborn neck hair. That is one heck of a time savings when added up over a year. It is like using a lawn mower with a 30 inch deck as opposed to a 20 inch deck. Three swipes per side of the face and you just need to do a bit of cleanup after that.  The cleaner is also very nice. I use it about every fourth shave (and just wash the razor under the sink the other times). You can also sign up for a \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; with amazon to get an extra 15% knocked off the cost of the cartridges. I just have them mail me out a new pack every 6 months automatically(contains 3 cartriges).</li>
    <li> I prefer my Gillette Mach III razot</li>
    <li> I received this electric shaver for Christmas so have been using it for a couple months.  Yeah, it works well, but I can&#x27;t honestly say it shaves any better, closer, or faster than my previous 2-3 Norelco \\&quot;Triple Headers\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I just got this shaver last week. I must say i was so impressed. the last time i had a shaver was about 15 years ago and it was an old remington dry shaver.  At first i was a little scared to use it with shaving cream but soon found out that it was shaving just as good as with the talc i use.  I&#x27;m hooked on this shaver and i have shaved now twice this week instead of letting my beard grow out for a couple of weeks.  Shaving in the shower is the best perk i don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining it. It really makes shaving fun, IMHO.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver and I would like to recommend this shaver for those people who has tough beard and lots of facial hair. It&#x27;s easy to use and I can use it with foam as a wet shaving, But the fun part is dry shaving which I prefer and this is the best of all shavers out their in the market.</li>
    <li> This shaver is very well designed and manufactured. Used several different priced Philips electric shaver, non of them could compare with this one. Well done Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Panasonic shavers over the last 15-20 years and this one is the best ever. It far exceeded my expectations in terms of closeness of shave.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. I read about these and decided to try. Was a bit on the high priced side but my skin was asking for it. It has been a year now and I can say was not disappointed. Good clean and close shave. There are no rash or red patches from the day one. Completely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have always thought I will never be satisfied with electric shaver, but this one changed my bias.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone and I even use this to shave my head. It works fine!</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LA93-K is not a bad shaver. It takes a few days and some razor burn to get used to it but after that it provides a very close shave around the lips. You can use it dry or wet but I did not notice any difference either way. Where this shaver, like all other electric ones, fails is on the neck and the jawline. I have spent 7 minutes with &amp; without shaving gel trying to get a clean shave of the neck and the Panasonic still leaves lots of stubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison purposes I also tried a Braun 190 shaver which currently retails at 1/4th the price of the ES-LA93-K and got almost identical results (excellent shave near mouth, bad near jaw &amp; neck). The Panasonic shaver is now being returned since there is no justification for the premium price even considering the cleaning station.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, better than any I&#x27;ve ever owned. I spent a little extra to get a good shaving lotion and pre-shave oil which I think helps. I get a really close shave with no irritation. I wash the shaver on a daily basis then use the vortex cleaning system once a week. Very simple to use. This shaver is a little more expensive than most but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Upgraded from my Panasonic ES8249 (previously reviewed: [[ASIN:B001DKMYAK Panasonic ES8249K Arc IV Nano Vortex Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaving System, Black]]), and it was worth the upgrade.  I paid about half the retail at one of Amazon&#x27;s partners, so I encourage shopping around; I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s $200+ better than the 8249 if you pay full freight, but it&#x27;s a definite improvement and certainly worth it if you can get it for substantially less than retail.  Basically the same function as the 8249 - water-based cleaner, cleaning unit buttons function the same, same cleaning cartridges (a nice touch), wet-dry shave.  The head is very large, but is easy to manipulate when you get used to it.  Shaver seems to be slightly less noisy than the 8249 when in use; the cleaning unit is definitely noisier in the first few minutes of its cycle, but essentially the same when the blower comes on.  It takes longer for the clean/dry cycle than the 8249 - haven&#x27;t timed it but I would guess maybe 20% longer (well over an hour).  The lock button on the back is a little more difficult to operate than other Panasonic shavers I have owned and is somewhat stiff, but looks fairly sturdy. One complaint about the Panasonics is that you can&#x27;t use them as a corded shaver (maybe the result of fear of lawsuits for shaving in the shower with a cord attached!), but operationally to me this doesn&#x27;t matter, and it charges within an hour.  The batteries in this model last longer than the 8249 - guessing maybe 20% longer on a full charge.  The bottom line - this shaver gives me the closest shave I have had from an electric shaver - very close to a blade, and the wet shave is definitely the most comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Postscript:  Just returned from a recent detour into the Norelco world (rotary); I used Norelcos years ago, and like their quiet operation and battery life.  Norelco also now has wet/dry shavers, and automatic cleaning stations.  Worth a try again, HOWEVER, have gone back to Panasonic (wet shave) for two reasons:  1) Closer shave, and 2) Comfort.  Which, I suppose, is the reason for shaving in the first place, if you choose not to grow facial hair.  After a long history with many, many shavers, electric and otherwise, this Panasonic is the best of the lot for wet-shave electric shavers.r two reasons:  1) Closer shave, and 2) Comfort.

    <li> As another reviewer mentioned, it seems to be the same thing as the Panasonic la63, except with the cleaning base and it&#x27;s black in color.  When I last checked, the LA63 was going for $190 and this one was going for $399, so it&#x27;s up to you if you want to spend that much more money.      As for the razor itself, it works great.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous electric razors over the past few years and all of them have been disappointing.  I&#x27;d try to use them for a few weeks, and I just couldn&#x27;t get them to shave anything smoothly.  These were all sub-$100 razors.  I&#x27;m not sure why I decided to go from $80 razors to a $400 razor, but I&#x27;m happy I did.  I shave both my face and my head, and my Mach 3 razor would really irritate my scalp and neck.  This razor, right of the box with no charge shaved my head, face, and neck very well with no irritation.      It&#x27;s not perfect around the ears due to the large head, so I still need to pull out the razor to get that smooth.  It shaves the neck surprisingly well, although I need to drag it across my neck parallel to the jaw to really get it smooth, but even with the Mach 3, I couldn&#x27;t get that very smooth.  If anything, this shaver does it even better.  And without the always present razor burn that the razor would cause.      The cleaning base seems to do the job well.  It&#x27;s fairly loud, but it cleans it, dries it, and charges it.  The cartridges seem cheap enough to avoid the hassle of cleaning it by hand.  I just shave and drop it in the base and it takes care of everything.      Is it worth nearly $400?  That&#x27;s up to you.  But it works better than any other shaver I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  I wouldn&#x27;t blame you if you went with the la63 instead, though.</li>
    <li> very good product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought as gift for son. He says it&#x27;s really nice. He likes that it can be used wet and is easy to clean</li>
    <li> I bought this razor 3 months ago and still have the Braun 7 Series in the closet. There is simply no comparison as the Panasonic does the best job - I am one of those people that can&#x27;t use a blade because I would cut myself constantly so I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for more that 10 years now(always the top of of the line Braun except now for this Panasonic). I never imagined that my face could be as smooth as someone that uses a razor - thank you Panasonic! I achieve this great result using dry shaving, about 5 minutes and going twice over the neck area - while this Panny does a great job on the chin, like all electrics, it needs 2 or more passes on the neck areas but that is a small price to pay for a truly smooth face.    I clean my shaver with regular soap and water after every use and only use the little cartridge and autocleaning feature about once per week - in the 3 months I had it, I still have the initial cartridge. One trick is to clean the water tank after every auto cleaning you do to prevent hair buildup and premature drying of the detergent cartridge.    If you can afford the high price, do yourself a favor and get it - your face will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> really nice shaver, gives the closest smooth shave of any electric shaver that I have had before.</li>
    <li> I will say this straight up, that this model is very close the es-la63-s, but this has the cleaning kit and the other model does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I should say is that you can get as close as you want. Closer than a blade, because with a blade if you add pressure, you get nicks and cutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to get so close that your skin will feel extremely raw? Do you want to get even further beyond where you start bleeding? Even further beyond, I&#x27;ve gotten so close that I&#x27;ve taken out my epidermis, my skin is raw to the bone and I have no hair, smoother than a babies behind; their legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How quick is the shave? Well if you just want a quick shave, this thing will give it to you. I got a good shave in less than a minute. At 14,000 micro-vibrations you can basically get a good shave in a minute. Very fast, very quick, very impressive. The head is huge, so that means you can cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want a comfortable shave? Dang, this thing is very very comfortable.  It felt like I was rubbing my face with a cloud. Yes, the blades spin that fast that it feels like you&#x27;ve got some kind of cloudy heat pad on your face. Rubbing it up and down, no irritations, very comfortable. Now if you shave for a while, it will get hot. And, if you shave for a while, your skin will get raw and a little irritated. All depending on how close you want to get. Basically, you want get any irritations if you shave quick; for those with sensitive skin, do not shave for a long period of time. This shaver is very good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it clean? Yes, put liquid soap on the top, run for a few seconds, and run it under the water. The shaver comes with instructions on how to properly clean. I will also take the top off and rinse off the blades; accidentally hit the blades to the sink while they were on; ouch. It still works though. Then soak the top in alcohol if you want, or set to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an LCD screen that tells you how long you have been shaving. And, don&#x27;t worry about dropping it because it has an incredible grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last comments, don&#x27;t shave in the shower, you can if you want, but my experience was that the water slowed down the blades and couldn&#x27;t get a good shave. You can use shaving cream to shave though, the blades won&#x27;t slow down unless you run it through water which includes the shower. Also, my hair type is fast growing hair, not very rough or tough, but still a bit of a challenge. This blade didn&#x27;t slow down when cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!een shaving. And, don&#x27;t worry about dropping it because it has an incredible grip.

    <li> Smooth shave, very good.</li>
    <li> I took a long time trying to decide what electric razor to buy after mulling over reviews for several of the Braun and Panasonic models.  I decided to give this one a try.  It has not disappointed me in the least.  I thought this was an expensive razor, but I can say that it&#x27;s worth it now after trying it for a few days.  I have a sensitive face and neck, prone to ingrown hairs in the neck region.  My hair also grows very quickly.  This is the first razor that I&#x27;ve used in which I can shave every day if I wanted to without irritation.  It works better for me in the shower because my beard is thick. It takes several passes for me to get all the hair off, but when I leave the shower, it feels similar to a manual razor shave. I am surprised electric shaving technology has gotten this good.  I have tried several foils and rotaries and never really had results near what I get with this razor.  This product also has a 30 day satisfaction guarantee.  If you are riding the fence like I was, take the risk and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(January 2014)&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this razor and I have changed the blades twice and the foil once.  It is still working great.  The only thing suffering is battery life and for some reason the black plastic is starting to bleed black on my face when I shave.  Other than that, all is great!</li>
    <li> DO DOT PURCHASE. Product is fantastic for 2 months then does not work, this is the third in a row i&#x27;ve purchased and Panasonic customer care do not want to know about it. Actually even worse is Panansonic refuse to give warranty to customers overseas who purchase their products even though Amazon ship overseas with no indication that that the 2 YEAR WORLDWIDE WARRANTY is not covered if sent overseas????&lt;br /&gt;Go figure that.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 6 weeks ago to replace my old Braun w/ self-cleaning system.  Now I&#x27;m back looking for another alternative.  Things i don&#x27;t like about this Panasonic:  * Takes longer to shave (more passes)  * Leaves more &#x27;stray&#x27; hairs  * Takes forever to self-clean (annoying noise on &amp; off for 1 hour or so)  * Flashing blue light after finished cleaning - can&#x27;t leave in cleaning/charging stand because the flashing light is so bright at night  * Self-cleaning system requires rinsing out &amp; refilling water reservoir (vs. Braun system with pre-mixed liquid cleaning solution)    Overall, very disappointed for the price (only to replace it right away too...).    I think I will go back to the Braun self-cleaning foil shaver, or the Philips Norelco 3-head/pivot style shaver.</li>
    <li> After shaving with one Gillette system after the other, culminating with the latest version of the Fusion (with batteries) available at the time, I gave in bought a Braun the 790cc in March 2010.  From the beginning (I have a rather heavy beard that grows in different directions), getting anything resembling a close shave in less than 15 minutes was impossible.  Still, I decided to stick with the mediocre shaves, the earth-shattering noise both of the shave and the cleaning process, because I was fed up with blood all over my shirt collars resulting from the inevitable daily cuts that accompanied my super-duper Gillette blades. By September, the foils (supposed to last 18 months) had so badly degraded that after 10 minutes, I still had a full beard.  So I purchased a new foil and cutter cassette.  Slightly better results for about a week.  Then, the five o&#x27;clock shadow became worse...and worse, and finally, the morning shave entailed an excruciating ripping of the hair from my beard.  By late November, I was finally determined that this was not going to work, and I went back to the drawing board.  For whatever reason, the Panasonic was not on my radar screen in March.  This time, I expanded the search and the ES-LA93-K wet/dry came up.  I read a half-dozen reviews, several from former Braun 7-series owners, and went ahead and bought the Panasonic.  It arrived December 3rd.  I have had two shaves, one dry with Williams Lectric Shave, and one in the shower with pre-shave oil and shave gel.  Both shaves exceeded in closeness, comfort and neatness anything I have ever experienced, ever, anytime--in a record setting 4 minutes dry and 5 minutes wet.  It is more comfortable to hold, quieter, utterly pain free, and is everything I expected and much, much more.  The cleaning system is easy to use, and much quieter.  I had used Braun shavers in the past, with similar results. The 7-series received rave reviews, and I decided to give it a shot. I am done with German engineering for good, after getting rid of a disaster of a BMW for an Infiniti and now the Braun 7-series in favor of the Panasonic.  While the Braun may work for you if your beard is lighter and has a predictable and consistent growth pattern, I would recommend the Panasonic simply because it works better under the most difficult conditions, and would likely give you lucky light bearded folks a two-minute shave, dry or wet.  I had grown to dread shaving--the past two days have been terrific.  It is six hours now since I shaved, and no hint of shadow. With the Braun, it would be there in less than three hours.   By night, if I was going out, I needed to shave again.  Those of you who are still trying for a perfect or even acceptable shave with the Braun:  do yourselves a favor and try the Panasonic.  Unless there is some dramatic regression with this one, or they for some inexplicable reason change the design, I have finally found the perfect shave.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a electric shaver for years but this one is really good. It is lite to handle and you get what you pay for. it is that good.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only had the shaver a month, it is by far the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I have only used the automatic cleaning system once and it left the shaver spotless.  If this shaver maintains this level of performance over time, it will clearly be an outstanding product.  I also have not used the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave option but it was never my intention of using it that way.</li>
    <li> Starting with the headline-spectacular.    The unit comes as a black model with cleaning base (ESLA93K) and a silver standalone model (ESLA63S). Both function the same.    This shaver incorporates some firsts for Panasonic: 14,000 rpm motor; a 2&#x27;nd motor in the head that copies the Braun foil-pulsing concept and a head that pivots up and down like Braun&#x27;s have for years (plus the usual Panasonic side to side). And the whole head arrangment is a little more elegant.    Brought forward from the past models are the 4-system head, the ARC foil and nano-sharpened blades.    The black version is a thing of beauty. First class manufacturing with solid, gleaming surfaces and perfect fit and finish. Thick sections of body and foil cap plastics. A premium product through and through.    The shaver is not as HUGE as it looks in pictures. But, it is a larger form factor than usual for a Panasonic. While it \\&quot;looks\\&quot; unwieldy, once in hand it melts in like a custom glove and is a natural to handle. It is heavier than other Pansonics out of neccessity as there is literally a second motor in the head. But it is not burdonsome.    The motor note to me is not as jarring or intrusive as other Pansonics. I think the thicker materials and more casing account for this. But it does not approach a rotary for being a quiet shaving experience.    Closeness: The best I have ever experienced, hands down. I&#x27;ve had great, close shaves with other shavers that feel \\&quot;dry.\\&quot; Not bad-but a close, dry. On a good day with the ESLA93K my skin gets a \\&quot;baby bottom soft\\&quot; feel.  I have never, ever experienced it until this unit.    Comfort: It was impossible for me to experience discomfort with this unit. I was unable to shave in any direction against any grain with any amount of pressure that was not completely comfortable. In fact, after a couple days my shaves were not as close-I figured out I was not pressing hard enough. You just don&#x27;t feel pressure.    Speed: I am a 7-9 minute shaver. Always have been.An over-shaver, never feel done. It&#x27;s hard for me to go past 5 minutes with this unit. I start feeling \\&quot;done\\&quot; about 3 minutes. It&#x27;s fast.    Trimmer: Due to the nature of the head the trimmer looks small-I compared it is exactly the same size as the trimmer on the Arc Retro. Works fine, it is in a somewhat unusual location but I got used to it right away.    Cleaning module: The module works well and is the standard vortex dry cake of soap plus water system with a different design to accomodate the shape of the shaver. The manual mentioned active-drying, which I do not think was the case with my ES8228S cleaning base. Still not as good as the Braun module in my opinion.    It carries over my one pet peeve from past Panasonic modules which is no sleep mode. When you come back for lunch, the shaver blinks once every 2 seconds. Blink. Blink. Blink. Gives you the urge to take out the shaver-so what&#x27;s the point of leaving it in until tomorrow? But this is a perhaps a personal quirk and the unit does the job well.    The module is a nice convenience that costs under 15 cents per day and the unit is easily cleaned by rinsing and/or cleaning with liquid soap per the instructions so either way it&#x27;s fast and easy.    Other: Unit has a bright, pleasant blue LED display that shows shave time, battery remaining, I think it indicates when cleaning is needed and it flashes a replace foil symbol after one year. Oddly, the LED goes OFF while you are shaving-but as stated above blinks constantly when done charging. I don&#x27;t know who thinks of this stuff for Panasonic but it&#x27;s odd.    Summary/perspectives: The Panasonic ESLA93K is the best foil shaver I have ever used, without question.    *Should I try it if I am primarily a rotary user? IMO-if you have always preferred the rotary experience you will probably still prefer a rotary to this unit. It is a fantastic shaver but it is a foil experience 100%.    *Should I upgrade if I just bought a recent Panasonic? IMO-if maximum speed, comfort and the sensation of soft closeness is something you are willing to pay for, yes. If ultra Panasonic close is all you need, all the other recent models are great.    *Should I try it if I love my Pulsonic? IMO-yes. To me the ESLA93K is everything the Pulsonic has been to others that it never gave me. It&#x27;s a step above, it is the ultimate foil shaver on the market today.</li>
    <li> Wow! Once Again I read many reviews before buying this shaver and So Far they Were Right! It Appears to be a great Shaver...but it&#x27;s ONLY Been 2 or 3 days.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave I have ever got with electric razor. I have used a rotor razor for 5 year  and this razor is like night and day. I should have switched to a foil razor years ago. The price tag is a little high but it&#x27;s worth it if we want a close shave with a electric razor</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing this shaver, I had the slightly older Arc IV (8249 I believe). The cleaning unit/base station crapped out on me because my daughter decided it needed &amp;#34;a bath&amp;#34; and the interior electronics were hosed (literally). I absolutely loved that shaver, but a replacement base was over $100. I found this shaver and decided to go for it because it wasn&#x27;t much more for the LA93 package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MUCH closer shave with this unit, probably because of the second motor and two-axis swivel design. It&#x27;s quieter than the 8249, closer shave, and the battery seems to last a little longer. I had the 8249 for 18 months and it shaved great until it&#x27;s last use, but this one blows it out of the water.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband as a Christmas present.  While he still enjoys the great close shave this shaver provides his face, the last week of April the cleaning unit died. Although the status light still turns on, the actual cleaning process doesn&#x27;t occur. Hopefully, the unit is just defective and Panasonic will replace it. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this product to other people.</li>
    <li> I have only had this shaver for about 2 weeks when the Charger/Cleaner System started flashing red and stopped working. Sent it to the Panasonic Service Repair Center and they confirmed that the unit needs replacement which will take almost 2 months. The shaver works fine but the Charger/Cleaner unit is absolute junk and even worse is Panasonic Service. This is a lot of money for something that only works for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research before I bought this shaver. I checked Consumer Reports and some other reviews sites. It seems the foil shavers do better than the rotary ones. I&#x27;ve been using my new shaver for a couple of weeks now and love it. Generally, I hate shaving every morning. It&#x27;s just such a pain. Using an electric rather than shaving cream and a blade is so much nicer. No, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade but I don&#x27;t believe any electric razor will. It does a great job of making me presentable for the day and in record time. The quickness and convenience of an electric far outweighs the closeness of a blade for me.</li>
    <li> To begin, I got the shaver quick. The shaver itself is a good product overall, the feel, how it moves. My only issue about this shaver is that it gives me skin burn and it doesn&#x27;t cut all the hair off. It&#x27;s pretty neat to shave with it in the shower or with shaving cream, but overall to me personally, it was a waste of 200+ dollars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace my Braun a month and a half ago and it BROKE.  Since it was after 30 days from purchase, I got to deal with the lovely people at Panasonic who told me to ship it back, wait (they wouldn&#x27;t say how long) and then MAYBE they will send me back the same model.  I guess Panasonic doesn&#x27;t give much regard to the word guarantee.  Obviously, this is a frustrating situation since, like everyone else, I typically use my shaver every day.  You would think that a $400 MSRP shaver would not break in a few weeks, but then again you would also think that the company that makes that type of high-end product would have decent customer service too.  It&#x27;s too bad--the shave I got from this razor was really good when it worked.  That being said, if I had it to do over I would not gamble on buying this shaver again, especially knowing that Panasonic doesn&#x27;t stand behind their products.    UPDATE---I am now on my third replacement shaver from Panasonic. The cleaning system on this product simply doesn&#x27;t work. I know my title says I threw it in the trash--actually, I am giving it to a charitable organization since the shaver itself does still work.  I am now an owner of a Braun 7 series and I am sure I will be happy with it, as I have owned Brauns before.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.  I can&#x27;t remember being less satisfied with an electronic item.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  I&#x27;ve been a braun users for many years, after my third braun razor (8595) broke like the others, I decided I&#x27;d try something else.  I had a tiny panasonic travel razor that shaved better than my braun so I gave this one a try.  WOW, what a great shave.  I have a heavy beard and usually need another shave by evening or live with the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  No more with the Panasonic.  Great, close shave, no irritation.  Highly recommend this razor over any of the braun models.</li>
    <li> Rarely do I review an item.  I have always wanted to use an electric razor, and through the years have tried several and they never cut it, no pun intended.  SO I am a traditional razor blade guy.  But all I can say is this has converted me.  I have had it 2 days and it does a great job.  I do have a heavy beard, and while I may get my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 4 o&#x27;clock instead with this electric  razor, I can touch it up before I go out very easily.    I saw this as a Deal Of the Day, for 169 and it seemed to get good reviews.  Not made in China, but Japan.  The quality seems good.  Very happy</li>
    <li> This shave&#x27;s switch failed after 15 months of use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and according to him he the cleaning feature works very well. I&#x27;m order for it to work quickly, he has to shave basically every day. He is one of those men who is talented enough to grow a full beard in a day though. It will work after a couple of days, but it does take more effort. Especially considering electric razors are looked at as something mostly for convenience and speed. He&#x27;s only had one other electric razor and it was a rotary style, this one beats it hands down. Over all, a very good product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a different shaver after the Braun top of the line  started costing more money than I expected or wanted. I went with the Panasonic ES-LA93_k because of some reviews that I had read. This is an amazing shaver and meets or exceeds the capability of the Braun that I previously owned. It shaves close, very close and is effortless to use. It&#x27;s trimmer is easy to use and sharp. The cleaning process is also flawless and will not bankrupt you. I have been using it for a month and it is everything it says it is... and I found  it on Amazon at a great price. Highly recommend it and expect to be a Panasonic convert after this experience....</li>
    <li> There are already many thorough reviews of this excellent product, so I won&#x27;t go on too long. I will add one more testimonial to the truthfulness of all the hype. This is one spectacular razor, and none of my previous razors come remotely close in performance. I am stunned that I can have a shave that approximates what I get with a regular razor. Five-o-clock shadow is now more like nine-o-clock as the shave is so close that I look great all day.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with all types of shavers and blades, mostly rotary shavers.  (I also wore a beard for 25 years because I don&#x27;t like to shave, had to give it up when it turned gray.)  I&#x27;ve used wet-shave Norelcos for the last 5 years and been fairly happy with them, and I thought I was looking for something similar.    This time I decided I was going to decide based on performance instead of price.  I read all the reviews and did some other research, found out which companies (in reviewer&#x27;s opinions) are not producing the same quality they used to.  I wasn&#x27;t looking at the top-of-the line models that add hundreds of dollars for some colored lights or digital displays, but at the models that had the top-of-the-line guts without the extra chrome.    I convinced myself that the Panasonic ES-LA93 was the best value among the small group of elite models, and I was not disappointed.    It may sound trite but it&#x27;s true, it gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I have been using it for four months and am still in love with it.</li>
    <li> i was using the top of the line of Braun series 7 but this product has much higher performance and has very smooth and clean shave. its really a great shaver.</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;1. Very close shave, feeling smooth like baby skin after&lt;br /&gt;2. Beautiful looking shaver&lt;br /&gt;3. Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;4. Sharp blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;1. It takes 90mins+ for to clean and dry!!&lt;br /&gt;2. The clean machine is loud!! I dont recommend buying the clean machine upgrade....you can easily wash it yourself&lt;br /&gt;3. only two modes of speed, Turbo or Slow (slow pulls your hair)&lt;br /&gt;4. Could not get the areas around my jawline with one shave&lt;br /&gt;5. the shave was so close, if you had an acne/pimple, you will bleed!</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco user for all of my adult life. For many years, they made superb quality razors; but nowadays, their Chinese-made razors just don&#x27;t measure-up to what they used to be. So I finally decided to look for another brand. I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with Panasonic, but I wanted to find a razor that was actually made in Japan and NOT CHINA. This one fit the bill and had amazing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a little less than a month so far, I can tell you my experience has been great. It cuts so close and smooth. I have a very heavy beard and this does the trick. I didn&#x27;t have any irritation either when transitioning to this new razor. You can feel the quality when you hold this razor. Also the cleaning base works much better than I expected. It cleans and dries the razor better than any other system I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed. For those of you who are tired of buying cheap quality Chinese goods that never work that great to begin with and you have to keep replacing and want to start investing in quality, this razor is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s time we as consumers start putting our money back into quality items like this one and send a message to manufacturers.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  Very close shave.  No razor/shaver burn.  Contrary to some other reviewers, I find that the trimmer works very well, but I keep short sideburns withiut any mustache or goatee.  I also have not seen any deterioration of the chrome finish. This could be because I don&#x27;t use the cleaning system; I just use liquid soap and water.</li>
    <li> Seems to strike the perfect balance between closeness and comfort. I now shave in about 1/3 the time of my old shaver (a Braun) and is more comfortable as well. Yeah...it&#x27;s expensive, and only time will tell if it&#x27;s worth the investment but so far I coudn\\&quot;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> Nice, very close shave in less than 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> I looked at reviews for some time before deciding on this shaver. It came down to the top of the line Braun and this. I have no regrets, but in summary say that the LA63-K is from my understanding the same shaver just without the cleaning station. I think for value, the LA63-K is better, because cleaning this shaver under tap water is easy and efficient. If spending the extra is not a big issue, the cleaning station of the LA-93-K works well and cleans well. It is however noisy (as noisy as someone actually shaving and the cartridges are an expense that Panasonic suggests to be changed at monthly intervals.    One caveat I feel is prudent is that this is not as close a shave as my Schick Hydro 5. I think that nothing still beats a good wet razor (Gillette, Schick or the like)for closeness or time spent shaving. But for an electric, it&#x27;s pretty darn fine. I used to be a Philips rotary guy and this is a notable upgrade.    PROS: This is the closest shave I have ever had with an electric. I have been pleasantly surprised how good it is. Unit is made in Japan suggesting quality construction. Can use in shower, but I don&#x27;t personally care about this.    CONS: Pricey, cleaning station is a little noisy.    In conclusion, look for one on sale. I would love to have tried the Braun in comparison, but overall this is one hell of a great shaver.</li>
    <li> Good shaver and cleaning station. Nice shave. Negative is that when cleaning station is finished the LED display on the shaver blinks on/off forever until shaver is removed. The display is very bright and the blinking looks more like airfield landing strip lights than those on a shaver. The new 5 blade Panasonic ES-LV81K is a much better designed and effective shaver and the cleaning system and does not have the obnoxious &amp;#34;blinking&amp;#34; as when it&#x27;s finished cleaning, all lights on both the shaver and cleaning station go off. Much, Much better design, better shave than the LA93-K.</li>
    <li> I have bought the best available electric shaver, based on Consumer Reports and other tests, for the last 60 years. This has meant buying whatever has been the top Panasonic model over the last 15 years or so, whenever they brought out a new one... so three different models in that time. And I still have all of them, so I can do comparative testing.    The GOOD news. Even the oldest of these three is still fine, has never had anything done to it, including no replacement foil. Wet/dry capability was added two models back. And the shave from each of them has been increasingly smooth with each new model. And with the latest model, you get an auto-cleaning system, probably added to compete with Braun who had it first.     The BAD news. The price has gone up very fast and is now astronomical (except on eBay). But that&#x27;s not the really bad news, which is that the &#x27;trimmer&#x27; has been shrunk so that it&#x27;s now almost useless for trimming sideburns and necks accurately, its main use for most users. It was excellent on both the preceding models, so this is a major backward step and the auto-cleaning system is complex and I never use it or needed it before--just blow the dust out after tapping it on the side of the sink. This is not a trivial error: it&#x27;s like the recalls on the Toyota, a sign that the internal quality control has gone to hell, obviously because they got sloppy from being top dog for so long. No surprise that they lost half a BILLION dollars in the last year, reported today, and are laying off what will amount to a total of several thousand workers. A sad sign that success undermines itself; and guess what country needs to learn that lesson much faster than it is showing signs of doing at the moment.    So I down rate it to four stars, probably should be three.    PS I have six or seven of the little battery operated travel shavers, and the new ones either have no trimmer or a very poor one (as on the current Braun). None are very good for a clean shave, only just better than nothing.</li>
    <li> If I would have rated this product shortly after receiving and using it, I would have given it 4 stars. The only things keeping it from receiving a 5 star rating were the functionality of the charging/cleaning unit and the retail price. I&#x27;m sorry, but there is absolutely no way that this electric shaver is worth $400 retail. I feel bad for anyone who paid the full price for this product. I picked it up new for around $200 on Amazon. I feel that is a much more reasonable price point for this shaver. The problems with the charging/cleaning unit are 1)it is really not needed, 2)the cleaning cycle is ridiculously long and loud, 3)at the end of the cleaning cycle, the unit emits an incredibly bright flashing blue strobe that continues until you remove the shaver, and 4)there is no separate charging function when placing the shaver in the unit.    After 5 months of daily use, I can disappointedly only rate it at 2 stars due to quality/reliability issues. The charging/cleaning unit is no longer functioning properly. After the last few attempts at using the cleaning cycle, I have found my shaver sitting in a pool of cleaning solution in the morning. The blue led display on the shaver is displaying non-sensical information. For instance, when I last finished charging the shaver, instead of showing 100% charge, the display shows 188% charge. The minutes used/remaining feature displays unintelligible numbers as well. Fortunately, this has not affected the shaving performance one bit, but I wonder about what is going to happen down the road. The shaver is basically controlled by a microprocessor. What if that goes next?    This is my second Panasonic shaver and I continue to be impressed with the pure shaving performance of the shaver, but Panasonic is failing me in the reliability department. It is too bad, because I really think Panasonics perform well. I am not talking about their products failing after years of use. I am talking about their $400 flagship shaver having problems after only 5 months! I do not purchase a shaver of this type for it to end up being disposable. A previously owned Panasonic shaver also had problems with the battery holding a charge. I had it for a little over a year. Panasonic customer service wanted to charge me $40 for a refurbished unit, but gave me a one time credit after I pushed the issue. I have contacted Panasonic in regard to my current problem and told them that I am not interested in a refurbished unit. Hopefully, they will make things right. Fool me once...    UPDATE 5/24/11    After emailing Panasonic through their website and receiving no response, I decided to try calling them. I explained my problems with the shaver to the customer service rep and he provided me with a reference number and contact info for the McAllen Exchange Center. I paid to ship the unit back and within a week of them receiving it, I received a replacement unit at no cost to me. The invoice states that it is a refurbished unit, which is disappointing because I specifically asked them for a brand new unit given the cost of the original unit and the length of time that I owned it. If it is refurbished, I can&#x27;t tell. Everything from the packaging to the shaver and cleaning unit are exactly the same condition as my former brand new unit. While my customer service experience took a turn for the better, only time will tell if this shaver can make the grade in terms of long term reliability.</li>
    <li> Brilliant , very good shave</li>
    <li> This shaver is great while it lasts. Within 2 months of purchase the LCD started to malfunction. Byt the 4th month the cleaning/charging station stopped working altogether and now, in the 11th month it has completely died.   This shaver has never been misused and I have kept it in meticulous order. There seems to be no reason for its death other than poor craftsmanship.  Its a shame Panasonic self such junk at such an inflated price point.  Because I live in Australia and bought it online from Amazon, Panasonic will not honour any warranties.. So it had to be binned.  Very dissapointed</li>
    <li> After my 5 year old Braun 8595 started to actup, I decided to buy the Panasonic ES-LA93K. The shave is much closer than the Braun as the Panasonic effortlessly glides across your beard. Clearly superior to the \\&quot;over priced\\&quot; and \\&quot;over rated\\&quot; Braun! I like the ability to use wet or dry and to be able to clean it with plain water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the higher end Braun&#x27;s for years, was ready to buy another one until I read a few reviews comparing the Panasonic&#x27;s. I took a chance on the ES-LA93-K model and here were my first impressions:  1. The shaver head is on the larger side  2. The sound is a bit menacing at first  Getting past this, upon first use, it was very comfortable while shaving and you get a very close shave - better it seems that any of the higher end Braun&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;ve you don&#x27;t need or want the base unit, you can really do without it (as should I have) because you can simply clean it manually yourself with great ease producing similar results while saving a ton on those cleaning cartridges.  So far, this seems to be the best one I&#x27;ve owned.  Whatever the next model down is that doesn&#x27;t have the base unit, I would recommend as I don&#x27;t believe the shaver itself is any different.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the only electric which allowed me to shelve the shaving mug and razor.  I have been shaving for 40 years. I have tried many different electrics. None provided the close shave I require. The Panasonic is astounding. I cannot evaluate the cleaning system but I am very satisfied with the razor itself.</li>
    <li> I just started to used this product, can&#x27;t really give you my honest opinion yet. as of now I would say so-so. thats my honest opinion. thanks</li>
    <li> Pleased with the razor and the shaves I get. However it does take a good month for the beard to adjust, and I had used another type of electric shaver prior to this purchase.</li>
    <li> It has better performance than I think. Thanks for good shaver.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this unit. I had been using rotary shavers for years; they were OK, not great, and replacement parts were so expensive I often just junked the whole thing. This time, I bought a higher-end unit, and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t do it years ago. It shaves much much closer than the old ones -- wife noticed right away -- and it&#x27;s much easier to clean -- just drop it in the charger and press the button. Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and even though I was supposed to give it a month to allow my skin to get used to switching from a straight edge, all the reviews I had read and even comments from the manufacturer&#x27;s website suggested there would be minimal transition from straight edge to this razor. In the first three weeks I used this razor I had a rash all over my face and it constantly left hairs behind (it didn&#x27;t matter how long I shaved for those same hairs never got picked up). Then, the last straw was when I went to replace the cleaning cartridge on the cleaning system but the status light never went off. I got there customer service on the line who went through a series of fixes with me over the phone and then decided I have a bad unit and should send it in. Instead I decided I was going to return it and the cartridges I had just bought. I spoke to an Amazon representative who said I could get my money back on the razor and the replacement cartridges but I only received a refund on the razor. Then I shaved with my old Gilette Fusion and had the best shave in weeks. For me this was a horrible horrible product!</li>
    <li> After 30 years of blade-shaving, I finally decided to try this Panasonic, which is my first electric shaver ever. Why switch now? Well, with a dozen of Gillette&#x27;s latest Fusion blades costing nearly $50, the idea of dropping $195 for what many describe as the best electric shaver on the market actually made good economic sense. And since Panasonic backs it with a 30-day money back guarantee, I figured I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, since it&#x27;s my first electric, I can&#x27;t compare it to Braun, Norelco, etc. But with me, the comparison was the holy grail for electric shavers: it had to be at least as good as, or better than, the shave I get with a blade. And by that standard, this Panasonic has proven itself a clear winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but from the first shave, it was faster, easier, and (yes) closer than my Fusion blades. I shave \\&quot;wet,\\&quot; using the Billy Jealousy Hydroplane gel and I&#x27;ve had no discomfort or irritation. In about 3 minutes, I&#x27;m done and as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s butt, with none of the missed spots that I would often find and need to do over again with blades. My beard is tough to shave because it grows in several different directions, but the Panasonic handles that challenge with ease. As others have noted, this shaver is smaller than it appears in photographs and it handles incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few minor niggles, but nothing for which I&#x27;d detract a star: the cleaning cycle is a little noisy, though quiet when it&#x27;s drying; the insanely bright blue LED which flashes whenever the shaver is in the cleaner/charger unit could light up a harbor in dense fog; the shaving head is a bit large--I have a close-cropped goatee, and shaving along the edges of it can be a little tricky because the shaving head somewhat blocks my view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up: The King is dead! Long live the King! The Panasonic LA93-K. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope that you found it helpful!</li>
    <li> if you are considering purchasing this electric shaver, DON&#x27;T!   My wife calls this contraption a cylon device- I wish it were so then I can at least vouch for its efficiency . My issues with it are covered by other reviews .I have had better shaves with a cheap 2 edged razor. It requires multiple passes to get a semi decent shave and it is way too loud when cleaning.   \\&quot;Move along ,these are not the droids you are looking for\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for 2wks, with no complaints for my wife, in my book she is the only critic that counts.  It does the job with no miss steps, clean and smooth.  I&#x27;ve been a long time Braun guy,  5 Series.  Just past that model down to my son.  Because I wanted to try out the Panasonic, and lets just say I am not going to miss the Braun.  The only thing I miss is the lemon smell of the cleaning solution of the Braun.  Panasonic&#x27;s is plain, no order that I can tell.  Hey if you have to loose something that would be it.  The save is as close as the Braun if not better....  Hope to get a lot of years of use!</li>
    <li> Looked on Amazon.co.uk and cheapest price was £229 for a German sourced shaver otherwise £299.  Decided to try Amazon.com where it was substantially cheaper.  Using the checkout system was easy and additional customs duty was automatically calculated before total price was paid by credit card in £s.  Total cost came to £158 including customs/p&amp;p.  Ordered 24th June and arrived 8th July.  Shaver plug was the US style 2 flat pins rather than UK round pins but it plugs straight into the shaver socket fitted in my bathroom with no problems - charger works with 110v-240v.  Great shaver and a lot quieter than my previous 7 series braun.  Cleaned using cleaning unit twice so far and has left the head spotless - doesn&#x27;t matter about the length of the clean/dry cycle as I just set it when I finish shaving and go to work.  Overall recommend the shaver and also recommend importing via Amazon.com as it was easy and saved £70!</li>
    <li> By comparison, I have used Brauns and other Panasonics for at least fifteen years and have a fairly heavy beard and angular face.  I have used this shaver for about a month and my overall impression is that it is very good.  The wet shave (with shaving cream) is extremely close, in fact E XTREMELY close.  Dry (using a pre shave like Afta) gives a very good shave- absolutely no complaints.  As another reviewer noted, the ES LA93 looks large and bulky in photos but it is very light and easy to use but it did take some additional effort to shave up close below  my nose because the shaving head is larger than any of my previous shavers.  However, it just takes a little effort and is hardly a complaint considering how well this shaver works overall.  The vortex cleaning station really cleans the shaving head very very thoroughly but when charged the constantly blinking blue light is on the bright side so that I actually have to keep the bathroom door closed at night.  Neighbors no doubt now have confirmation of my behavior being related nightly to alien abductions!  The cleaning solution is just over three weeks old and I still do not have a low or change light indicator coming on.  Per instructions, I change the water reservoir once a day (which is very easy.  I do it at night so the unit is ready to clean after my morning shave).  I am definitely pleased with this product and would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor at the beginning of September 2011 and have been using it at least every other day since then.  My problem with this unit is after only 3 months, my charger / cleaning base quit working on the cleaning side.  What I mean is, the unit sounds like it is working but will not pump any fluid to actually clean the unit.      Now if you are like me, you read the first few reviews, or even the first 10 or 15 but what you need to do is read the 1 star reviews.  This unit has a proven track record of being garbage (the base) and Panasonic&#x27;s customer Service and Warranty policies really stink.  You have to send the ENTIRE unit back, leaving you without a razor for several weeks while they decide to replace your defective unit with a refurbished one (they have multitudes, based on how often they break).      DO NOT buy this or any self-cleaning razor from Panasonic or you will be stuck like many others of us.  I just ordered a new Braun razor to replace this one because for the last 15 years I have owned braun and they have worked flawlessly for me.    I really like the razor, it cuts well even on my beard which is quite coarse. I like the fact that I can use it in the shower and rinse it off as well.    The things I don&#x27;t like about the razor are the head size is HUGE, so it&#x27;s hard to get any precision with it.  The cleaning / drying cycle takes about 2 hours to complete and is pretty noisy, espcially if someone is trying to sleep near the bathroom.  The power button is right where I put my thumb while holding it, so I turn it off in the middle of shaving and the base unit is total garbage.</li>
    <li> There is nothing positive that I can say about this shaver.  I feels cheaply made, and gives the impression it would be destroyed were it to be dropped on the floor.  In fact--I&#x27;m doubtful it would survive a drop into the sink.  It is a less successful shaver than my Panasonic of ten years ago--leaving most gray hairs untouched--unless you press about as hard as is practical.  Then, after going back and forth repeatedly--it will cut your beard.  In addition, the shaver was quiet for the first week.  After that, a much louder rattle came from the shaving head and nother I could do would abate it.  But the worst, by far, is the noise of the cleaning and drying cycles:  drying alone could be heard in another room at the end of the house,  the cleaning cycle sounded like there was construction going on in the street--or a small factory was manufacturing something in the bathroom.  Suffice it to say I tried &#x27;cleaning&#x27; once only.  And drying, I left to open air on the bathroom counter to accomplish.</li>
    <li> I have had the shaver for 5 weeks and I love it!  The first couple of times I shaved with it I wasn&#x27;t too impressed but then... I guess I need a couple time to get use to holdig a new shaver.  I love the way it makes my face feel when I am done shaving.  I don\\&quot;t even feel like I just shaved.  If feels great!  You get a close shave without the irritation and the muliple bades on the foil do an awesome job.  The cleaner is a little loud but it cleans the razor good and leaves it smelling clean.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s been a little while since mid-November when the shaver arrived, and I still love it.  Best shave ever.  I&#x27;ve used Panasonic shavers since 1984 and have alway been happy with them, but this is the best ever!  I hesitated to put that much money in a shaver, but now, NO REGRETS.  It is a closer shave than any I have before.  The last shaver was a Braun 4775, a gift, and I was never happy with it.  It wasn&#x27;t as close as my previous Panasonic.  Not so with this gift to myself the ES-LA93-K.  It is quicker, smoother, more comfortable than any shaver I have ever had.  A joy to shave.  Only complaint, a minor one, is that when it is in the charger/cleaner, after any of the cycles, the led display flashes every other second.  It is BRIGHT!  Too bright, it lights up a room with blue flashes.  It is a bit annoying especially at night.  I don&#x27;t know why they chose to make it flash all the time.  It does come with a carry case and shield for the head of the shaver and you can charge it by connecting the power cord directly to it, both these items are unclear in the information on the AMAZON informational pages.  You can travel without the charger/cleaner base unit.  I do recommend it.  Wish for: All previous Panasonic shavers had to be replaced because the internal ni/cad batteries died.  I would wish for end-user replaceable batteries!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few electronic shavers, mostly rotary shavers. I was never particularly happy with any of them. However, this shaver has changed my mind entirely. I get a close shave every time. The self cleaning unit makes it feel like a new shaver every time I&#x27;ve reached for it. I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone in the market. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
    <li> In the last 36 years of using electric shavers this is the first electric to ever leave my neck completely smooth and clean of all stubble.  And it did so in just a little over 3 1/2 minutes!  I&#x27;ve used many different brands looking for the perfect shave over the years starting with Sunbeam, Remington, several Norelco&#x27;s, and a couple of Braun&#x27;s, the last being a Series 7.  All were top of the line shavers but none could ever get all the hairs and stubble from my neck.  I&#x27;ve always had to keep a disposable razor handy to drag over my neck a few times to get all the stray hairs that the electric&#x27;s missed.  But not with this new Panasonic.  It get&#x27;s all the neck hairs and shaves so far below the skin level that my 5 o-clock shadow is a thing of the past!  I can get through the entire day now with that fresh shaved look.  This shaver is amazing.  I tried it this morning in the shower and what a luxurious shave that is.  I just used some Dove bar soap and my face shaved smooth and clean.  I had a little trouble with it shutting off several times because while you&#x27;re trying to keep hold of it with all that soap on it you inadvertently keep squeezing the power button.  But I remembered it has a lock button, so I just turned it on and locked the button.  Problem solved!  It took a little longer in the shower because I don&#x27;t have a mirror in there and had to shave by feel, but the results turned out fabulous!  It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll probably only have time for on the weekends though.  The cleaning station as far as I&#x27;m concerned is far superior to the one that came with my Braun Series 7.  I much prefer the smaller and cheaper dry cartridges to the much larger, messier, and more expensive alcohol based ones that the Braun uses.  I could only get about 6 weeks out of the Braun cartridges even with cleaning the shaver every other day.  The system is not sealed so the alcohol just evaporates whether you use it or not.  The water based system on the Panasonic appears to be much better sealed, and of course you could always add a little more water if you needed to, so I can easily see getting 2 to 3 month&#x27;s out of a cartridge with this setup.  I&#x27;ve always rinsed all the whiskers out of the shaver head first (yes, the Braun&#x27;s head was washable) before putting it in the cleaner base to help keep the load and odor at bay.  This helps the cleaner in the base stay fresher longer and also reduces clogs in the system as well for reduced maintenance.  I&#x27;ll probably only use the wash cycle every few days with the Panasonic because it cleans up so well under the faucet with just using the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; cleaning method.  The cost of these cartridges through Amazon&#x27;s subscription purchase is only $2.83 each.  I have been paying $4.33 on average for the cartridges for the Braun, and then they only last 6 weeks.  So this will be a nice savings if I can get a few month&#x27;s out of these.  I feel the cleaning system is worthwhile because it keeps my shaver clean, fresh, and dry so much better than if it was just left up to me.  And Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning station allows me to select \\&quot;dry only and charge\\&quot; (where the Braun&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t) so on those day&#x27;s when I choose not to use the cleaning cycle, I can still dry the shaver head in the station which I feel is important to the longevity of the blades.  Plus since there&#x27;s no alcohol in the system, it won&#x27;t erode the finish on the shaver like it did with my Braun.  All the paint flaked off around the base of the head on my Braun due to the alcohol.  I&#x27;m really enjoying my new Panasonic shaving system.  The only gripes I have with it all have to do with the way it&#x27;s programmed to do certain tasks.  Let&#x27;s start with the base.  This is an excellent system and cleans the shaver immaculately.  However, who in their right mind would program it to dry the shaver for 1 1/2 hours!  That&#x27;s right, the fan runs for an hour and a half to dry the head.  That&#x27;s ridiculous!  The cleaning cycle only takes 10 minutes, and that&#x27;s fine.  But it shouldn&#x27;t take more than 20 to 30 minutes max to dry the head with the fan.  Who comes up with these things?  Then there&#x27;s the infamous flashing blue light display that it reverts to after the battery is fully charged.  What would make any one ever think that the customer would be happy with a blue beacon in their bathroom flashing all night long!?!  How absurd is that!  When the shaver is done charging the light should just go out - end of story.  But no, it has to flash and light up the whole room endlessly flashing like a little lighthouse.  Who-ever is in charge of programming these shaver&#x27;s and bases needs to be moved on.  In summary, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  And the cleaning/charging station does an outstanding job keeping the shaver in tip top shape.  It is only flawed by a couple of really dumb programming choices.  But I&#x27;ve discovered that you can just tip the shaver to one side in the base to make the flashing blue light go out.  It doesn&#x27;t look quite as elegant as when the shaver is straight but it works.  You can also stop the drying cycle that way too.  Despite these annoying flaws, I still highly recommend this shaver to anyone that wants one of the best shave&#x27;s that can be had from an electric shaver.  Yes, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  been using an electric exclusively for about 11 years now and my last two shavers have been top of the line Brauns.  I was ready to purchase the current top of line Braun (790cc) when I ran across this Panasonic.  Based on the reviews I changed my mind an bought this shaver.    I couldn&#x27;t have been any more excited for my first shave, but unfortunately I found that although it did shave extremely close on my cheeks and chin, it did an awful job on my neck - the main problems being hairs that were completely missed and irritation.  I really tried to like this shaver, trying it both dry (how I usually shave) and with gel.  EIther way, I had the same problems.  Also, shaving your upper lip with this thing is a challenge.    I gave it a fair shot (about 2 weeks - yes I know it&#x27;s not the month you&#x27;re supposed to take to adjust) and ended up returning it and ordering the Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about three weeks now. This is my first \\&quot;real\\&quot; electric shaver. I inherited an old Norelco many years ago from my grandfather and I never liked the circular shaving motion I had to use to get just an OK shave. The Panasonic overall works pretty well, though it did take me a few shaves to get a good shave. Learning the shape of your face, which way your hair grows and how much pressure to use were the three things that I needed to learn. After shaving with a blade for many years, I never worried about these things. The Panasonic&#x27;s shave is good, but not fantastic. From time to time I will leave some patches of stubble that I&#x27;ll need to go back over, but I&#x27;m getting better each time I shave. I haven&#x27;t used the cleaning feature yet as it&#x27;s simple enough to just use soap and water. Drying time is very long (3 hours). The noise of the drying fan was not as loud as I expected from other reviews. If you&#x27;ve ever had your PC start to overheat, well, it sounds like that! Panasonic should really extend their return period time to a 60 day period to give customers a full month the use the shaver. There is actually a little card inside the box that says you should use the shaver for a month to let your face adjust - ironic that your refund period will expire at the same time!    Bottom line: I&#x27;m I happy with my purchase - YES    FYI - Do a search for reviews on this product and you&#x27;ll find a link for a cheaper price listing on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very advanced and extremely clean and comfortable. I really like the self-clean centre. It helps me a lot!</li>
    <li> Been using it for just over one week.  Have yet to use automatic cleaner.  The shaver gives a very smooth shave within three minutes.   The trimmer was helpful in trimming sideburns.  Would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews, I thought this would be the next thing since sliced bread.  Shaved with wet face but no lather, had to go over spots a few times and still all hair was not shaven off.  The shaver did not leave any burns or plucked hairs (Then again, it didnt shave) guess I&#x27;m stuck with a $200 lint remover.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate this razor.    1.  Too Big and Bulky.  2.  Does Not Cut Whiskers Completely Without Repeated Strokes.  3.  Does Not Slide Smoothly Over Face.  4.  Does Not Shave Neck Hair Adequately.  Extremely Disappointed in this Very Expensive, Oversized Razor.  DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR!!!</li>
    <li> had it for a week and so far it&#x27;s amazing... been using razor for ages, decided to try this and glad I did....</li>
    <li> Love this Shaver. Definitely not a big fan of electric shavers but this one has changed my mind. Shaves really close, very impressed</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver, it is my first electric shaver, I was hesitant about going electric because I was worried about the pinching and pulling that comes with electric shavers. This shaver is pinch and pull free, feels great and just glides over my skin giving a very close shave, I would say as close as a razor. The base is rather chunky but doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, because it makes it quick and hassle free.</li>
    <li> Im 57, I have had alot of elec razor&#x27;s and this is the best I have ever had.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My trusted Braun had given up on me after only a few years. The switch to Panasonic was absolutely painless, literally. It is more comfortable on my sensitive skin and gives me a closer shave in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I can see how much battery I have used. This shaver charges in no time and is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all full marks for this perfect Panasonic!</li>
    <li> The razor works great. Had the Braun Series 7 prior to this and wasn&#x27;t happy enough with it to replace the blades when it came due. The positive reviews on this product align with my experience. The only Cons would be it cuts so close in some areas that I&#x27;m having trouble with ingrown hairs and like most shavers I&#x27;ve used over the years, including the Braun, it just can&#x27;t seem to easily get to some areas. Sometimes it will leave behind a single hair that I will have to get with the trimmer.Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning system yet, but overall a great razor though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is with the org Panasonic uses to process their rebates. Useless. They say they *cough* never received my paperwork and could I send copies. You mean a copy of the UPC. The item you say must be original? Please. This should be easy to process since it was through one of the largest retailers in the world.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver and I would like to recommend this shaver for those people who has tough beard and lots of facial hair. It&#x27;s easy to use and I can use it with foam as a wet shaving, But the fun part is dry shaving which I prefer and this is the best of all shavers out their in the market.</li>
    <li> For years I have tried a number of electric razors. the Braun 7, and Norelco&#x27;s SensorTouch 3D being the latest.  Each of these two razors was good in differing ways, but they did not give me the shave I was trying to find.&lt;br /&gt;Along comes the Panasonic Arc 4 ES-LA93-K.  At last I got the shave I was looking for. Close and very comfortable; effective around those nagging neck hairs; wet/dry (excellent ) and unlike the Noreleco it can be charged whilst travelling. I am sold on this product.  It combines the best of the other two mentioned above in a well made body.&lt;br /&gt;I do have one cavil however, and that is the washer that came with the razor.  To me it over complicates the cleaning process, and the drying takes - wait for it - 180  minutes.  The cleaning is done, but the other two cleaners - the Braun and Norelco - are far faster and seem to do as good a job.  The Braun has a rather nice citrusy smell in its cleaner too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: the Panasonic is the best electric razor I have owned.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW. I purchased this item because I was tired of paying 5 to 7 bucks a blade for the Gillette/Schick blades (I went to Schick because the blades were cheaper) I have a heavy thick beard (I have 5 o clock shadow by noon) and have had Norelco shavers in the past and was never impressed with the quality of the shave. Since I travel 2 to 3 days a week I wanted something that I can bring on the road when I travel and simplify my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shaver 3 times and I can&#x27;t believe it shaves as close as a razor with a non scraping feeling I felt I always get with razors. I have used it wet and I have used it dry and while wet was wonderful shaving dry was good as well. I have read multiple reviews on this product and I know Braun has it&#x27;s fans but for me I feel the Panasonic delivers exactly what I was looking for and then some. I haven&#x27;t used the cleaning system yet but as long as the unit cleans like it&#x27;s supposed to is all I care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Math a blade a week is on the low end $5 x 52 &#x3D; $260 I figure I am ahead by $80 and I expect the unit to last longer than a year. I will replace items like foils and cutters as the manufacturer recommends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many electric shavers over the years and have never been completely satisfied.  I was reluctant to spend $200 on a shaver but based on other reviews, decided to go for it.  From the very first shave, I&#x27;ve been amazed at how close it gets.  Even my wife was totally impressed that there is absolutely no stubble feeling!  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great shave, comfortable, close and fast. I use it with just a bit of shave gell and it is just about as good as a razor. Charges quickly, cleans itself or you can run it under some cool water. I would have given it five stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the high price. If you want a really close and fast shave and like a wet/dry shaver, this is great.</li>
    <li> Razor worked fine... 5 stars on its own.  The cleaning system is loud and takes forever... No idea why the process takes so long, but it is not something you want to listen to for an hour or so... The razor gives a very close shave - especially wet shave.  I have had my share of razors and this one is easily the best to date - even better than my Braun. No need for the cleaning system, some warm water and liquid soap does the job just fine.</li>
    <li> Well it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  Neck hair is quite a problem with this thing.  Apart from the ongoing cost of razor blades I prefer the shave granted by them.    This shaver does a really really nice job of the face, close and lovely, but if you have substantial growth under the chin line I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.    No I haven&#x27;t tried any other electric shaver before so I&#x27;m only comparing this to a manual razor.</li>
    <li> hey &amp;#34;brothers&amp;#34; if you&#x27;ve been looking for an electric shaver this is the one...I have used hand trimmers for ever on my face and head because any and I mean any razor breaks me out...I was online shopping...at work no doubt...hey don&#x27;t look like that I&#x27;m not the only one...anyway and decided to make this purchase....best decision I&#x27;ve made...now I know you&#x27;re not used to paying this amount for a shaver and neither was I but...one shave in and I was like wow...there was absolutely no pulling and the shave I got was better than with a razor and with zero irritation...for best result &amp;#34;for me&amp;#34; shave with your hand trimmers and the next day or two use these then after that unless your hair grows like bamboo then every other day will keep you looking your best...don&#x27;t use with a weeks worth of hair and then say they don&#x27;t work they are best for stubble... they work for everything...head, underarms, and the boys if you like to keep them shaved too...make sure you pull the skin taught on the underside of the boys</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing shaver I have ever had. It not only gives you a close shave but also allows you to shave with shaving cream, rinse or whatever you prefer. I highly recommened this shaver aslo because of the charger/cleaner that leaves the shaver in top shape and clean all of the time. A full charge also allows you to take the shaver with you on a trip without the need of recharging until you get back. And if it is a very long trip then you can take the charger with you also.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this shaver especially for everyone with very sensitive skin and tough beard like myself. I have been a Philips user for almost 15 years and then I switched to Panasonic with an ES8228, then I moved to an ES8249, and finally I bought ES-93, which is the best shaver available in the market at this time. I like a consistently close shave and no irritation on my neck. Of course, it is costly but you get what you paid for. The only problem for me is that due to my tough facial hair I need to change the foil and blades every 7-8 months, which could be perceived a bit expensive by some. However, the comfort and healthy looking skin are more important for me than any other considerations. I have tried the new model of Philips 3D as a long standing fan of old Philips models and I can attest that the Panasonic shaver is still superior. I have no experience with the Braun shavers and I have no desire to try as I am very happy with my Panasonic. I am slightly puzzled by some negative reviews for this shaver, my guess is that the competition cannot compete with Panasonic via technology and thus they may use different tactics. In any event, I highly recommend this shaver, which I bought not only for myself, but for all my relatives and friends who are grateful and happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> I used to need a blade razor to get a close shave or after 2 days of growth.  This shaver easily takes care of both of these.  It realy is the best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> The cleaner does not really do any cleaning. Dipping the shaver in water and soap is not cleaning. I have to manually clean it for it to be really clean. Shave yourself a few bucks and just buy the shaver alone.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. I like the high speed the blade vibrates and the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> The razor works fantastic I only wish all razoes would cut close as a manual.  I am really enjoying thr rszor would recommenf to all.</li>
    <li> brand new. love it. guys out there. purchase this item</li>
    <li> i have bought a lot of hi end shavers over the years and this is the very best of all of them and i dont buy the low cost ones this is a little costly but well worth it no pulled hairs no bumps great shave just dont press hard on your face and it will work great like under the neck where the hair grows in different directions gets them u can go wet or dry i like dry great shaver u will love it i do also can shave the head bald very close</li>
    <li> I have owned numerous razors from Norelco, Remington, and Braun and I can tell you that Panasonic makes one of the best Electric Shavers on the market.  This unit uses tap water and a cleaning cartridge to keep your razor clean and ready for every use.  The shave is superb and wonderfully close.  A blade may get you just a hair closer (I know, bad pun) but you can also remove a layer of skin each time you use a blade.  I did have one issue with my shaver base and Panasonic replaced the unit within one week with a brand new one.  I was very happy with the turn around time and would recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a close shave and easy cleanup.</li>
    <li> nice design and nice hand feeling, just the clean system is designed too square. I bought it for my self. it works very well.</li>
    <li> The blade is really sharp enough. I really like this product. Good job.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have had so far Expensive but worth it</li>
    <li> A very good wet/dry electric shaver, the Panasonic offers many electronic features; indicators for when to clean, when charge the battery, etc.  My only concern is one needs a Phd. to understand how to use it.  Once mastered, however, the shaver is an excellent respite from the blade, but not a complete relacement for the blade.  Save your blade for a real close shave every once in awhile.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but when you have to shave every day, it&#x27;s worth the money to get a close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> very impressive! This is actually 4.5 stars. I already have best norelco and the best braun. Heres why this is best: The norelco works great in the shower but because its circular the upper lip area is not served well. Couple that w the fact that its not a close shave and the battery just progressively getting worse w each charge (and yes I dont over charge it), it ultimately fails as a stand alone.  The braun does work well as a stand alone as its a very close shave, a little bit closer than the panasonic actually! but it takes forever, and the replacement blades are extremely expensive, and it cant be used in the shower (owing to its slowness).  The panasonic however, IS a wet/dry shaver, it is efficient, its pretty darn close and it is incredibly fast.  im not saying I dont have to run the same area twice or anything, but its far and away the fastest. One guesstimate is that its about 50% faster than the Norelco. The braun is about 4 times slower.  That huge, humongous head actually is easy to use, and bc its linear it can be used for the philtrum area. It is a little tricky in the side burn area as Im always a bit nervous about shortening it unnecessarily, but im sure ill learn how to do it eventually.  1/2 star deduction for that, its slightly less close shave than the braun, and how the blue light blinks powerfully in the bathroom at night when it charges. literally had to close the door bc it was bothering me!  Great product panasonic! wish I bought you first!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Had a Panasonic electric shaver before this one, so knew what to expect from a Panasonic shaver. I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver &amp; would buy one again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so many positive reviews on this product before just i go ahead and buy it. Well anyway this might not work on your skin as i tend to have PSB so i thought this product might help but actually it doesn&#x27;t! and it gets so difficult to shave your jawline with this so i guess i&#x27;m going back to my old philishave.</li>
    <li> After having a Braun for many years, I gave this Panasonic a try.  I was happy with the shaver (aside from the annoyingly bright blue light that I taped over).  However, the real issue I had is that just shy of a year the self-cleaning base stopped working.  From searching for a replacement I&#x27;ve found that this is not uncommon issue.  I so far haven&#x27;t been able to find a way to order a replacement base.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used an electric razor, and I can say without a doubt this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had--so close I&#x27;ve actually managed to cut myself when trying to use it like I&#x27;m used to. I learned very quickly that you don&#x27;t need pressure to use this thing, it&#x27;s so sharp. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face, or pull or tear like other razors. The ability to use it in the shower is wonderful. Only real downside is that the cleaner is loud, and when charging, the display constantly flashes with a bright blue light--I don&#x27;t have a problem with this though, as I just set it to clean when I leave for work. Great, great product.</li>
    <li> I surprised my husband with this, neither of us knew exactly what to expect. Turns out it is beyond anything he imagined, best electric razor he&#x27;s ever used. None of the negative reviews applied to this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great in the shower with a little bit of shaving cream. Had a little bit of neck irritation after first use, but I was aware of this and didn&#x27;t use too much force when shaving my neck.  I figure the best way to shave my neck is to find out which way the grains are going and go against them with slow, multiple passes.     I haven&#x27;t used to self-cleaning system yet, I just remove the foil and rinse it out. Still on my first charge after about 8 shaves.     Update:  One month later on second charge and it&#x27;s working great. No more irritation on the neck, plus a smooth shave all around going against the grain.</li>
    <li> Three months of use.  I clean daily and use only dry.  Still as sharp as day one.  I have a very tough neck to shave and it does as well as my Braun ever did</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for one month and it is the best I have ever used.  With very little effort you get a nice close shave.  The cleaning system is very easy to use and does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. He had stopped shaving everyday because of cuts and the general mess of shaving cream. Now he can do a quick shave or regular shave. No more mess and no more cuts. And the cleaning system has been working fine. We&#x27;ve owned it for about two months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those who take avantage of other customers&#x27; reviews and rarely write one of my own, but I thought this the Panasonic ES-LA93-K deserves one.  My 10-or-so-year-old Braun shaver (dry) finally died so I tried one of Gillette&#x27;s new technology razors.  It was alright - it reminded me that I liked the feeling of a foam shave and the warm rinse afterwards.  When Amazon put the ES-LA93-K on Deal of the Day, I jumped on it not really knowing what I was buying - only that it seemed to be a great deal.  When I finally tried the shaver with foam, I had to ask myself why I hadn&#x27;t tried it before.  The shaver glides over the foam so smoothly.  With its 14000 cpm, I don&#x27;t feel any tugging or pulling.  It is also great for dry-shaving, but I just like it with foam better. Oh, and no, 14000 is not a typo.  That&#x27;s 233 per second dudes!  The package comes with a little note that asks you to give the shaver 30 days to allow your face to get used to it.  After just two days, I don&#x27;t feel any discomfort whatsoever and my face comes out so smooth!    I&#x27;ve also used the trimmer - it works as advertised.  I like the cap - it&#x27;s easy to put on and it fits two ways (hard to explain, but it snaps on one way, and it&#x27;ll also snap on if you turn it 180*).  The locking mechanism is probably going to be important for me as I travel for business quite a bit.  When I do, I&#x27;ll be using the custom pouch the shaver came with.  The cleaning kit looks pretty cool.  I like that the cleaning solution isn&#x27;t a big container of alcohol like my old Braun&#x27;s.  Oh and lastly, it charges fast - with an indicator of % complete.  I&#x27;ll follow up if I find anything negative, but as of now, I highly recommend the ES-LA93-K.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic rechargeable men&#x27;s rechargeable electric shaver is fantastic. This is not my first will not be my last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Ned Leiby</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a Norelco electric razor with circular foils after not feeling like I was getting a close shave each morning and getting occasional skin irritation if shaving too aggressively (from trying to get a close shave). With the Panasonic shaver there was a noticeable difference in smoothness and closeness of the shave with no irritation. The cleaning function isn&#x27;t just a novelty either, it does a great job of cleaning the razor out, which I&#x27;m sure extends the life of the blades and foil. A bit pricey but you do get top of the line looks, feel, and functions. One thing I thought was smart is the charger can plug into the base OR directly into the razor so it makes traveling with the razor for long stretches easier/lighter.</li>
    <li> This shaver does an amazing job, I would highly recommend it.  For the last 10 years I have used a philips 3 head rotary shaver and this shaver is so much better.  I actual look forward to shaving in the morning now, the experience is that good. The closeness of shave that I get with this shaver is just as good as a razor, if not better.  The thing I like most is that can be used as a wet shaver with cream in the shower. The only negative I would give it is that when it is plugged into the wall charging you can not shave, however the charge time is really quick, 1 hour.    If you are looking for a new shaver you will not be disappointed with this one, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> To all you men out there looking for an electric shaver that works as good as the high end blades out there... THIS PANANSONIC ES-LA93 IS IT!! I AM 56 YEARS OLD AND HAVE TRIED JUST ABOUT EVERY ELECTRIC SHAVER BRAND OVER THE YEARS INCLUDING EARLIER PANASONIC MODELS ONLY TO ALWAYS-ALWAYS-ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE BLADE. I FULLY EXPECTED THIS TO BE THE SAME. BUT, I WAS AMAZED AND A COUPLE WEEKS LATER STILL IN AWE OF THIS PIECE OF FINE EQUIPMENT. MY FACE IS NOT ONLY SMOOTHER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN IT DOES NOT EVER HURT FROM NICKS, BURNS ETC ETC ETC. PLUS I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO SHAVE AS OFTER BECAUSE IT TAKES LONGER FOR THE HAIR TO REACH THE SKIN LEVEL. I DON&#x27;T KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND THIS SHAVER BUT MY HAT IS OFF TO PANASONIC AND IF THEY EVER ASK ME TO DO A COMMERCIAL FOR THEM I WILL SIMLPLY SAY WHEN AND WHERE! MUST I GO ON AND ON AND ON. I FEEL COMPELLED TO DO SO. I READ SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASED AND ALMOST DID NOT BOTHER BECAUSE OF THEM. WELL I AM HERE TO SAY THE ONES THAT SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT THE LA93 EITHER HAVE A BEARD THAT IS LIKE A GRIZZLY BEAR&#x27;S OR JUST DON&#x27;T GET IT.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver to shave my head. It does a great job. At first their was some razer burn on the back of my neck but after two weeks my neck adjusted. I use the shaver in the shower with shaving gel.</li>
    <li> One month in and upset I didn&#x27;t make the switch earlier.  Shaver performs almost as good as a razor in about half the time.  I&#x27;m convinced there will never be an electric shaver that gets 100% of the wily neck beard, but this shaver leaves you hunting for the stragglers not staring at several.  Overall, this is an excellent everyday shaver.</li>
    <li> First time in 30 years have used an electric shaver--have used this product for the past 2 month I am very happy with the results and the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Almost precise and close shave. Better then mach 5 blades (at least for me) and less mess. Love it. Blades are still going good even on fourth month. I was expecting to last these blades for no more than 3 month as I have really hard shave. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I had a Panasonic wet/dry shaver before and made the mistake of switching to a Braun electric shaver.  What a mistake!  I will never buy anything but a Panasonic electric shaver.  I did a lot of research before making this purchase and the reviews were right.  This shaver is top notch.</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic electric razor.  I used my first one for about 5 years.  It worked great.  This new one is even better.  It has a larger shaving surface and so it shaves faster and closer.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical before purchasing the ES-LA93-K. I haven&#x27;t owed an electric razor for the past 25 years. This is definitely the best electric razor I have ever used. I&#x27;ve had it for approximately three months now and have only replaced the cleaning solution once. I clean  the shaver about once a week, with the cleaning solution/automatic cleaner system so it is very inexpensive to maintain. I have rinsed it out  after every use and feel it is unnecessary to replace the cleaning cartridge any sooner.    The previous shavers that I have had in the past were a couple of Norelco triple head shavers and a Remington foil type shaver like this one, and neither one came close to shaving as great as this shaver. I do not have a real thick beard and I use the Panasonic shaver every day. It only takes a few minutes and it does a great job on your neck. That is why I wasn&#x27;t crazy about my prior experience with electric shavers.    I used a triple blade razor before purchasing the Panasonic and the only time that I have ever gotten a closer shave is when you put in a brand new blade, which you and I both know only stays sharp for the first one or two times you shave.    The bottom line is: I highly recommend this shaver! I love the fact that you can use it in the shower if you want. I like the built in trimmer. It shaves almost as close, if not as close as a blade. In my opinion it was well worth the money and I would definitely purchase one again in the future!     [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K  Men&#x27;s Shaver]]</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Great price! I bought it as a present for my husband birthday. He is very pleased and happy with it. I just love the results!</li>
    <li> I had a Panasonic ES8228 which I was very pleased with. I wore it out after several years of use. Now I was wondering if I should buy another or upgrade to the newer model. The saying goes don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broke but I figured that if Panasonic made a good product to begin with then they probably made it better. So I took the chance and upgraded. Now I&#x27;m glad I did. A great improvement on an already good product!</li>
    <li> Wow! never thought an electric razor could shave this close!  Haven&#x27;t even tried it wet yet and it&#x27;s just incredible how smooth and close it shaves, no rash and picks up even awkward hairs on the neck area.  Even shaves chest area smooth as the proverbial.  Can&#x27;t rate this high enough</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mulitple razors over the years, and did significant research before choosing the Panasonic ES-LA93. I had narrowed it down to this or the Braun 9 series, and let me tell you I made the right choice! This Panasonic is absolutely awesome!!!    Now I don&#x27;t have a skimpy little \\&quot;some er\\&quot; beard either. You know some hair here, some hair there. I am a hairy guy, and my face is thick! This Panasonic cuts through with the greatest of ease. The flexibility in the head allows it to closely shave the contours of my face and neck. Even after a weekend of not shaving, when typically I would have to use a trimmer to get it short enough to use the razor, this Panasonic cuts right through!     I chose this razor over the Braun because of the ability to use it dry or wet. And although it does a very nice job when wet, I&#x27;ve found I like to use it dry better. Primarily because it seems to bog down once its full of hair and shave gel. Yes, you can rinse and continue, but that&#x27;s time wasted. When I use it dry it doesn&#x27;t cause razor burn and leaves me smooth everytime. It has cut my shaving time down from 10 to 12 minutes to about 5! No more 5 O&#x27;clock shadow either because the floating blade system lifts and cuts for a clean finish everytime!     Some of the negatives I had read about are NOT the case for me. I have no trouble shaving my upper lip. I have had no issue with the trimmer on the burns or around the ears. The cleaning/charger station does an excellent job and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it what-so-ever!     I bought it on Amazon and paid $220 not MSRP of $400. I expect many great years of shaving with this razor and think that it is well worth the money. If you have a tuff beard, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this Panansonic!!! This razor is the bomb![[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K  Men&#x27;s Shaver]]</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband and he was very pleased with it.  It gives him a very close shave with out irritating his skin even when he uses it dry.  It tells you when it needs to be recharged and when it needs to be cleaned and its very simple to use. Looks sheik and i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my birthday as I had lost my Braun shaver while traveling. There is no need for detail. I can tell you that the Panasonic is an imitation of the Braun and doesn&#x27;t cut as thoroughly nor as smoothly. This china made shaver doesn&#x27;t come close to European made Braun. Sorry I am returning this gift.</li>
    <li> Its almost 2 years since i bought this razor and its still working well. I replaced the blades and screen once. This was well worth the the high initial cost. It still does a better job than any of its competitors.I just purchased this new razor from Panasonic. I got tired of hair left on my face that neither the Braun Pulsonic 7 or the Norelco Arcitec couldn&#x27;t get. My family always tell me about the long hairs that were missed and the constant strokes over the same spot to get a reasonably close shave from the competition.&lt;br /&gt;The new Panasonic worked well out of the box. It took 60 minutes to charge it. All I had to do was fill a little water tank with water and slide in the cleaning pack. It couldn&#x27;t be any easier. My Panasonic was now ready to give me the closest shave I have ever had. I bought some Edge shave gel for sensitive skin, put some warm water on my face and applied the gel. The shaver did the rest. The trimmer worked perfectly and had no problem cutting my sideburns evenly and straight. I haven&#x27;t used a shaving gel for a long time but the results were remarkable. It zipped through my beard and didn&#x27;t leave any uncut hairs.. Clean up was simple too. I just rinsed off the shaving creme from the heads and placed in the hydroclean system. I had to set the clener for clean, dry and charge and my razor is now ready for my next visit.&lt;br /&gt;This razor might be pricey but well worth the price. Panasonic makes tremendous products and this one lives up to it&#x27;s reputation. While the Braun and Norelco were ok, this was super!!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this unit with Hydraclean...it works and it will save you time cleaning your new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 shaves, this is still the best shaver I have ever had. I have tried quite a few electric razors and this one tops the list.It,s 15 months later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 3 weeks since I started using this razor. I still think it is terrific. I opened the razor last night and found that it was perfectly clean. I have no problem with the hydra clean system so far. By this time I had problems with the norelco arctic and the Braun top of the line razors but none so far with this panasonic unit. I didn&#x27;t pay $400 for this. I had a coupon for 20% off at a different internet retailer. I know it&#x27;s alot of money but so far its worth it. I bought my son-in&#x3D;law a top of the line Panasonic about 6 years ago. He replaced the blades and the screen and the shaver just died a couple of weeks ago. If this lasts that long, it will be worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;It is now more than a month since I purchased this shaver and the shaves are getting even better. You don&#x27;t have to press hard and the closeness of the shave is incredible. As for the cleaner, it does a very effective job, just rinse the shaving creme off the top which takes seconds and put it in the auto cleaner. The razor comes out like brand new. I have opened the razor after cleaning to see that it is spotless. I was really suprised. I haven&#x27;t changed the cleaning solution yet because I am waiting for the indicator light to go on. The auto cleaner is definitely worth the money. It saves alot of time.&lt;br /&gt;UP-Date&lt;br /&gt;It is now Feb 20th 2010 and this shaver is still the best ever. You don\\&quot;t have to press down to get a close shave. And the hydra clean system still produces an imacculate razor after the cleaning/drying process. You just have to rinse the shaving cream off the outside of the blades and let the collected water drain off( you&#x27;re talking about seconds to do this). Then it is ready for the hydra clean system. Your beard has finally met its match!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is now more than a year later and I have tried the new 3d from Norelco and the new Braun 7 razor and I have to say that the Panasonic is still the top shaver. It works remarkably well and all I had to do was change the screen and blades and it works like I just took it out of the box. Panasonic makes a terrific product and this is no exception.stem so far.

    <li> I did quite a bit of research on which shaver to purchase and I think like the many of you I read through the reviews of the electric shavers that Amazon sold. This was one of the better reviewed products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one since panasonic&#x27;s the one brand that I hadn&#x27;t tried yet. To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I mostly dry shave and don&#x27;t have time or the inclination to do little else. I still have the rotary Norelco plug in that I bought so many years ago that I no longer use since...well, it&#x27;s old and I&#x27;ve gotten tired of being tethered to an electric outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shaver that I&#x27;ve used. I had to give it a review.</li>
    <li> As someone with a very rough facial hair, I can say without a doubt that this is the best shaver I have ever used.  When I first started shaving I used electric and it always worked moderately well.  After I blew through my second shaver in as many months I switched to Wet Shaving with a Fusion.  Ignoring the fact that I used to cut my face to ribbons it was the closest shave I ever had gotten.  But as I got into my morning routine after College I realized a problem, I hated holding a razor sharp blade to my face every morning.  I began looking for a solution.  I finally found it with this shaver.  This thing can tackle my scruff after 2 days of not shaving.  Understand that after 2 days I usually had to do 2 passes with a bladed razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual Razor fits well in the hand and doesn&#x27;t slide around, like some, when I use it.  Because of how rough my facial hair is I usually restrict the movement of the head with the switch on the back, just so I can press down a bit harder.  I have yet to actually uses this thing enough to drain the Battery past 80%.  I bought mine with a Cleaning station, and I don&#x27;t think I will buy another Razor without one.  One of the worst parts of the electric experience in my opinion has always been the daily cleanup.  The amount of time you save is lost with having to break the razor down and clean all the hair out.  The Cleaning Station always manages to clean my razor completely, there is no hair in it at all after its done.  The only complaint I have is the Cleaning solution gives the razor a mild smell (The smell is so mild I can not smell it unless I&#x27;m working on my upper lip).  Additionally you can use the cable from the base as a charging cable for the razor directly if thats more your speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole this razor is of astonishingly good quality.  It doesn&#x27;t just fit in the hand well its solid weight and great power mean that I will likely use it for a long time to come.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought another version of the Arc 4 that does not have a stand. I like the feature of wet/dry shaver. Makes it easy when your in a hurry in the morning. This is my first electric shaver and I love it.</li>
    <li> follow the instructions and enjoy the smooth and close shave from now on. I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long to try.</li>
    <li> I used a Braun for years and it finally broke (the trimmer portion broke if you are wondering). I&#x27;ve had this for a week now and so far it is excellent. I use it to shave my face and my scalp. My only complaint is the trimmer is a little narrower than my old Braun, but the newest version of the Braun is also narrower so that is a wash. I&#x27;ll report back if anything changes, but so far so good. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the best Braun shaver (Series 7 - 790cc) for two weeks. I was satisfied with the closeness of the shave but the locking mechanism broke rather easily. I decided to return it for this one and I can definitely say there is a big difference. The four blades cut much closer than the Braun and the lock for the head is so much better - it won&#x27;t break after messing with it.     The big downside to this one is that the Braun had the better cleaning system. Still, you can run this one with some liquid soap under the tap - works just as well.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier high end Panny and went to replace before this model. There really was no difference in the product. The ES-LA93 is an improvement and the shave possible is as close to a razor as you would find; closer to my dear Braun Series 7 razor! :(     The Braun is quite nice but not as close as the four blade ES; better than the 3 blade Panny in the past.     The cleaning system for Braun is FAR superior in my opinion to the Panny in terms of the length of cycles, use of electricity and the lack of fragrance of the finished product that may appeal to Panny users although I do like the lemon fragrance of the Braun cleaner.       My thoughts on two remarkable products that have been going \\&quot;head to head\\&quot; for a few years now.</li>
    <li> This shaver is NOT made in China, as one reviewer inaccurately stated. It&#x27;s made in Japan and is clearly marked on the shaver and on the box. Big Difference! I bought this shaver based primarily on the reviews that I read. I have been using it for approximately three months now and am very happy with my purchase. I am 35 yoa and have been using a blade for the majority of my life, though I do have some experience with various electric shavers. Compared to other electrics that I have used, this Panasonic blows them out of the water. It basically shaves as close as a blade, though it does its very best work when used daily. It doesn&#x27;t punish you for taking three days off from shaving by pulling at your hair, but it does take a couple more passes to get everything. When used daily, however, it works like a dream and I can completely shave in under 4 minutes.     Ergonomically, it feels great in your hand and against your face. I&#x27;ve primarily used it dry, but it can be used with shaving gel/cream and in the shower. It took a little getting used to after being accustomed to using a blade, but after just a few shaves it felt very natural. The quality of the shave is outstanding. I&#x27;ve used the self-cleaning base several times and it works great. The key is to follow the instructions in the User&#x27;s Manual. Change the cleaning solution at the appropriate time and you should never have a problem. I noticed that one reviewer criticized the base unit because it was too loud. That seems ridiculous to me. Just set it and let it clean as you&#x27;re leaving for work if you don&#x27;t like the noise (it&#x27;s really not that loud anyway).     With this shaver, I actually enjoy shaving again. I&#x27;ve had absolutely no skin irritation or razor burn from the shaver. I absolutely love this product and I think it&#x27;s worth every penny. Plus, I got a GREAT deal on it from amazon. The side burn trimmer is not super impressive, but I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver that had a great side burn trimmer. They just don&#x27;t seem to cut close enough. Due to the design of the shaver itself, it actually trims up my side burns rather nicely (without having to use the side burn trimmer). I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the shaver that will meet everybody&#x27;s needs (what product could really do that anyway?), but I believe it will work very well for most people. I&#x27;m giving this Panasonic shaver a 5/5 because its one of the best products I&#x27;ve bought in recent memory. I love it and can enthusiastically recommend it.</li>
    <li> Yes.  It&#x27;s worth the money.  I replaced an old Panasonic shaver and this one is sooo much better.  Maybe just new but I don&#x27;t remember the old one shaving this well or this fast.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, to say the least about being able to get a nice truly smooth shave on my head with an electric razor.  This razor is awesome.  It shaves just as close as a bladed traditional razor, with the exception of a couple of small odd places on my scalp.  That&#x27;s no fault of the shaver, but simply the consequences of being beat about the head on occasion as a youth.   So with an extra 20 seconds of touch-up with a blade, I get a perfectly smooth head.    If you&#x27;re concerned about the razor pulling the hair out, which has always been an issue for me with electrics in the past; it would seem that they&#x27;ve sorted that problem out as well.  Not even a bit of a tug.    This is an amazing razor, worth the cost.</li>
    <li> My husband recently had stents put in &amp; was put on blood thiners, causing problems w/bleeding when shaving w/his razor. But he could never use a shaver before due to his heavy Italian beard. He was not a believer until he tried this Panasonic. This shaver is wonderful. It shaves him clean without even using lotions or creams. No more problems w/bleeding. He really loves it!  I love it because he shaves more now!Shipping was on time &amp; it was a pleasure as usual, ordering through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well as a shaver. The trimmer is almost worthless as it does not seem to be angled right for trimming sideburns. Does a nice job with wet shaving, but is apparently not very well sealed as the electronic display is failing after only 5 months. Unit has never been immersed in water, but the top segments of the display are out, apparently from moisture infiltration. This does not affect the operation or charging/cleaning, at least not yet. The cleaning cycle is noisy and seems to run very long. Overall, not a bad shaver, but there are probably better out there.</li>
    <li> Provides the best &amp; closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced from an electric razor.  I&#x27;ve historically used Philips Norelco electric razor systems, but after using this razor for one day I&#x27;m sold on the quality and results of this Panasonic unit. The only downside I can note thus far is it is relatively loud compared to the rotary type.  This was noted in previous reviews but that is a small price to pay for such a nice razor overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this maybe three times in the year I&#x27;ve had it. Not impressive and no better than any other shaver.</li>
    <li> To start, I&#x27;ve used a few different razors and electric wet/dry shavers from a many different brands.  I&#x27;ve never been completely satisfied with a shave before.  I thought when Mach 3 moved on up to 4 blades, I&#x27;d get such a better shave, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. I&#x27;ve been using an older electric shaver from Panasonic, one of the junk ones you buy for 20-30 bucks.  I read the other reviews on here and of course I was completely skeptical, being let down many times before.  The reviews looked too good to be true, but I&#x27;m thankful that my concern was ill warranted.      I just tried this thing for the first time last night.  Took it out of the package, skimmed the instructions real fast, noticed it had enough juice in it to make a run or two so I gave it a try before doing an initial charging.  After I was done, I was speechless and hairless.  It usually takes me 10 minutes to shave.  With the LA93 it only took me about 5 minutes to shave and this was only my FIRST shave with this thing.    Pros:  This thing shaves FAST.  This thing shaves CLOSER than a razor.  This thing left NO razor burn.  This thing shaves EFFORTLESSLY.  This thing is SELF cleaning.  This thing in black looks NICE.    Here I am almost 24 hrs later and I STILL feel smoother than if I had shaved with a razor.  I can now say that I found an electric shaver that I am completely satisfied with.  I had considered Braun, but I&#x27;m glad I went with Panasonic.  I&#x27;ll come back in a few months and re-review this products to let you know if I still like it.</li>
    <li> Having tired several different high-end electrics over my 40 something years I&#x27;d resolved myself to being a standard blade guy.  Every time I had to buy new blades though I&#x27;d wince because I really only got about a week out of a new blade.  Throw in that I now shave the few hairs on my head and this was a financially painful process.  I decided I would give an electric another try....the last time having been 5-10 years ago.  I read the reviews on this one, made the purchase, and WHOOO HOOO I found my solution!!!  This Panasonic does it, and does it well.  Shave wet or dry, foam or no, face or head, it is excellent.  I have been using it for over a month now and my shaves are getting even better as my beard has grown accustomed.  My only gripe (and it is a minor one) is that when charged in the cleaning unit/stand the light blinks repeatedly when it reaches full charge.  It looks like a police car is parked in my bathroom at night!  It&#x27;s tolerable, but could be better.  Believe all the good things being said about this razor and buy one.</li>
    <li> I have a very difficult beard and it is hard for me to find an electric shaver that does a good job. I have tried all of the \\&quot;best brands\\&quot; and I have found this one to be the best. It shaves me close and the charger/ cleaner unit works very well- the cleaner cycle is a little noisy but one cannot have it all I guess. I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband because he was complaining about the length of time it takes to shave every day.  He&#x27;s been using norelco rotary wet/dry shavers for over 10 years.  He prefers shaving in the shower for a closer shave.  He always spent a lot of time shaving over the same areas over and over to get all the hairs cut.  He also had a problem with a little razor burn and bumps.  After using this shaver once, he was thrilled with the close comfortable shave.  He says it shaves as close as a straight razor.  It now takes him 2 minutes to shave and he&#x27;s ecstatic with the results.  We highly recommend the shaver!  The cleaner seems to do a good job.  It&#x27;s little noisy, but we just keep it in a guest bath so we don&#x27;t notice the noise.</li>
    <li> Having used norelco shavers for 45 years I needed a change so I bought the Panasonic ES-LA93-K shaver to try. Now after 2 months I have found this the best shaver I have ever used. Being 82 years old my skin is a little loose,so I used a little EDGE to lubricate my skin and got the closes and the best  shave I ever had and no skin irritation.I would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband had one of the first self-cleaning braun electric razors and it started cutting him so we decided to get a new shaver. He doesn&#x27;t have much facial hair but does want a close shave. So far he&#x27;s pretty pleased with it and hasn&#x27;t had any irritation. It&#x27;s nice to have alternative for Norelco and Braun.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST electric razor I have ever used. I tried the major top of the line electric razors(except Panasonic) and have ALWAYS returned to the blade. I even tried a straight edge razor and that was a disaster. I looked at all the evaluations of this electric razor and decided to give it a try. It is fantastic. I always get a very blade like close shave without any irritation or rash on my neck. I have shaved both wet (shaving cream) and dry(with and without Pre-electric) and have the same enjoyable, yes enjoyable, close shave. Another plus is that you can manually clean this razor with superior clean results.   This razor is expensive but well worth the price. Amazon had the best price by far so check it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit about a month or so ago.  I&#x27;m normally a Gilette blade user, but I thought I would try a new electric shaver since I hadn&#x27;t used one in probably 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give this shaver 4 stars.  It is well made, cuts reasonably well, can manually clean and fits the hand comfortably.  So I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note.  There simply is no electric shaver that can give you as close a shave as a blade.  While this shaver does a decent job it&#x27;s not as close as a blade shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I do like the side burn attachment.  If I were to purchase this again I would probably not get this unit with its self cleaning.  I don&#x27;t know if I will ever use it.  But we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I feel an exception is due for this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have had electric razors in the past, and have overall been unimpressed. I decided to try again as I have problems with ingrown hairs and decided to try something different. When I used this product, I was amazed at how well it performed. I beleive I have a closer shave now than when I was using a regular razor. It was easy to operate, and cut a lot of hair on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note - When the razor has finished charging, I noticed that the blue led screen flashes - it can be a little annoying if you can see it outside the bathroom. Also, the cleaning cycle takes a while to perform, but it does a really good job of cleaing the head that I can live with that.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have had yet. Only used it once, dry, so i&#x27;m looking forward to using it the way i normally do, in the shower.    This is my second Panasonic shaver, the other one is also great but I wanted one for travel, as I do lot&#x27;s of it.    Only downside is the price, so if that isn&#x27;t an issue then go for it!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a Norelco for 25 years and decided to give this one a try based on claims of a closer, more comfortable &amp; longer-lasting shave. I just use a standard pre-shave lotion - nothing fancy. So far I am loving this shaver. It does a great job, is easy to clean, and gives me a much better all around shave than my Norelco, especially now after a month or so and my skin &amp; beard are becoming accustomed to the foil-type shaver. This is a precision instrument. It runs quietly and after each shave I clean it with a little handsoap gel &amp; warm water just like it says in the instuctions. No need to use the expensive cleaning cartridges that come with the charging unit. If you get one be sure to use the \\&quot;FREE\\&quot; position to allow the head to float as you shave and try it for at least a month to allow your skin &amp; beard to get used to it.</li>
    <li> After 5 years wanted to upgrade my shaver from an old Norelco Rotary.   Did a bunch of research mostly considering the Braun vs. Panasonic.   In the end the discount on this unit was too hard to pass up.       I went on a shaving strike for 4 days before using the new shaver. Doing so with my old Norelco would normally result in a painful pull fest but the Panasonic cut through with ZERO discomfort and very very close.   As this was my first shave, it took some getting used to a foil vs. rotary but after a few tries in each direction and about 2 minutes I was done.   Looking forward to trying the Wet Shave capabilities out.   But my trepidation over switching from a rotary to this foil was for naught.   This unit is cool    Easy to set up...cleaning system looks interesting (have yet to try).     A little louder than I had expected (I think this is generally true of foils)  Clean Shave... no cuts or redness.</li>
    <li> I believe that Panasonic has made a shaver that will shave as close as an electric can shave and probably as close as a blade can shave but to shave this close with the Panasonic or a blade you need to shave against the grain. For me there was a short adjustment period going from my Braun 8595 because with the different design and the larger offset head the way I hold the shaver is different.I&#x27;m 68 years old and have an average beard, not real coarse and heavy. The Panasonic ES-LA93-k gives me the best shave ever in about 3 to 4 minutes time. It does a really good job for me on my neck also. As others have said you should not apply much if any pressure and you will need to go over the hard spots more than once to get a near perfect shave. I always dry shave after my shower and use about 6 drops of  Pacific company shaving oil rubbed into my face. I&#x27;ve never tried to wet shave with an electric shaver so I don&#x27;t know if it could improve the results. I suspect that shaving shortly after a hot shower like I do would be as good. I also believe that dry shaving will make the shaver last much longer than taking it in the shower or using it with shaving cream. I&#x27;ve only used the cleaning system twice so far and it does an excellent job but it is noisy  and about the same as my Braun. No big deal unless someone is sleeping nearby.For those who have good quality tap water I would recommend saving the money and buying the the model without the cleaning station. I have hard well water so I use distilled water in my cleaning station. I have kept my Braun and use it to preshave my lip area under the nose which makes it easier to use the Panasonic against the grain there. All things considered this is the best shaving product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used non-electric razors on my beard and I&#x27;ve never been bald or balding, until recently.  Due to cancer treatment I started losing my hair in clumps.  Needless to say, that was Not a good look!  I decided to try an electric to handle both my head and my beard.  I hadn&#x27;t even tried an electric (in the last few decades).....         I did some research, read many Amazon reviews, and decided on the Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s Shaver.  It is a bit spendy, but worth every penny.  I&#x27;d say my beard and hair are medium in weight and thickness, and it makes very short work (so to speak) of my beard, as well as the hair on my head.    After it arrived, I first tried it on my beard for a couple of days to see if it was going to be workable, or going back in the box...  From the first pass of the razor I could tell.  This was the answer!  Close, comfortable, and handles nicely in either hand.  I cut most of the hair on my head with my Remmington beard trimmers, then used the Panasonic to shave.  Oh, and all this was done in dry mode.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and irritation free this razor leaves my head and my beard.    Shaving one&#x27;s head for the first time ever in January, in northern climes, is clearly not ideal.  This razor made it exceedingly easy.  I do a touch up every day, and it usually takes me around 4 to 5 minutes for both head and beard.  I know this because it tells me how many minutes it has just been used for, as well as what percentage of charge is left.  Handy.       This product far exceeded my expectations and I could Not be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking it would cut really close.  I didn&#x27;t and for that reason I&#x27;m disappointed.  Axel</li>
    <li> I bought this product in Okinawa Japan, about 7 months ago.  This product works great for African American with sensitive skin.  I have always been hesitant about putting a razor blade to my skin for fear of PFB (pseudofolliculitis barbae) but if I wanted my skin to be \\&quot;buttery soft\\&quot; or \\&quot;baby bottom\\&quot; like, then I had to bunker down and get&#x27;er done with a razor. I also knew that in about 3 days my face would look like the back of a Mr. Goodbar (take a glance next time you eat one...) With this one you can still get that feel without the candy bar reference (haha). After doing a thorough review while in Okinawa of this product I finally broke down and bout it ($280 US)  I must say that it was the best buy hands down of 2010 for me personally.  If you are an African American male looking for a close shave with no residual pain (PFB) this will work for you.  If you need the extra protection couple this item with Bump Patrol shave gel and after shave lotion.  Its a win win...I&#x27;m gonna go and eat a Mr. Goodbar now, I just made myself hungry!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving!!</li>
    <li> The shaver works great; however, as others have reported, the Cleaning/Charging module has a defective design. 6 weeks after my purchase, the red status light came on. I followed all of the cleaning instructions and replaced the cartridge. I repeated this process 3 times but the red status light remained on, which disenables the unit&#x27;s cleaning cycle. I called Panasonic. The CSR just read from the book and then told me to send the unit back at my expense. I asked for a supervisor who agreed to email me a prepaid mailing label but guess what?.........it&#x27;s been 2 days and no label yet. Just for the heck of it, I ran the DRY cycle and after it completed, the status light went out. I then ran the cleaning cycle this morning, and it seems to be working. UPDATE-6 MONTHS LATER: Cleaning unit kept failing and now the red status light is always on despite my cleaning efforts. I&#x27;ve been trying to get a response out of customer service with no success other than \\&quot; the appropriate department will get back to you\\&quot;. Despite the cleaning unit problems, the shaver does work well.</li>
    <li> Never have my shaves been so close and actually enjoyable. The shaver massages your face a bit and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair grows in more evenly now. The self cleaning system works flawlessly. Definately highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp and comfortable. The best electric shave ever  and I am extremely critical regarding shaving. I use shave gel or  lather, then sometimes touch up with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews of this product, I guess I got my hopes up. I&#x27;ve been looking for an electric razor that would at least give me a decent shave. Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t it. I read the literature that came with the shaver and gave it the time necessary to \\&quot;acclimate\\&quot; from razor to electric shaver shaving. After shaving with this razor for about 3 weeks, I have gone back to using shaving cream and razor. I thought that (because of the PRICE) and the reviews, that I would be able to use this shaver as my primary shaving tool. I was wrong. One of the reviews stated that once you started shaving with this shaver, you&#x27;d never go back to a blade....WRONG!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shaver.  I have shaved with Braun for many years and Norelco before that for several years.  This is the closest to a blade I have ever felt.  Especially after a few months, when I decided to try wet shaving with shaving cream.  The shave feels just like a blade shave, without all the problems I had with blades.  Plus, with the Bruan, a shave took 5 to 7 minutes, going over and over the same areas, since the beard on my neck runs all different directions.  With this one, my average shave it about 3 minutes.  Only issue I had was that the hydrocleaner kept clogging up and leaving the shaver standing in a half inch of water, not finishing its cycle.  So I eventually just got rid of the cleaner base  and now I just use the method in the instruction manual -- run the shaver under the faucet for a few seconds (not plugged in of course) and then pull off the screen and run a little more water to catch stray hairs, blow or shake off excess water, cap it and let it dry on the shelf.  Works great, and now I won&#x27;t have to constantly buy the hydro refills.  The manual discussed a \\&quot;turbo clean\\&quot; mode where you put some hand soap on the screen and hold the on button for two seconds and it goes into a turbo mode (you can hear the difference) and the shaver puts a little icon on the screen when it wants that cleaning.  But just running it under the water for a few seconds (screen on) seems to clean it pretty well.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the Panasonic hydro-clean solution anyway, not as nice as the Braun.  But when I think of what I spent over the years buying those CCR2 refils for the Bruan, one per month, just using the tap water is appealing.  So I still give it five stars because the clogging hydrocleaner made me realize it was unnecessary.  The blow dryer isn&#x27;t necessary either; it&#x27;s all stainless steel and nothing is going to rust.  Love this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Feels close as a blade to me.     I should qualify by stating that I&#x27;ve primarily used lower end Norelco electrics up to this point, so I can&#x27;t really compare this to any high end electric shavers. However, I can&#x27;t imagine a better one than this!</li>
    <li> ... It is absolutely idiotic that the led panel flashes forever after it&#x27;s done charging. All night I see a flash coming from my bathroom every few seconds. How freaking stupid.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin, and I can&#x27;t use a conventional razor more than twice a week without my skin to bleed from everywhere.  In time I tried one Braun electric shaver (9 years ago), and I followed instructions. Result wasn&#x27;t near what I wanted: just after shaving, I felt like I didn&#x27;t shave for the last two days.  Then I tried a Philips (rotary), and I found it painful and not doing quite the job.    This one is very expensive. I checked a lot of reviews about electric shavers before buying. The first week, it was okay, but not the result I wanted, specially on the neck. I continued because I felt it was getting better everyday. And after a mont, I can say I am pleased! It&#x27;s a fabulous thing to always be shaved, everyday. The buy of the year in my case!    Notes: It is strongly suggested to use shaving cream for the first 3 weeks, and I did. Now I can use it no problem no cream. Easier because I have a mirror! I got to cut myself at Adam&#x27;s apple a few times though...  Also, I find that if you are not using for a couple of days, the next shaving won&#x27;t be as good as if you are using it everyday.</li>
    <li> In my 61 years, I&#x27;ve shaved once with an electric ... and was very irritated. The instructions say to shave for three weeks with lather and then try dry shaving. I had a four-day-old beard when it arrived and so I thought I&#x27;d put it to the test. I shaved dry as soon as it was charged and the shave was painless and very close -- about 95% as good as the Gillette Mach III that I always use. With lather on a one-day beard, it will probably be as close. I noticed that with an electric, you have to go over and over an area to get all the hairs cut. With a blade, it&#x27;s once only. So it takes about twice as long to shave. I&#x27;m very happy with this (really expensive) shaver.</li>
    <li> I will add to the 5 star reviews because it is an amazing piece of technology. My skin is as soft as if I shaved with a straight edge.   Its comfortable to hold and feels solid. I have super sensitive skin and did not irritate at all.   It took me 5 minutes to get everything but I did which is more than I can say about my old Braun 8995,  which I I&#x27;ve had for 7 years. The Braun was a very good but always left behind a few of my neck hairs.   It was also not nearly as close of a shave as the LA93. Ive never owned a wet/dry shaver before and within a day I cant Imagine using a dry only model.   The only thing I am not crazy about is the Vortex cleaning station&#x27;s dry cycle.   It can take an hour or more to dry which is double the time of the Braun&#x27;s cleaning stations whole cleaning cycle.   They should have used a combination of mild heat and a fan.   Other than that everything else about the LA93 is top notch if Panasonic keeps innovating like this I might have to stick with the brand until they fall off. Hands down the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is a very well balanced, easy to use shaver. It is comfortable to hold and easy to clean. Overall it is the best  razor I have ever owned. I&#x27;m very impressed, it gives a really close shave, and in my opinion equals any blade. I&#x27;m very, very happy with this purchase, certainly value for money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about 1 year now. When I originally saw this shaver on the Men&#x27;s Health awards for best electric razor I was intrigued. I had always found electric razors to be clunky, noisy, and inefficient. The reviews came out for this product and they were rave! I was getting very excited about a shaver that I may enjoy using every day. I dropped the cash and haven&#x27;t looked back.  The Dock: Amazing how far technology has come since my father&#x27;s era of safety razors. A rechargeable, self cleaning, self drying razor with a digital display. The dock performs two functions, cleaning/drying, and charging. This makes it very easy to maintain a clean razor that is free of oils, hair, etc. After a shave one simply puts the shaver in the dock, presses one button and the rest is history. There are cleaner packs which must be changed every 30 shaves, but these can be purchased very cheap here on Amazon; $9.99 USD for a 3 pack (that is 90 shaves for $10).    The Shaver: The machine itself is easy on the eyes. It&#x27;s shape is attractive without being too futuristic and gaudy. It inspires confidence in the grip whether holding it right side up or up side down. The head has a wide swivel range and with only small adjustments to my shaving angles it performed dry as well as any traditional razor with cream that I had ever used. The motor in here is incredibly strong, smooth, and quiet. I can&#x27;t remember the figure off hand but I think the motor revs to 14,000 RPMs, which is 3-5k higher than other razors. After coming from a Wal-mart $80 electric razor this thing was like driving a Ferrari after being stuck in a Toyota for years. It completely changed my opinion of electric razors.  The Shave: Smooth, very close, and with little to no irritation. With the dexterous head there is no place on my jaw line that it fails to cope with. Someone else had complained about the upper lip, but the confidence this shaver gives me I have never had a problem getting a perfectly smooth shave beneath the nose.   The End: You cannot go wrong with this shaver in my opinion. If you are looking to get out of your current electric razor this one is worth the scratch. The price may be up there but it is absolutely worth the money. If you are currently shaving with a traditional razor this may be more of a step out of your comfort zone, but this guy at least can say it was the best personal hygiene choice he has made since switching to solid stick deodorant.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews here and on other sites.  I replaced my Braun Synchro shaving system with this and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The Braun would lose effectiveness quickly and never gave me a close shave.  I didn&#x27;t realize how radically better my shaving experience could be until I bought the Panasonic.      The ability to quickly get a clean shave and the ease of clean up are my favorite things about this product. After I finish shaving I pop the foil off and run the cutter under the faucet while running, and rinse the foil.  I then put the shaver back together and into the cleaning unit.  It gives the shaver a quick clean and dries and charges.  Simple.    The built in display is annoyingly bright at night, and blinks every second if you&#x27;ve completed a cleaning cycle in the base unit.  I tip the shaver off the contacts to stop the light.  That&#x27;s my only beef with the design.      Great product!</li>
    <li> Hopefully this review helps for those of us who are beard challenged.      This was my first real electric shaver ever.  I have always used razors.  So perhaps this might be a bias review but I will get further into it.  I started to use it, and after the 2nd or 3rd shave, it started to cause cuts and nicks.  I didn&#x27;t like that and perhaps its just my beard/skin.  I decided to return it and received a refund (hence the 3 stars).</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver, as a bit of a guess. I read a review, and thought I would give it a try.  Wow, it was fun setting it up, and then the shave. It was great, the dry shave was nice, but the wet shave was awesome.   I stood in the shower, and enjoyed a smooth shave, almost like a razer.    The closeness was as close as a razer. It was easy and you can do it even when you are half asleep.  It has cut down my shaving time and can be done anywhere.    I just love this unit.</li>
    <li> My husband has had this since Christmas and he is still not sure about an electric shaver. He has always been a razor man and the reason I got it for him is because he has such a tough beard growth that it is wearing out his T shirts and sweat shirt collars. He needs to shave everyday and I thought an electric razor would do the trick.......I guess time will tell!  It gets the close shave but he is just having a hard time getting use to it.</li>
    <li> Very close shave, had other shavers in the passed Like this one much better. Dont shave much in the shower, nice to know you could if you wanted too.  Like the cleaner very easy to use it even drys it. only had for 2 mounth so far so good</li>
    <li> Braun to Gillette and yes prior Panasonic.  This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used.  In the shower it&#x27;s as close as a blade.  Dry comes VERY close.  For me,  the cleaning system is a waste.  The pop up trimmer is a little awkward for nose and ear trimming.  If it gives me years of use, I&#x27;ll always buy another.</li>
    <li> Had this shaver about 2 weeks now and on a scale of 1-5 this shaver is a 10!  Every few years I buy a new shaver and have tried ever shaver imaginable.  THIS is by far the best electric razor on the planet.  I bought it ONLY because of the reviews and had every intention of returning it.  Only in the last few days did I actually open up the cleaning solution and started to use the self clean mode, which is excellent by the way.      Every few years I try a new shaver and always seem to go back to Norelco because its the lest irritating.  3 years ago I bought the top of the line Braun foil shaver and it was miserable experience.  My face is very sensitive with very fine and thick hairs on my beard.  The Braun&#x27;s motor was not strong enough and felt like it plucked out my hairs, giving me ingrown hairs, rash and after 2 months small part of the foil broke giving me deep scratches all over my face. Put the Braun in my drawer and bought a top of the line Norelco.  Norelco is OK, quiet, but just doesn&#x27;t shave that close.      Saw the new Norelco 1280x, was going to buy it but thought I give the Panasonic a try because of the great reviews.  This Panasonic is AMAZING!!!  It is by far the fastest and most COMFORTABLE shaver I ever had.  If your a Norelco/Rotary shaver make the switch to the Panasonic ES-LA93.  The Ultra Fast 14,000RPM motor, vibrates (pulsates)lifting your beard, giving you an incredible close and comfortable shave.  Thought this was just a gimick but it really works and works amazingly.  I shave in 1/2 the time of my old norelco and without irritation.  Only 2-3 passes of each area and you are done.  Wet shave is amazing to but I really prefer a dry shave.  Dry shave is faster and just as close.     Don&#x27;t let the big head on this bad boy intimidate you, it functions so perfectly, cuts down shaving time and easily gets every hard to reach spot (ex: under nose, neck etc...).  First thing you will notice is how quiet this shaver is (compared to my old Braun).Then the power, like have a Ferrari in your hand.  Even after 2 days it easily shaves my beard without breaking a sweat. The motor doesn&#x27;t even slow down.  It is so quiet, smooth and gentle I had to keep feeling my face to confirm it was actually shaving my beard.  The closeness is amazing and gets better the more you use it (and get comfortable with the shaver).         I have only 2 complaints.  1. When charging it has an annoyingly BRIGHT, blue LED light that blinks.  This light is so bright you might have a Jet land in your bathroom.  2. is the side burn trimmer is a little small (and close to the shaver).  Still functions fine but would be perfect if it was an inch or 2 longer.    SUMMARY:  The Panasonic ES-LA93 is hands down the best shaver out there.  If you are a Norelco guy (like I was) do yourself a favor and try this.  You will never look back.  The Panasonic shaves just as close as a blade and is way more comfortable.  The self cleaning feature is like having a new shaver every day.  Nice thing is replacement blades are $17 which is very reasonable, compared to 38-50+ for Norelco or Braun.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard. I shave once a day. The closest shave I get is with a Mach 3, but sometimes I get cuts or irritation. I tried a different foil electric shaver in the past, but found that it took longer per shave than with a Mach 3, I still got the same amount of irritation, and the shave was no where near as close.    This shaver is much better than my last. It shaves closer, but still not baby smooth. My shaving time seems to be around 3 minutes and 30 seconds (it has a timer that tells you how long you shaved for). It irritates a lot less though, and can be used dry or wet (I seem to get better results dry).    Only problem is it often misses a lot of hairs around the lower neck area, which means going over and over that spot in different directions to try and get them all, and this leads to irritation. Sometimes no matter how many times I go over that area, there are some hairs it just can&#x27;t get. I&#x27;m almost tempted to use a razor to finish the job, but I&#x27;m trying to just get used to it.    The cleaning base does a good job, although it takes about half an hour, and can be a little loud in a quiet house (goes on an off).    All in all it&#x27;s a good shaver, and I&#x27;ll stick with it, but it&#x27;s not a revolutionary product. There&#x27;s pros and cons compared to a Mach 3 shave, and cost adds up to more or less the same in the long run.    UPDATE: I gave up on the cleaning base. It&#x27;s too loud, takes too much space, takes too much time, and starts to smell after a while. Just rinse the thing under a tap and rub some soap on it now and then. Easier, takes less time and doesn&#x27;t clutter the bathroom. If you can, just buy the model without the base and save some cash.</li>
    <li> I have skin allergies, and face shaving was always like a torture for me. Using traditional blades or cheap machines did not help at all. I could shave at most with two weeks intervals, since my skin was severely irritated.    However, after buying this product, my problem with face shaving is solved! It gives a very close shave with near-zero irritation! This is the machine I was looking for very long time. I am very pleased with its minimum irritation property. Its battery life and usability are also perfect.    I strongly recommend this product, especially with the people with sensitive skin. It worth its price.</li>
    <li> The shaver is better than most but doesnt work as well on certain spots or angles especially in the neck areas and the angle of the neckline to the jaw. For the amount of money I paid I expected it to be more thorough. Also you can get razor burns if you press too hard on a particular spot it hasnt taken care of.</li>
    <li> I have been a Philips users for the past 10 years but i have never had a close a shave than what my new shaver offers me! Great product. So easy to use and maintain.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed easily, so this shaver was a wonderful surprise.    I am a long time user of Panasonic shavers, this one replaces a failed ES8168 I purchased in 2007 (ES8152 in 2004, and ES8003 in 2002 - still works today).  Have used the last two daily in the shower - always followed by razor, as it was never close enough.  Same was true with the Norelco I had before these, the only other close shave was from a Braun, but it was not a wet/dry shaver and was cord only.    Today was the first time ever that I did not need to use the razor touch-up! very clean shave and no irritation what so ever.    Actually I was not going to purchase another Panasonic, after the horrid experience I had with their customer service getting the last one repaired (display stopped working a couple of months after the purchase), but the limited choices in wet/dry shavers led me back to the ES-LA93-K, and I am glad I gave it a try.  Aside from its slick look, it is comfortable to hold, and is by far the best electric shaver I have ever owned.    So lets hope this keeps working, and I do not have to call their support again ;^)</li>
    <li> I know they all claim to shave as close as a blade and most dont but the Panasonic ES-LA93-K really does. This shaver is a joy to use easy to clean and very mild on sensitive skin. Great value at the amazon price</li>
    <li> I had been using a Gillette Fusion manual razor for about 3 years, and I suppose it worked just fine. It would cut pretty closely, but always give me razor burn no matter what I did to prevent it. I felt like I needed to switch to something that wouldn&#x27;t keep hurting my skin. I did a lot of shopping, and a lot of review reading here on Amazon. My brother had recommended the [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]], which he owns. I tried it out, liked it, but felt like I could find something better...enter the Panasonic ES-LA93-K. This thing got really great reviews, and even got the Good Housekeeping \\&quot;Seal of Approval\\&quot;, all of which meant nothing to me. I had to try it. It was on sale for about $175 + a mail in rebate, so I bought it. I have to admit, this thing seems like a beast at first. It has it&#x27;s own massive box, full of documentation, Vortex cleaning/charging dock, power cable, case, and even a nice hard plastic cap to protect the foil. I took it out, charged it up (charging is FAST, and you never need to worry about ruining the battery by leaving it plugged in, it shuts down once it reaches 100%), and took my first dry shave. If you&#x27;ve never done a dry shave with an electric razor before, you should probably start with a wet shave. This thing is great, the wet shave feels really nice, cleans up easily, and really reduces irritation. The first 40 days with this razor were the most difficult for me. One day, my face just got completely irritated, and bright red; which made for an extremely uncomfortable weekend. But, this thing will give the closet shave ever...it&#x27;s ridiculous how great it is. After those first 40 days, the zones of my face that used to get REALLY red and irritated, no longer do. The cleaning station works extremely well, and I use it every day, with no problems. I think the cartridge should last a little longer than one month, using it every day. I cannot give this razor more than 5 stars, but I would.</li>
    <li> Happy with the: speed of the motor, shaving time, closeness, shaver info, no added hair/razor bumps, over all feel after shaving, and it does what is stated.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace an older Braun model and the difference was immediate. I noticed a much closer shave right away. The previous complaints about the bright LED light are correct but there is an easy fix if the shaver is in your bathroom, which it most likely is, just close the door.     It also takes a while for the cleaning system to run but that is not a big deal for me.     I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a well engineered product. This has been the only electric razor, I&#x27;ve owned so far, that would cleanly cut the stubble on the neck. Another plus it&#x27;s very smooth and quiet and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> For a baseline, see my review of the 8078 this replaced [...]. After nearly five years, the batteries on the 8078 gave up and forced me to buy a new shaver.    By the time the this puppy arrived, I had a week of growth on my head and beard. I figured this would be a good test, and my first shave was dry with LectricShave pretreatment. The shaver went to town, leaving smooth skin on the sides of my head (where hair grows) and getting the elusive few that try to annoy me on the top. It did the same with my beard, and left no irritation on either the normal skin or the skin that had radiation treatment.  I rinsed the head by dunking it in hot water halfway through to clear an appreciable amount of hair, and when I continued I was surprised to find that the wet foil didn&#x27;t tug on my skin like the 8078 would when wet. I&#x27;m guessing that this is attributable to the vibrating head.     Since the first shave, I&#x27;ve done completely dry shaves, my normal wet shaves with Edge cream and dry with Billy Jealousy lightening bolt pre-electric lotion as well. Dry is satisfactory with and without pre-lotion, but most comfortable with lightening bolt.  My favorite is still to shave in the shower with plenty of Edge.     The shape is definitely different from the old Panasonic, and the head is designed to allow drainage on the top and bottom. The older one had no such drainage and I have found that if I hold the shaver in a way that prevents draining, I have to work harder. This is not a big issue because the head can go 20 degrees or so in every direction, but it took some getting used to.    If you&#x27;re switching to electric, I don&#x27;t think this will have the curve that less expensive shavers have, but if you&#x27;re not thrilled on day one give it a few weeks.    I have a mix of thick beard on my chin and under my substantial nose, thin beard with sensitive skin that was radiated in the 1980s on my cheeks, moderate hair on the sides of my head and only a few stalwart survivors guarding the top. I have yet to need an aftershave.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband in the military and he said its the best shaver he has ever used. He can use it everyday and not get any razor burn like with other razors electric or not. Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, I have curly beard and I use this product to help control bumps and ingrown hairs. First I heat my face with hot water then apply an oil or skin cream I shave through this oil. The oil barrier leaves me a decent shave but not so close that hairs get caught under the skin. It cleans easily in the shower. I also use it for a touch up shave by shaving dry but applying minimal pressure, just barely touching the skin and I have been successful wiith this method as well but remember that the technique is partially hand talent.&lt;br /&gt;Downside,  so far it does get every hair so a little touch is required every other shave, especially under the nose&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line,I got more than my $ worth, it makes my life easier and convenient , you can shave almost anywhere</li>
    <li> I choose this shaver because it has 4 heads for a closer shave.  It contours to your face and neck.  I like the lock on the power switch.  It has a sleek style and the blue LED&#x27;S are attractive.  This is my 2nd Panasonic and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic ES-LA93-K Arc 4 Mens Electric Shaver two and a half years ago for my father. He says the razor is terrific and does a great job on his face...that one finally petered out (we couldn&#x27;t get it to accept a charge anymore, and couldn&#x27;t manage to open the unit to try to clean the contacts as shown on you-tube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought the exact same one for him again. Usually a stoic and not particularly expressive man, when I asked him if he liked his new shaver he showed it the same respect and dare I say love that he holds only for Hersey bars (no almonds) and mashed potatoes with a hearty, &amp;#34;do I ever!!&amp;#34;.:-)</li>
    <li> Only one year was used this product and the starter is not working.&lt;br /&gt;Worse product ever</li>
    <li> Have tried top line Norelco, Braun and this Panasonic. Norelco shaves very well but irritates the skin under chin and neck, Braun takes long time to get a good shaving, but fortunately both companies accept return. Eventually I bought this Panasonic, that is double the price of my previous Panasonic model and shaves worse.</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrific shaver.  It is by far the best electric shaver I have ever owned.  I cannot praise it enough, it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this 1 year ago and just think why I didn´t bought this early.      Now I spend 3 minutes shaving myself, it´s increable fast, confort and safe.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my husband.   Package arrived on time, no problem.  First day Shaver worked fine, Cleaning unit did not clean, only dried the shaver.  Constant flashing red light.  Called Panasonic customer service.  They were poorly trained and not knowledgeable about their product.  First, told my husband that he needed to replace the cleaning cartridge - it was brand new out of the box packaging! .   Then he was told to send, at his cost, the entire unit, shaver, cleaning unit, etc., back to Panasonic customer service center for evaluation and then they would decide whether to fix, replace or send a refurbished one with 2-4 weeks.    We said NO.  Thank goodness for easy Amazon return policy.  Returning it to Amazon for refund.  Husband is going back to Braun.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver ever. Tried Braun 4 years ago and changed for Panasonic ES8249. At that stage, the Panasonic shaved closer than a Gilette Fusion with less irritation. I wanted to upgrade to get a full floating head.  Wet feature is great. Shaves closer under the shower!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for almost 30 years now, so I won&#x27;t go into the discussion on shaving quality. Let&#x27;s just say that shaving performance has gradually improved throughout the years. Instead, I will point out a few features that have changed with recent models:    Improvements:     -Sliding lock for power button. This is a much needed feature for travel. With prior Panasonic shavers it has happened twice that I&#x27;ve gone on a long trip (without bringing the charger) only to find that the shaver accidentally has started in the luggage and run the battery empty.  -The cradle automatically handles charging. You do not need to manually enable charging by pressing a button on the cradle.    Set backs:    -The razor has a very bright blue light that blinks when charging is complete. This is the way it was in previous models (e.g. ES8168) and this is perfectly fine when charging was manually instigated like in previous model. However, the new ES-LA93 cradle automatically handles charging, which means the blue light blinks every day and night. Totally useless and irritating. This blinking is clearly a remnant of previous models and it is an oversight of Panasonic to leave it this way. Needs to be fixed in next version!  -The razor cannot stand on its edge like in the picture. The edge is rounded. You have to lay down the razor. Consequently I always want to store it in the cradle and as a result I am punished with the blinking light. I think this is the first Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve owned that does not let me store it in upright position.    Missing feature:    -No way to make the cradle default to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; mode. I prefer to clean the razor with hand soap after each shave (as described in the manual, and as I have been doing for 30 years). Then I put it in the cradle to dry. Every time I need to press the button to set the cradle to dry mode. Why can&#x27;t this be automatic? This is how I use the cradle - it should be possible to \\&quot;configure\\&quot; it to do my desiredevery day action automatically. I remove the shaver from the cradle to shave, then I clean it after each use, when I put it in the cradle it should know to start drying automatically.     All in all this new shaver did not meet my high expectations. The ES-8168 was a great shaver and the ES-LA93 only marginally improves things while it adds a couple of new annoyances. Two minor software fixes (disable blinking light and add cradle auto dry) would have made this a 5-star review.    Update: It appears the blinking light annoyance is fixed in the new 5-blade ES-LV81 model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the ES-LA93-K for the past 6 weeks. I&#x27;m a long time electric shaver user (20+ years), having used various models in the past - Philips rotary, and several Braun foil models (most recent was the Braun Activator series). This Panasonic is my first wet/dry shaver, and I have to say that it offers the closest and most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced from an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many reviews for this shaver (mainly positive which led me to purchase mine), not wanting to be repetitive but I&#x27;ll just share some of my experiences &amp; observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Shaver: not as huge as it appears in the images, and not too heavy, fit my hand just right after a short (2-3 day) &#x27;getting used to&#x27; period. The head is on the large side, and took some getting used to / maneuvering for some areas (under nose), but still doable. The nice thing is that the head pivots on 2 axises (side to side, front and back), this is what sets it apart from single axis shavers - it follows the contours of the neck, chin &amp; jawline really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil is very smooth, and glides with hardly any resistance, catching pretty much everything in a pass or two. Even with a couple days worth of stubble (quite a bit in my case), it doesn&#x27;t pinch or snag the hairs like other models I&#x27;ve used. I find that I am taking 2 to 3 minutes less to do the job with this shaver than my Braun predecessor. As for the noise, it&#x27;s a bit more noisy than other shavers I&#x27;ve used - but the motors in this shaver are oscillating much faster than others, so I&#x27;d say it might be the higher pitch that makes it seem louder, it&#x27;s a trade off for an exceptionally close shave. The wet shave / clean feature is a great thing to have. LCD screen is intuitive, showing total shave time, battery level and cleaning indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is on the smallish side, and due to the placement / head size is hard to maneuver in tight spots. The charging / cleaning base isn&#x27;t overly large, but I am really disappointed in the cleaning time (and noise) compared to my old Braun. The cleaning / drying cycle is 3 hours, and the base uses an annoying fan to dry the shaver. Braun&#x27;s Activator base was silent (and much faster), using an inductive heater to dry. It&#x27;s much faster (and silent) to just wet clean this shaver with a drop of hand soap, and pop the foil off to rinse and let it air dry...no need for the charging base. Another nuisance mentioned by others is the LCD screen flashes bright blue every 2 seconds when it&#x27;s plugged in (or in the base) to indicate full charge. It&#x27;s like an annoying flashing nightlight...a simple LED indicator or unlit LCD would have been perfectly adequate to know when the thing was charged. I would have preferred a rigid travel case for this than the soft pouch they included - to better protect the shaver when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this offers an exceptionally close &amp; comfortable shave (which is why I bought it); and despite having some design quirks, the pros clearly outweighed the cons in my book.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver from Amazon with the included cleaning/charging base.   Background: I am a life long blade shaver and up until recently used the Mach 5 Fusion battery powered razor. I have a coarse, moderately thick beard. I never feel I get a very close shave with my blade razor after a \\&quot;normal shave\\&quot;. I usually shave in the shower. If I want a really close shave for a wedding, pictures etc, I usually shave normally with the grain, then reapply shaving cream (Billy Jealousy Hyroplane)and then shave AGAINST the grain. This gives me a very close shave at the expense of significant irritation the next day or two. I have been trying to find a way to get a close have so I don&#x27;t look like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 1pm...  My father purchased a Braun 7 series electric razor on a whim. I tried it for 2 days when he was visiting and really liked how well it shaved. It is a relatively small shaver and a bit noisy. It does not give very good feedback as to when you are picking up left over hairs (some shavers you can hear as they cut extra hairs, the braun, it is just always loud).  I was going to purchase the Braun since I liked how it shaved, but it is a dry shave only, not water proof. I stumbled upon the Panasonic while I was researching razors and decided to give it a try.  Initially, I was a little disappointed. I didn&#x27;t think it shaved quite as close as I remembered the Braun shaving, but memories can be deceiving...I was also taken back as to how big the shaver head was. Some reviews on here say it really isn&#x27;t as big as it looks in the pictures...baloney...it is every bit as big as it looks which makes it more challenging than the Braun the save the mustache area.  I was about to return the razor, when my dad visited again and I did a blind test with my wife and father. I shaved half my face with each razor for 2 minutes and had them compare. They both felt the Panasonic side was just a bit smoother. I felt the same way...  THEN, I decided to try it in the shower since that was the real reason I went Panasonic (I had not tried wet shaving for the first couple of weeks just to get used to the razor...) EUREKA! The Panasonic produced the best shave I have yet had while I was in the shower. I took a normal shower as I always do to let my beard get moist and soft. Then I applied a small amount of the Billy Jealousy Hydroplane silicone shave cream (Love this stuff). The silicone cream allows the razor to glide around your face in any direction minimizing the irritation and pulling and allowing you to go over areas in multiple directions to get more hairs. I shave between 3 and 4 minutes and get a great shave. The razor is then easy to clean in the shower too. I rarely use the cleaning station (hot tip, if you will wet shave most of the time, save the $$ and get the razor without the cleaning station).  Overall, I really like the razor now that I have used it for several weeks and started using it in the shower. It gets my beard closer than a blade but does leave a few hairs behind. I hope this improves as I use the shaver longer and my face gets used to the electric shave.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I am using Electrical shaver from past 15 years, I tried all brands but This is Gem.  Very close and easy to clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 18 months. Construction is high-quality; battery life substantial; cleaning of device with tap water is simple (I didn&#x27;t want to buy Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning tablets). Trim is effective for neck and earlobes (the stray hair). However, I was initially a bit disappointed with the razor, as it did not, for me, shave as closely as a straight razor (my razor of choice was a Fusion). Once I discovered that I could make a 2 minute and 30 second pass with the Panasonic, followed by the Fusion, I was very happy: closest, most pain-free shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Total procedure takes me 5 minutes, and there&#x27;s never any discomfort.  Some weekends I just use the Panasonic and forego the Fusion. Haven&#x27;t nicked myself in months. My wife much prefers the barber-shop closeness as well. For me this double razor system does work, even with tough to get corners and curves around jaw and neck. Review should be a 4.5 star.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have ever used. All the other&#x27;s left me with razor burn on my neck, not this one. Very pleased, was going to give up on electric razors until I tried this one.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shaver. I always used a Braun in the past and was taking a chance with this model. Shaves like&lt;br /&gt;nobody&#x27;s business an super convenient to use. The indicator tells me where to charge so I never get&lt;br /&gt;a dead shaver. Cleaner also works great. I clean every 3 days which is new to me as I have never had&lt;br /&gt;a cleaning system before. Terrific buy !</li>
    <li> High quality and inexpensive, the quality is good Panasonic shaver. The price was $145, really cheap, in China price 5800 yuan ah. Support American amazon.</li>
    <li> I used electoric shaver that has rotary blade [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]].  My beard became thicker lately, so I looked for more powerful shaver.  But, the problem is I have quite sensitive skin.  When I used razor like Gillette[[ASIN:B003983I1S Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge, 8-count Package]] , sometimes I had blood on the skin.  I searched best shaver for me on Amazon looking review, then I found Panasonic 4-blade shaver.  That&#x27;s amazing.  I don&#x27;t have enough time in the morning.  I can shave very first by 4-blade!  And shaving performance is nice.  Close shave and gentle for skin.  Sometimes I shave with shaving cream.  The shaver can be used wet &amp; dry, so I can shave even under shower!  I am satisfied with the shaver, because I had no problem on my skin so far and my thick beard were shaved comletely.  In addition, shaving speed is very first!  The motor is a little bit noisy, but the motor is equipped with linear function.  The speed is amazing.  I can stand the noise.  This is the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent electric shaver.  I used it exclusively for 5 weeks like directions say but I still break out on my neck from it.  My neck is just too sensitive combined with my heavy beard for an electric shaver. That&#x27;s why I put 4 and not 5 stars.  I thought it might be the one to let me give up blades but guess it not.  This shaver does better than any I&#x27;ve every tried and it does give a good shave but I can&#x27;t handle the sore skin on the neck.  I like the self-cleaning feature too &amp; the razor tells you when it needs to be cleaned and how much of a charge remains.  I still use it some on weekends when I don&#x27;t have to have the neck quite a closely shaved or for a quick touch up in the evening sometimes as well.  The technology is amazing and I would recommend it for anyone that needs a replacement for an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Just to give a bit of background I&#x27;m coming from a braun 790. I love electric shavers for there ease of use and little cleanup time. This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s much faster then my braun. After one full pass just about all of the stubble was gone and all that was left was the small rough stuff. All together it took 3:30 to get through my first shave, the following shaves have been a bit quicker. The thing that amazed me the most is the lack of irritation that this shaver gives. I have sensitive neck skin that would always redden up with my braun but not so with the panasonic. overall I would recommend this to any guy that wants the best electric shaver you can get. Simply incredible.</li>
    <li> I have a really tough beard, and unfortunately the shaver dont works fine with my beard, some \\&quot;hair\\&quot; still remaining after use the shaver, and its not so close than i expected, but it is just for me, with my dad works fine.</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic shaver and by far the best. Shaves closer than the previous model in half the time.  Charging base is better as well.</li>
    <li> My husband had a $60. whatever razor and i got him this top of the line Shaver and he loves it.  I can&#x27;t beleive i found such a great deal on it either. im sure this will be the last shaver he will ever have to get.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, but the cleaning base has broken on my twice, and in addition, the warranty policy of Panasonic is awful.  I bought this when my last razor was on its last legs.  When the cleaning base stopped functioning, they made me ship them the whole unit back, including the razor, sent me a refurbished, not new, unit, which took about 3 weeks all told.  I suffered using my old razor during that time.    A few weeks after receiving the \\&quot;fixed model\\&quot;, it broke again.  Again, the want me to send everything back.  I told them I could not go three weeks without the razor, I could send just the base back, send everything after I received a new model, or get a refund, that anything else was unacceptable.  They didn&#x27;t care.  I wish I had gone with Braun, this will be the last panasonic I buy. Too bad, the razor itself is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Used one of these for a few years now.  Absolutely the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve experienced, and I&#x27;ve used them all.  It does take some getting used to, though.  The huge head and the fact you don&#x27;t have to bear down on it to get a close shave were counter-intuititve to my habits from over the years with electric shavers.  For 200 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> We checked out the reviews to see if anyone used this for their heads. People said it worked great. It does NOT work great for the head. For about 1 week it works great. SO if you have 50 bucks a week to replace the heads, go for it but we don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I used the Braun Pulsonic (9595) for just shy of two years.  I never got a close shave, the trimmer broke off and had to be fixed, and finally the battery died (in less than two years).  Although the Panasonic ES-LA93 is somewhat more expensive, it is an outstanding shaver.  I shave in half the time I did with the Braun, the shave is as close as with a blade, and the shaver is lighter to hold than the Braun.  In short, it is well worth the extra expense.  The cleaning system is also easy to use.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> I have owned both the Braun 5 and 7 series, as well as many other shavers in my life and the panasonic LA93(The LA63 is exactly the same but without a cleaning station or the special contact points to use it)is by far the best, it has no problem clearing a 3-4 day beard without trimming first. It can be used with shaving cream, in the shower and it really does shave as close as a razor with minimal razor burn. My only complaint is with the cleaning solution, it is just a small cartridge filled with dry detergent that the instructions say is only good for 30 days no matter how much or how little you use it. Where as the Braun cleaning solution will sterilize your shaver, smells like a powerful cleaning solution (Like scented rubbing alchohol), and is good until it turns dark from being filled with shavings no matter how long it takes. But I guess the cleaning solution isn&#x27;t really a big deal since both the panasonic LA63 and LA93 have another cleaning option where you hold the power button down for 2-3 seconds to put the shaver into \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; or \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; mode meant only to clean the shaver(instructions warn not to shave in this mode as it could damage your skin), while in \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode you simply hold the shaver under running water and add a little hand soap. My advice would be to save a few bucks and buy the panasonic LA63 as it&#x27;s the exact same shaver as the LA93 and I&#x27;m not that impressed with the cleaning solution, besides it has the built in cleaning option. Also do a search for rebates for this and anything else you buy, I found a $30 rebate for this shaver.</li>
    <li> I have used a number of electric razors since somewhere back in the late 1960&#x27;s. Most recently I have used different models of Panasonic razors. This model gives the closest, quickest shaves I have ever experienced. I am more than happy with it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.</li>
    <li> Panasonic has really outdone themselves this time, this shaver impressed me right out of the box when i first saw the super sleek HI gloss black finish on the shaver, not only that, the shaver pretty much does everything from telling you it needs a rinse while shaving to letting you know how long you&#x27;ve just shaved for, down to the second. It comes with a travel case and charger so you dont have to take the cleaning station with you on trips.  When you&#x27;re done with a quick shave, set it in the station and press select twice to start the fan that dries your shaver or press once to start the insane cleaning process which from what i hear seems like a 10 stage process. in short, it&#x27;s AWESOME all the way around and I will never go back to razors.</li>
    <li> Shaver works well and creates a smooth shave. The shaver moves well along the face. Would definitely buy another if needed.</li>
    <li> Easily the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;For years, due to sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve shaved with electric and then followed up with a razor. I no longer have to do that. I&#x27;ve had this razor a few months and have no complaints, only praise. The cleaning process is a bit noisy, but if you put it in the cleaner before you leave for work, you&#x27;ll never be around to hear it. The auto clean works exceptionally well. The change holds well and while it&#x27;s slightly difficult to get the head between your upper lip and below your nose, it can get it done.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cartridges are fairly priced and better than an infection from the razor yuck getting in your pores.&lt;br /&gt;When this razor dies, which hopefully won&#x27;t be for a while, I will replace it with another Panasonic of this quality.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most fantastic products that I have purchased, its quality is incredible and has a lot of details, also looks great.</li>
    <li> I did not think the shaver was going to shave as good as my razor, but it is just as good or better.  I love it, best shaver I ever bought.</li>
    <li> This Arc 4 shaver does the job...but it could be better at lifting tough laying hairs that are around the jaw line and neck area. I often find myself having to touch up my jaw line and neck areas with my plug-in Andis T-Liners. Overall its a good electric shaver...I&#x27;d recommend this shaver to anyone who is in the market for a nice quality wet/dry electric shaver.</li>
    <li> All of the professionals that I have spoken with advise me to use a manual razor for the closest shave. However, with the panasonic electric razor I feel as though I get a closer shave than my gillette pro razor.</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric shaver before. I always thought that they could not shave as close as a blade, especially with my tough beard. This shaver proved me wrong. I have used it both wet and dry and I get a very close shave. It is also easy to clean (I have only used the liquid soap option with the dryer function on the charging unit). It may be a bit pricey but with the convenience, portability, and close shave I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this in October 2010.  Disclaimer-- I have seriously thick hair and it grows in a swirl pattern at the jawline.  Shaving takes me 15 minutes for a good job, with a blade, it&#x27;s messy. So I bought this after reading the reviews.  For most people, I think you get a good shave, while it works.  For me, it was no better than the blade, but without the cuts.  However, it didn&#x27;t justify the price.  Then came, the cleaning and replacing costs which are obscene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the battery progressively wore out along with the LED screen.  This week, it completely died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have replaced it with the Phillips Norelce 1290. So far It&#x27;s an improvement over this from its day 1 performance, but not amazingly so. That said, for me and my particular shaving challenges, I thinks the broad circular heads of the Norelco is a better system.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good shaver.  It gets close, especially if you take it into the shower and use shaving cream.  And cleaning it is really easy, just stick it in the charger and it cleans and dries it in about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously not as close as a non-electric, but definitely good anyway.</li>
    <li> Been using this shaver for 6 months now and have one big pro, and one big con. I have used electric shavers for 20+ years. I have always used the norelcos. I liked them, with exception of neck rash during dry climate times. This Panasonic does not do that, which is very nice. BUT, its very loud. My old razers could barely be heard, and this thing can be heard 2 rooms away. I will probably use this for a few years and then go back to the norelcos, but I do like the shave it gives. I dont use the cleaning part..just rinse it out every few uses.</li>
    <li> I just received the Braun Series 7 and the Panasonic ES-LA93-K in the mail. I originally bought the Norelco 3d but it did a terrible job of shaving my face so I sent it back. It left long hairs on my neck and it took for ever to shave. Also it irritated the heck out of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Braun Series 7 and Panasonic ES-LA93-K and they arrived at the same time. I tried both of the shavers out on the first day I got them. From the first use I loved Panasonic ES-LA93-K. It shaved my face extremely close, which is basically the only thing I care about. It did a really good on my neck as well as my face. I used some pre  shave oil and it shaved my face as close as a razor. Today I used solely Panasonic ES-LA93-K and my face is so smooth its ridiculous. I am going to give the Braun another try tomorrow by itself and compare the shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES-LA93-K is very comfortable to hold and seems like it effortlessly shaves my facial hair very close. I am in love with it. The Braun had better do a tremendous job tomorrow morning or it will be heading back.</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s 4-Blade shaver to replace my Braun 7 series that after 18 months under went product failure. I was hesitant to buy another shaver over $200. However, after reading the reviews and seeing the rating on the Panasonic ES-LA93 I was impressed. Yet,most places I looked the price was almost $400 - that is until I went to Amazon. Amazon has the shaver at 50% discount making it cheaper than the Braun 7 series I bought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the shaver for about 2 weeks. The shaves I&#x27;ve gotten are better than any razor blade or electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. Shaves are 3 min or less. Even the fine hairs on my neck are gone after one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a good ergonomic fit to my hand. It is quietier than the Braun. I like the fact you can shave wet or dry giving me the option to use shaving cream or pre-shave. Cleaning is simple - use the self-cleaner - much quieter than the Braun unit - and takes about 90 min to cycle. Or you can clean the blades with liquid soap and water, turn the shaver on for 20 sec rinse, dry and it is done! I don&#x27;t know how long the cleaning cartridge lasts since I&#x27;ve only started using the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for an electric shaver, this is the one to get. And as long as Amazon has it at the 50% or better discount it is a bargain that shouldn&#x27;t be passed up!</li>
    <li> From experience this shaver, when used with shaving cream, shaves closer and more comfortably than the Braun Pulsonic and the Norelco Arcitec competitors. The Braun did not do the neck well, and both it and the Arcitec required repeated passes over the same area to get the job done. The Arcitec did a poor job in the area immediately under the nose. The Panasonic also does a better job than the Gillette Fusion blades.  It is a cinch to clean using liquid soap as directed or by using the accompanying cleaning machine. It will do almost as well shaving dry, but then you risk the possibility of the shaver pinching the looser skin on the neck.  The only drawback is the length of the cleaning/drying cycle, which can last up to 3 hours. Just drying takes half this amount of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it...I was a drinker of the Braun\\&quot; Kool-Aid\\&quot; for over 20 years. Having been very disappointed in the fit and finish, performance, and numerous problems with my last Braun 790 (gave up on it in just under a year), I decided to try this Panasonic model.    First, the fit and finish of the Panasonic far surpassed the Braun 790 by a wide margin. I paid a hefty premium for a German \\&quot;engineered\\&quot; product that was slapped together as cheaply as possible in a Chinese sweat shop.     Having been used to the feel and handling of a Braun, the Panasonic took about 2 shaves before I was proficient with it. The Panasonic may appear bulky, but it handles incredibly well, and the ergonomic handle and articulated shaving head are an excellent combination.     The Panasonic delivers a superior shave, in my opinion, and accomplishes excellent results in fewer passes. It surpassed the closeness of a braun with a new foil and cutter block!    The cleaning features differ slightly from Braun. I actually prefer using the smaller, and more convenient Panasonic cassette system. I love the results, and in my opinion, the Panasonic system leaves the razor more clean, and leaves no cleaning solvent residue.    I personally have a beard; so if you have any concerns about the maneuverability of this razor&#x27;s cutting head, it is a non-issue.</li>
    <li> My first review of the Panasonic ES-LA93-k said that the reviews of  this Panasonic ES-LA93-K Vortex men&#x27;s shaver are true, and that it really did give the closest shave with an electric razor, and nearly as close as a safety razor.  The instructions could be a little more useful, but the shaver is great.                                                             That was my review in October 2010. It&#x27;s now July 31, 2011 and I am on my THIRD Panasonic ES-LA93.       The first two had to be returned because they stopped working.             My third Panasonic ES-LA93 has died,     just like the other two,   for no apparent reason.  It just stopped working, despite a full charge and being clean.  It doesn&#x27;t matter whether Panasonic would give me another one if I returned this one, I&#x27;m TIRED of returning them, of not having a good shaver to use, and of having to keep a backup shaver at the ready all the time.  Panasonic obviously has quality control problems here, despite Hammacher-Schlemmer&#x27;s glowing reviews which induced me to buy this shaver in the first place.  Btw, the comments about the cleaning process taking hours, and being very loud, are entirely accurate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used disposable razors my whole life and recently decided to re-visit the electric shaver market after poor experiences with the cheap stuff.  After much reading, I narrowed my choice down to Braun (top model, can&#x27;t recall #) and the Panasonic ES-LA93-K.  The Panasonic won largely in part to a special that Amazon had and I have not regretted my decision.    While it doesn&#x27;t deliver a shave as close as a razor (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible?), it&#x27;s still very, very good.  My skin is a lot happier for it too.  No burning, snags or nicks after 1 month of near daily, dry use.  A lot less messy too.  My average shave time is just over 4 minutes and the Panasonic easily cuts down 1, 2 or 3 day growth.    The base station makes maintenance a breeze.  Just drop it in, hit a button and walk away.  It gurgles, buzzes and blows it dry leaving you with a clean and charged shaver ready for the next day.  I haven&#x27;t replaced the cleaning cartridge yet, but it looks simple enough.  As with most other Panasonic products, the quality is very good and the manual is complete and readable.    Overall, I am satisfied with the Panasonic ES-LA93-K shaver and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is giving me the best shaves ever.  I have a particularly tough beard and I&#x27;ve experimented with many electric shavers over the years, always going back to a safety razor. But, I really believe the days of the blade are over for me.  This product does all that it advertised and more.  A super product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are disturbed by the flashing blue light, throw a cloth over it!</li>
    <li> I use it to shave my head and find that it works outstanding in the shower using a high quality shaving cream!! It has been everything I had hoped! I get a really smooth head shave without all the nicks and cuts using a razor. I like the style and ergonomics of the shaver. Makes it really easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service from Amazon was also outstanding as I received the item within two days from order!</li>
    <li> i am very happy with this product and the price.  i did not experience any problem getting used to the shave from day 1.</li>
    <li> After much research, reviews, and pricing, and more research, more reviews, and more pricing..my EX husband loves this shaver.  It took him a few trys to get it to clean because the contacts weren&#x27;t aligned properly so he had to, of course, \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; them. His only advice is to not let the beard get too \\&quot;far behind\\&quot; before using this shaver in order to maximize its potential.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to review this shaver, because one aspect of it is so good, and the other is so poor. First, let me say that I just bought a new one, to replace the same model that I purchased just over four years ago. So, I must like it well enough to spend another $200 for another one. And I do, but at the same time, I know what I am getting myself into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good. This shaver gives an amazing shave. I shave in the shower with shaving cream, and it is absolutely the best electric shaver shave ever. Nearly as good as a double edge razor shave. The battery lasts over a week on a charge, and the cleaning unit does a good job of cleaning and charging it. I do wish that that were an option to run the clean/dry cycle without charging (as some other Panasonic models allow), so that I could clean the shaver while running a longer discharge cycle on the battery. However, that is not a huge issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for everything else. For a shaver that is supposedly &amp;#34;wet or dry,&amp;#34; the water sealing is not very good. Neither is the overall build quality or materials. Here is the history of the shaver that I just replaced:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought the shaver in January, 2011. Everything was great until about 11 months later, when the display started to get wonky. Some parts would display, while others did not. There is a two-year parts and labor warranty, so I contacted Panasonic, who suggested that I send it back, and I did. I received either a new or completely refurbished shaver and cleaning unit in a new box. All was fine for about another 11 or 12 months, when the display started going wonky again. It kept showing that the shaver needed to be cleaned (it didn&#x27;t), or half the charging display didn&#x27;t work. Sometimes the display would come on after using the shaver, and not go off for hours. However, I realized that I had waited too long and was just outside the warranty period, and I did not want to pay to have it repaired. The shaver was still working otherwise, so I decided to keep using it. It continued to work, although the display continued to get worse and worse, until finally it would just light up with absolutely nothing displayed on it. The shave was still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the next year, two thing happened: I noticed that after shaving and removing and rinsing off the screen and head, when I turned the shaver upside down, water would drain out of the shaver. Not sure where it was coming from, but there was more than would have been just from the blades. Also, the back part of the case of the shaver started to peel and deteriorate around the area where it joins the front case. Finally, over the course of the last six months or so, the trimmer stopped working. It was at this point that I decided to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked around, but could not really find another shaver that seemed to offer the shave that this one did. There was a $25 off coupon offered on Amazon, so I bought another one. Does this make me a fool? I don&#x27;t know, but I really like the shave that I get from the shaver. I will watch the warranty dates more closely this time, and return it for replacement at the first sign of trouble.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I have now had this razor for four years and use it regularly. It is made extremely well. I have yet to replace any parts on it. When my hair is longer it does not pull on my hair nearly as much as my previous generation model. When I use it for upkeep on short hairs it does not catch at all. The cleaner works well too but I rarely need to use it. I normally just rinse it clean every now and then but empty it after each use which takes about five seconds. Battery is doing just fine too after all this time.</li>
    <li> Gives a very close shave and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The shaver is comfortable and cuts hair reasonably well. I opted for this one over some of the less expensive models hoping to get a quality item. I&#x27;m not returning it, but I have the following objections. Once the shaver is fully charged, the blue display blinks brightly enough to illuminate my entire house at night. I can&#x27;t imagine what user interface genius thought anyone would want to be woken up by a shaver. Taking the shaver out of the charger stops the blinking. So far, I have forgotten to remove it twice. I&#x27;m considering covering the display with electrical tape. The second problem is that it does throw some of the hair around so I need to shave over the sink. It&#x27;s not nearly as bad as the Remington it&#x27;s replacing, but my previous Panasonic from a different era was better about containing hair.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent unit at the time.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves easily and quickly with very little irritation if any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But considering there are superior 5 blade models out on Amazon as well I would recommend purchasing them instead. Hence why this got 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had both and recommend the 5 blades.</li>
    <li> This is a really great razor and Amazon has had it on sale so it is also a great deal.  My 3 series Panasonic razor just died after over two and a half years and I was looking for another one.  This razor is amazing quite.  My only gripe with it is when it is in the charger the blue lights on the razor remain on and they are amazingly bright and they blink.  So bright that I find I have to remove the shaver from the charger to sleep.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It cleans easily, charges quickly, and shaves more closely than any other shaver I&#x27;ve tried. By shopping Amazon.com, I was able to locate the shaver for 1/2 price. Wow!</li>
    <li> While most reviewers seem to overlook the Panasonic, it outshaves any Braun or Norelco I&#x27;ve ever had.  It is better wet than dry, but worth the small extra effort.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews from this site and a link to you tube. I&#x27;ve tried electric razors in the past, all high end, and they all caused razor burn! I thought I&#x27;d try this one since the reviews pointed toward low irritation. When the razor arrived I plugged it in and tried it... No irritation, and one of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. I no longer mind shaving, and I get a very close, comfortable shave everytime.</li>
    <li> I like its trimmer because it seems to work faster.</li>
    <li> As a life-long user of &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; razors, and high-quality shave cream, I was somewhat skeptical of an electric shaver.  However, upon taking a job that required me to shave every day, and seeing the havoc that wreaked on my face, I decided to take the plunge with an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first week, shaving took longer, and still required a lot of touching up with my old razor.  Then, after about two weeks, WOW, was I impressed.  For the first time in my life, I can shave against the grain.  Plus, I&#x27;ve found that this is most effective when you dry shave--shave creams just cause your facial hair to adhere to your face.  I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a month now, and can&#x27;t imagine going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering the version without the cleaning module, don&#x27;t.  Having cleaned this with regular water while on the road, and comparing that to using the cleaning system, there&#x27;s no comparison.  The system leaves the shaver clean, dry, and smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A costly shaving device, but you will save on creams and razors in the long run.</li>
    <li> Liked it a lot more at first. Gave it 5 stars when I was less concerned about closeness and speed. Am now finding that it takes longer than a multiblade razor and doesn&#x27;t shave as closely. The differences are not terrible: blade shaving time about 2 minutes in a shower vs electric at maybe another minute. The blade, however, gets a much closer shave to the touch. I originally bought it to go over areas that had recent surgery where I did not want a razor possibly nicking the skin or stitches. Now that all is healed, I find that I get better results with a multiblade razor in the shower in less time. The best results with the Panasonic were also in the shower with the same shaving gel. It seems now that it was unrealistic to think that a foil between the blades and the skin could ever be as close as a blade in direct contact with the skin.  The price of the Panasonic could pay for at least 5 years of razor blades. Not displeased with it, but only use it occasionally at this point. It certainly works fine to its ability. For travel, particularly international travel, the weight factor always requires shifting back to blade razors. The charger is convenient and fast. Overall the design and workmanship are excellent.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Panasonic shaver user and I am really impressed with the closeness of the shave and ease of use of the ES-LA93. I have used both the ES882 and the ES8078 Linear shavers for the last decade or so. Each was significantly better than the last. The ES-LA93 is a significant upgrade over the ES8078. With the recent discount I would recommend to anyone holding onto their older Panasonic shaver to upgrade. It takes only 2 - 4 minutes to get a close shave that took 6 - 9 minutes on the ES8078. The shave is also closer for two reasons. First, the shaver does a better job on flat surfaces due to the larger head and mutliple cutting blades. Second it is so much faster on those surfaces that you have more time to concentrate on the trick curving areas of your face. As an additional benefit the wash and dry unit is much quieter and easier to use. You just place the shaver in the unit and it charges straight away.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, very quiet.</li>
    <li> Having just retired a 10 year old version of this razor, that I couldn&#x27;t imagine getting any better, what a surprise this new model has turned out to be!!    Lighter, more powerful, and as effective as ever. Anyone still using an old-fashioned wet blade just hasn&#x27;t tried one of these. This has to be the best razor on the planet. It shaves incredibly smooth, incredibly quick and without any fuss.     The new model includes the washer/charger base and I&#x27;m equally impressed with this marvel of automation. A real treat that makes an impressive product just that much more convenient.    Panasonic is way out in front in this category. I&#x27;ve had Remington, Phillips and Braun razors in the past and they were not even close (pun intended) to the Panasonic shaving system.    The price here at Amazon was unbeatable and although I like to support local business, on this item it would have more than doubled the price. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t whether it was shipped with dull blades, but the razor does NOT shave very well.    Their older model shaved much better (closer)    I am extremely disappointed considering the price of the shaver, I expected MUCH MUCH better.</li>
    <li> To be fair, the product is fine. Even better than fine. Likely the best electric shaver I have ever owned or used. When it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a little over a year (13 months) after purchase the cleaning base stopped working. Not due to lack of care on my part. I called Panasonic for support, expecting that a world class organization would have world class service/support. Boy was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now need to ship - at my expense - the entire product to their service center in Texas. They will then take 7-10 business days to inspect the product. Panasonic will then either repair or replace it at their choice. They will then mail me either the repaired unit or a replaced one. That&#x27;s almost a MONTH! A MONTH! Not sure why they don&#x27;t simply mail me a refurbished (or new) unit immediately and have me return the defective unit. That&#x27;s how almost EVERY OTHER COMPANY does it. That&#x27;s the right way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked what I should for the month that my shaver is gone. Their advice: buy another one (!!!) or get disposables. Really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful service from Panasonic, simply awful.</li>
    <li> I was previously a Norelco Fan, and believed in that technology of rotating cutting heads.    Simply put, this shaver wins and has made me a believer in foil shavers.    Took me 3:31 to do what I would normally,in 5 mins with my old Norelco.    The shave is remarkably smooth and my face feels quite soft after the shave without those annoying bumps that happens after an electric shave.    The multi flexible active head works awesomely. No other comments on that necessary.    I must point out, that I read every review done here about this product, so I knew what I was buying and it has met my every expectation.    Maybe in a couple months  I will revisit this review if needed. I doubt that I will need to tho.</li>
    <li> Panasonic shaver is absolutely fantastic! So much better than my old Braun. It works on voltage anywhere on this planet!!</li>
    <li> I used previously two Braun shavers that lasted for 25 years, and still they do, but I was needing to replace the blade and make an adjustment, so I decided to change and buy a Philips Norelco 8170xl. I did it one year and a half ago.   The Philips is very quiet and shaves fine, but I prefer the non rotary system of Braun and decided to buy their newest pulsonic model.    Looking in Amazon and based on the reviews of Panasonic I decided to change my mind and buy this model.  I was a very bad decision.    Here are my comments for the three aspects that you need to consider when buying a new shaver after 6 month of use:    The Shaver. Shaves well but not a real difference with my other cheaper and older machines. Some time it leaves  difficult to cut hair as others reviewers says, probably it leaves more hair than the Philips that I´m using now  (later I will say why i´m still using it), but in any case I prefer the feeling of the Panasonic or the Braun blade to the rotary of Philips.  Panasonic is as noisy as the Braun but this is more comfortable to hold due to its shape.   The pulsating system probably work but I don&#x27;t appreciate it. I would give to the shaver 4 stars    The cleaning module. Work well whiles it last. As other reviewer this is a bad part of the bundle. It cleans and also dry the machine. It can dry only if you prefer to wash it with soap and after only dry. This module is very, very noisy and uncomfortable if you are trying to listen the radio in the bathroom after the shave. Also it fails, may be because is sensible to the humidity and it stops to work for me, after the second change of the cleaning liquid. I would give 2 stars to this module.    The service. The worst of everything and the reason why I´m giving 1 start to the entire package that you buy for the price that you pay (shaver, cleaning module, service). When I contacted them for the problem with the cleaning module,  they told me that I have to return everything and they would sendme a new one. I insisted that I only wanted to repair the cleaning module and I would like to keep the saver so I would continue using it. They told me: don&#x27;t worry they will send me very fast a complete new replacement unit. He told me that they always do that due this is a personal care item. I accepted. After more than two week I received a used one in a refurbish box nor as the original box that I sent them. This unit had clear signs of been used and I decided to open the head to to see if it had hair inside and I saw that it had some blades dangerously folded inside. I was so disappointed. Then I called them and after speaking with several people, they recognized that they were sending back refurbished units even for personal care products and doing that even if the yours is a working unit and nearly new as the mine. I had to return again the used one that received and I´m still waiting,  for more than one month,  to receive an used refurbish unit.    Summary.  Never again Panasonic,don mind if it is a tv, radio, shaver, anything.</li>
    <li> This is my first wet/dry shaver.  It does work very well.  I still have issues with it on my neck.  But besides that part it works very well.  The cleaner is pretty loud and it usually takes over a hour to clean and dry.</li>
    <li> I have used many electrics and this one comes closest to the feel of a blade, but without the cuts or irritation.</li>
    <li> so far I am liking it just fine. Am changing from blade razor to electic and they recomend using for 30 days before passing judgment .  Allowing your and your skin to adjust to the new type of shaving.  I do like using wet and with small amount of shaving gel.</li>
    <li> Great shaver!! Shaves close and smooth</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. He has a terrible problem with ingrown facial hair. The Panasonic ES-LA93-K was recommended for this problem and it works great. He has very few ingrown hairs now and he doesn&#x27;t pick at his face to get the hairs out.  Because of this shaver his complexion has cleared and he looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Great shave, but it&#x27;s got a lousy battery and even worse cleaning unit. The wet shave is  &gt; the dry one. The dry shave is still pretty good tho. Recommend buying without the cleaning unit.</li>
    <li> This shaver is simply the best one my husband has ever owned. He&#x27;s had a few pricey ones before but nothing that gave such a close shave so fast! I use it to shave my son too who needs help due to mental handicap and it is by far the best shaver I have ever used as well. My husband can shave in less than 3minutes instead of the 15 it used to take him with his old razor. This would be a great gift for the man who has everything. It&#x27;s price probably keeps guys from getting it for themselves but it is such a nice thing to own and use everyday that every man would really appreciate the speed and comfort of this shaver. I highly recommend it!! My daughter got this for her boyfriend for Christmas too. He is 22 years old and hates shaving but is a clean cut guy. I have a feeling he&#x27;s going to love this gift. It&#x27;s sleek, looks high tech and gives the closest shave ever. So young ladies out there, don&#x27;t under estimate the gift scale of this as a present. Believe me , even if they are thinking \\&quot;a shaver?\\&quot; when you give it to them, they will be thanking you enthusiastically after the first time they use it.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver for about a month and have found the results it produces to be very poor.  I have a moderately coarse beard and this shaver is incapable of giving me a decent shave.  I have followed all the instructions carefully and tried using it dry, with gel and I even bought some expensive shaving oil to try and improve the shave with only marginally better results.  Shaving generally took me between 9 and 12 minutes with this product and still the results were quite poor compared to a sharp razor.  It also caused me moderate skin irritation and frequently cut my face.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone.  It may produce acceptable results if you have very fine facial hair but even then I&#x27;m somewhat skeptical after my experience.  My conclusions lead me to question the validity of some other reviews here that make claims such as \\&quot;It&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had\\&quot; and \\&quot;it takes me 3 minutes to shave\\&quot;.  If you buy this product I suggest you make yourself familiar with the return policy and be prepared to do so!</li>
    <li> I have had mine for about two years now and still love it. It is nice to be able to clean it every day by pressing a button and I use Amazon for replacement cleaner and cutting heads. I do wish the cutting heads would stay sharper longer - I get about 8 months before replacing and notice a difference when I slap that new one on. I was a Norelco fan for years and would say that it did a slightly better job on my neck, but I see a lot of mixed reviews on Norelcos these days. I also used a Braun and have good things to say about that brand as well, but this Panasonic is best. Only problems I&#x27;ve had have been my fault. Got the cleaning/charging unit wet and it was replaced under warranty and didn&#x27;t lock the switch off when packing for Europe. I heard some strange noises at the airport which I later realized was my razor running. It was completely discharged when I got there and I forgot to bring the charging cord. Had to get a razor from the front desk and lost about a pint of blood shaving each day. Reminded me how much I love this shavers over razors.</li>
    <li> After years trying electrical shavers and this is the one!&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday on either dry or wet shavings and it does the job beautifully. It took me three days to get the hang of it. Now I&#x27;d not change back to blades.&lt;br /&gt;Above my expectations.</li>
    <li> I prefer shaving while i shower and was happy to find a good wet/dry shaver. I had no issues with the shave...if an area wasn&#x27;t smooth i just ran it over the area again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month or two of use the LED started to flake out and display broken characters. No biggie as it wasn&#x27;t impeding the use. A few days ago though it quit displaying any of the symbols or numbers,  yet the display was lighting up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being bored, I opened it up and found all sorts of hairs and moisture inside of the sealed, waterproof casing. With some cleaning and drying of the boards and display, I was only able to get the display partially working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning kit...can&#x27;t say i really needed it since i wet shave and it takes up a good chunk of my counter. When it showed the little faucet icon i looked to see if it was actually dirty, but never saw any hair buildup.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 7 series and liked it.  Still use it, but am glad I picked this one up.  It gives me a better overall shave and as long as it does that can we complain?  Like any new razor, your skin has to adjust to it with a few shaves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used blades and wet-shaved.  15 years ago I considered electric shavers a gimmick, but manufacturing, electronics, and materials have advanced some so I thought I&#x27;d try one out.  I bought this one thinking I should go ahead and try one of the better shavers available.  I tried it dry and then wet with and without a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is this shaver is much slower and far more tedious than a blade.  The only reason I can imagine anyone using something like this is if they can&#x27;t help cutting themself with a blade.  With a blade, I can shave a 1, 2, or 4 day beard in less than 4 minutes total, with no more than 2 minutes of blade work (the other 2 being washing, lathering and rinsing).  After shaving for that long with this Panasonic shaver, it&#x27;s very spotty.  I can go over the same area again and again in different directions, pushing, pulling and stretching, and it just doesn&#x27;t shave it all.  With a blade, one pass is enough, two, one in each direction is the most I&#x27;d ever use.  This shaver is worthless to me.  I can&#x27;t say that among electric shavers it&#x27;s particularly bad by comparison, but I found it useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any reasonably sharp blade is far better than this.  I&#x27;ve used gilette cartridges, disposables, a straight-razor, safety-razors, BIC, whatever.  I&#x27;m slower with a straight razor than I am with a t-handle, but the straight-razor is still faster than this electric.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver.  It is quick and does a fantastic job.  A great replacement for my old Norelco shaver.  Well worth the money.  Lasts about 12 to 14 shaves between charges.  Very quick recharge rate.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It does a good job on my face but not so good on my neck.  In addition it smelled like B.O. until I had used it for about 3 weeks.  Now I either got used to it or the smell has dissipated.  I have to keep going over my neck and it never does get clean shaven.  I&#x27;m afraid that, despite the rather high cost, this is not the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; electric razor.</li>
    <li> Relatively good razor for the money.  Good shave, good charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, about 10 months in, the screen failed.  It now lights up every single icon / number on the display, so I can&#x27;t tell what the charge is or what cleaning needs to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called up customer service, as the razor is under warranty.  However, they won&#x27;t send me a new razor without sending the old one in.  Given that this is a product I use daily, and is not a cheap razor that has had major issues within a year, this is not ideal.  I asked if they could put a hold on my credit card and send me a new razor preemptively, and then remove the charge when they got the broken one, and they said they could not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary - poor display failed under a year, and customer service won&#x27;t make my life easier.  Not what I expect for a $200 product.</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 Panasonic shavers over the last 4 years.  Both of them were top of the line at the time and both had the cleaning/charging base.  The Shavers work very well but they do not do very well on the neck or jaw line.  That is a minor issue.  The real issue for people considering purchasing a Panasonic shaver with the charging/cleaning base is that the base will only last about a year then it will start to leak and the electronics will fail.  Both of my shaver bases did the exact same thing in almost the exact same amount of time so it is definitely a quality problem.  I take care of my shavers so it is not a case of abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget about any support from Panasonic - it is the absolute worst customer service you can imagine.  They tell you to send in the razor and the base which of course leaves you without a razor for 6 weeks or more.  Why do they need the razor when the problem is the base leaks all over the counter?  The leak has nothing to do with the razor.  When you try to explain this to them they just tell you to send everything to them and wait for them to decide what to do.  In the mean time you will just go buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the reviews here are all very positive and I liked the razor so much that I bought another one when the base started leaking after only a year.  But when the second one did the same thing I had too much invested in these things to go buy another razor so I just threw the base in the trash and charge it from the wall with the standard cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these with a huge \\&quot;buyer beware\\&quot;.  Also be sure to keep a towel near so you can mop up the counter when is starts leaking.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m done with Panasonic razors after dumping nearly $500 into them over the last 4 years.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it! he has very sensitive skin and after purchasing many different razor and product this is the first one he never has issues with , been using it for a while now and still loves it</li>
    <li> Great Product! I will buy again if I need it. Perfect Shaving and fast.  I recommend the cleaning station, makes more easy the cleaning shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun series 7 for about a year. I was getting pretty good results, but thought I would try this Panasonic after reading the many 5 star reviews. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but I am not happy at all with results I&#x27;m getting with this shaver. I end up having to finish with shaving cream and my Gillette Fusion razor.  I switched to an electric razor when I was hospitalized for three weeks and could not get up to shave. I bought my Braun from Amazon after research and reading the reviews. My wife asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I told her that I wanted a new electric razor. So that is how I ended up with this Panasonic. I have tried it dry, with pre- shave and with shaving gel and cream. None of these gave a close shave. I hate to go back to using cream and a bladed razor. So I guess I will replace the blades in my Braun and give this Panasonic to my son-in-law.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for a month and it gives quick close shaves. Not impressed with the cleaning system. Cleaning under running water is fast and easy.</li>
    <li> A shave that makes your face feel soft and smooth again. The wide head, that floats sideways to ensure maximum contact, ensures that you can cover your entire beard growth area quickly and efficiently. I use this to shave my face and also my neck where untidy hairs grow. I have had two Panasonic shavers before this one and they have each lasted me around 4 years each before upgrading, so I know that keeping your razor clean is the best way to ensure that it remains at it&#x27;s best. The wet cleaning system this shaver uses means that keeping my shaver clean, unclogged and sharp is no effort at all; hence I do not anticipate a performance degradation, with age, which I experienced with the previous models. This is now and very quick and easy process and I am very happy with my purchase. Even when away and without the cleaning base unit, just a small squirt with liquid soap and then running it under a tap does the job perfectly. A great product with an unbelievably fast service to New Zealand.</li>
    <li> The competition was very close between my Braun 760cc and the Panasonic ES-LA93-k which I got on an Amazon deal of the day promotion. The Panasonic basically takes the same amount of time to shave my face, but irritates my skin less, and the shave seems to last longer - probably because it cuts a little closer. After getting used to the shape, the Panasonic wins for me. Neither of them have a very good sideburn trimmer. For the record - I liked my old Braun 8590 (lasted for 10 years) much more than the newer 760cc.</li>
    <li> So I received this electric shaver and it&#x27;s been 2 days, so far I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;- Good quality materials are used,&lt;br /&gt;- Easier to clean than Braun 7 series (my dad has one)&lt;br /&gt;- Information displayed is very useful such as number of secs used, battery life etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;- It takes 180 minutes to dry&lt;br /&gt;- When the battery is full it flashes, it&#x27;s kind of annoying&lt;br /&gt;- When the shaver is in clean mode it makes a long beep noise every 5 secs, I am the first person who wakes up in the house and by the time I leave the house everyone is in sleep so I can&#x27;t really clean the shaver unless I close the washroom door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I don&#x27;t know enough about this shaver to configure, I will update later in a week or two once I figure out how to turn off the beeps.</li>
    <li> Bottom line up front:  This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Worth every penny.  Quality product.  FINALLY, a solution to my razor bumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ME - I am in the military, which means I have to shave every day.  I hate shaving with an angry, burning passion.  I have been in the military for 18 years and the worst part about the job, day to day, has been having to shave each morning.  Yeah, I dislike shaving THAT much.  I have light skin and coarse facial hair that is very prone to ingrown hairs (aka razor bumps).  I have tried everything to mitigate this condition... yes, EVERYTHING.  A zillion different combinations of blades, techniques, shaving creams/gels, and after shave treatments like Bump Stopper.  I have also tried several other electric razors... other foil and rotary shavers.  I have tried blades and razors and creams reportedly designed specifically for sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tried chemical depilatories.  A few years ago, I even underwent several extremely painful laser hair removal treatments to try and get rid of my beard for good... that did NOT go well!  Finally, I&#x27;ve found a combination of products that drastically reduces (although it does not eliminate completely) the number of ingrown hairs I&#x27;m liable to suffer from.  This electric razor from Panasonic is at the center of that combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HISTORY WITH THIS LINE OF RAZORS - I am speaking from experience.  Panasonic helped me turn the tide in my battle against razor bumps about 10 years ago.  I&#x27;m estimating this figure because it&#x27;s been so long.  I bought one of the very first models of their Linear foil shaver series... the ES8077, I think.  I only recently replaced it with this newer model, the ESLA93K, because the cleaning/charging station finally gave up the ghost.  Even then, it was probably due to my overzealous cleaning of the unit, that involved running quite a bit of water over (and ultimately inside of) it.  Up until that point, the razor itself, the chargingbase, and the cleaning system worked exactly as well as they did when they were BRAND NEW.  TEN YEARS AGO.  When was the last time you could say that about one of your small appliances, especially one that used some sort of rechargeable battery system?  I wish Panasonic made dustbusters, because I&#x27;ve been through about four of those suckers (no pun intended) in the past decade... they stop holding a charge the second you take them out of the box!  As long as you periodically change the foil, the blades, and the cleaning cartridges, you&#x27;ve got a product that will last you a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY A PANASONIC LINEAR SERIES RAZOR vs. OTHER BRANDS? - Several reasons I will cover here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) SPEED.  This is really where these razors shine.  10,000 - 14,000 RPM cuts FAST.  If you&#x27;ve got a coarse beard like mine, a speedy razor allows you to make one or two slow, smooth passes to get all the hairs, keeping you from overworking the area and causing irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) BATTERY LIFE.  I think they power these razors with Plutonium.  Two months ago I went two weeks in the field with my ten-year-old razor (and battery of similar age) without charging it and it still shaved with the same power on the very last day as it did when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) QUALITY.  My razor has survived countless road trips, field exercises, and two year-long deployments to Iraq.  Snap the plastic cover over the foils, drop it in its little pouch, and off you go.  Other than regularly changing the foils, blades, and cleaning cartridges, I haven&#x27;t had to replace a single part.  No dinky plastic pieces sticking out waiting to get snapped off, no chintzy base or poor quality electrical connections or components... it is, quite simply, extremely well built.  That is why, even though the cleaning/charging station died, I&#x27;m keeping the razor itself so that it can permanently live in my shaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) WATERPROOF.  If your face can stand a wet shave (mine can&#x27;t... it cuts too close, then I get bumps), this is a phenomenal razor.  My wife has used mine on her legs sometimes when we are travelling and it leaves them silky smooth every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) IT&#x27;LL HACK THROUGH YOUR BEARD LIKE GRANT THROUGH RICHMOND.  I&#x27;ve taken on whiskers at least 1/4 of an inch long (about a week&#x27;s growth for me... I don&#x27;t shave when I&#x27;m on leave if I can avoid it) without doing any sort of pre-trim with clippers.  It takes a little longer, but it&#x27;ll get through it.  Try THAT with a rotary razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) COMPARATIVELY LOW COST VS. BLADES.  You do the math for yourself.  How much do you spend on blades per month?  Multiply that by 120 (number of months I owned my last razor before buying this one).  If it&#x27;s less than the following, then the electric razor is a good deal for you.  I spent $125 for the unit, I changed cleaning cartridges about every four months (a $15 three-pack would last a year), blades every six months ($30 a year?), and the foil every year ($25 or so?).  Yearly upkeep was $70, or $700 for a decade plus $125 for the unit itself, is $825.  Divided by 120 months, is a cost of less than seven bucks a month.  I&#x27;ve also thrown a lot less stuff in the trash over the course of that ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) WATER-BASED CLEANING SOLUTION.  Other systems use an alcohol-based solution that, over time, will degrade the plastic and rubber components of a razor or charging base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) EASE OF CLEANING.  If you buy one with a cleaning/charging station, then DUH.  Periodic (semi-annual?) cleaning of the cleaning station will help clear out any schmutz that builds up in the water tubes or elsewhere in the base.  Don&#x27;t rinse the whole doggone base under the faucet (see above under \\&quot;reasons why I&#x27;m buying a new razor\\&quot;).  Even without a cleaning/charging station, you just pop off the foil cover and rinse it under the water.  How much easier can it get?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ES-LA93K AND MY ORIGINAL PANASONIC LINEAR SHAVER - I haven&#x27;t had it for long, but some things have come to light... some good, some not so much.  See below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) IT IS FASTER.  Between the higher speed and the extra foil cutter (four heads vs. three), I can shave off a day&#x27;s worth of stubble in less than three minutes if I&#x27;m really in a hurry.  Not really because I can move the head faster, but because it definitely allows me to get a great shave in just one or sometimes two passes.  Fewer passes and less pressure equals less irritation which equals fewer razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) MORE COMPLIANT / FLEXIBLE PIVOT.  It took me almost no time to get used to the new configuration, with the head sticking out at an angle from the handle... I like how there seems to be less spring tension on the moveable head, it really allows it to follow the contours of my face closely without requiring much pressure.  It also pivots in two axes, vs. one from my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) VIBRATING HEAD.  Okay, I&#x27;ll admit that I thought it would be a marketing gimmick, but it is another great method for reducing the pressure required to get a nice close shave.  Are you picking up on the theme here?  Less pressure &#x3D; less irritation &#x3D; well, you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) IT IS A LITTLE LOUDER.  Some folks complained about the noise in their reviews, both for the razor and the charging station when it&#x27;s in its cleaning cycle.  I guess I&#x27;m just used to it.  Still... loud compared to what?  A chainsaw?  No.  A razor blade?  Yep.  Your wife&#x27;s \\&quot;personal massager?\\&quot;  That depends... what kind of batteries does it take?  The point is, sure, it makes noise.  Close the doggone bathroom door for a few minutes and shave your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) THE LED DISPLAY IS UNBELIEVABLY BRIGHT.  Okay, no arguments here.  Fortunately, I cannot see into my bathroom from my bed, because if I could, I would have a recurring dream every night that I am a plane, coming in for a landing, and there is a bright blue homing beacon flashing at me through the clouds every few seconds.  Seriously... you could signal aircraft with that display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) ONE QUALITY ISSUE (with the cleaning/charging station).  Do an internet search for \\&quot;flashing red status light Panasonic razor\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll come up with a smattering of posts about this.  Considering how I have long touted the quality of this line of Panasonic products, I was a little disappointed to have this manufacturing defect affect my unit.  Fortunately, it was an easily remedied problem.  The error occurs because a microswitch inside the base of the unit gets moisture or water or who-knows-what in it and thinks that you don&#x27;t have the cleaning cartridge inside the base when you actually do.  Since few folks would make the mistake of running a cleaning cycle without the cartridge in there (properly seated), it&#x27;s an easy feature to bypass.  The switch wants to be \\&quot;open\\&quot; (i.e. when there is a fault, the switch closes the circuit path) so all you have to do is undo three screws on the base and snip one of the brown wires leading to the switch itself... now it will think that it&#x27;s \\&quot;open\\&quot; all the time.  Hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me since, but it&#x27;s a shame that I had to take this sort of remedial action as a consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) THE FOILS ARE ARCHED SLIGHTLY AND THE HEAD IS BIGGER.  I was worried that the bigger head would make the shaver more cumbersome and harder to get into the nooks and crannies of my face, and that the arched foils would reduce the contact patch and cause the shave to take longer.  I was wrong on both counts... it is extremely maneuverable and has no trouble reaching everything quickly and without requiring several passes or excess pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY SHAVING / FACE MAINTENANCE ROUTINE - For what it&#x27;s worth, here&#x27;s what works best for me.  Your results may vary, but this is the best combination I&#x27;ve found for a close shave that does not irritate my skin and cause razor bumps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Shower first thing in the morning, right before the shave.  UseApricot facial scrub (with or without the 2% salicylic acid... I prefer with) [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz]] to wash your face, scrubbing gently to get a nice deep clean.  Dry face thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Prep beard by applying Remington face-saver pre-shave powder stick.  [[ASIN:B00065QS3M Pre-Shave Stick]] I tried Lectric Shave and other pre-shave treatments, but this talc-based powder allows the razor to glide very smoothly.  That means less pressure, which means... yeah, you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Shave against the grain of your face, or across it if the stubble is short enough.  This will help \\&quot;feed\\&quot; the hairs into the foil holes.  The slotted trimmer in the middle of the two main cutting foils will do a good job batting cleanup if you shave in this manner.  I work as rapidly as I can without missing hairs or pressing too hard, because if the razor runs for a long time (unless you are wet shaving) then it will heat up a bit.  This doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it uncomfortable, but it does seem to drag a bit more when it is warmer.  I hit the hardest and most sensitive spots first, then I do my cheeks and sideburns last because they are the easiest and the most resilient, so if the razor has warmed up a bit, it won&#x27;t have as much of a detrimental effect on my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Stop halfway through, pop off the foil cover, tap it out, and pop it back on to continue shaving.  ESPECIALLY if you are using talc, you&#x27;ll get stubble and talc residue building up inside the foil cover, so it&#x27;s a good habit to get into in order to keep from overburdening the razor.  Once you have the \\&quot;battle drill\\&quot; down, this takes all of about three seconds to do and get back to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Check to make sure you didn&#x27;t miss any stray hairs.  Get really stubborn ones with the pop-up trimmer.  Rinse your face with water to get any remaining talc or loose hairs off.  Pop off the foil cover again and rinse both the razor and the foilcover under the water.  Tap them dry, reassemble, and place in the cleaning/charging station.  If you do not have a cleaning/charging station or you are travelling away from it, I recommend applying Remington \\&quot;Shaver Saver\\&quot; spray [[ASIN:B00006IV41 SP-4 Spray lubricant and cleaner Shaver Shaver - For all Shavers &amp; Groomers]] to the reassembled unit and running it for 5-10 seconds before stowing it.  If you do have a cleaning/charging station, I alternate... one day I will simply set it to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and the next day I will select \\&quot;clean / dry.\\&quot;  This helps my cleaning cartridges last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) I have a prescription for a combination topical antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide (called Benzamycin) that has really helped keep razor bumps at bay (I rarely, if ever, break out anywhere other than a hair follicle site).  Once my face is dry, I apply the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) After letting the Benzamycin dry for a few minutes, I apply Gillette conditioning after shave gel [[ASIN:B003W3P1TC 2 BOTTLES GILLETTE AFTER SHAVE SENSITIVE SKIN GEL 2.5 OZ.]].  It is not alcohol based so it doesn&#x27;t sting, and it helps moisturize and protect my face (the Benzamycin dries it out somewhat).  My wife also LOVES the way it smells!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Throughout the day, I do my best to keep from touching my face.  Hard to do, but it reduces the chance that I&#x27;ll introduce bacteria into a tiny break in my skin that has been irritated by the shaving process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) In the evening when I get home, I use a face wash (like Neutrogena) [[ASIN:B001EUQBRQ Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Facial Cleanser, Pink Grapefruit, 6 Ounce]] that has some salicylic acid in it to clean the day off of me.  Then, at night right before bed, I put on another application of Benzamycin and follow it up with the after shave to re-moisturize (and because I&#x27;m about to climb in bed with a beautiful woman who likes the way it smells).  If your face is susceptible to over-drying, you might want to be careful about combining salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments... my face doesn&#x27;t seem to mind, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10) When razor bumps do pop up, I pull the hairs out with a tweezer.  A dermatologist would probably advise against this, but it seems to let the accompanying pimple heal much quicker with the hair not in there continuing to irritate things.  The biggest challenge for me is to not try and yank out a hair before it&#x27;s long enough to grab.  Otherwise, if you get just a piece of it, it&#x27;ll break off as you tug on it and wind up leaving a jagged-edged hair that is back below your skin.  Recipe for a few more days of disaster right there... better to just leave it alone for one more day and get it when it&#x27;s longer.  Be especially careful not to touch the site where you&#x27;ve removed an ingrown hair... you KNOW the skin is compromised there and you don&#x27;t want to introduce anything that might cause an infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11) On the weekends, or whenever I can, I give my face a break.  It seems to allow it to heal and get ready for the next week&#x27;s battle.  Some might postulate that it&#x27;s better to just shave every single day and let your face get used to it... doesn&#x27;t seem to work that way for me.  If I do wind up having a breakout, continuing to try and shave over an already irritated area just makes it ten times worse.  It&#x27;s like the zits/bumps \\&quot;cross pollinate.\\&quot;  Awesome.  When that happens, the weekend just can&#x27;t get here fast enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE - Read the manual to see what they recommend.  Now that this razor in particular will tell me when the cleaning cartridge needs to be changed, I will probably just do that upon demand.  Before I was changing the cartridge [[ASIN:B000BF1396 Panasonic WES035P Vortex HydraClean Shaving System Solution Cartridges for Men&#x27;s Shaver (ES8109S, ES8228S, ES8249S, ES-LA93-K, ES-LV81-K) (Pack of 3)]] (and the water in the tank) about every three to four months.  I changed the shaving blades everysix months, and the foil every year [[ASIN:B002N5MHL0 Panasonic WES9025PC Replacement Foil and Blades]].  This kept my unit cutting like new throughout the entire time I owned it, and I will likely keep up a similar schedule with the new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, hopefully you&#x27;ll find this review helpful.  I know that these razors can be quite an investment, and they aren&#x27;t for everyone.  If you&#x27;re looking for some guidance or reassurance before taking the leap, maybe you&#x27;ve found it here.  No promises, but I can say with absolute certainty that they&#x27;ve been a godsend for me.  If you decide to give one a try, I hope you wind up being as satisfied as I have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck!</li>
    <li> It provides a very close and comfortable shave.  The base is very useful, though the battery life seems quite good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time Panasonic user. The shavers are really great for tough beards like mine, and they work in the shower, which is fantastic. I remember reading in a Braun manual once about how a dry shave is always better than a wet shave, and maybe that&#x27;s true for them German beards, but for my beard it most definitely is not (and I&#x27;ve experimented with both).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three months of daily shaving, I&#x27;d say this is by far the best Panasonic (and closest shaver) I&#x27;ve ever used. It gets all the tough spots and does an all-around fantastic job. I did deduct a star for a few flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first flaw is that the manual says, \\&quot;it is recommended that you replace the outer foil at least once a year, and the inner blade once at least every two years, to maintain your shaver&#x27;s cutting performance.\\&quot; Ridiculous---unless your beard is made of peach fuzz, there&#x27;s no way the razor&#x27;s blades are going to last the full 24 months. In my 6 years of using Panasonic razors, I&#x27;ve found that after 9 months, the performance is noticeably down from when I first bought it, and that I need to replace both foil and blades. Yes, I have a tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second flaw is that the shaver&#x27;s performance depends heavily on how much it&#x27;s charged. Between 70-100% charge it does its best job; between 40-70% it does a good job, but takes longer to get to the same result as 70-100%; and below 40% charge, it&#x27;s basically as good as a Norelco (which is, for my type of beard, not very good). This charge-dependent quality is true not just of this shaver but of all the other Panasonic models I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third flaw is the quality of the slider that takes you from flexible grip, to firm grip, to trimmer activation. The slider is extremely easy to trigger accidentally (I&#x27;ve frequently switched from fixed to flexible without intending to do so). Minor gripe here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final flaw is with the whole vortex cleaning system. This system suggests you use the same pool of soapy water 30 days in a row (or else spend $$$ on vortex refill pods unnecessarily). I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s such a hygenic idea to keep on re-using that water for so long, which is why before using vortex, I make sure my razor is as squeaky clean as possible (using the ultrasound quick clean mode). I would have preferred an alcohol, rather than water-based cleaning system. However, don&#x27;t try putting alcohol inside a vortex system thinking you&#x27;re going to be so smart. I did that on an older unit, and it broke within a few weeks. That having been said, Vortex does get the job done---no mildewy smell ever on this razor (and without some type of cleaning system, be it vortex or something else, you WILL get the mildew, guaranteed, even if you rinse the razor religiously).</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with my Braun Pulsonic 9595 until the trimmer broke so I started the search for a new shaver.  I have a thick beard so I wanted something that would really mow the lawn.  With this new Panasonic I have never had a closer shave, maybe not even with a blade.  Going from the Braun&#x27;s 10,000 cycles per minute to the Panasonic&#x27;s 14,000 vibes is like night and day.  So for me, this was the main selling point.  That being said, there are some areas where the Braun scores.  The shaver head of the Braun is smaller so it is easier to get in those tight corners like under the nose.  The Panny head feels bulky.  The Braun hair trimmer is rounded where as the Panny is flat with sharp corners so shaving the back of the neck is not as comfortable with the Panny if you don&#x27;t hold it exactly flush with the skin. The Braun&#x27;s cleaning solution is alcohol based so it cleans and dries much faster.  The Panny takes about 80 minutes (I think) to dry.  On the other hand, the Panasonic being water based should be more economical over the cost of the Braun&#x27;s Clean &amp; Renew cartridges.  I also like the fact that after I&#x27;m done with the Panny I can just rinse it out under the faucet with some hand soap so I won&#x27;t have to use its self contained cleaning system on a daily basis.  Over time the Braun&#x27;s alcohol based solution started to eat away and peel the paint on the shaver.  The Braun also would leave the whisker clippings all over the sink area where as with the Panasonic the clippings stay under the screen until you pop the screen off to rinse.  One small negative, the Panny has this bright flashing blue charge indicator that is really annoying at night.  It looks like a strobe light from a bad &#x27;70&#x27;s disco movie reflecting off of the bathroom wall.  The simple solution is to unplug the unit at night or turn the shaver around in its cradle after it&#x27;s charged, so not a big deal. If Braun ever came out with a 14,000 vibe unit this would be a much tougher decision.  But for now, Ihave to give the edge to Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Have not loved a razor this much since Braun made quality electric razors in the 90&#x27;s. LEss razor burn, really good craftsmanship (made in Japan!), and a nice package, all-around. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I expected a closer shave especially with this high price.  I&#x27;m going to get new blades for my Braun, it gives you a better shave with less time and effort.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, without a doubt, and that includes a couple of Brauns I&#x27;ve had. Each shave is super close, and granted, I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, but this shaver always leaves my faces feeling baby soft. Equally as close as a razer, but without the nicks, cuts, and blood stained towels. I have the cleaning unit and even though I&#x27;ve had the shaver for over a month, I haven&#x27;t seen an indicator yet that I need to change the cleaning cartridge and water in the resovoir (instructions say if you clean and dry the shaver daily, it will last for 30 days before requiring a change). If I had to cite any less than perfect aspects of this shaver, it would be that the cleaning system can be quite loud. Also, and maybe this is nitpicking, but the edger/side burn trimmer would have been better located on the same side of the cutting blocks (you have to flip the shaver around and flip up the trimmer). Other than that, this is one outstanding piece of work! Let&#x27;s hope it lasts for a few years.</li>
    <li> Did what l expected, very close shave. As long as it holds out I would recommend this product. Little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Fast, smooth operation. Didn&#x27;t expect such a close shave, I&#x27;ve use Norelco and Braun before and this is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten from an electric shaver. You don&#x27;t get the irritation on neck like you do with Norelcos. Cleaning mode is louder than Braun, but it&#x27;s no big deal, bright charging light blinking @ night can be annoying.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaving machine...very close to his skin and always leaves a fresh feeling on his face... yay!!</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as a razor but then again my face is not cut either. Very satisfied. Razor works wet or dry, in and out of the shower. Generally with a razor I need to shave every day, so you can tell my beard is moderately heavy. I think if was a smoother, less hairy man, this would even be better. Price was high, but when you add razors, cutting skin, and other products, I felt like this was a good deal. Smooth delivery.</li>
    <li> I lovethe razor but I can&#x27;t master the cleaning process. Do you have helpful videos?</li>
    <li> Well built razor. Shaves close without irritation. My only gripe is the never ending flash of the display once a full charge is complete.</li>
    <li> very good shaving machine!</li>
    <li> I have now used this razor for 3 months with no issues. I am an everyday shaver, I do not recommend this razor for a weekly shaver. If you let your hair grow in, you have to trim first. I love the close shave! Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric. The trick is you have to move slow and let the razor do its job! I was used to using a Braun moving fast and going over again and again. If you take your time you will get the best shave.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my dad. He uses it all the time and is able to get a very close shave by using it wet. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great, arrived in time and works as described.</li>
    <li> Shaves good but the LED display went out in four months and I need to replace the blades and screen every 90 days. Not a ghood value.</li>
    <li> Pass over your neck a hundred times...it doesn&#x27;t matter. This shaver is guaranteed to miss those neck hairs. I bought a cheap 50 dollar shaver that does the job and this has become an overpriced piece of junk.</li>
    <li> The shaver itself is easy to hold in the hands. The shaver head can adjust to your face in all angles.&lt;br /&gt;Very soft on the skin so it doesnt hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean - just wash under running water.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for anyone.</li>
    <li> It costs me few bucks but it surely worth it. It works perfectly, charges fast and cleans/shaves to the minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly a perfect product.</li>
    <li> Preforms as promised!  Would be nice if an order form and address was included for more soap andreplacement blades.  Still has a way to go for under the chin wiskers vs. a manual razor.  All in all I&#x27;m very pleased. Sam</li>
    <li> Better than any razor or electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve owned many.&lt;br /&gt;A close comfortable razor. Buy it you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron</li>
    <li> Comfortble, convinient, and good looking , like it very much! Also ,I buy it during Christmas with deals, it&#x27;s really cheap.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time in original packaging with warranty. The head pivots, it&#x27;s wet or dry product. It&#x27;s an electrical charger and comes with a travel charger. It comes with a clean machine or you can clean it your self with just water and soap. It has a timer to inform you how long you have been shaving or its been in use without charge. I love this product, but I&#x27;m still getting use to it. As for females, they don&#x27;t have shavers like this out there. I don&#x27;t have to shave as often any more, it&#x27;s awesome. Oh, I never get cuts or feel burn. It&#x27;s always smooth, but the only probable I have it didn&#x27;t get all the hairs. It will feel like it did, but as I did before I&#x27;m still getting use to it. Thanks again</li>
    <li> Using Edge gel I have gotten the best shave ever from an electric. Better than Norelco rotary and about 90% as close as a blade but without the irritating red neck!  Works really well dry as well. A bit noisier than the norelco. I love the automatic cleaner and use it once a week and rinse it after every shave. All great until it just would no longer even turn on. Currently in Texas being exchanged. Should take 3 weeks according to Panasonic service, which was very helpful. Can&#x27;t wait to get it back. If it was more reliable it would easily be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I noticed skin darkening after using for 3 days. So, returned.</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift for my husband and he is delighted with his new Panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and would often get irritation and burning from shaving, so all these wet shavers that I discovered over a decade ago were real (skin) life savers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started with the Phillips wet shave (the ones that had a built-in dispenser on the back)...6700 or something, but switched away from them when they adopted the &#x27;open&#x27; system that had all the shavings fall out all over the place, once my 6700 broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that point, I decided to give Panasonic a try, because it had good reviews.  I went with the 8109S (dual-blade predecessor to this one, also foil, wet shaving and cleaning base).  It was great:  much less irritation than the Phillips I had before, and it would clean itself.  I went through two of these (one because the battery died and the price difference to getting a replacement shaver rather than a battery was negligible, the second when my cleaning base died, and I decided to see if this shaver is better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect the ES-LA93-K (or its sliver brother) to be better, and thought the extra blades are a gimmic, but whatever it is about this shaver, it actually IS better.&lt;br /&gt;The shaves take me 4 minutes (took 7 minutes with the 8109s), which could account for the slightly lower irritation (it was low to beginwith the the Panasonic units anyways).&lt;br /&gt;My chin is definitely less irritated thanks to this shaver really handling it well, whereas with the 8109S, I had to go over it many times to get it cleared (with this one, just once or twice and the chin is cleared).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other observations, for those who may care:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s made in Japan&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s louder, but the pitch of the buzzing is lower and quite soothing&lt;br /&gt;-battery is Li-Ion, similar to cellphones, where it suffers a lot less &#x27;battery memory&#x27; issues.  This is a big plus for me, as I would always worry with the 8109S that if I charge it every day, it would deteriorate battery life fast, so I would end up doing &#x27;clean, dry&#x27;, but not chargeuntil the battery was down to 30%.  I was a bit worried when I saw that this shaver doesn&#x27;t have that choice (you can only pick clean or dry, but charge is always picked for you as soon as you dock it), until I saw that it&#x27;s an Li-Ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;-cartridges are the same as the 8109S, so I didn&#x27;t have to throw out the spares I had left over&lt;br /&gt;-cleaning is easy.  either dock it and let it clean (the manual gives you 30 days of usage once you start a new cartridge, so no sense in skimping out).  I also use liquid soap (as per the manual) to clean every other time, and the soap I picked is an anti-bacterial, as my sensitive skin means I sometimes get rashes from shaving too (so far, not with this shaver, which I had for a month)&lt;br /&gt;-shaver is heavier than the 8109S, especially at the top, but not too heavy to be comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;-&#x27;shaking out the water&#x27; needs to be done with care on this one-put a finger on the head, and don&#x27;t shake too hard, as the head is mobile, and heavy (in the 8109s, it was just sideways mobile, and stayed put because it was light).&lt;br /&gt;-many users complain about the light, and yes, it is super-bright, and the bedroom looks like an airport at night if the bathroom door is open.  Yes, Panasonic: it&#x27;s nice that the screen is bright, but did it really have to flash every two seconds indefinitely once fully-charged?  I just put a tissue or two over the unit and that&#x27;s enough.  I suggest doing the same to all those whom it bothers&lt;br /&gt;-Shaver works very well with the Nivea Foam that I use (I found this to be the best for sensitive skin, both the white and blue bottles).  Needs to be rinsed-out mid way, as the foam builds up too much, but other than that, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  super-recommended for those who still use the Phillips or other rotating shavers, and for those considering switching from the 2-blade units that Panasonic sells.</li>
    <li> I have had two older models both with the linear motor. I have the es-la63 but the &#x27;93 is the same shaver plus the Vortex stand. Great  product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is much more usable without the \\&quot;foil frame\\&quot; where the black foil \\&quot;carrier\\&quot; is exposed. This way the shaver is much easier to get closer under the nose and easier to see what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what to do about securing the cap? I made an elastic \\&quot;chin strap\\&quot; to hold the cap on. Using one of those hair bands with a hole (3/16 drill bit BY HAND) where each release tab \\&quot;bulge\\&quot; is. The \\&quot;chin\\&quot; being that area under the pivot.  Just knot the band on the outside of the cover just like you would for a hat strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt; For the longer and stubborn  neck hairs use the trimmer but drag it up your neck (upside down) with the foil facing down. This shaver now is a Five Star!</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for 1 year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor does a great job of shaving - close and comfortable.  The head feels a little large, but you adjust to it pretty quickly.  The trimmer while appearing small compared to the head is actually the same size as other Panasonic trimmers.  It is just a little more awkward to use because of the large head.  You do get used to it but I actually do not use the trimmer that much - I have another trimmer that is easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is a bit heavier than most but it is not overly heavy or uncomfortable to hold/use.  It fits the hand well and it does not feel heavy no matter how long shaving takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - The module works well, but I prefer to just clean the shaver myself (the directions for the shaver say use liquid soap and water) and just use the drying function of the cleaning unit.  Not sure if this helps the shaver last any longer, but I do like the idea of drying the shaver and not letting water sit on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display for the battery is easy to see - although the battery life does not display when shaving.  This is only an issue if the battery is low when you began shaving and you want to know how much time before the shaver dies as your shaving.  You have to turn the unit off to see the battery display.  The good news is that the unit charges very quickly.  It will charge enough to get you through a shave in about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head Shaving:  The other great thing about this unit is that I use it to also shave my head.  It works great and I get a close shave over the entire head.  Even if I miss a day of shaving my head and the hair gets a little longer, the shaver does a great job with no hair pulling or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving my entire head and face with this unit for just over a year now and I have had no issues at all.  While I am still using the original blades/foils and am still getting a close shave, I think it is just about time to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that this is a great unit.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> No matter how much I cleaned the unit I kept getting the red light error message. Tossed razor in garbage and I would never reorder. Junk. OK shave but Braun better.</li>
    <li> The absolute BEST shaver I have used -- much better than my previous Braun.  It gets very close.  Not as close as when I use a double sided safety razor, but about as close as a disposable.  I can get a good shave in about three minutes, and have no irritation (helped by ritually using Burts Bees Aftershave lotion immediately after shaving).  The cleaning cycle works great, and the mixture last a long time before needing to be replaced.  Also, it has no smell -- unlike Braun&#x27;s.  Braun&#x27;s cleaner is more of an alcohol based mixture.  Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning cartridges are more of a filter element saturated in a soap.  It has a tank that you fill with water, which dissolves the soap the first time it is used, and this is stored in the tank and repeatedly cycled through the filter on the cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway -- great shaver and definitely worth the money considering the time I same each week by using it.  I&#x27;m a daily shaver, and shaving with a razor used to take me seven minutes, so I&#x27;m saving 28 minutes a week with this shaver!</li>
    <li> 1) I have had this unit about 5 years now. I&#x27;ve had to replace the foil/blade quite a few times now, as one would expect. I know when it&#x27;s time to replace when I feel my whiskers being tugged, generally every 6 months of daily use. I have tough whiskers (I could scour pots with my beard if I wanted to lol!)  The battery, motor seem to be less efficient now than when the unit was new, so it&#x27;s not immortal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the good. Best shave ever by any method I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve owned Norelcos, Brauns, and Remingtons a-plenty. My skin doesn&#x27;t tolerate being blade shaved, I could be the poster boy for razor burn! I get the best results using it dry, promoting a baby-butt like texture to my face : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you own this razor you probably already know but in case you don&#x27;t, you can extend the life of the cleaning cartridges immeasurably by rinsing the blades and foil assembly under the faucet before doing a cleaning/charge cycle. I&#x27;ll get another one of these if they&#x27;re still available when mine finally gives up the ghost.</li>
    <li> I love it.Enjoy the convenience of a quick shave using the dry operation or use wet, with foam or gel, for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Well made and cuts close, almost as good as a straight razor shave but not quite. Holds the charge well and is easy to use. Really like it</li>
    <li> A few thoughts on this great product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;m writing this review over two years after I purchased it and after use multiple times each week it STILL feels like it&#x27;s brand new. I&#x27;ve lugged it around on trips a handful of times and it&#x27;s proven to be very durable and has lived up to it&#x27;s high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I use it as a dry shave and even so, it actually almost feels GOOD while I&#x27;m shaving with this. Yeah, I said it. That&#x27;s how comfortable it is the first use after I clean it. It gives me as close of a shave as I can possibly expect from an electric shaver. I never get any irritation on my face. Once and awhile I&#x27;ll get a little on my neck, but it&#x27;s not much and it&#x27;s gone quickly even without using any kind of lotion on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The trimmer cuts through thick hair like you can&#x27;t imagine. If I have let my beard grow out longer than usual to where it&#x27;s pretty thick, I usually just take it out with the trimmer then finish off with the normal shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I like the extras. The cleaning system works great and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. In fact, last week I dropped it on my stone tile floor from four feet while I was changing the cleaning cartridge and after having a minor freak out I plugged it in and it worked perfectly and had no physical damage. That&#x27;s actually what reminded me to write this review. The carrying case is very nice and has worked well when I&#x27;m on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note on the cleaning cartridges: Panasonic recommends you change them every month, but I usually get by on two, even when I use the system a lot, which I don&#x27;t. I usually simply rinse it under the faucet and it does fine. The system only comes with one cartridge, so you&#x27;ll need more pretty soon. When that time comes, get these: [[ASIN:B000BF1396 Panasonic WES035P Vortex HydraClean Shaving System Solution Cartridges for Men&#x27;s Shaver (ES8109S, ES8228S, ES8249S, ES-LA93-K, ES-LV81-K) Count - 3]]. It&#x27;s a three pack that will last you over six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, you hate making big purchases. When I made this purchase, I put it off forever. But it was completely worth it. It has done an amazing job over the past two years and I fully expect it to last me a long time into the future.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never did I believe that an electric razor could shave your face baby-bottom smooth, but this thing can.  I&#x27;ve been using it for well over a year now and it&#x27;s showing no signs of slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny and I&#x27;ll be buying Panasonic razors henceforth.</li>
    <li> The very best electric shaver on the market. If you wet the shaver under the faucet it really works better with the shaving gel</li>
    <li> The reviews and advertizing indicates it gives a razor-close shave; it does not.  However, it is easy to use and keep clean.  It shaves close enough that others don&#x27;t notice the shave not to be razor close unless dragging a credit card across one&#x27;s face.  Still and all, it works well, is very nice to have on journeys abroad (charger works with current from 100-240 volts), and I use it under normal circumstances for everyday shaving and revert to the foam and razor only for very special events.</li>
    <li> I searched for a while before buying this electric razor for my husband for Christmas.  This was rated one of the best electric razors for African-American men and my husband seems to really like it.  It is keeping his face pretty smooth which is nice because he is prone to in-grown hairs.  He uses it about every other day and we haven&#x27;t had any problems yet.  We gave it a 4 because it is really loud when cleaning.  Our son&#x27;s bedroom is on the other side of the wall and it woke him up one night while it was cleaning.  I am not totally convinced it was worth the money that I paid, but my husband does like.</li>
    <li> Japanese designs are all about performance and this one lives up to expectation. The battery is actually very good.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for travelers!</li>
    <li> This shaver gets as close as a blade without the irritation that inevitably follows a close blade shave.  I was amazed that the unit felt as comfortable to handle as it did.  It is a huge shaver but has great ergonomics.  I am unable to create the sensation of discomfort no matter how hard I press or how many times I go over the same area.  Also, no more ingrowns.  If you can justify the cost, go for it.</li>
    <li> I went from Norelco&#x27;s top-of-the-line triple-disc razor (I forget the model now) to Braun&#x27;s Series 7 to this, and this is by far the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  It shaves extremely close, is as comfortable as a warm cloud on your face, and feels well built.  The price is high, but if you want the best electric shave possible, pick up this baby!</li>
    <li> Me...  -Heavy thick beard--60 grit sandpaper like.   -Need to shave every day  -Had zero confidence in electric shavers--tried them and they did not do the job for my beard    ES-LA93K...  -Outstanding shave results..blade shave is marginally,and I truly mean marginally closer--considering the cuts you get with a blade it is not worth it  -Great feel, well constructed and excellent clean/dry cycle  -I am now shaving every day, including weekends (which I used to take off to give my face a break when using a blade)    Things to consider...  -Use it for 30 at least days--you will be hooked.</li>
    <li> To start off with I have sensitive skin. For the longest time I used the most expensive Gilette Blade Razors available (at the time was Mach 5). In Nov 2009 after many nicks and cuts I decided to give electric shaving another try. See I tried using an electric razor in 2002. At that time I purchased the best that Norelco had to offer.  Though that razor work well on my cheeks, it did a terrible job on my neck and I gave up electric shaving after 3-months.    So as I mention, in Nov 2009 I started looking at electric razors again. I spent many hours researching and reading reviews and it came down between the best that Panasonic had to offer and the best that Braun had to offer.  Honestly it was a toss up and I chose Panasonic because the ESLA93 was a brand new release model that had only been out a couple of months. The Braun model had not been updated for a couple of years. Yeah I know that sounds silly but that&#x27;s how I chose the Panasonic.     Well over 8-months later I can honestly say that I made a good choice. This Razor works like a charm and the self cleaning feature is awesome but a bit noisy.     As recommended I change my cleaning filter monthly and this has kept my razor looking, smelling, and working like it is brand new.     The shave is as close as a blade and does not cut me. The only issue that I had is that my skin took a little bit longer than the suggested 30-days to adjust to electric shaving.  It wasn&#x27;t until about the 7th week that I noticed that my skin was fully adjusted.    Though this shaver is a little pricey, I would recommend it to anyone and put my stamp of approval on it.</li>
    <li> Great shaver!  Purchased the Panasonic ES-LA93 Arc4 as a replacement for my Norelco and could not be happier.  Works great and provides a very smooth and clean shave.  I no longer get any skin irritation from shaving like I did with my Norelco ARC</li>
    <li> I have been a different shaver user for over 40 years.  When I went to order new blades I was shocked by the price and the poor reviews.  It was time for a change.  I have only had this razor for 3 weeks but it is great.  Beats my old razor hands down.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m so glad I bought this razor.the quality is there throughout the shaver and stand.i bought it because of all the great reviews.i knew it would produce a great wet shaving experience.and it really does.i was surprised that it gives such an incredible dry shave too.the readout display gives all the right info.cleaning and drying procedures are easily done with the touch of one button.i get a close shave with a two day old beard in under two minutes.very smooth results.i definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> **I should start out by first prefacing that, before purchasing this, I have been using a Gillette Fusion straight razor for the past 4 years and hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver since before that time (I had an old Norelco one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after being a straight razor user for 4 years, I decided to purchase this electric shaver for a few reasons: (1) Convenience--I could shave anywhere, in the shower, in the bathroom, the car, etc., (2) It was supposed to be really easy to clean (to get a good shave every time), (3) my wife was tired of me &amp;#34;forgetting to shave&amp;#34; in those crucial moments that we are late and need to leave the house right away, (4) it got great reviews, (5) the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-LA93-K doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I put a lot of research into which shaver to get and it all seems to come down to personal preferences at the end of the day. The one shining point for me with this was that the general consensus on performance and design was extremely positive from most people that had purchased this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a non-performance, strictly visual/design standpoint, the shaver is gorgeous, both in and out of the included charger/cleaning base. It is also lightweight and the ergonomics when holding it and using it are really wonderful. You can tell that a lot of effort went into the design of it to get it to feel right in your hand and on your face. My wife also likes the way it looks on the bathroom countertop (which gives me brownie points with her!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fit and finish of the base and cleaning system are great too. The shaver slides into the base very easily and rests in it nicely. There is a flashing blue LED that is constantly on when it is in the base that some reviewers have said is bright and annoying. I could give them that for sure. If you are plugging it in and setting it up within eyesight of your bed at night, I could see how that could be an issue. Mine is in my bathroom (away from my bedroom&#x27;s line-of-sight) and so it isn&#x27;t an issue for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance goes--I am, seriously, impressed beyond all expectations. The shaver delivers a very close shave dry with absolutely no irritation of my skin (and I have VERY sensitive skin when shaving normally). That&#x27;s a first for me! It generally takes about 2-3 minutes to get a really solid shave with this and it never feels uncomfortable or awkward to use--it just fits in your hand well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the shaver really shines is when it is used &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; or with a shaving gel (make sure you use on recommended for electric shavers--regular creams and gels will clog up in the cutting heads). It is baby smooth and gets even closer than using it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;--again, with zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A side note and recommendation that I have to get the most out of a shave with it, is something that I stumbled upon in some other reviews here (and I am so glad I did!) in regards to shaving cream/lubricant. There were a few reviews that recommended the Billy Jealousy Hydroplane cream with it (also available at Amazon). I wasn&#x27;t even aware of the brand before that and didn&#x27;t even know what it was. It is a specially formulated cream/lotion that is very light and extremely slick (for the blades). I can&#x27;t tell you how awesome the combo of both the shaving lotion and this shaver are--it literally gets as close a shave as I was getting with a straight razor, with no irritation, my skin is actually more moisturized after, and it doesn&#x27;t clog up the blades in the shaver either. The bottle is a bit pricey at $20 or so, but it will probably last about 6 months, and I couldn&#x27;t, at this point, see me shaving without it (even with a straight razor--it&#x27;s that good!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system works well (you need to add some filtered water to the base and &amp;#34;plug-in&amp;#34; the cleaning fluid to it). I have not had any issues so far, and when I use it, the next shave feels just as new and as good as the first. I like that. If you don&#x27;t use the cleaning base (maybe you&#x27;re in the shower, etc.), it opens up and allows you to rinse it very easily too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I would say that if you are in the market for either a first jump into an electric shaver, or are looking to replace on that you currently have, I don&#x27;t see a way that you could be disappointed with this. It looks great, feels solid and comfortable, gives a fantastic shave with no irritation to speak of and just performs the way you would hope a shaver would. Panasonic did an excellent job with this and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> a great gift for my father, and he likes it very much, and he said it is more comfortable and convenient to use this one shaver.</li>
    <li> Husband loved it! He does not use razor blades anymore.  Good quality; have had it over a year now</li>
    <li> The ES-LA93K is a clear improvement over my prior Panasonic shaver.  It is the fastest to use of any I&#x27;ve tried (still requires several passes but fewer than any other I&#x27;ve used and over the years I&#x27;ve used all major brands).  The shave is noticably closer truly approaching razor closeness.  I have yet to get any razer burn or rash.  It is quieter.  I like the recharging station better.  And the shaver retains the same great features of prior Panasonic razors -- the main one being you can rinse it after every use under the tap thereby preserving the blades basically indefinetely.  I rinse it each time I use it.  If you are so motivated you can even use soap on it though I don&#x27;t find that to be necessary.  I put it in for a clean cycle in the recharging unit when it needs to be recharged.  This regimine has kept my last Panasonic working flawlessly for 5 years.  Because the razor is basically mostly clean when I put it into the unit, replacement of the cleaning cartridge is reduced to just a few times a year.  Overall it is hard to find fault with this razor.  For those who prefer a foil type shaver I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Used to use the es8249....this wasn&#x27;t even close.  Terrible shave.  bumped up to the ES-LV61 which is better, but still not spectacular.  Battery life was poor, and it came with that stupid charging base which is yet another way for the company to drain your wallet for the cleaner refills.  Just use soap and save the $$</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Panasonic razor, and it is also the most expensive.  It gives an exceptionally close yet comfortable shave.  It is also quieter than previous models. However, mine is dead after about 9 months of use, and that is far from acceptable for a luxury product in this price range.  My work requires a fair amount of business travel, so my shaver gets packed frequently, but has never been dropped or misused.  I have a very average beard, and shave in the shower with shaving cream, therefore, there is no credible reason why my shaver should have failed so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the LCD display on all Panasonic razors tend to be too fragile and are the first things to die; in mine, this happened after only 5 months of use.  Previous Panasonic razors have had the display fade and fail after about 12 to 18 months of use.  Panasonic should find a new supplier for their LCD displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 9 months of use, the Panasonic just stopped working.  I cannot tell what is going on, since the display, which should tell the status of the shaver, stopped working months earlier.  I will send it in for repair, but I suspect that the repair will cost as much as a new shaver, which is a shame.  I really wanted this shaver to last, since I liked the close and comfortable shave, but it just is not built robustly enough to stand up to even gentle use.  I am therefore unable to recommend this model.  I will likely try a Braun next, in the hope that it is better made and will therefore hold up longer.</li>
    <li> Good shaver but the shave is not as good as the Braun I replaced.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic gives me a closer shave than my Braun series 7.  The trimmer is not as convenient or well placed as the Braun&#x27;s but I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaved for so many years now. I know it&#x27;s well over 4 years old. This thing still works like a charm. I&#x27;ve only bought replacement cleaning cartridges about a 3 pack every year. It is recommended to replace the foil &amp; shaved blades but I have not done that &amp; I still have a great shave (which is every other day). I&#x27;m thinking I should replace those parts soon, but why bother when everything still feels brand new. Buy this, of all my shaving products I have had this the longest.</li>
    <li> About as good as an electric razor could be.  I thought, for the price, it would be as good as a cartridge shaver.  Not quite!</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic Razor and I have to say it&#x27;s the best. I stopped using my older one years ago and just got fed up with buying replacement blades on my Gillette Fusion. I just tried the Vortex last night and it gave me the cleanest shave from an electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had. With my older Vortex I would have to make multiple passes on my neck but this one it only took two passes. I also used a shave soap to help with any razor burn. It&#x27;s been two years since my last electric shave but I have to say I was impressed with how good and comfortable the shave was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I will make updates as the weeks go by.</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome.  Never had a machine shave so close.  I&#x27;ve had 2 Norelco&#x27;s.  The first was great but it gave up. The second couldn&#x27;t find a hair to cut longer than 1/8\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m retired and the beard is occasionally allowed to grow.  My beard&#x27;s coarseness on a 1-10 scale is about a 6.  With that in mind I&#x27;m finished shaving in 30 to 40 seconds.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver for my son.  He did not like it at all.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> For Christmas I ordered my husband the Panasonic Shaver....it was the priciest one, but well worth it for him!  He says it&#x27;s the closest, smoothest shave he&#x27;s ever had with an electric shaver.....and it&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve owned a number of razers in my life but this one beats them all . it shaves as good as a razer. i highly reccomend this one.</li>
    <li> Best razor i ever had. You can feel your skin.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for 20+ years. I started with Norelco (Philips) and then changed to Braun. After 4 Brauns (each lasted 3 years or so), I just bought this Panasonic and it is the best razor for me to date. I always bought top end Norelcos and Brauns so the comparison is apples to apples. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> u&#x27;ve had this shaver for over a month now and I love it!  I havent had one in a long time and the last one i used was a low priced one about 15 years ago.  I am glad I had the money to get a good one when I decided to try one again.  This shaver is great.  It does take about 4 or 5 minutes to get a nice smooth shave, but i could never get this close with a regular razor before.  I like the cleaning base as well, keeps the razor performing properly when used right. I shave with shaving cream and water with no problem.  Great buy and would do it again easily!</li>
    <li> I have been a blade user for almost 50 years and suffered with nicks, cuts and raw red irritations on my neck.  About 6 years ago I tried a Braun electric &amp; 3 years ago I tried the Norelco Arctic, but still got red irritations on my neck without the close shave I experienced with a blade.  Both razors were sent back during the trial period.  I felt it was time to try another electric and stumbled onto the Panasonic razor.  From the first day, I experienced a close shave with NO irritation anywhere.  It is faster than a blade, not the 3 minutes that the instruction booklet says but maybe 7 minutes.  After all when you measure the time of wetting your face, putting on shaving cream and then rinsing off the cream, it takes a while especially if you get nicked.  Buy this shaver and never look back. I am sold. You will be too.</li>
    <li> I never imagined that an electric shaver could shave as close as a blade, but this electric shaver does. Great product Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and decided to write a review.     The Good:    I no longer have to prime my face with hot water from a shower or otherwise like when using a blade. I can just start right away on my dry face.     Does a decent job and I get a pretty close shave....at least above the neck/jaw line.     Charge lasts a long time and is simple to clean with just soap and hot water. I never use the cleaning base anymore.       The Bad:    Does a terrible job on the neck and lower jaw. I have to go over and over the same spots at different angles and it still misses a lot.     A little rough on the face and especially the neck. Leaves some razor burn marks/bumps.         Overall it&#x27;s a good product. It will not nearly come as close as a shave with a razor but the fact that you can just pick this up and shave without priming your face without water is a huge plus. I still use the razor if I&#x27;m going out and need to be extremely clean shaven. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other latest model/brand cordless shavers but would recommend this product. The base is cool for charging but it&#x27;s absolutely (in my opinion) not needed for cleaning. It&#x27;s just a waste of time and money buying the cartridges etc. Most would probably be happier just buying this unit without the base. If you want the cool look of the base for charging then get this one.</li>
    <li> Ok so I have only shaved a couple of times so far (and never with an electric razor), but all I can say is WOW!  I was completely skeptical about electrics.  I thought they would not give a good shave and definitely wouldn&#x27;t leave me feeling that crisp clean and new feeling after a shave with a brand new mach3.  Boy was I wrong.  Not only was my shave close and super fast, but it didnt irritate at all.  Super product!  A little pricey to those of us who think that $20 is crazy for razors, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with an electric foil razor since around the late 80&#x27;s.  I have always had Braun electric razors until this Panasonic.  During all of those years I&#x27;d say that actual shaving quality has improved little with battery life seeing the most improvement.  Also during that time companies have figured out how to further monetize electric shavers through such things as cleaning systems.  Be it for Braun, Panasonic, etc., it is of dubious value but some make it more affordable than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having Braun for so long I made the switch due to my neck.  As my previous 8-year old Braun 7 Series&#x27; battery started to die, I began looking at alternatives that I thought would have a reasonable chance of finally being a \\&quot;complete\\&quot; razor for me.  By complete I mean a razor I could use without having to do some small clean-up with a manual safety razor as I have always had to do for my neck.  I felt I had given Braun ample opportunity over the years, but while they have always been top notch in reliability and offered a great shave on my face, they have failed continuously to shave my neck to a reasonable degree.  Thus this Panasonic enters the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a big fan of cleaning systems which as mentioned before are over-priced and offer dubious value.  I was actually looking at the non self-cleaning version of this razor, when I found I could get this version for $150 here at Amazon.  For less than $20 difference I felt it was a good enough deal especially as it would serve to hold the razor and the cleaning solution itself is vastly cheaper than Braun&#x27;s (although a bit more cumbersome).  Upon receiving this unit I charged it complete in it&#x27;s base overnight before setting out trying it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I am glad I waited a week before writing this review because my first reactions were not very positive.  However, after spending more time with the razor I began finding better ways to wield it around my face.  My face is well adjusted to foils after all of these years, but I found the angle you use this at to be very important (more so than my old Braun).  Therefore my personal star meter went from an initial two to the current four.  This Panasonic shaved my entire face closer than my old Braun and, most importantly, it does finally allow me to shave my neck to a degree that I don&#x27;t feel I need to clean up with a manual razor.  Clearly a big win.  While it is not perfect and not as close as a blade (at least not on the neck) it is close enough that my manual razor is now in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the timer function, I find it takes me between 6-8 minutes to shave complete.  Longer than my old Braun, but to be fair, it shaves the neck and overall provides a closer shave.  So, I find this to be a good trade-off.  However, the Panasonic foils do get quite warm (I am not pressing hard either) while the Braun never did.  For this reason I&#x27;d recommend shaving the upper lip area earlier in the process if you don&#x27;t do so already.  I typically did that area last, but found it a little uncomfortable due to the heat.  The neck does take work at multiple angels and frankly there is no part of the face that won&#x27;t require multiple passes.  Despite the size of the head, I certainly don&#x27;t think it is more efficient.  I also don&#x27;t think it glides over the face as easily as did the Braun.  I should mention at this point that I shave dry and will continue to do so.  If I have to buy shaving cream, etc., I have lost what I see is the major advantage of an electric.  That said and you do have the option with the Panasonic while you do not with the Braun.  The best part of this option for me is that I can at least clean it under the water quickly versus the Braun where I had to use a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the trimmer on this Panasonic more than on my old Braun as I find it to be more precise with my sideburns.  It is a smaller trimmer, but I find it to be a bit more effective.There is a button on the back of the head that allows for free floating head (used for most of the face/neck), locked head (upper lip), and the pop up trimmer.  Very straight forward.  Just one on/off button in front and a superfluous LCD display which shows shave time, battery life, and other status.  I really don&#x27;t think an LCD is required as it is just another thing to go wrong.  External led displays would have been sufficient for the statuses you need.  Additionally, if left charging, the LCD will blink a very bright blue color continuously to let you know it is finished.  Extremely obnoxious.  Why they think that this info is so critical as to require a neon flashing sign is beyond me.  An exit sign in a burning building is okay. Saying that the charge is done...not so much.  I actually place my razor at an angle in the base so that it doesn&#x27;t charge each day and I don&#x27;t have to come in the middle of the night just to be blinded by the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning process is more involved than the Braun which just requires the cartridge.  The Panasonic also requires filling a canister at back with water.  However, given the much lower cost of cleaning solution versus the Braun, and I&#x27;d say this is a fair trade.  The cartridge supposedly lasts as long as the Braun&#x27;s which is daily for 30-days.  Like the Braun I will use it weekly.  The cleaning cycle/drying is extremely long at something over 90 minutes.  I cannot fathom how such a small device would require this kind of time.  That said and you don&#x27;t need to stand there and watch it.  I also don&#x27;t find the noise it makes to be any greater than the Braun&#x27;s system although again it does last substantially longer.  This unit also comes with a carrying case, however, the case is not big enough to house the plug (unlike Braun&#x27;s).  I also understand that, unlike Braun&#x27;s unit, you cannot use this razor while plugged in.  I haven&#x27;t tried this, but frankly it was not a feature I ever needed to use with Braun.  I havenot tested the accuracy of the battery life indicator against reality as I charge it once a week.  The LCD would indicate that it is the best I can get, but again have not confirmed.  I don&#x27;t see this is a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics and build quality seem okay, but not up to Braun standards.  What this may mean for longevity is obviously something I will eventually find out.  I would be very surprised if it lasted as long as my Braun&#x27;s have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is impossible for me to say whether this performs better than a new Braun would have.  What I can say is that it was much cheaper for me and it does the job.  I think I paid a fair price at $150, but would not agree that this is a $200+ shaver.  Certainly the cleaning system isn&#x27;t Worth $70+ over their non self-cleaning version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaves very close and does an acceptable job on the neck&lt;br /&gt;- Good trimmer for sideburns&lt;br /&gt;- Option for wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;- Much cheaper cleaning solution vs. Braun&lt;br /&gt;- Option to self-clean with soap and water for \\&quot;free\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;- Quick charge if you run out of juice&lt;br /&gt;- At $150 was a fair deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Foil gets quite warm&lt;br /&gt;- Does require work to get that close shave&lt;br /&gt;- Obnoxious flashing blue display&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely long clean/dry cycle&lt;br /&gt;- Travel case does not fit plug&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning solution doesn&#x27;t smell that great&lt;br /&gt;- Cannot shave while plugged into an outlet&lt;br /&gt;- Too expensive at its current regular $200+ price point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have since found that this razor does not last me a full week on a single charge.  It lasts me about 6-days which equates to roughly 40-minutes of shave time.  The unit will kick off immediately upon reaching zero although since you can turn it on again for a bit, means that the battery isn&#x27;t really dead.  There is only a brief second or two decrease in shave power to alert you to the shutdown.  I can confirm that the shaver will not work while plugged in which is unfortunate.  That said and if you plug in the razor for a few minutes to charge, you should be able to get through a shave afterwords.  In other words it does do a reasonable quick charge to make up for the lack of use while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: I thought I would update this review as it has been nearly 1.5 year since my purchase.  I continue to use the blade and foil that came with the unit and I have not noticed any degradation in performance.  Although I was a long time electric foil razor user, I did see my shave times drop after further use of this product to somewhere between 4:45 and 5:10 minutes per daily shave on average.  I would recommend prior to putting the shaver through the clean cycle that you rinse it well.  This won&#x27;t take more than a few seconds and it will prevent the cleaning unit from clogging with tiny hairs.  I also tend to put it through its charge/clean cycle whenever the shaver gets to 20% or less after a shave.  I have found when using it under 20% that it can slow at a certain point so 20% is a good marker to make sure the last shave is a good one.  I still have no troubles in recommending this product as laid out in the review above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3: It has now been 2-years and unfortunately this thing no longer works.  There is vibration in the head but the blades no longer move.  Battery is fine and blades/foil were replaced a few months back.  Extremely disappointed in the quality as I certainly expected this thing to last more than 2-years.  Back to Braun for me.</li>
    <li> Needed to start shaving again. My beard was 12 years old and my circumstances have changed. So rather than manual ( Shaving cream, blades, blade holders ) I decided to try electric. Read the reviews. Decided to try this one.    I used the side burn trimmer to thin the forest ( fine, not dense hair ), after clearing cutting, a day was given over for recovery ( yikes, who is that ) before going after the stumps in the desert.    I have found that keeping the unit clean ( I dry shave ) by using compressed air after each use to remove the fine cellular &amp; hair stubble from the mechanism ( pull the cover/screen ) appears to keep the machine working.    I bought the whole kit with extra parts, I have used the cleaning ( wet system ) once or twice, it seems to do an OK job, my cleaning with air probably aids the process.    I have used it on the side of my head ( Old baldy on top ) and it has worked OK just be aware of the need for multiple pass&#x27;s over the same terrain surfaces are going to be necessary as it is not a single pass tool from my limited experience.</li>
    <li> Coming from Braun electrics for the past 10 yrs, the Panny was a nice upgrade.  I&#x27;ve only used the shaver a few times, but so far I&#x27;m impressed, close shave</li>
    <li> This razor &#x3D; $200.00    Mach 3 blades I used to purchase(per month)&#x3D;$100.00    Now, comfort/closeness of shave/no nicks or bumps &#x3D; PRICELESS    If U dont buy this PERFECT razor, you deserve to keep putting your hard earned money in the pockets of Shick  and Gillette shareholders -your choice. Nuff said!</li>
    <li> I had ES8238 and it was very good and better than other shaver that I have used in 30 years. but this ES-LA93-K is some thing else. It is so accurate, so faster and in one word (excellent). I am so happy to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 days - and so far, it&#x27;s great! I had an old Braun 5200(?) series before and could not find replacement foils and blades so I decided it was time for an upgrade... I was NOT disappointed! Shaving with this shaver feels so... precise... I just hope I don&#x27;t run into the same issues with the LED that others have mentioned.</li>
    <li> I had the Norelco 1050CC for a couple of years; and it was alright, not bad, but I wanted a new shaver. After doin a little research, I went with this Panasonic. Awesome! I never tried a Panasonic shaver before, only Norelcos, but I&#x27;m glad I did... Just mad I waited so long. Gives a great shave,  exceptionally close and fast. Love it!</li>
    <li> I never have had an electric shaver shave like this does!! None of my other shavers would cut so close and not burn my neck. This shaver not only out do all the rest I&#x27;ve used, but it has a great cleaning device in the stand. I&#x27;ve used it dry and wet with amazing results. A bit pricy, but it is surely worth it. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good~I like it.I will be back soon.So i will take ti more.It&#x27;s very very good.It&#x27;s very very nice.</li>
    <li> Gives really good shave, even if it takes a lot longer than I thought it would (not the fault of the razor though)</li>
    <li> Powerful, very clean shaven, is to spend more than one hour each wash, but it does not matter, in the hope too long. Price relative to China to be much cheaper.</li>
    <li> It is very good and very good quality.  I recommend it highly. I can not make any comparisons because it is the first one to buy&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I was wanting to get a better shave on my beard than I was getting from a rotary which I have been using for over a decade, and I have sensitive skin, and after researching the best sensitive skin razor, i decided to give the Panasonic a try to see if it made a difference. It did make a difference when i started using it, close, and works great in the shower, but its loud and if you are used to a rotary shaver, its going to take some getting used to. It shaves closer than the high end Norelco that i also tried out, and cleans up well too, I just rinse it off and put it away, never bothered with the included cleaning base as I saw that it was loud too, and I just don&#x27;t like that. I am not sure it is as comfortable as the norelco, as that glides across your face and this does that but not as good as the norelco. The charge is good, i had charged it the first day, and did not have to charge it for three weeks, but I only shave two or three times a week. Its made in Japan, well built, and powerful, but it does not get the hairs at the neck like most electric shavers, and you have to go back a couple of times to get those spots, which can cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ultimately decided it was too noisy, and not very good at keeping the irritation down on my neck and chin, but guess what, Amazon has a crazy restock fee for item that have been opened, they have a high one for unopened items that you just don&#x27;t want, but its up to 50% restock fee for opened stuff, even if it was not up to par for what you need! You won&#x27;t see this on their site in plain English, you have to search for it, but I am stuck with it, and only used it 4 times in a month. I will Ebay it, I paid 163.00 with shipping, so i can sell it on ebay for what i paid, since Amazon and other retailers are still selling it for close to 200.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice shaver if you like foils, but amazons return policy has gone down the tubes, and I will only buy from here if it is something I know I will never need to return, and most things I do not, this is my first attempt at a return here, and it is pricey!</li>
    <li> The shave performance is best... closest shave ever...the cleaning was confusing.. not sure whether to use the cumbersome and costly device or the simple quick soap and water when the cleaning light goes on.. this is after i bought the extra cleaning supplies, etc.... would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This razor is exceptional but it does not shave as close as a razor blade. I also use it to shave my head and it does quite well. The self cleaning unit does a fine job of cleaning the blades but it makes noise that some will not tolerate especially in the early morning hours.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars for giving a close shave. The reality is when you are using blades underneath a foil shield how can it possibly shave as close as a blade on bare skin?</li>
    <li> buy Norelco and save $100 and get a better shave. I don&#x27;t know why I still use this thing. I bought it because it was said to be the best. After years of using $100 Norelcos and being happy with them, I look up some reviews, and ending up with this piece of junk.  The microscreen had a hole it within a week. It&#x27;s got this huge base which takes up half of the counter around the sink. When I charge it overnight, the blue LED&#x27;s keep me and my wife awake. It&#x27;s like a UFO just landed in our bathroom. And for some reason Panasonic thought that knowing how long I&#x27;ve been shaving with it was important as it tells you 2 mins 10 sec and so on. Why is that necessary?&lt;br /&gt;NOW, reread the title of this review.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever owned. Cannot go wrong. Very smooth, no nicks, close shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband since he&#x27;s very picky about using an electric razor.  He didn&#x27;t think the shave would be close enough and was ready to not like it.  He was very surprised at how nice it is and he loves it so I&#x27;m very happy to have made this purchase- A happy husband is always a good thing :)</li>
    <li> No problems with &amp;#34;breaking-in&amp;#34; this electric shaver!  I shave &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; with no pain or scraps.  The &amp;#34;free setting&amp;#34; on the shaver is a big help for covering all spots during shaving time.  The trim function works well; it is very sharp, so you need to be careful not to cut yourself when trimming.  By the way, I finish my shaving time in about 5 minutes lest than with what my older shaver required.  I have not tried any &amp;#34;wet-shaving&amp;#34; as yet, so, I cannot comment on this function.</li>
    <li> My last shaver was a Braun which did an OK job, but I eventually just went back to using regular razors.  I got fed up with the prices of replacement blades and the fact that my face would always break out afterward.      I have to admit, my facial hair is definitely not the norm.  It grows kind of patchy and not all that fast.  It also tends to grow in every possible direction!  I would usually shave once every 3-4 days, due to the irritation.    Now I shave every other day and the results are getting better with each shave.  I lather up in the shower and shave away!  On rare occasions I have a hair or two that gets missed and I hit it with a regular razor, but that&#x27;s ok.    I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone thinking about getting an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I am changing from a Norelco 6885 and so far I think that the shave I get with this Panasonic ES-LA93-K is about the same as the old Norelco. It takes about the same amount of time to shave it seems like I have to spend alot of time going over the tough areas to get a close shave. I have found that I have to touch up the tough areas with a Gillette multi blade razor after using an electric shaver to finish with a pretty close shave.</li>
    <li> Needed to switch to an electric shaver due to blood thinner meds and the doc not wanting me to use a razor. Amazon was running a special prior to xmas for free next day shipping and it showed up the next day. I charged it and gave it a try. It worked great, didnt give me any type of rash shaves just like a razor. I dont have anything to compare it too but dont know what else you could do better.</li>
    <li> An update to my review: I initially gave this item five stars.  I am now taking that back to three stars.  What I wrote about this electric shaver still holds, but I would like to comment on the pop up trimmer, which I have tried using a few times in the month since receiving this razor.  Simply put - the pop up trimmer is not very good.  It does a poor job of cleaning up my sideburns and while it does trim, it takes longer than the pop up trimmer on my old Braun and does not leave a nice straight line.  For some reason, some hairs just don&#x27;t get cut leaving a jagged look.    ------------------      I bought this as a gift to myself to replace an old (seven year old) Braun Syncro.  I was torn between this razor and the newest one from Braun.  To be completely honest, I was never that impressed with the Syncro even though I do like Braun styling.  To me, this Panasonic razor looked clunky, but I bought it anyway because of the mostly glowing reviews.    The reviews are right!  This razor gives a great shave with minimal irritation (I have sensitive skin and I avoided shaving whenever possible.    Some points about this Panasonic:    It shaves quick (mine are 3-4 minutes average) and it leaves behind few hairs.    It is mostly made of plastic, but it has a solid feel and does not look cheap.    The bulbous head, though it looks unwieldy, actually does not detract when the shaver is being used.    The pop-up trimmer is in a position such that when in use you can easily see where you are trimming.    The shaver is a bit louder than my old Braun Syncro, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to that and it is no longer a distraction.    In all, I&#x27;d say this shaver works great and worth the money I spent on it.</li>
    <li> As a (formerly) dedicated rotary shaver man for over 30 years I finally found a different razor I am happy with. Took a few weeks to get used to, but this works better than any electric. Still has, like all razors, some problems with the neck area, but clearly the best so far.   I started shaving first with shaving foam, but as my technique improved I just shaved dry. Average shave time is around 2:15( 3 if I am slow) and about 30 sec to clean it--can&#x27;t beat a 3 minute shave!     I stopped using the cleaning system and instead just rinse it with a little soap after each use, as described in the manual. Dawn direct foam works great.The cleaning stand is noisy and clunky and takes a while, but it does work.</li>
    <li> I have been using exclusively electric razors for the last 40+ years. I have used up literally dozens of machines: Remingtons, Norelcos mostly, and for the last 20 years about a half a dozen Brown razors. Compared to those quite well-known and respected brands, my new Panasonic ES-LA93-K beats them all, hands down. It has given me the cleanest shave ever.  Since it is both a wet and dry razor, I think for safety reasons, it will not turn on if the charging cord is attached--I could not find any reference to this feature, but it is good to know that one cannot use the machine if the battery is totally discharged. Yet, once plugged in, within minutes the charge will be sufficient for a 4 to 5 minute session.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about a month now.  It is excellent.  This is the first electric shaver that I have used for years because after shaving with a razor and shaving cream every electric shaver was too irritating to my face.  I am using pre-shave and find it not to irritating.  I shaved once with it using shaving cream and was also happy with the results.  The shave is very fast and shaves amazingly close.  I strongly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> The ES-LA93 provides the cleanest, closest shave and most manageable system that I&#x27;ve ever had.  Its trimmer is a great great piece of work.</li>
    <li> Coming straight from a disposable shaver, I was not expecting any electric shaver to be as smooth, but this shaver gives a much smoother shave than any disposable. This shaver does require a little handy work to shave the lower neck properly, but the rest is a piece of cake.    The self-cleaning module cleans so well a shave after the clean feels like new again. Cleaning without the cleaner module (rinsing under water with a &#x27;sonic&#x27; cleaning mode) works very well also, but not as good as with the module.    This shaver has converted me, I will never go back to disposable shavers.</li>
    <li> The shaver itself is exceptional.  I&#x27;d been a satisfied Braun user for many years but decided to switch to the Panasonic because of reviews I had read.  I am very pleased with the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am very unhappy with the cleaning system.  Contrary to what the instructions say, I am having to install a new cassette of cleaning solution as often as every 7 days.  The instructions say that doing this once a month is what one can expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Panasonic doesn&#x27;t make it easy to get warranty service.  After hunting down the correct service number, I was given instructions that made no sense by someone who clearly didn&#x27;t know what he was talking about.  And to make matters worse, my only warranty service recourse is to ship the entire package -- including the shaver, which is working fine -- to a service center in New York City or in San Francisco.  This would leave me without the shaver for one to two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I switched from Braun to this Panasonic was the cost of the Braun cleaning cassettes.  But it is turning out that the Panasonic ones, less expensive per unit, will end up costing me much more because they need to be replaced much more often than their promotional piece indicate. I don&#x27;t plan on using them any more; I can clean the shaver under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Buy the shaver and forget about the cleaning system.  I don&#x27;t see it as necessary anyway and it certainly is not worth the maintenance costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later: When the warranty ran out, the cleaning system itself broke.  That is, the red light began flashing and would not turn off despite my cleaning the reservoir, the entire unit, and installing a new cartridge. This made it impossible to engage the cleaning system at all.  Furthermore, efforts to order a replacement resulted in their sending me the wrong part and then requiring several hours to trying to get connected to a human being.  Not that the problem was resolved easily once I got through to a person.  It would have cost about $100 with shipping to purchase a new cleaning base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I cannot recommend this system, despite the fact that the shaver itself does a good job.</li>
    <li> I had been using a high-end Braun for several years, so I liked the idea of an automatic cleaning system.  This shaver definitely gives me a better shave.  To get that excellent shave, I need to go over and over my whole beard-like about 5 minutes.  Time consuming, but worth it.  As for the cleaning system, I think I prefer this system to the Braun.  It should be more economical as well.  Overall, this Panasonic seems better built, better shave, and usable in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. I owned a previous vortex shaver that was cheaper. I was fairly happy with that model but this model while far more pricey gives a fantastic close shave. I dislike being ripped off by paying a few dollars for a multi bladed cartridge razor that cost a few pennies to make.  So i have been searching for alternatives. This electric shaver does a great job and is versatile so one can use shave cream or soap or not as you please. I am experimenting with a double edge safety razor as well. I fully intend to stop being enslaved to gillettes mach three. This electric is the best available i know of and does a great job. My face got a baby bottom smooth shave the first time out of the box. The display gives a full readout on available power and power consumed. It takes only one hour to fully charge from a complete discharge. The shaving head is a bit larger than the other model i had and it has more cutting surface. You can renew the shaver with a replacement screen or blades eventually. The electric shaver finally comes to compare with a manual blade shave. Bye, bye gillette!</li>
    <li> So here it is... This is a nice razor, in the sense that it looks nice, it is from a good company and works well. All of the positive reviews of this shaver made a believer out of me, a man who has shaved with a blade for almost all of my life. So I bought one, and tried it, not once, not twice, but for a full 30 days. Although the shaver is large, it feels just fine in the hand. It charges rather quickly and I don&#x27;t really care about the long clean/dry cycle... Really, who cares if it takes almost 3 hours to clean and dry it? Once you&#x27;re done using it for the day, you&#x27;re done using it for the day, and you don&#x27;t need to use it in the next 3 hours; so just set it in the cleaning cradle and forget about it. The cleaning cartridges are really not that expensive, ($10 for a pack of 3 on Amazon) come on people, stop complaining about that. Now, on to the shave:  This is in fact the fastest shaver head on the market, something ridiculous like 14,000 rpm, this is nice, but it translates to heat... Lots of heat being generated from the head after a couple of minutes of shaving. The shaver does an OK job on the face, nowhere close to a blade, but not bad. The neck and chin are another story. I have a normal chin, no cleft, no crazy jaw-line, just average man-chin. This shaver, along with all others I have tried, does not get close enough on the chin. Inevitably there are 10+ short stubbles left that require cleaning up with a blade. On the neck, even worse. Lots of hairs left behind, especially on sensitive areas which leads to shaving the area over and over and over which leads to...Yes, my friends: razor burn. Not to mention that even after shaving the neck until it is almost raw, I still had to break out my Mach 3 to clean up the left overs.   After lots of after shave lotion, and some salicylic acid to prevent the inevitable ingrown hairs, I&#x27;m writing this review. Don&#x27;t waste your money, I paid $170 for this shaver and it is being returned today. It simply is not good enough. It is just \\&quot;good\\&quot;. For that price, it should not be just good, nor should I have to do any clean up with my blade after spending 5+ minutes shaving. Just not worth it. My advice, if you&#x27;re a blade guy, stay in the club; nothing I have tried has come close to my blade, and if you&#x27;re reading this, nothing you&#x27;ve tried has either.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably close shave. Closer than the Mach3 wet shaver I have been using for years. Dry shaving has not given me any skin burn whatsoever.    Expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Usually I look at extra blades or foils on a razor as an extra attempt to appear more useful. But I was blown away at the effectiveness of this shaver! My shaving time is usually 2 minutes with my old 2 row +trimmer but now I can finish in half the time. The pivoting head proved useful as well and the motor is a little higher pitched than my old one but definitely not as loud. The only con I have is the bright, I mean, blaringly distractful, led light that blinks every couple of seconds. It&#x27;s so bright I need to cover it with the travel pouch just so that it doesn&#x27;t light up the bathroom at night. Also when you put it in the charger/dock washer, the display is upside down. This is poor design in my opinion because 99% of the time you look at it it&#x27;s when it&#x27;s in the charger. You can&#x27;t see it when it&#x27;s on your face. The last con I have is the cleaning system. It uses a cartridge that pretty much has dehydrated concentrated cleaning liquid. You fill the back reservoir with regular water that activates the cartridge, which is only rated for 30 days, no matter if you use the clean cycle daily, twice a week, weekly, or every other week. The plug also plugs into the dock in an awkward slanted angle on the right side instead of the back. Design appears to have gone entirely to the razor, which is fine, but it could have used some refinement.</li>
    <li> I converted to electric after shaving with a razor for 20 years. This shaves just as close as a razor. It does take a bit longer than shaving with a razor, but it gets the job done. I use this primarily to shave my head. After the learning curve was over, face takes about 2.5 minutes and my head takes 6-7 minutes to complete.</li>
    <li> Being a black man, and having the problems the most black men have when it come to shaving, the shaver works great !!! It allows me to shave more often, without the irritation and bumps!!! And the cleaner makes clean up a breeze!!!</li>
    <li> Was as advertised.  fast charging, fairly close shave. Still not as good as a blade razor but I don&#x27;t nick myself.  Certainly better than the last electric I bought.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not well in english, so I&#x27;ll do a very small review!   When I bought this shaver I just wanted buy the best one! From a lot of shavers I suddenly choose two: The Braun 790 and the Panasonic Es-la93. It was difficult, Braun seems that has the best brand name, but the Panasonic has o lot other thinhs better! So I choose this shaver and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied! I didn&#x27;t try the other one, but however I think this one is the best of the best shavers!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would do a good job, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.    I use it mostly for dry shaving, and it can get very close.  But as with just about electric shaver ever invented, if you want perfectly smooth skin (baby style with no razor stubble in *any* direction), then you need to use a razor blade shaver.   I&#x27;ve found that if I want perfectly smooth skin, I have to use the electric shaver for longer than I would the razor blade one.  I also have to pull my skin tight and manipulate in a lot of different directions.  Maybe others don&#x27;t have those challenges.    As of now I mostly end up using it in two ways; one, for quick shaves where I&#x27;m on the go or don&#x27;t have time for a full shave.  The second is to shave the sensitive spots, where a manual razor can catch my skin.  I zip over those areas and smooth them out, then do the manual shave in the bath.  I don&#x27;t need to shave every day so that approach works for me.  Sometimes I will do the complete shave with the electric.    Overall, I have used Brauns, Norelcos, triple heads, straight heads and others ... and this is definitely the best.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey though, so think about your use and expectations before you make the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and I can shave every day with this thing.  It&#x27;s a beast too!  I shave my face and my head in 9 minutes with no problems.  I had the $90 model of this before I upgraded and even though it would shave my head it would take about 15 minutes for just my head.  The cleaning stand is a little noisy, but whatever man, I keep it in my bathroom so I don&#x27;t listen to it.  Cleans and dries perfectly.  I was kind of skeptical about spending so much money on it, but I would do it again without a question.</li>
    <li> The razor was nice, better than my braun 7XXX, but i have to say, the cleaner just simply useless, it crushed in just one month, and what i can do is send the whole system back to panasonic, they will send a new one to me, BUT, this situation will continue, till the warranty expired.</li>
    <li> After years of appreciating my Braun 8500 series, they went and changed the replacement cutter block and foil, and I just couldn&#x27;t seem to get a decent shave (and yes, Braun apologists... it was a German-made replacement block and foil). So, I thought I&#x27;d treat myself to the [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System]]. I was able to forgive how the top-of-the-line Braun was pulling hair and cutting me for a little while, but after 30 days of \\&quot;OUCH!\\&quot; and some gross scabs, we had to break up. Sorry, Braun. It&#x27;s not me. It&#x27;s you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard good things about Panasonic, and basically stumbled in to a great deal on this razor, so I had to give it a shot. And, I have to say, I wish I had become a Panasonic convert sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave I got was excellent and consistent. It was comfortable from the very first shave, and only seems to improve. Not a single hair pulled, and not a single cut on my neck. And razor burn? A thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like how much quieter the cleaning cycle is on this razor, compared to any of the past three Braun razors I&#x27;ve owned. If I forget to clean it after I&#x27;ve shaved in the morning, I can do it before I go to bed without terrifying my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only four stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Coming from a Braun, the head on this razor is absolutely massive. It would be fine if I didn&#x27;t have a beard and was just arbitrarily shaving, but hitting the line of my beard is really challenging, because the foil is encased in black plastic. So you have to get a feel for where the plastic stops and the foil begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) While the Vortex cleaning system seems competent enough, it requires filling a separate tank with water in addition to the Vortex cartridge. You have to pick up the base, unplug it, remove / insert the Vortex cartridge, remove the tank, fill it, replace it, and plug the base back in. By comparison, the Braun Clean &amp; Renew cartridges are pre-mixed, so you push a button, the base pops up, slide the old one out and the new one in. Further, the Braun Clean &amp; Renew bases all have an indicator (or indicators) showing when the solution cartridge needs to be replaced. The Panasonic base doesn&#x27;t do this at all. And lastly, I&#x27;m mildly concerned about what impact my hard tap water will have on the longevity of the razor -- yes, I could pick up some distilled water, but how convenient is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Another base complaint -- the Braun bases look fairly contemporary, and lock the razor in when it&#x27;s being cleaned.  The Panasonic base looks like it&#x27;s from the future, if the future was envisioned in 1981. Yes, it&#x27;s utilitarian, but at this price level, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect more than \\&quot;functional\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) When Braun razors are charged, the LCD (or LED, depending on the model) just shows a charge. This razor continually flashes the blue backlight from the LCD display. Minor? Sure. But again, at this price level, I don&#x27;t expect my razor to look broken when it has a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Individually, I think that list is pretty minor. But taken as a whole, I can&#x27;t say this is a five-star product when there are a number of improvements that could be made that wouldn&#x27;t appreciably change the underlying price of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In saying that though, I&#x27;d totally recommend this to anybody looking for a decent electric razor.nd the new one in.

    <li> Works well, operates smoothly. Does not irritate much. Not quite as close as razor, but pretty good.</li>
    <li> Pros: looks nice, gives a very close shave.  Cons: expensive and not a quicker shave vs competitors (especially against the other electric shaver I own), doesn&#x27;t shave well around the adams apple of the neck.  I have been using electric shavers my whole life, so I have a pretty decent idea of how well they work. I heard wonderful things about this shaver through reviews, and thought I would upgrade because reviews raved that this shaver was fast (some people saying 3 minutes to completely shave). I let my face grow 5 days and it took around 7 min and 30 sec to shave. I went back to my old razor (braun 8000 series) over a month later and timed my shave. It took about 6 minutes. I was expecting the panasonic to mow through the hair, but you still have to rub back and forth to cut the missed hairs. Cleaning station is pointless because it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver. The instructions that come with the shaver even promote cleaning without the cleaning station. As stated above, the shave is closer, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it a 1 star. Not worth the price currently. Wait til sub 100 dollars.</li>
    <li> This thing cuts closely. TOO closely in fact. I cut myself more easily than any other razor I&#x27;ve used. That said at least they&#x27;re sharp cuts and not at all painful. On the plus side if I am careful I can get a very close shave with no problems. It does take a few passes to cut hairs despite vibrating and being sharp, but that is true of any razor. The only minor downside I can see is that it is super noisy. This is WAY better than my previous Braun (and almost as good as my Braun before that... they&#x27;ve gone WAY downhill) and better than my old Norelcos. Panasonic has a new fan.</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric razor for the last 17 yrs. I have always had foil shavers. The last 7 years I have had a Braun 7526 that has always been good to me, a clean shave that never really missed any hairs. It has slowly been taking longer and longer to shave. I decided to start the search for a replacement. Being a Braun user for so long, I was really leaning towards just getting their 7 series shaver. The Panasonic ESLA93K was very comperable in every catagory as the Braun. The 4 Nanotech blades &amp; dual 14,000 rpm motors are what sold me on this unit.   I have been using my Panasonic ESLA93K for almost a month now &amp; seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier. I had 3 days growth when I used it for the first time. With my Braun I would have to have used a trimmer to cut the length down to a manageable size for my razor to be able to get through it. The Panasonic ESLA93K was able to cut straight thru it to a super smooth shave in under 7 minutes. I never felt even a single hair pull or catch. I have also not had a single day with razor burn (I only dry shave). I have cut my shave time down from over 10 minutes to under 6 minutes, my shave time doesn&#x27;t increase even if I miss a day.   All that said..... A couple things that aren&#x27;t perfect with the Panasonic ESLA93K    1. It&#x27;s size is a bit bulky, I have a little bit of a problem shaving my side burns close to my ear&#x27;s    tragus.    2. I find it harder to shave a nice staight line, for a goatee.    3. The cleaning unit is a bit noisey &amp; takes a long time to cycle.    4. You can not clean the Panasonic ESLA93K without charging it too, I like to run my battery down to 10% or    lower prior to charge.    None are really all that bad. I have a smaller trimmer that eliminates all the negatives for me. I love this shaver &amp; am extremely happy with it. I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it.</li>
    <li> I was a lifelong Norelco user but, I recently purchased a Panasonic ES LA93 and a Norelco 1280X/42 for a head-to-head comparison.  Here&#x27;s how I rated each.  Obviously, this is subjective and not every item gets equal weight:  Panasonic ES LA93:   Comfort - 5   Closeness - 4   Difficult spots - 3   Noise - 2   Cleaning System - 5  Norelco 1280X/42   Comfort - 4   Closeness - 4   Difficult spots - 5   Noise - 4   Cleaning System - 3  Overall, I give both razors a 4 and would easily recommend either one, but different people will have different priorities on what they want to get out of it.  Comments for each category:  The Panasonic was very comfortable; using it I could survive without after shave if I had to.  The Norelco is more comfortable than a blade, but there&#x27;s still a bit of razor burn after using.  On closeness, I find it impossible to get a perfectly smooth shave, even with a blade.  If I want a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shave, I would take 10 minutes with a blade and have a stinging face all morning, so I don&#x27;t bother. Two or three minutes with either one of these razors and I&#x27;m good enough.  There was no appreciable difference between the two.  For the difficult spots (under the nose, under the chin, etc.) I found the foil on the Panasonic to be farther from the edge of the body than I expected and particularly under the nose was a little tough to get to.  The curves on the Norelco get right in there with no problem.  The Panasonic is way louder, not unpleasant, but it made me appreciate how quiet the Norelco had been all my life.  The cleaning system on the Norelco is okay, but 20th century compared to the Panasonic (kind of like a semi-automatic sink compared to an automatic dishwasher).  Not a big deal to me either way, but if it were, this would have put Panasonic over the top.</li>
    <li> Works a lot better than others, closer and easier with less passes.  It is a louder motor which can be annoying.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for husband, and he LOVES it!  Smooth dry shave with no irritation. My reason for buying was to save money from buying expensive refillable disposals.</li>
    <li> Very efficient product! I like it.</li>
    <li> Great product superior design.  I&#x27;ve never have been able to use a razor or shaver but wanted to give this a try.  It worked well but took about 2 to 3 days before the razor bumps started to appear and another day before it just became to sensitive to use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have owned, dry and wet.  It takes a long time to clean, dry and charge.  But, it normally requires this no more than once a week for me.</li>
    <li> Although, I love this top of the line shaver&#x27;s performance, but after a few months of use, the electronic display on my shaver went bad and digits became unreadable due to bad seals and moisture penetration.  This happened to my two previous EA-LA93-K shavers too.  One time I even sent it to San Francisco for repairs, but after a few months  the numbers on the display were all mixed up again.  This repair cost me $120.  I think I am switching to Braun wet and dry models, because I have had it. Even buying insurance for these shavers is not helpful, because when I bought my first shaver, I bought insurance with it too, but when I wanted to get a replacement, I found out those crooks favor sending me a partial payment, until I demanded a replacement. Panasonic really should take another look at their designs for better water proofing these shavers.  SO BE AWARE.</li>
    <li> It Shaves very quickly and clean.&lt;br /&gt;unlike the former two blades I used, four blades cover your face tightly. it wont leave one beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment speed need to be quickened,</li>
    <li> I had an older version of this razor, and loved it.  Used it for the last couple years.  I screwed up though and forgot the foil on one of the ports of the cleaning cartridge, and I ruined the cleaning unit.  Razor still worked well, but I like the convenience of the cleaning system.  I clean daily myself just with water, but when the battery is low and needs a charge, I love having the system to just drop it into to charge and get a good cleaning.  Only maybe every three weeks, but it&#x27;s worked great for me and that lets the cleaning cartridges last for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I tried the Philips Norelco 1280X/4 system.  It looked like a good alternative.  But when it arrived I was very dissatisfied with the cleaning system.  It&#x27;s an open system, basically a bowl of water underneath the system.  Bump it, and it spills.  You can&#x27;t move it easily.  This is totally enclosed, so there&#x27;s no worry about that with the Panasonic system.  And when I tried to shave my head, the Philips just didn&#x27;t do a good job at all.  It was much quieter than these Panasonics, to the point where you wonder if it&#x27;s even working right because it sounds so quiet, you think the blades could barely be moving.  And it felt good, no tugging at all. But it took me two to three times as long going over my head repeatedly, and it NEVER got as close as my Panasonics had.  It constantly felt like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my head.  People love how they work on the face, but on the head, it was bad in every respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I returned it and picked up this one, since this was the closest to what I had, just a newer version of it.  Same cleaning system concept I was used to, but the razor is a definite step up from even the very nice Panasonic I&#x27;m replacing.  The head pivots both side to side and &amp;#34;up and down&amp;#34; which made SUCH a huge difference when shaving my head.  My other one only went side to side, and I usually left it locked anyway since it didn&#x27;t pivot as smooth as this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved my head in about half the time my other Panasonic took, and it&#x27;s never felt this smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is comfortable.  The noise is just about the same as the other Panasonic.  The lock button is a bit stiff, but since I rarely have to travel, it&#x27;s not an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit and finish is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third Panasonic now, and the other two still work - I always keep one as a backup in case of problems, so now I can retire the very old one that had been my backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, worth every penny, as this is the quickest, fastest, least irritating shave I&#x27;ve ever had.oes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved my head in about half the time my other Panasonic took, and it&#x27;s never felt this smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is comfortable.

    <li> This is a great shaver although expensive.  I had to retire my Braun shaver as the battery would not hold a charge any longer.  This unit gives me a great shave and has a neat but noisy cleaning system.  If you can spring for the cost, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> After several months I am impressed with the quality of the shaver. Much better than the Arc3 shaver I had before, perhaps because of the moving outer foil. I cannot say the charger/washer is well made. After several months, the charger gets into all kinds of error, sometimes accumulating water in the well, some times not washing, other times not charging. So I now manually wash it and use the dock only for charging. I had the same problem with the previous Arc3 model as well.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this Panasonic product. Replacement parts are a bit expensive&lt;br /&gt;though as in the Outer Foil which I dropped and then stepped on. I would not hesitate&lt;br /&gt;to buy again.</li>
    <li> works well, not real great on dry shave but better than the other 3 electric razors I have had</li>
    <li> This thing shaves the hell out of my face.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. I got a Braun 7 Series from Costco and returned it as it was not shaving close enough. Consumer Reports had that as top of the line and this Panasonic as number 2. So I gave this a try (Purchased at Frys) and it was excellent. Saves as close as a regular blade (manual). You need to give it a few weeks as per the manual (I did with Braun as well but had to return in the end). Ypou won&#x27;t be disappointed with this, the money is worth it.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about one year now.  I have always had issues shaving my face.  My hair is very coarse and grows in several different directions and I get razor burn and ingrown hairs very, very easily.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from rotary electric shavers to all different types of manual razors, and nothing seems to work well for me.  This was my first attempt at using a foil, and I decided to go all out and get the best, but unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for me either.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is a very nice piece of equipment.  I love the cleaning and charging dock and everything seems to be made exceptionally well.  The shaver, however, does not do a very good job on my face.  I have to go over most areas several times to get all the hairs, and even then it ends up missing quite a few.  Constantly going over the same areas results in irritation and razor burn.  I have a particularly difficult time shaving under my jaw/neck line, as the shaver usually misses most or all of the hair in that area, no matter how many times I go over it.  I also have a difficult time above my upper lip/under my nose.  When it comes to these areas, it seems the shaver head is just too big to be precise.  When I am done I always have to finish up with a manual razor to get the areas this shaver missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this shaver three stars based on its exceptional build quality and the wonderful cleaning/charging station.  I&#x27;ve read many reviews saying the cleaning solution only lasts one month whether you use it every day or once a week.  I, personally, have found that if you remove the shaving head and rinse the foils prior to running the shaver through the cleaner, it does not use much solution at all.  In fact, I am still on the original solution cartridge after one year, and I clean the shaver every time I use it, which is 2-3 times per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this shaver, and was really hoping that I would finally be able to shave every day or at least every other day with it.  Just like with anything else, however, I can only shave with it once a week or it tears my face apart.  I have no doubts this works wonderfully for many people, but it just does not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for one month now and compared it to my Braun 790cc shaver system.  The ES-LA93-K is built very well including the side-burn cutter.  It shaves as close as the Braun which is very good. I was skeptical of the cleaning system, but it is the best cleaning system I have so far used.  The shaver is relatively quiet and can be used in the shower.  The power button is easy to accidentally hit, and noticeable fine whiskers are not caught in the shaver head compartment.  Fix these two problems and it would be the perfect shaving system.  I recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> It has been 35 years since my last electric shaver so I thought they would have improved. The last one I purchased was a Ronson and it did not give a close shave even after going over my beard several times. This shaver isn&#x27;t any better than that old Ronson but a lot more expensive. With a blade I can get away without shaving for a couple of days but with this electric I feel I need to shave twice a day. I&#x27;m going back to the blade for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Great product I haven&#x27;t used the 5 head but the 4 head is much better than my old 3 head</li>
    <li> wonderful razor, scrape the cleaning system, better done by yourself</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic shavers for 15 years now and this one did not dissapoint.&lt;br /&gt;The 4 blade makes shaving faster and closer. I noticed a big difference between my previous 3 blade Panasonic shaver I have (I have used this for almost 8 years and is still running well). I am going to now use the 4 blade at home and will switch the 3 blade for travel to replace the crappy Braun shave I own as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the shaver for about two weeks now.  I was ready write the review after my first dry shave with it because it was as close or closer than a blade.  Prior to this shaver I used a Braun 8585 for six or seven years.  It takes series 7 replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I noticed that I had a hard time moving the shaver across my face when dry shaving with no shaving cream or oil.  This made me try it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I love using this shaver with shaving cream, gel or oil.  The shave is amazing.  It takes me about 6.5 minutes, but I have a mustache and goatee so it takes a little longer.  When I&#x27;m done, the shave is amazingly close and smooth.  I shave at 5am and my whiskers at 10pm are how they used to be with the Braun at 10am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;ve used the shaver with Barbersol, Alba shaving gel, Pacific Shaving Company shaving gel, Pacific Shaving Company shaving oil and Neutrogena shaving gel.  It worked great with all of them and I use those that allow the shaver to glide across my skin, but aren&#x27;t too slippery that I can&#x27;t stretch the skin for a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Cleaning the shaver under the sink is incredibly easy and works very well.  I clean it in the cleaning system about twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and have recommended it to at least two of my relatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my father. He likes it.</li>
    <li> My dad is getting older and having a tough time shaving. I bought this based on reviews, and it has served him very well. He was actually using it to shave dry for a while, and was really doing fine. Now he&#x27;s started to add shaving cream, and likes it even better. Catches longer and softer hairs with ease, and the cleaning mechanism works nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  A great close shave every time.</li>
    <li> Excellent very suitable</li>
    <li> While the shaver itself is excellent, the cleaning base is another story. I&#x27;ve now gone through 3 of them within 2 years. Panasonic doesn&#x27;t seem to realize that the cleaning base/charger is prone to premature failure. My son, who also purchased this razor has had the exact same experience as me. At first you&#x27;re delighted by the close shave that you get. You&#x27;re enthralled with the fact that you no longer have to clean the shaver. Than, out of the blue, the base/charger stops working, or ends up leaking. Panasonic obviously knows that there is a defect in this unit, yet they have the gall to refuse to send you a new base once it&#x27;s out of warranty. When you spend this much on a shaver, the entire system should last more than 2 years. Now, I don&#x27;t even use the base, as it no longer works. I refuse to pay Panasonic any more money to replace it for a forth time. I simply wash the blades under running water and let them air dry. When the shaver needs charging, I plug it into a wall outlet. The bottom line is that this is an excellent shaver, but because it comes with a defective base. I only give it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> The razor is ok as far as electric razors go, it&#x27;s easy on the skin and won&#x27;t cut you, but that might be because it does not give a very close shave.  I have basically gone back to &amp;#34;analog&amp;#34; shavers, this just doesn&#x27;t cut it(pun intended)</li>
    <li> I used to use high end Braun shaver, then switched to Gillette Fusion 5-blade razor, now I am back into the electric shaver world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between Braun series 7 790cc and this Panasonic LA93-K, I went for LA93-K (pretty much a random choice, as I know either way they are the best shaver out there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my choice.  Coming from Braun, wet shave is new.  It also give good result, the shave was close.  I personally feel it is as close as using razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot make comparison to Braun series 7 790cc, but this is better than the best Braun shaver I had couple of years ago.  And I cannot imagine a much better shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned nothing but Norelco&#x27;s for the past 4 decades but my last Norelco was always a disappointing shave. It just wasn&#x27;t close enough. I decided to expand my options and after much research, I chose the Panasonic ES-LA93. I use to use Panasonic exclusively for everything from TV&#x27;s to answering machines but I got burned once on a TV and then on a top of the line VCR so that put me off Panasonic, also for decades. Anyway, as I said after my research, I figured they suffered enough and it was time I gave them another chance. It&#x27;s been about 3 months now and I am very much impressed with this razor. For those of you who dry shave, it is imperative you try at least once, a wet shave with a shaving gel in the shower. I never thought you could get such a close shave with an electric razor. Truly rivals a blade. The one small issue I have is that every once in awhile, it misses a face hair that just lays too flat on my skin to be picked up by the screen and cut. It doesn&#x27;t pick it up for a couple of shaves and I notice it, usually at my work mirror, and by that time, it&#x27;s long enough to pluck. Ouch. Another issue I had initially, but solved, stemmed from my pressing too hard with the razor on my skin. I was actually getting little nicks and cuts. This was because I was used to pressing really hard on my face with the Norelco to try and get a good close shave. I became aware that I did not need such pressure with the Panny and I bleed no more. Is there a Panasonic Viera plasma TV in my future? I am considering it but baby steps Panasonic, baby steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE A YEAR LATER*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok,a year later and I&#x27;m more impressed than ever. Panasonic recommends changing the screen once a year and the blades every 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I was noticing the shave was not quite as close after about a year so I ordered a new screen even though I couldn&#x27;t see how it would make much of a difference. I thought the blades would make the difference there. I was wrong. The screen change restored the shave to like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single hair laying flat issue hasn&#x27;t occurred for over 8 months or so. I&#x27;ll assume it was my face becoming accustomed to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner charger has a slight glitch. Just this past month or so, and for the first time,the cleaner didn&#x27;t work when i pressed the button to begin the cleaning cycle. The lights remained flashing on the cleaner as it does when the cycle is finished but the cleaner just did not respond except the charging for the battery continued. I unplugged the unit and when I plugged it back in, it the cleaning cycle started and worked fine.</li>
    <li> Genius. Pure genius. The closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric shaver. Every man should have one of these. My only gripe is that it can&#x27;t be used while plugged in. But I&#x27;ll assume it&#x27;s just part of this shaver&#x27;s genius, and I&#x27;m just an idiot for wanting to shave with a corded appliance.</li>
    <li> This was for my boyfriend and here is his review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from the Arc 3, this is a welcome upgrade and even a faster shave! No razor burn. Very smooth. Quiet. Long lasting charge. Used it for 4 shaves and it is still 100% charged. My  only wish is that they sold the shaver without the Vortex Cleaning System.  I just wanted the black shaver. It looks so much nicer...and with the $20 special reduction, it came close enough to the 63K silver version, so I went with this one. Both shavers ES-LA93-K and ES-LA63-K are identical except for the color. Also worth noting is that the LCD screen is very readable and bright. Much nicer than the Arc 3 I had, which is now retired. In case you are wondering, my facial hair growth is very heavy and course where the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow appears within a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Shaves very nicely, very close. The pop-up trimmer is disappointing, too small and awkwardly placed. But I have a separate beard trimmer and don&#x27;t really use the trimmer on the shaver. Another annoying thing is the cleaning base gets clogged easily with hair and doesn&#x27;t drain. Never happened with my Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> Black friday....2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;List Price:  $399.99  this item wasnt this expensive since 2011, nice lying Amazon to make it look like a massive sale! just check camel camel camel</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that the shaver is really great, but the cleaning unit is a problem. After I used the cleaning unit for several days, the status lamp came on. Since it still cleans and dries the shaver, I have not had it repaired. When the lamp came on, I searched online for more information and stumbled over many consumers complaining about the same problem. So, obviously it is a very common issue, which the manufacturer has not taken an action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about giving three stars because of the faulty cleaning unit, but I couldn&#x27;t because I like this shaver so much! So, the shaver is really really great. Very close and comfortable shave without cut or nick.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband who has Demensia.  We are still working at it.  It will take a while for him to get used to it.  It&#x27;s especially great that it cleans itself!!!!  So far it is doing its job.  Thanks.  Finally got rid of the razor blades.</li>
    <li> Having primarily shaved with a blade all my life, and having only used one other electric razor in my life (and a cheap $30 one at that), I thought I would give this Panasonic razor a chance.  I was hopeful that it would speed up my morning routine and take some of the work out of the chore of shaving.  I was also hopeful that given the relatively high price and recent advanced in technology, that this razor would do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was disappointed.  I gave the Panasonic a solid two weeks before giving up and going back to a blade.  I don&#x27;t have what I&#x27;d consider to be a particularly thick beard, but I do have to shave every day.  While the Panasonic did an acceptable job on the sides of my face, I could never get anything resembling a close shave on areas with thicker hair, such as around my neck.  As I stated at the beginning of my review, one of the primary reasons I gave this razor a try was in hopes of speeding up my morning routine.  Well, to get a presentable shave, it took minutes with the Panasonic--making multiple passes over the same area to try to get a closer shave.  In the end, I didn&#x27;t feel like I was saving any time at all, especially when combined with the sub-par results.  Spending more time with a blade would result in a better shave; with the Panasonic, it was just frustrating, and there were diminishing returns after a certain amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor itself, the battery life seemed fine and was never an issue.  The self-cleaning system appeared to work well, although is quite noisy, as some other reviewers stated.  Noisy enough that you can hear it from several rooms away.  Not a big deal if you shave and are out of the house, but if you work from home, or have other members of your household home while this thing is cleaning, I can see how it would get annoying quickly.  Also, when this razor finishes charging, the blue backlight on its display continually blinks on and off.  This light is BRIGHT, and if yourbathroom is anywhere close to your bedroom, this will drive you crazy at night.  I ended up having to remove it from the cradle every night to get that crazy light to stop blinking.  Maybe there is a way to disable this \\&quot;feature\\&quot;, but it wasn&#x27;t apparent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes--I used this Panasonic electric razor for a solid 2 weeks and pretty much gave up on it.  I&#x27;m keeping it for use when I&#x27;m traveling, or out hunting, since I think it will be \\&quot;good enough\\&quot; for those purposes, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily use if you&#x27;re coming from a blade.  Perhaps if you&#x27;re exclusively an electric razor guy, this might be a decent razor.  I don&#x27;t have enough experience with electric razors to make that comparison.  But I do know what a good shave feels like (i.e., a good blade), and this electric razor doesn&#x27;t come close.  For lack of a better description, I&#x27;d say I still feel \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; after finishing shaving with the Panasonic, whereas a good blade will leave you with a \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, refreshed feeling.  And for me, when I&#x27;m getting ready to start out the day, I much prefer that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case someone out there is interested in a *great* shave, I&#x27;ll give my humble recommendations on a good (and relatively cheap) set-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B002FC7B2G Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome #180, 10 Double Edge Platinum Blades]] (don&#x27;t use the included Merkur blades, they are junk)&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] - my preferred blade, but everyone is different.  Many folks recommend getting a [[ASIN:B004UIZFQW sampler pack]] to start with so you can quickly and cheaply sample a variety of blades.&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] - you can spend a lot more on a shaving brush, but this one gets the job done, and the price is right&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]] - OK, you don&#x27;t *need* a razor stand, butthis thing works great, and adds a touch of class to your bathroom&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shave Soap, Sensitive, 150 Gram Jar]] - Shave soap - this will last you a long time.  A good shave soap is a necessity - using cheap shaving cream or gel just won&#x27;t yield the same results.&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B000RIAD0W Proraso Pre and Post Shave Cream - 3.6 oz]] - Optional, but nice and refreshing&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B001N9MJX8 Proraso Dioibarba Aftershave Lotion (Liquid) 100ml/3.4oz]] - again, this is optional, but is very refreshing and a great way to start the day</li>
    <li> Very happy with it. I used every brand of electric shaver over the last 60 years. This is absolutely the best, nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Pros : shaving very well almost like regular razors&lt;br /&gt;  easy and comfortable to use&lt;br /&gt;Cons: no&lt;br /&gt;I stronly reccomend this product</li>
    <li> The shave is good, but I suspect that one gets a good shave from most modern shavers.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is really loud. I am half deaf and, oddly, noisy things really bug me a lot. This shaver is one of those noisy things!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, and worst, the cleaning base is dead after well less than a year. You&#x27;d think they would like to keep selling the expendable supplies, the cleaning packets. But if the cleaner is dead they won&#x27;t make those sales.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;ll go next, but it won&#x27;t be with Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!been using this daily for roughly 3 years, shaving my head and face...that is a whole lot of wear..honestly haven&#x27;t even purchased replacement cleaner until now...and never irrated skin or head...results of a 5 blade razor while shaving my head smooth...&lt;br /&gt;did I say great product?!?!?  well worth the money!!! it will pay for it self</li>
    <li> My husband seemingly likes this. It was a Christmas gift for him and he uses it daily, but my God it is LOUD! He has to use the bathroom across the house in the morning because it wakes me and our baby up.</li>
    <li> big difference compared to my old panny shaver i had for 6 plus years. didn&#x27;t realize how worn it was even with new blades and foil.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver; certainly better than the Braun it replaced in terms of quality of shave and pretty close to Gilette&#x27;s finest. I think its probably as good as an electric shave can be. The ability to use gel, take it in the shower etc transforms the shaving experience. Some reviews refer to the relatively high noise level but I don&#x27;t think its particularly loud. I&#x27;m from the UK and best price here was GBP240 so I purchased from Amazon US and its cost me cGBP170 inc tax and postage, so about 30% saving. Takes a little while to arrive but is completely hassle free so well done Amazon US for bringing me the benefit of global pricing. Hopefully this will help drive down excessive UK prices!</li>
    <li> The shaver performs better than expected . The price was very reasonable. When used with a shaving gel it gives an exceptionally close result.</li>
    <li> This unit&#x27;s technology does give the closest shave compared to all the other shavers on the market however, there are two major problems:  1. The cleaner base system is fragile.  Mine broke within several months.  The status light went on, and it would no longer clean or dry.  In my opinion, this shaver requires the cleaner unit in order to give the closest shave and keep clean.  So if the cleaner system is not working, the experience is not the same.  2. The second problem is that Panasonic Customer service call center is not very truthful.  The service center has a Texas address, however the call center is in Asia-Pacific so there is a disconnect there.  The call center service rep said they would replace my unit with a brand new one, however I am rather sure I received SOMEONE ELSE&#x27;s rebuilt unit that had another, new problem:  the cleaner will not drain, leaving me with a wet razor after the cleaning cycle.  How is this supposed to be brand new?  So, I am faced with a 2nd faulty cleaner base system and I am having to send everything back to them at my own expense again.  I find this unacceptable for a personal care product costing $220+.</li>
    <li> I have to echo what a lot of other reviewers have said.  This is a great shaver, hampered by a terrible cleaning system.  I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and still continue to use it.  My previous electric was a Braun, and the Panasonic is a much better shaver.  I get a closer, faster, less irritating shave with the Panasonic.  Unfortunately, the cleaning system it comes with is pretty much useless.  Even when it did work, I was not impressed with how the system worked or how well it cleaned.  Hardly a couple months after receiving the system it stopped working completely.  The red status link blinks continuously and it refuses to do anything but &#x27;dry&#x27; the shaver.  At least this is a Wet/Dry model, so I just take off the foil and rinse the blades and foil really well in the sink and allow the unit to dry it.  Panasonic has got Braun beat on the shaver, however, it could learn a thing or two about cleaning systems from Braun.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this razor is great.  It&#x27;s the first foil razor I&#x27;ve used since I first started shaving and I am stunned at how much better it is than my Norelco that I just bought.  I&#x27;ve always been pretty happy with the shave of rotaries, but this latest Norelco was horrible.  This Panasonic, just blows it out of the water,  it&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve had from an electric...ever.  I just used the cleaning system for the first time and it&#x27;s pretty cool too.  I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s necessarily worth the extra money, but it does work well.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor.  It shaves closer than I expected it would.  Cleaning system works nicely, although cleaning manually is also very easy.  Can&#x27;t think of a single complaint.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This shaver was everything I wanted. It works great with no problems. It is easy to use and has many great features that i use everyday. If you want an up scale quality shaver that is comfortable to use, then this is it.</li>
    <li> Works great, great price.  Very close shave!  I was worried when I read some of the reviews that were critical of the shaver, but it works excellent and I could not be more pleased.</li>
    <li> This product was a pleasant surprise.  I have been using Braun&#x27;s top of the line electric shaver&#x27;s prior and this one blows them away. Very nicely displays the power left after each shave, the shaves are very close with no irritation and it is extremely easy to clean being a wet/dry shaver.  You can just rinse it off or use the cleaner kit.  Much more economical than the Braun cleaning system.  Also quieter than the Braun.  I have  very thick facial hair.</li>
    <li> before it died on me.  It was fine until then....but surely, they could make it last longer.  This is unfortunate as its a pretty good shaver.  Not awesome, but pretty good.</li>
    <li> This razor replaced a Norelco 3D whose battery decided not to take a charge after two years. I had used Norelco razors for decades, but had purchased a Panasonic wet-dry razor about 15 years ago because I wanted to shave in the shower (one of life&#x27;s simple pleasures for us guys!). When my Norelco died, I did not want to reward them with another couple of hundred dollars for a razor that would die in a couple of years.  And besides, now that my eyesight is not as keen as in my younger days (I have to wear eyeglasses now), it is much harder to trim sideburns with a rotary razor than with a straight edge razor. With that as a background, I went online in search of testimonials about various electric razors. Although the Braun faired well, I had had a bad experience with one a few years back, and at that time, their customer service was really poor. After that, I went back to Norelco - the one that died on me recently. So, remembering how much I enjoyed my old Panasonic, I purchased this one. I could not be happier, unless the razor shaved me by itself! Using this razor did require me to let my beard adapt, but after the first week or so, I began to get shaves as close as I was used to with the Norelco. I have now owned this razor for just over one month, and not only do I get really close shaves, I also take less time to shave. I can shave in less than 3 minutes, including making sure my sideburns are trimmed straight. This model also includes the charging stand/cleaning station, which is a neat way to maintain the razor, although not really necessary. As with my old Panasonic, you can clean this one under the faucet using liquid soap. But the charging stand/cleaning station makes it so simple. And if you decide to clean it under the faucet, which I probably will do when I begin using it in the shower, there is a drying-only feature in the stand that allows you to simply dry your razor. Another nice feature is that you can actually charge this razor with the cord, so when you travel (for extended periods), there is no need to take along the stand. That is different from my old Norelco 3D which charged by induction only and required me to pack along the charging stand in order to charge with razor if I was away from home for more than a couple of weeks. For me, Pansonic has hit a home run with this razor!</li>
    <li> think i will try Brawn next</li>
    <li> My husband is really satisfied with the appearance, material and the functions of the sonic washing part. But the shaving experience can be described as &#x27;moderate&#x27; or &#x27; OK&#x27;, because it is not that fantastic as expected to match its price.</li>
    <li> Get a nice fine shave although not as fine as a mechanical one. Never used a mechanical shaver before and this electric shaver has ensured I won&#x27;t ever need one.</li>
    <li> The cleaning base is over kill. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ther shaver is nice, however, I switched back to Gillette Proglide after a while.  It&#x27;s no more convenient or comfortable. Not worth the price</li>
    <li> This has really made my life easy.  Close shave every time and super sanitary.  I highly recommend this razor to anyone that is looking for a quality device.</li>
    <li> Best Shave i  ever gotten, as good as a blade, and better than any other electric.....I have tried them all...love this razor</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a Phillips three head rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the Phillips but much prefer the closer shave of this foil shaver.  So much so that after three years service I upgraded to the new ARC 5 version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the charging/cleaning station so cannot speak for it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the ES-LA93-K since May 2011 and it&#x27;s been an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I primarily use this shaver to shave my head every 3-4 days in the shower; each use leaves my head smooth and blood free.  It allows me to quickly shave my head without worrying about cutting my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the cleaning system a few times, however, since I primarily shave in the shower, I keep the shaver relatively clean and don&#x27;t really use it often.  If you plan on shaving in the shower, then you can probably go with the ES-LA63-S if you don&#x27;t want the cleaning system.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun for a long time - they&#x27;re nice razors, but a bit slow...and with my thick stubble, it typically took about 10-15 minutes to get a shave.  And, by noon, I&#x27;d have stubble again.  I read a review about the Panasonic in Wired Magazine (go figure), and talked with a few friends who owned them.  I decided to check it out, and placed my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon setting it up, while there&#x27;s SOME similarity to Braun, there&#x27;s FAR more differences.  The cleaning system is very different (but works about the same way, methinks).  It took a bit to figure out what each cleaning mode was, but real world, the two modes anyone will use is Charge, and Clean and Charge...so who cares?  Note that the picture is not distorted, btw...the head on this is HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is FAST.  I get a FAR closer shave with this then I ever got with the Braun, and in about 1/2 the time.  This I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it only has one downside.  The display on the shaver is sweet...tells you how long you shaved, and the % of battery left.  When you charge it, it tracks the charge level.  THEN....until you use it again, it blinks a bright blue light every five seconds.  No big deal...until it&#x27;s 11pm, and the location of the shaver is directly opposite the wife&#x27;s side of the bed.  Not so good....a blinking night light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took some work to get this straightened out, but beforewarned....that is a definite bright light at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that aside, this is a GREAT shaver...glad I switched!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Well, I had decided to not return this shaver in hopes that someday I would like it. I was packing it up and found a leaflet in the box stating \\&quot;stick with it, it&#x27;s worth it.\\&quot; Subtle but effective. So after a couple of months I decided to give this another shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do have to stick with it-even coming from another Panasonic shaver my face had to adjust. But in the end this unit really does give a good close shave. The vibrating foil does help some, and the battery life is somewhat lacking. But I&#x27;m now six weeks into using this shaver regularly and really like it. For wet shaving in the shower I suggest a small can of shaving gel. A travel-size can will last a while, since you just need a small amount to help the shaver glide over your face. Also, if you intend to use this as a wet shaver consider the version without the cleaning base if the price is less. As a wet shaver the shaver is completely clean after a rinse, and the drying feature of the cleaning base is too time-consuming. So while my original criticisms stand, they don&#x27;t stand in the way of this being a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a long-time Braun shaver user, and until very recently I had a Braun 9595 Pulsonic, now known as the Series 7 that served me well for five years. I&#x27;m also a Panasonic user-a few months ago I also picked up a Panasonic ES-LT71, which is Panasonic&#x27;s entry level 3-blade shaver with a cleaning station. I travel very frequently and sometimes need to pack extremely light, such that the Panasonic is a better choice than the Braun due to weight and size and ease of cleaning in the field. So when my Braun just stopped working, I ordered the Panasonic ES-LA93K after reading so much favorable information about it, and I eagerly awaited the UPS delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LA93K gives a good shave, but has a few issues. First, the second motor in the head provides the vibrations for the \\&quot;pulsing foil\\&quot; concept, a version of Braun&#x27;s Pulsonicidea. The problem is that while the main motor is 14,000 cpm the foil pulsing motor is much slower and is less effective. It doesn&#x27;t do much aside from draw power. Which is the second issue-battery life. Most shavers now use the same cylindrical Li-Ion battery, but with two motors drawing power this shaver gets much worse battery life. My old Braun or Panasonic LT71 can go almost 2 weeks on a charge, but this one barely lasted a week. With more foils one would expect that this shaver might give a dramatically faster shave, but I found the effect to be less than expected. Next, to accommodate all those foils, the shaver head is comically large. On open areas this does a good job but detail areas such as above the lip or below the sideburns are more difficult. The final issue is the cleaning station. Overall the Braun has a superior cleaning system but it is higher maintenance, where the Panasonic system is less expensive to run. The problem lies with the drying-Braun uses an inductive heater to actually heat the blades after cleaning, and combined with an alcohol cleaning solution the result is a clean and dry shaver in 30 minutes. Panasonic advertises a \\&quot;heated dry\\&quot; but the heat is provided by the friction of running the shaver dry while a small fan blows over the shaver head. This is a missed opportunity, as a small heating element would have done wonders. As it stands now the cycle takes nearly 80 minutes. Overall, the shaver feels good in the hand, is well balanced and well manufactured, but suffers from some design flaws that I hope Panasonic will address in future models. Until then I highly recommend either the ES-LT71 or a Braun Series 7.</li>
    <li> great for sensitive skin,no burns like I was getting with Braun and Phillips .Easy to clean and battery life is fine</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric razor in my life but I have to say this gives a pretty close shave. Still not as good as a blade but pretty close. Clean up is easy.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver a 4 only because it&#x27;s not perfectly perfect. But this is a great shaver!. I have used Norelco Cool Gel which was average. I then switched to the Panasonic ES-8249S which was also a great shaver. I wanted to upgrade to a better pivoting head so I went with this shaver. It&#x27;s expensive so if you can buy it cheaper of course do so (I got mine open box on ebay for $125). First few shaves left my face more irritated that I expected because I was using a foil shaver already. After the first week the irritation was almost gone. The shave it great. Near perfect but not perfect. Maybe the ES-LV81-K is perfect but it&#x27;s also twice what I paid for this one. The shave is a good as a razor and there are no perfect razors either unless you want to spend a fortune there. I recommend this shaver as the best foil shaver I&#x27;ve used. From what I have learned of the Braun 790 this one is better.</li>
    <li> easy to clean, no more clipping of the hairs, no more pains during the time shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;automatic water cleaning take too long time.</li>
    <li> My husband loved the gift of the Panasonic ES-LA93-K arc electric shaver I gave him. He had other shavers but put the others in a drawer now as he uses this gift every day. Thanks Panasonic folks for such a good product!</li>
    <li> Think about what a smooth shave you could get, I willing to pay for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for anyone for sure.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really good for African American beards!  Wonderful cleaning system!  I even it use it to shave my head.</li>
    <li> I have only used this shaved as a dry shaved both with and without pre-shave lotion.  It always gives me a comfortable close shave.  The cleaning system in the charging stand does a thorough job and, apparently, does not need to be used every day.</li>
    <li> Nice features. Super, super close shave. A bit cumbersome working around a goatee, but somewhat expected. I do the best I can with it and clean up with a disposable. That works for me. So far, I have not had an issue with the cleaning/charging base as others seem to have had. I will update if I do. I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 months. I will point out that it says to unplug the base when not in use. This may have something to do with those that have had issues. But, it&#x27;s just a theory.</li>
    <li> Never had an electric like this, very, very fast and close shave and leaves my face&lt;br /&gt;really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base is a joke though, when you can just hold it under the faucet to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;But the razor is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Braun Series 7- 790cc, which was a few years old.  So far this has exceeded my expectations for a shaver!  Shaves very close and is extremely fast.  From looking at the timer on my shaver it takes me less than 2 minutes each time to shave (I shave every day).  There is absolutely no pulling or anything.  5 stars!</li>
    <li> Super sleek, ultra modern and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!!! Best shaver ever</li>
    <li> good price&lt;br /&gt;good quality&lt;br /&gt;excellent time for delivery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is exactly as described, a great deal for your money, i would buy again from this brand.</li>
    <li> This razor is the closest electric shave I have ever had! It replaces a Phillips and the differance is like chalk and cheese. I strongly recommend this razor to anyone with thick wiskers.</li>
    <li> perfect shaver, effective, beautiful look, I like it-</li>
    <li> This shaver is top notch as far as a daily shaver on your FACE only. If you don&#x27;t shave every day you might be disappointed(keep reading). I also have to say that this shaver is more difficult to get neck hairs than the slimmer braun alternatives. The extra blades make short work of the hair on your cheeks but you loose all of the advantages on your lip and neck. This shaver has a very large head that makes accessing these areas tough. Also longer hair is not easily shaved with this razor. It constantly misses longer hair. If you like to shave twice a week or so then you will be missing a lot of the longer whiskers with this shaver and covering those areas again and again to get them cut. Having said that it is awesome for smooth easily accessed areas. It would probably be awesome for girls shaving leg hair. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many electric razors over the years.  All of them have been Panasonics and I&#x27;ve always been pretty happy with them  After receiving this razor this morning, I dropped it in the charger and got it ready for \\&quot;the test.\\&quot;  I shave in the shower and I use Dove soap as \\&quot;shaving cream.\\&quot;  All I can say after using this razor is WOW!  The shave is amazing in a few ways.  1)  It is close.  2)  It was painless - no pulling or irritation.  This is a great razor!  I&#x27;m glad that I finally took the plunge into the upper echelon of Panasonic razors as it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic Wet Dry Shavers since they first came into the market place.  In my estimation, there is not a better product on the market for wet or dry shaving.  With each new Panasonic Shaver that I purchase they keep getting better and better.  My new ES-LA93-K is no exception.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from the gold deal of the deal because it was a great deal.  I needed a new shaver to replace my bruan and this razor had good reviews so i gave it a try.  I was very pleased with this  razor it gives a great  clean shave and looks very well made. Four blades really make this a better razor leaving skin very smooth and silky i was very impressed thanks again amazon.</li>
    <li> I received one of theses shavers for Christmas.  It shaves well but the cleaning function quit a few seeks ago.  Now it continually signals that it needs cleaning and I can not but wonder how long it will continue functioning.  Not what you expect for $400.</li>
    <li> trimmer not strong enough to cut 3 days growth</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about 1.5 years now. Overall satisfied, you don&#x27;t need the cleaning cartridge to clean this. Simply hold under warm tap water or shower that has a good pressure. Or let it stay in a soapy cup of water for couple of minutes....you can go creative on cleaning this different ways and don&#x27;t need the cartridge</li>
    <li> Best shaver I ever used.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it. He doesn&#x27;t use the cleaner as much as he thinks it&#x27;s not necessary to clean it everyday but rather use it every 2 months. However, he is quite content with it performance</li>
    <li> thank you very much!! good choice!!</li>
    <li> I have used many shavers but this is the very best for a guy with a tough beard.  It will take a week or so to get used to it but get ready for a great shave.</li>
    <li> Had a LA-63 go out after a couple of years.  Picked this up as a replacement.  This shaves closer and is quieter.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, but the display crapped out within the first year.  I sent it back to Panasonic and they mailed me a replacement shaver.  However, I&#x27;m wondering if the same thing will happen a year from now when the warranty is out.  Debating whether to spend $35 on an extended warranty...</li>
    <li> One of the best razors! It is evry light and very comfortable. I just used for a week and very happy about it!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s 3rd Panasonic wet/dry shaver. He&#x27;s loved all of them, but this one he says is even better than the Arc 3. He does the majority of his shaving in the shower with it every morning, &amp; then does little touch up stuff when he gets out. He gets a very nice, smooth shave (you have to give it a couple of weeks if you&#x27;re new to electric). It cleans up great in the base, &amp; it&#x27;s significantly more quiet than the Arc 3. The flashing blue light bothers me some at night coming from in the bathroom, but that&#x27;s easily solved by closing the door or unplugging for the night. This one comes with an even better travel case as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also set the cleaning cartridges up on Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save for every 3 months. This way we know he has them when needed, &amp; we get the discounted price plus free shipping! Love Amazon; love this shaver!</li>
    <li> Does a very good job with some effort.  A bit hard to trim around beard and mustache, but can do with some effort and practice.  I have been a blade shaver for many years, but I like the way this shaves my neck in particular as I wear a dress shirt and tie every day .</li>
    <li> Nice product! If you buy it, you won&#x27;t regret. It is working very well after my skin adapted it. I like it very much</li>
    <li> Expensive to maintain....new cover and razors about every 5 months</li>
    <li> This delivers everything as promised. I have sensative skin, especially around my throat and jaw-lines. All other shavers I have tried irritate my skin, causing me to have a very noticable rash. This shaver does not do this. I find it works better in a hot shower, rather than dry. Not that it causes irritation, but the cut seems to be smoother and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt this is one of the best, if not the best, shaver on the market. My dilema is I am trying to see the advantage of electric shaver vs traditional razors? I have used razors my entire shaving career and thought this would be a better alternative. Shaving with razors take less time, and are a little bit closer shave. I am questioning why I decided to make the switch to be honest. But I am invested in a electronic shaver now; I&#x27;ll use it until I die or it dies.</li>
    <li> Excellent unit. Gives a really good smoothe shave. Previously used a rotary and never very smooth.</li>
    <li> satisfy with good quality and fast delivery</li>
    <li> So far so good,,it leaves smood skins after shave and no sking reaction..good so far.I haven&#x27;t washed yet but ,I am happy with the product so far.</li>
    <li> Super amazing close shave. best I&#x27;ve had in years!    The shaving is very nice and smooth. Noise, barely noticeable. and I have yet to run the battery down during one shave.    Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought this razor was awesome however after I accidentally ran over the razor I had to purchase a new one. I did some research through consumer reports and found that the Braun shavers were rated higher than panasonic. I ordered a Braun Series 7 790cc razor and have found it to be a higher quality product. It shaves closer than I could get with a manual razor blade and is a lot quieter than the Panasonic. I would highly suggest purchasing the Braun over the Panasonic. I am very pleased with the Braun.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  Don&#x27;t use the base that much.  It&#x27;s really loud.  Just run water and some soap thru the shaver after your done and it will stay clean.</li>
    <li> Smooth shaves right out of the box. I use it dry, but you can also use it in the shower. The cleaner/charger keeps the shaver fresh. The only drawback is the cleaning cartridges...they are hard to find locally, but are availae at a good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> After many years of being a Braun fan, the last iteration I owned totally turned me off Braun. I had another very bad customer service experience with them going back some years and so, will never buy or even consider another Braun. But, this Panasonic is truly a Dream Machine! It looks very good - sleek and elegant - and is also very comfortable to use. The shave is exceptional, really, in my experience, the best ever. The instructions indicate that it can take 30 days for one&#x27;s skin to adjust to a new shaving regime but I tell you what: my skin said \\&quot;Yay!\\&quot; the first time! This is in my view, the Rolls Royce of shavers I have owned. The Brauns have been consigned to the recycling bin forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wet-dry functions on the Panasonic are great and although it can be rinsed easily under the tap or swished through some warm water and neutral detergent, it also of course has a clean and dry function on the base unit. This is rather noisy but provided you don&#x27;t do it at night, should not be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other plus with the Panasonic is the fact that it copes with 100v - 240v so can travel internationally! All you need is an adaptor plug fitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All up, I am so pleased with this purchase! Full marks Panasonic!</li>
    <li> i buy the product as a birthday gift to my father-in-law. He likes the birthday gift.  so i like it, too.</li>
    <li> When I discovered Panasonic&#x27;s line of electric shavers I took awhile to come around to taking the plunge. I had used electric razors before, but all were dry and all had the same problems. They filled with gunk from my beard quickly and they left me with seriously irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have never tried an electric razor again until I stumbled on this. I read and re-read the description of using this shaver wet. I thought about it and finally opted to try it, knowing it would be a costly experiment if it went wrong. The reviews here on Amazon coaxed me along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I found. The blades move fast, are lineier, and can handle soap, water and oil without gumming up. I have very sensitive skin and a very coarse beard that grows like weeds in a garden. I would not go a day without nicking myself and having to spend time stopping the bleeding before heading to work. My face would be red and irritated all day and I was generally miserable having to get up every day to do it again (I&#x27;m in the Army).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this, and like the box says, you have to get your beard accostomed to the new shaving technique. What I got was the smoothest shave with zero irritation. I was sold. I threw away the other gimmic products supposed to make razor shaving easier, bought oil shaving liquid and I haven&#x27;t used a blade since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is loud, but not irritating. The loudness it a testiment to the cutting speed, which is the reason your shave is smoother and there is little to no irritation. The hairs are cut quickly and never pulled by the shaver. I have not once felt a hair tugged by the blades, and that is saying something. I shave wet, right out of the shower, and I cannot begin to speak of how much I appreciate this product being out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts for a good while, and I average using 15-20% per shave. You cannot use it with the power cord plugged in, for obvious reasons, but the batter life makes up for this. Because the motor is so powerful and there are so many cutting surfaces you do not need a lot of time to shave, so it is obvious Panasonic had this in mind for the dry shave traveling crowd who prefer to use these plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue LCD is the perfect size and tells you everything you need to know about the state of the razor. The cleaning base has a smart compact design and uses water and detergent to clean the head. This is another selling point for people with sensitive skin since most electric razor cleaners use alcohol which can cause discomfort. The cleaning system takes a while and can be a bit loud, but it is thourough. It cleans, soaks, drains, cleans and then drys the head so it is ready for you the next day. i use liquid hand soap to clean the razor before putting it into the cleaner to keep most of the gunk out of there, but that isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the razor and cleaning station on deployments and on multiple trips. The razor is designed for the traveler, comingwith a case and protective screen for the head, and it is voltage regulated to handle 110 and 220 outlets. That feature in and of it self saves me all kinds of money in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I bought it I have had no problems with the electronics, blades, display or anything associated with the razor. I can safely say that for the price you are buying a quality product that will last you as long as you take care of it. If you have sensitive skin and dred shaving in the morning, I encourage you to take the plunge and buy this or any other Panasonic wet/dry razor....you will love them.</li>
    <li> Have had it for about 2 weeks.  Went from a rotary which died to this and get a far smoother shave than I ever got with the old shaver.</li>
    <li> This wet/dry electric shaver really does the trick. It has no problem going through thick tough stubble with a nice, clean cut.</li>
    <li> The linear motor gives the closest, smoothest shave, especially for hairs growing out at an angle.  I was getting bad shaves from other shavers such as Norelco rotary shaver and eventually tried Panasonic&#x27;s Linear shaver.  I have tried the 2-blade, 3-blade, and now the 4-blade.  I thought the 2 and 3 blades gave just as good of a shave; and actually the smaller size gave the added benefit of improved maneuverability.  The 4 and up configurations may be over engineered and not necessary.  I would probably go with a 3 blade with cleaning system in the future, as there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any added value to justify the increased costs for four blades or more.  The cleaning system is nice as it does make the shaver seem like new after each cleaning that also gets rid of that &amp;#34;hair smell&amp;#34;.  However, I have had difficulties with the cleaning system in the past such as accidentally interrupting the cleaning cycle making the function permanently inoperable; and hope those don&#x27;t repeat.  This would be five stars if it were not for the cost.  Hard to believe it costs as much as 1/4 -1/2 the cost of a washing machine.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my father, he said it was really great ~satisfied</li>
    <li> I used Brauns prior to this purchase and liked most of them. However, by comparison the motor on this Panasonic is much more powerful. Because I have a coarse facial hair, that&#x27;s a big plus. The Panasonic is a bit larger to hold in your hand and a tad more cumbersome to navigate around the upper lip but not a deal breaker. The LED display gives you charge status. The cleaning station seems to work well. The shaver runs for quite a few days on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative. If you run the charge down to empty and plug the shaver in using the cord, the unit doesn&#x27;t operate. You have to wait until it has been recharged a bit before using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a black male, and I have always had problems with shaving. With this product I love it. It is the best shave that I have ever had in my life.I have not had any shaving problems. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this shaver is a replacement for es-la93 that was purchased january 2012 that just stopped working one day,amazon customer service assisted in replacing the shaver.....the shaver does a good job of shaving but the workmanship of the unit is not what it should be for $193....i have a very difficult time trying to use he trimmer...it will not...without a lot of pushing to get it in position to trim..i have at times had to use both thumbs to push it up.....</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver I have ever used, and I am 69 years old.  The results are almost as good as a blade shave.  Easy to use, quiet, inexpensive to maintain.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for another Panasonic shaver, I received in May.  At the end of June the charger cleaner quit working.  I returned it to Panasonic for exchange (it was past the 30 day return period for Amazon).  They received it on Jul 11.  It is now Aug 5 and the last I heard from the exchange center is that the replacement will be sent out in 5-7 business days (that&#x27;s the same thing I was told the last time I called them 2 weeks ago).  They say they upgraded their system and could not do any exchanges for 2 weeks and that&#x27;s why it is so long.  It took over an hour on hold just to get through to them, to be told the same story as 2 weeks ago.  If there are that many of these in for exchange it doesn&#x27;t bode well for the shaver.  It might be okay when it works, but with this level of customer support and the short lifespan of the one I got, I doubt it.  This is one purchase I wish I never made.</li>
    <li> I switched from a Braun top of the line foil shaver with cleaning system which I have used for several years now.  Up to that point, the Braun had given me the best and smoothest shave of any electric shaver I had ever tried.  When it was time to replace the replaceable foil head of the shaver, I opted to purchase the new Panasonic shaver.  I am extremely happy with this shaver- especially using it wet with shaving gel.  I get the closest and smoothest shave without any irritation whatsoever.  Whatever Panasonic has done in engineering this machine, I hope they keep on doing as it is truly remarkable.  And, I too, thought it looked huge in the pictures before I received it, but it is very comfortable to use and definitely not too large.  I also like the ability to be able to clean it with liquid soap and running water- great product!</li>
    <li> I change the head and blades each year, and its as if I have a new razor. Yes, I have to go over my face a few times, but I get there. Better than the Norelcos I used to buy. Overall, a wonderful razor. This is my 3rd Panasonic. That may tell you something. I have not had any of the problems listed here with led readout or others. I don&#x27;t travel much so I am less apt to have those issues with a razor jostling around in my luggage. Recently, I played with the thought of returning to a safety razor. Have you seen the prices of those systems? Yes, the investment in a Panasonic is high, but compared to the Gillette systems, maintenance is quite low. As advised, the la93 is not meant to shave the head. I did recently purchase on Amazon a Norelco head shaver...quite the appliance. Cannot recommend that enough.</li>
    <li> When I first got this razor, I thought it was the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Unfortunately, the shaving performance goes down once the cutters get old.  They suggest replacing them at least yearly, but I&#x27;d say every 4-6 months would be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it still performs very well.  The batter lasts quite a while even though it&#x27;s now old.</li>
    <li> I wish I could have afforded the Arc5, but it was over $250. This was much more reasonable in cost. It is a great shaver, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the Arc5 is better, but not worth 250+.  This is a significant improvement over the arc3, which I have had for a few years.</li>
    <li> Tried a Norelco before but it was hard on my skin. Bought this one and it&#x27;s been well worth the money! Close shave and easy on the face!</li>
    <li> Perfect! this electric shaver is by far the best shaver ive ever had.</li>
    <li> I have always been reluctant to purchase an electric shaver. But after reading the reviews on this shaver I gave it a try. I was very surprised with the outcome of this electric shaver. I&#x27;m now hooked on electric shavers and this Panasonic gives me a great shave.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun electric shavers for over 20 years. Tried Panasonic after reading over 300 reviews. They have done an excellent work on this shaver. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> I have only had one electric shaver before and I hated it. It was a cheaper model someone had given me. It pulled hair, and shaved unevenly and not at all close.&lt;br /&gt;My health condition has changed such that I might cut myself severely even with the safety razors we use now, so I bought an electric knowing I would hate it, but bought the one I thought I would hate least.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprize I love it! It shaves smoothly and very close, is easy to use, and the self cleaner/charger is well worth it. In this instance it is definately worth it to spend a little more to get a quality product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband&#x27;s Christmas present. He has only used it once but he loves it.</li>
    <li> The rating would have been a five star except the instruction book is a joke.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. I purchased June 14 2012, started using June 17.  Shaver worked great.  Recharger/cleaner unit has developed a malfunction.  Panasonic expects me to have kept the original boxes.  Since I did not, I am expected to buy boxes somewhere and return everything to a place in Texas that will decide what to do.  There is no option for giving panasonic a credit card number and having them ship a new charger/cleaner unit and having me return old unit in their shipping box.  I will have to buy a different shaver to use for the month or so that I have no shaver because panasonic requires that everything be shipped to their sole repair center in Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to buy this unit, buy 2 so that you have one to use while the other undergoes their warranty process of a month or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of wet shavers.  I had Panasonic&#x27;s previous model and this is a much improved version. The head is slightly bigger and the head is angled more making easily to shaved under one&#x27;s chin.</li>
    <li> A great,comfortable, close shave! No more having to constantly buy razors! I got this for my hubby for Christmas,and he LOVES it! It is quieter,than some I&#x27;ve seen,and a much smoother shave! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Much better shave than Remmington</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great, close comfortable shave for an electric shaver.  Even when I let my whiskers get a little long between shaves, it never yanks a hair or anything.  I use it in the shower and it never bogs down from the water or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of improvements could be made though:&lt;br /&gt;-The cleaning function in the base is extremely loud.  So much so that I feel bad running it after I get out of the shower because it would wake up everyone in the house.  So I have to wait until the evening to run it.&lt;br /&gt;-The on/off button on the front is right where my thumb sits when operating the shaver.  I&#x27;ve never accidentally turned it off, but it causes me to hold it in an uncomfortable way sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;-The trimmer on the back is difficult to activate because the head has to be lined up perfectly with the handle in order to activate it.</li>
    <li> Bought the Panasonic ES-LA93-K Arc4 Electric Shaver on August 28, 2014, loved it for the first six months. Since then I have replaced the Inner Blade &amp; Outer Foil Set twice but the product does not perform any longer. The replacement blades are not even close to the original set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for many years.  The Panasonic ES-LA93 is the first shaver that I&#x27;ve owned that does exactly what the product says.  I hope it is still on the market when the one I own now wears out.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with an electric razor.  I was having breakouts on my cheeks for almost a year and tried everything to get rid of it.  I figured it must be coming from the disposable blades that I was using, tried different ones with no luck.  Every time I would shave the breakouts got worse since I was constantly cutting them open getting more dirt inside, what a mess.  I figured I&#x27;d give an electric a try and wanted to buy one of the best out there.  I read many reviews about many razors and decided to go with this one.  For a first time user they claim the break in time for your face is about 2 weeks, well it took about a month for me.  The reason being is that after years of disposable use your face builds up scar tissue from constantly pulling off layers of skin.  I tried many different ways to use this razor from using oil, soap, in the shower, different times of the day and so on.  I almost gave up on using this one since it was taking a long time to get used to.  Finally I found that using the electric razor in the morning or at night with a dry face worked the best with a splash of jojoba afterwards.  I don&#x27;t know why but jojoba has worked wonders for me with shaving once a day or once every 2 days.  It&#x27;s been a year almost to the day and my face has been clear and clean for quite some time and I am not giving this razor up any time soon.  I just got the new blade and foil set.  It&#x27;s great for traveling, not too big and the bag is a good size.  It&#x27;s only big enough for the razor though not the power cord.  The self cleaning is also quite something.  I however messed up with that part and didn&#x27;t change the cleaning solution for almost a year, though I clean it out of the cleaner most times anyway.  I have since purchased new cleaning solution and will probably change it once every 2 months, recommended is every month I believe based on usage.  Long story short this thing works the cats ass and I hope it lasts me a long time.  Another note is thatI have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s been great for mine.</li>
    <li> this item only worked well on the first day of work. Other days no good shave. Bad roduct. I regret buying the product, although a very expensive product</li>
    <li> First, the item was delivered exactly as advertised and shipping was relatively quick. With regard to the shaver, it works great. It cuts quickly and efficiently. The charger base is compact and the cleaning and drying functions work well. I&#x27;m not sure that the 4-blade head is that much better then the 2-head, but it does seem to work well. I&#x27;ve been using a Panasonic wet shaver for years so I didn&#x27;t have to get accustom to it. The shave head is quite a bit larger than previous models but as another reviewer said it&#x27;s easy to get use to. One negative about the unit is that the large LED in the handle that displays the state of charge and the run time for your last shave flashes once every two seconds once the unit is completely charged. This seemingly insignificant function is rather burdensome as it generates a continuous strobe light effect that is annoying at night. It&#x27;s quite bright and flashes into the bedroom all evening, sometime making it difficult to get to sleep. I found that I must remember to remove the razor from the charging base every evening at bedtime. It&#x27;s not a really big deal, but clearly an oversight on the part of the designers.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this shaver would save time in the morning instead of using a manual shaver.  I purchased this and used it once with shaving cream in the shower and once dry.  The shaver left small cuts on my face and when I was finished there were red spots on my face.  I just dropped it off at UPS to return to amazon.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a better shaver, and then I had seen this product on an ad here in Amazon. As I&#x27;ve read the comments, I see that there are many positive opinions about it. So yeah, I tried to buy it. When the product arrived, I used it immediately. It was too sharp for me and it gave me wounds around my chin. But I could say that it is durable and quite effective</li>
    <li> Hubby&#x27;s Christmas present that he got early. He loves it. If he loves it, so do it, definitely!! And what a sleek looking tool.</li>
    <li> I have gone through probably 10-20 electric shavers in my lifetime.  I started shaving in 6th grade.  Yes, I&#x27;m Italian with thick hair that grows super fast.  Have to shave every day.  So I consider myself a near-expert on this topic.  Now for my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Good/great battery life.  The blinking blue light when charging is very bright but is not a big deal if you plug it in while you&#x27;re in another room.  It does NOT take a long time to charge.  Under 30 mins.  Big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Big head and good pivot mechanism is a huge benefit - cuts down on shaving time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I would call this a &amp;#34;high horsepower/low torque motor&amp;#34;.  I also just replaced the cutter heads and I did see an improvement but not as good as I thought I would get.  It runs at a very high RPM (higher pitched sound) but the motor bogs down if you go too fast.  I had a Braun years ago that was the exact opposite- low RPM/high torque.  Part of me likes the latter better, but that shaver is long gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I never used the cleaner base.  Still in the box after having this for 2+ yrs.  I disconnect the head, rinse both parts with warm water and give it a few light shakes and then let it air dry.  Been doing that for 20 yrs with success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Trimmer is good, not great.  It has a tendency to &amp;#34;flip back&amp;#34; to its original closed position.  With a little practice this can be minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this shaver - but does take a little bit of getting used to (big head)...but it&#x27;s worth it, even at this expensive price point.</li>
    <li> It turned out to be a.very good purchase. It took a few shaves to get accustomed to an electric shaver but now i really like the close shave it provides.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric razor back in 2010 to replace my Mach 3 hand-held razor.  I haven&#x27;t been more impressed with it&#x27;s shaving prowess and ability to provide the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten in years!  It takes approximately 4 minutes or so to shave my face and neck.  I shave dry after my shower and find this method translates to the best results.  I don&#x27;t have to clean the razor as much because my clippings aren&#x27;t soiled with my skin&#x27;s oils.  I haven&#x27;t shaved in the shower with this unit, although this is yet another way to approach shaving with the LA-93k.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most about the LA-93k is the cost savings when compared with using Mach-3 blades.  I can shave with the same foil and blade set for at least 2 years without replacement which is great!  These blades are made using the same process that Japanese swords are forged, thus providing an unparalleled cutting edge that rarely goes dull.  Unlike other users, I rarely experience tugging or pulling of facial hairs over time and I think I have a reasonably course beard.  I can easily go more than a year as well, on a Year&#x27;s Supply of Vortex Hydraclean shaving / cleaning cartridges provided I empty the clippings after each use in the sink.  Economically speaking, this electric doesn&#x27;t tax your wallet like a manual Mach 3 would which is even more reason to go out and purchase one for yourself!</li>
    <li> The cleaning motor takes forever to clean the razor - instructions are not too clear - too expensive toon tube satisfactory</li>
    <li> My husband enjoys using this new shaver.  The only thing missing is a cleaning brush of some sort to allow him to clean it when necessary.  I had an old brush from another kit so this is what he is using for now.  It does do an adequate shave.</li>
    <li> Look, I &#x27;ve had 02 rotational shavers , both Philips . My first was the Philips Speed ​​XL , 8240 , fast and a great shaver for the day -to-day . Recommend everyone to travel and as the name implies , fast and beautiful razor . Out of curiosity I bought the Philips Senso Touch 3D 1250, which offered a little more quality shaving but at the expense of a bit of delay. But I still stayed with that gray chin and it was impossible a close shaver neck with 02 . But then I took a chance and bought this Panasonic ES - LA93 - K Arc . I was impressed . I get 07 minutes (04 minutes with the XL and 05 to 1250 ) , a close shave , soft ass baby, like never . My face is equal to tests without failures , no gray areas and last almost until the next day . I have no rush on my face ? Like the Philips devices . I&#x27;m not saying that Philips are bad . I used them for 04 years and highly recommend due to price . But this one was remarkably higher than the 02 IMHO . The cleaning unit comes in handy . I shave every day in the morning and clean the unit every 03 days . Anyway , the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had . I got him 2 months ago and very satisfied . Although the price is expensive for sure recommend this unit .</li>
    <li> very good shaver for electric!</li>
    <li> Tried electrics for years and never had success at removing as much hair as skin.  Must have been the cheapo rzors.  This thing is really nice and gives a comfy shave.</li>
    <li> Great product, been using it for 3+ years. Never bought Cleaning Cartridges, don&#x27;t think it is necessary expense. Using Automatic Cleaning System for drying only after washing shaver with liquid soap and water, as described in the manual.</li>
    <li> The LA93-K is the third Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve owned since 2004. Like the others, I purchased it because Panasonic bills it as wet or dry-capable. (I find that I get a less irritating and a closer shave in the shower, though I don&#x27;t use it this way as often as I thought I would.) The LA93-K does a decent job, though I usually have to spend longer than I&#x27;d like to get good results, going over problem areas several times. Replacement blades and foils aren&#x27;t cheap, and it&#x27;s often difficult to determine which ones to order on Amazon because of the multiplicity of choices and product numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver&#x27;s weakest point by far is its LCD display. It pulses brightly to indicate a full charge, which is annoying at night. Even worse, the display started to malfunction after about a year. Some of the characters and icons on the display wouldn&#x27;t appear until I recharged the shaver completely. Now, most of them don&#x27;t light up at all, so I can&#x27;t determine the charge level. I had similar problems with both previous shavers - I assume that moisture is the cause, but that shouldn&#x27;t happen if it&#x27;s water-resistant. This will be my last Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After months using the shaver without a working display, the motor started to malfunction to the point where it would only operate for a few seconds or turn on by itself. I&#x27;m convinced that Panasonic doesn&#x27;t know how to manufacture a shaver that is properly sealed. I expect a lot more for $200, so I&#x27;ve downgraded my rating to one star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic LA93 for over 2 years now &amp; love the razor.  My beard is tough, but not thick - I&#x27;m a 3 minute shaver with this razor.  To quote another reviewer \\&quot;It&#x27;s like moving a cloud over my face\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve also owned the high end Braun &amp; Norelco electric razors.  This Panasonic is the best of the bunch.  I use the stainless Feather safety razor on the weekends for change of pace and enjoy the quiet shave.  The Panasonic is as close if not closer than the Feather safety razor.  Granted, the Feather is considered to give a mild shave - but with practice &amp; patience the shave is very close.  Initially, I used the cleaning &amp; drying cradle that came with the Panasonic razor.  Now, I don&#x27;t use the cradle - don&#x27;t need it.  Just remove the foil head, rinse under hot water, tap out the extra moisture on counter, run cutting blades for a few seconds, towel dry the exterior &amp; that&#x27;s it.  No need for the noisy cleaning &amp; drying cradle that uses expensive soap cartridges.  BTW - I use Billy Jealousy \\&quot;Super Slick Shave Cream\\&quot; (I think it&#x27;s more of a gel).  I&#x27;ve tried many shaving gels, creams &amp; soaps.  Billy Jealousy is the best.</li>
    <li> I am using this razor for more than a year now. It was more expensive when I bought and is the top of the line razor from Panasonic. So, I had high expectations of this razor. Even though, it is a wet/dry razor, I noticed that it works much better only in the dry mode for my beard. I have a tough and probably also a thick beard and used to suffer from razor bumps every time after shaving with a manual razor. After I started shaving with this Panasonic razor, I noticed that it offered only slight protection against the development of razor bumps. The only advantage that I found is that it is easier to deal with razor bumps when shaving with this razor when compared to the manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while I get a really close shave on the face, this razor doesn&#x27;t work very well on the neck for me. I have thick beard growing in all directions on my neck and this razor just couldn&#x27;t take care of that. I have to use the sub-par trimmer of this razor to get rid of the left over beard on my neck and that is disappointing. I don&#x27;t know if I could ever find a good electric razor that could offer me a close shave on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another disappointing issue that I have noticed is that I develop break outs on my face after using this razor. I don&#x27;t know if it is the heat produced that is causing this or if my skin is too sensitive to this razor. Since, I noticed that this razor works better only in dry shaving mode, I could not test it to see if this happens in wet shaving mode also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent shaver and I doubt there are any better electric shavers in this price range. But I don&#x27;t think it is suitable for giving a close shave to all kinds of beards.</li>
    <li> The only thing this is missing is internet radio.  That&#x27;s it!  :)  Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Very smooth.  Feels like I used a blade.  It appears a little bulky at first, but surprisingly comfortable in the hand and very maneuverable.</li>
    <li> Almost 5 star but its head is rather bulky and its hard to trim around accurate lines, as well as the fact that the trimmer is absolutely USELESS. Otherwise, close shave and amazing... thought I had already reviewed it... but Ill do it again. Amazing shaver. UPDATE&gt; been two years now and have not used it every day, but at the same time have used it at least once a week and it is still awesome!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it people, shaving sucks. It&#x27;s messy, time wasting, sometimes painful and overall; not a good experience. I once worked a job that required daily shaving, a routine that irritated my neck to no end, especially with razors. In hopes of, pardon the pun, &amp;#34;saving face&amp;#34;, purchased an electric shaver. I soon realized that shaving electrically wasn&#x27;t the answer to reducing irritation, it actually made it worse. Needless to say, I stopped using the electric shaver and not too long after this I quit the job. I had tried a few other electrics only to be disappointed over and over. Then, recently, I was reading reviews on electric shavers and came upon the Panasonic ES-LA93-K. Well, against my better judgement I purchased it. Turned out to be one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve ever made. This thing is awesome. It&#x27;s so ergonomic, visually appealing, charges in one hour and lasts for weeks, is so simple to clean, and shaves, wet or dry, as good as a razor with no cuts, nicks, etc. I know I probably sound like an employee of Panasonic, but I&#x27;m not an employee, just a fan. It&#x27;s a little spendy but well worth it. If I could afford to, I&#x27;d buy one of these for each of my brothers.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver to replace one I got almost ten years ago, and I love it the same, Panasonic make good shavers.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this shaver for me as a gift.  I have sensitive skin and needed a shaver that was able to shave close without leaving a rash. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth. It beats a blade hands down. Shave wet if you want outstanding results and rinse blade during shave to maintain maximum closeness and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warren</li>
    <li> This is amazing product, high quality. Excellent.</li>
    <li> It sounds good is it a woman one or a men one.  Is there any diffrence and dose it hurt can you do all your body sorry too many questions😄</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first electronic shaver. It seems like it does the purpose. They say that if you&#x27;ve never shaved with an electronic shaver then your skin will react. In my case it did as such. But other then that it cuts pretty close to a smooth skin. Occasionally I would have to use a manual disposable shaver to get hairs that cannot be cut with the unit. Since it is a wet/dry shaver I would take the advantage of using the feature and it is ok to use shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this new razor for about 3 weeks now.  I must say that I find it gives me a much closer shave than my braun series 3 I had been using for several years.  So far I love this new shaver.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!  I&#x27;m glad I took advantage of one of the daily deals and got this.  He hasn&#x27;t had to use a regular razor and shaving cream since Christmas.  He has to shave daily for his job, so this makes it super easy.  He also likes to shave his head daily and boy is it smooth!</li>
    <li> I got this shaver after using my old norelco one for ages.  Honestly I didn&#x27;t know there could be such a difference between electric razors, but no I know.  This shaver is great.  It&#x27;s been about a month and I love it so far.  The Charger is great to have , just drop it it.  It will even dry your razor for you if you use shaving cream with it or wash the razor after (it is a wet/dry).  It has a cleaning setting I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but manually cleaning it with water is as easy as it can possibly be.    Shaves are close for me.  I usually shave once every 3 days or so.  Maybe a bit more frequently now and then.  It is quite an improvement from my previous electric razor.  I never used a wet/dry before, so occasionally shaving with shaving cream on with this thing seemed odd at first, but it works very very well and I get an ultra-close shave when needed.  Most times I just use it dry and it is great.    Highly recommended in all areas so far.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt this is the best shaver and shave I have ever received. Its as close a s babies botom every time and I finish the shave in 1/2 the time. One pass over the area is all it takes. It makes one look forward to shaving now.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an old Braun which served its purpose but not nearly as well as the new one.</li>
    <li> Who ever figured that leaving a blinking LED light going all night was not the smartest move!  The shaver itself didn&#x27;t give a close shave, I know it says that it takes a month to get used to it but Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a month to go without shaving to find it still doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit! Perfect shaver! Need more usage to discover! Better if there is more cleaner for free. Thank Aamzon, Thank Panasonic!</li>
    <li> Great~ wolking very well!!</li>
    <li> Works good so far.  I have bought it one month ago.  Few things to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really can&#x27;t tell when the detergent on self cleaning runs out.&lt;br /&gt;The water needs to be replaced after every use.&lt;br /&gt;It does make noise when it is going through clean and dry phase.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work very well with coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have gave it 5 stars otherwise.  I might still decide to change depending on how long the foil and the blades last.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of these units - Panasonic ES-LA93-K. I purchased the first one in November 2011 and then its replacement in July 2014. The first unit&#x27;s trimmer stopped working, and then a few weeks later the actual motor failed. Figuring it had given me the closest shave by an electronic shaver, I ordered the same model in July 2014. Most reviewers here already covered how close the shave is (it&#x27;s smooooth) so I have nothing to add on that. I have two negatives however that may become apparent after six or more months.&lt;br /&gt;The first issue is with the display panel. I like the bright blue display but after about six months the display becomes distorted and displays non-sense symbols that no longer indicate battery life, time of use, etc. This is not a deal killer for me, but I assume the problem is the result of moisture getting inside the unit. The first model I owned was used in the shower (as they advertised), and the display went bad in five or six months. The second model I used was only used at the sink and was rinsed quickly after each use - taking care not to dampen the display area, but its display still went bad after six months. So my current Panasonic still works great - but the display now reminds me of the wrist device worn by the alien in the movie Predator.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is the shave performance. Both shavers gave less of a close shave after about four to six months. I use the vortex cleaning system with my shaver, so I assume my beard wears down the blades and foil over time. After about a year or so, I replace the blades and/or foil. The second shaver showed signs of a drop off much sooner than the first model I owned. This just means I need to shave a little longer to get the same close shave. This might be typical, but I would expect a longer period of like-new performance from a shaver like this.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I have to say there is no shaver out there that has performed where it counts like this one. I have used shavers from Braun and Norelco and they never shaved as close as these Panasonics. I also really like the wet/dry aspect of this shaver, but when that is claimed as a feature I expect a more water-tight product.</li>
    <li> For nearly 20 years I have always stuck with Braun- however SOOOOO glad I switched to this Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I found that Braun always pinched me. If I didn&#x27;t shave for 2-3 days it was very uncomfortable to shave as it kept pinching making the experience very uncomfortable.  As soon as I switched to this Panasonic - I found the shave to be smooth, no pinching occurring, and even if I leave shaving for a couple of days this Panasonic works a treat. No problems at all. It still shaves cleanly, quicker than the Braun and much more comfortable and smoother to the skin. I highly endorse this product and recommend that if you electric shave you switch to this product for an easier life. For years I kept sticking with the same brand for the sake of it- however I finally made the leap, and so happy I did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the way it shaves as well as the way it self cleans, awesome. We haven&#x27;t had it for very long, but I wanted to share how well it appears to be handling my sons beard.  I bought it for my son because he has so much hair.  He hasn&#x27;t had much luck with electric shavers, he can never finish shaving on one charge. This shaver needed no recharge, finished his shaving no problem. Purchasing the Panasonic ES-LA93-K Arc4 Electric Shaver, is far more cost effective for us. Compared to using a regular shaver and continually needing cartridges which are so expensive.  This shaver will definitely be put to the test.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave.... I&#x27;m coming from a 4 year old norelco something or other that was quite good, but was at the end of its days, so the Panasonic was new to me.  I have a couple of their TVs and I&#x27;m happy so why not give their other stuff a try. Unrelated I know but why not give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the shave is close and comfortable, which at the end of the day is what I got it for.  I think it is closer than the norelco and I like the fact it has a straight edge and the latest tech.  It was tough getting a straight line at the side burns with my old shaver and its much better now, so mission accomplished there.  I got the version with the cleaner for the convenience and so far that has been working well.  The pop up trimmer is good and cuts well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides:&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is loud, relative to the norelco.  It basically screams when I use it and my wife has told me a few times that its definitely too noisy.  Likewise with the cleaning cycle.  And, the cleaner does take a long time to get done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good shave.  The display is nice and the battery indicator is great. It also feels good to hold and has a solid feel.  If you could deal with the noise,  its great.  I can, so I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no professional writer, nor am I a professional shaver, but I will give you the most unbiased review I can muster. Years ago I attempted to change from my triple bladed movie star to a mechanical, more convenient method. It was a catastrophe! The electric shaver made my neck break out like a 15 year old going to the prom. I already experienced slight discomfort and razor burn from my triple bladed warrior, but refused to go electric after that experience. Since then, upset at life and the fact that, if I shaved I would break out, if I didn&#x27;t shave I would get in-grown hairs. It was true, facial hair had a tight hold on me. I had to do something before I attempted (Gasp!) Nads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review after review, site after site, I tirelessly scoured every chunk of data I could for all the major hitters out there. I had my heart set on a Braun, I figured with a company that strong they have to have a good product, Right? They do, I purchased it (elsewhere) and it was enjoyable. But that darn 15 year old living in my neck wanted out. Every manufacturer will tell you to give them 30 days so your face can adjust to the shaver. It never happened. Well, not that they don&#x27;t make a fantastic shaver, it just wasn&#x27;t the best for me. However, leaps and bounds above my first experience, so I figured there has got to be one out there that has it perfect for my sensitive..er, my 15 year old boyish neck.  Insert Panasonic here. It has been close to 2 months that I have had this shaver. My skin has never forgotten to thank me. I use this bad boy every morning and have never experienced razor burn or irritation. And I use it primarily dry, it&#x27;s so choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the technical details - I can get through a full shave in under 4 minutes. Generally, I use it all week (Mon - Fri) and THEN I put it in to be cleaned and charged. It charges very quickly, within an hour. Hence, by the time it&#x27;s gone through a complete clean cycle it&#x27;s charged. It has a built in pop-up shaver, but I have only used it twice. It&#x27;s so difficult to get the pop-up shaver to actually pop-up that I&#x27;ve given up on it. I don&#x27;t need it, but I can&#x27;t say how effective it is since it must be defective and won&#x27;t work. Enough of me jibber jabbing, I&#x27;ll break it down:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fast shave time&lt;br /&gt;Super smooth result&lt;br /&gt;Zero irritation&lt;br /&gt;Contours to face&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a on-the-go case and protective shield&lt;br /&gt;Lock switch so it doesn&#x27;t turn on in your bag or what have you&lt;br /&gt;Battery last plenty long enough for the whole week without a charge in between.&lt;br /&gt;Included pop-up shaver&lt;br /&gt;Self cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pop-up shaver is a pain in the &amp;*% to get up (Must be defective)&lt;br /&gt;Loud when it&#x27;s being cleaned&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make me an omelet in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you have suffered from sensitive skin (as I do) and have held off going electric, this is your solution. This thing is amazingly close and accurate. I have literally thrown out my old razors, maybe that was a psychological move to get me to really want to love this product, but it really does work. Replacing blades is expensive, so can replacing blades on electric shavers. Additionally, there are cleaning cartridges to purchase with this unit. It sounds crazy, I know, but I will tell you that for the fact that finally, for the first time in my life, I can shave and not be embarrassed about the red headed step child screaming for attention on my neck. This was a confidence boosting, life changing decision. Get more confident, get the Panasonic Arc 4.t I have only used it twice.

    <li> Bought this shaver as a potential upgrade to the es8243. Product did not provide a good shave and it was impossible to get a clean shave above the upper lip. Shave from the es8243 is much better and I&#x27;m sticking with that shaver from this point forward. I have a light to medium beard if that helps.</li>
    <li> Cannot get decent shave, worst electric razor I have ever used. I would like to return it, but do not have original packaging.</li>
    <li> All comparisons have to be against Braun shavers, and this one does not lack anything - construction not notch, exudes quality all around. The first few experiences shaving have been good, and will hope it gets better only as I get used to the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest reason I had bought this over the Braun was due to its ability of wet shaving. On this count, it was very good, and I will say better than shaving dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I have docked it 1 star is that it is bit unwieldy (bulky), and difficult to use around tight areas on the face (around the ears etc.) - need to get used to it, and hopefully will get better with experience.</li>
    <li> I have mixed emotions.  Have contacted Panasonic several times and I haven&#x27;t even had this item for 30 days.  Confusion over selection of courses, next call was length of courses.  Final call was due to water not draining after course is complete.  Manufacture suggested I return product for a replacement as product has a two year warranty.  Not pleased that I have to pay for the freight to the return center.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the feel of the shaver not happy with annoying blinking blue light as well as blinking green lights after course has finished. Must remove shaver from recharger/cleaner after course is finished  Customer service is so-so.</li>
    <li> Read the review and thought of trying it as it was offered at a fantastic discount. No regrets! no hesitation in recommending this shaver.</li>
    <li> good razor works great on everyone have 3 people using it keeps a great charge cuts the hair right off easy to use cleans easy</li>
    <li> This shaver gives me the best shave from an electric that I have ever experienced. I just retired my six year old Braun Pulsonic 9595 and the Panasonic shave is closer with less effort. This Shaver feels a bit bulky at first but you quickly get use to it. It is lightweight compared to the Braun, but seems well built. It seems to conform to facial contours better. You do not need to apply a lot of pressure to get a close shave and there is no irritation. I have tried a wet and dry shave and there is no substantial difference in closeness. The cleaning station sounds a bit clanky when cleaning but it does a thorough job. I like that it uses water and detergent rather than alcohol based solution. The cleaning cartridges are very inexpensive and are supposed to last 30 cleanings. I have a thick beard and a shave takes me about 5 minutes with this shaver which is about half the time it took with the Braun Pulsonic. I recommend this and would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is also easy to clean manually under running water so you can also buy the model without the cleaning station if you wish. It is about $60 cheaper and is model ESLA63s</li>
    <li> Wow, I love how closely this razor shaves without leaving nicks and scars. It is a bit pricey but for what it does and how it shaves it well worth the investment.I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Not bad compared to other razors I have used. I can get a close shave, but it takes time (like all other razors I have used). I can only get 2-2 1/2 shaves on a charge. I have always loved Panasonic&#x27;s self cleaning feature. I have a tough beard and have always have had trouble with any razor I have used (Panasonic, Norelco, Braun, Remington), but this one is better than any I have used. I expect that someone with a easier beard to shave would absolutely love this razor. For me, It&#x27;s probably about the best I will ever see.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have ever had. It&#x27;s worth its price.</li>
    <li> I switched from Norelco expecting at least a better shave.  However, after almost two years, I have given up even pretending to like this shaver.  At first, it was continuous irritation and bleeding.  When I would take special care of one area, another area would be irritated or bleeding.  It took almost five months to become comfortable using this shaver and I had to use it wet in the shower with some form of lubricant (Fusion, Creamo) or the irritation returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after one year, the cleaning and charging station suddenly stopped working.  At that time, there were no replacements available.  I had also purchased one of these shavers for my adult son.  He uses it dry but waves the shaver over his face very fast and repeatedly.  He always has a red and irritated face afterwards but it does not seem to bother him.  His cleaning and charging station developed a bad case of mildew or mold that made the bathroom stink when the dryer fan ran.  We could never get it clean enough to stop growing the mold or mildew so he only uses it to charge the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the inner blades once at six months and the full set after a little more than a year with no improvement either time.  In fact, the shave on my neck became horrible after the second replacement with long hairs being completely ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, to cap it all off, the display has now begun to show incorrect readings such as 4:88 for the time of the shave and battery life left at 28% after only one shave from a full recharge.  The only part of the display that I believe is the remaining battery bar chart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be moving on to another vender.</li>
    <li> Broken within a few months. The shaver no longer starts. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for  my husband. He loved it. It cleans itself and its easy to use. I like that it has a trimmer as well.</li>
    <li> it shaves really well and I am loving the mini washing machine that comes with it great product definitely exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> Good product, performs well, but it is very noisy when cleaning and the cleaning cycle is quite long.</li>
    <li> Well, first off, this shaver shaves better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve owned many high-end electric shavers over the years, and I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic for slightly less than two years. Before the ES-LA93, I owned a Braun Series 7 shaver. But the Panasonic has been a big disappointment, and rather than buying replacement cutter blocks and foil (which are due), I&#x27;ll likely replace the unit with a Philips Norelco 1280X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, soon after I got my ES-LA93, the cleaning function on the cleaning/charging unit stopped working. It wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble to deal with the warranty, so I simply rinsed the unit after each use and put it in the charging station in order to dry it and recharge the unit. However, unlike the Braun, the Panasonic charging station won&#x27;t automatically select cleaning or drying mode. This means, often (when I forget to hit the button on the charging station), the razor is cold and clammy during the next use. Not very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well, for some reason, Panasonic designers saw fit to equip the ES-LA93 with a blindingly bright blue LED display that blinks whenever the razor is in the charging station. This LED is so bright that it is easily seen in our bedroom through the bathroom door. That&#x27;s very annoying when you&#x27;re trying to go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the power switch is designed such that you will often hit it while you&#x27;re shaving, which will shut the unit off. As a result, I often have to turn the unit back on several times during a shaving session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while the ES-LA93 does shave very well, it&#x27;s other \\&quot;features\\&quot; make for a very annoying daily experience, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had another version of this Panasonic and it did a remarkably good job in the shower as well as out.  As to this model, it has proven to this point to be as good if not better than my previous Panasonic.  If the battery survives two years I will be happy as a clam.</li>
    <li> I did alot of homework before buying this razor. As a former blade or 3 head user only, I did not believe this style could be so comfortable and still do a great job- well it is, and it does. Absolute closest thing to a real blade you can get. Don&#x27;t buy a cheaper model, spend the extra on this one- the difference will be worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with electric shavers for 40 years and have owned every brand over this time period, but can now say the Panasonic Arc4 is the best &amp; most advanced technology available. This is the third model Panasonic I have purchased over the last two decades and after my first shave it was the closest most comfortable shave I can ever remember. They have cracked the code on wet/dry shaving with the ES-LA93-K because it far surpasses the last two Panasonic models owned for efficiency and comfort. I am very happy and recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> clear and fast, no bad feeling</li>
    <li> He really likes the LED panel that tells when it needs cleaning. Also likes the free movement of the razor that makes it easy to shave the curves of his face. The fixed movement is good for the upper lip. All this and it is real quiet too! Money well spent!</li>
    <li> I switched from straight razors (Gillette Mach III Turbo) nearly two years ago after hearing a commercial for Panasonic&#x27;s new expensive electric shavers that were supposed to rival a straight shave.  I went out and bought the 4-blade ES-LA63 model which I have been using steadily ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I recently upgraded to the 5-Blade ES, attracted to the claims that 5 blades will give even a better shave.  At the time of purchase, the LA93K with cleaning system was only $5 more than the LV81 without, so you can guess which one I bought.  I really didn&#x27;t need a cleaning system since I had gotten used to manually cleaning my 4-blade ES-LA63 by running it under the faucet with some soft soap.  For $5 more I am not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to talk to all of you about what it&#x27;s like switching from a straight razor to an electric, just in case you are contemplating doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I need to say is that nothing does as an outstanding shaving job as a straight razor.  While an electric razor can can give you the same perfectly smooth shave that the straight razor provides, it does have flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What these Panasonic electric shavers will provide you with is a shave that is undistinguishable from a straight razor.  In fact, upon completing your shave and running your hand across your face, you would swear that you just shaved with a razor.  The problem?  The neck area is almost impossible to perfectly clean.  This is a common problem with any electric razor.  You will find that there are just small patches on the neck that will never be clean shaven, and thus, touchups may be required from a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, for those sick of paying the costs of straight razors, I am uncertain that buying a $300+ Electric Razor is really saving you money considering that the blades and foil need replacing every so often and they don&#x27;t come cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, there is a real joy to shaving with an electric over a straight razor.  First, you rarely cut yourself.  As much as I love a brand-new straight razor, I hate the inevitable \\&quot;nick\\&quot; that comes with it.  The only time you will cut your face with an electric razor is if you apply too much force, and really, it&#x27;s almost impossible to do.  Secondly, you have the freedom to move the electric razor head across your face in any direction you want, as quickly as you need, without fear of hurting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of using this Panasonic electric razor?  Using it wet.  It actually gives you a much better shave if you wet your face with warm water and apply shaving cream.  If you want the best stuff to use with this razor, I highly recommend Remington KING OF SHAVES gel.  You only need a small dollop of the stuff, but it really does an outstanding job of shaving your face without gunking the razor.  It leaves your face so amazingly smooth you&#x27;ll be touching it with disbelief all day.  And with these gels, you won&#x27;t even need after shave.  Try the Menthol.  Really gives a nice kick to your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the razor dry, I would recommend applying pre-electric shave beforehand.  It really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect shaving miracles the first few weeks you switch from a straight razor to an electric.  You&#x27;ll find a note in the box from Panasonic telling you that great things take time.  They aren&#x27;t kidding.  Your face needs to adapt to the electric razor.  It will take your face at least two weeks (if not more) to adjust the new shaving method and only then will you see optimal results.  I went from a 6-minute shave to one just under 4 minutes.  That is how much my face has adapted to the Panasonic razor over the years.  So, the more you use it, the quicker your shave will be over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two years of going with an electric, I don&#x27;t miss blades at all.  In fact, I don&#x27;t want to go back to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery goes down about 10% for every shave (mine is averageof 4.5 minutes tops).  Therefor, expect about 10-12 shaves from a full to charge to having to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the 5-blade Panasonic better than the 4-blade?  The answer is, slightly.  The 5-blade seems slightly more refined.  It&#x27;s quieter, for one.  It does seem to shave my face faster than the 4-blade, but only by mere seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging/cleaning system is nice.  It has a magnet that holds the razor in place while it charges.  The downside is, you need to buy cleaning cartridges once the included one runs out.  If you buy the same razor without the cleaning system it&#x27;s quite easy to clean under a faucet and the application of soft soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this 5-blade razor worth over $300?  Well, if you have the money to spend, then yes.  This truly is the Cadillac of electric razors.  Once you start using it, you won&#x27;t want to shave with anything cheaper.  Just realize that as close a shave as these babies give (and it can be as close as a razor), it will have problems reaching areas of the neck.  This means that you won&#x27;t be able to really give up that straight razor after all.of 4.5 minutes tops).  Therefor, expect about 10-12 shaves from a full to charge to having to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the 5-blade Panasonic better than the 4-blade?  The answer is, slightly.  The 5-blade seems slightly more refined.  It&#x27;s quieter, for one.  It does seem to shave my face faster than the 4-blade, but only by mere seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging/cleaning system is nice.  It has a magnet that holds the razor in place while it charges.  The downside is, you need to buy cleaning cartridges once the included one runs out.

Just realize that as close a shave as these babies give (and it can be as close as a razor), it will have problems reaching areas of the neck.  This means that you won&#x27;t be able to really give up that straight razor after all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about 1.5 years now. It is, without compare, the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. Before this I had tried multiple electrics (foil and rotary) and several wet razors, each combined with any type of lather, pre-shave, and post-shave lotions, creams, etc I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my beard comes in at so many different angles, or if my skin is just that sensitive, but I always ended up with lots of bumps, bloody spots, and serious burning and itch. It was impossible to shave every day because the rash from the previous day was always so bad, and I was lucky if I could shave two days after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I switched to this shaver it was a little rough for the first few weeks. I still got some burn as my skin/beard adjusted to it, but no where as bad. Maybe by week three I was doing just fine though, and it didn&#x27;t take long to be able to shave every day without any burn. I still use an alcohol based pre-shave, but that&#x27;s more to get the hairs to stand up a bit better. I still get a little burn every once in a while, but that&#x27;s usually if I haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days. Still no where near the burn as anything previous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually shave twice a week (just due to laziness), and it takes me ~3.5-4.5 minutes. When I did shave daily it was a pretty quick 2 minute shave. This morning I hadn&#x27;t shaved in about 5 days and it took a bit over 7 minutes. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve got a pretty average thickness to my beard, so if you&#x27;ve got a heavy beard I imagine it would take a bit longer. I haven&#x27;t kept track of how long the battery lasts, but at that rate it&#x27;s over a month. I don&#x27;t feel like I have to charge it that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much just use the dock to charge the shaver. For daily use I just take the foil off, rinse it, and let it air dry. To clean I just add some soap to the blades, put the foil back on, and let it do its 20 second self clean deal. When I did use the dock for cleaning it cleaned the device well, I just haven&#x27;t ordered more of the soap that goes with it. I&#x27;d probably suggest getting the ES-LA63-S if you&#x27;re not going to use the dock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - Great shaver for sensitive skin, you won&#x27;t go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> Works perfect as rated, though you have to have a little patience for your face get used to it....</li>
    <li> I love this shaver its my second one and I&#x27;m buying another because I travel and like to have one in my bag and one at home. Excellent shaving quality and of course it cleans up easily when its washed. Highly recommended but watch the price because I paid less than $150 USD and its often selling for $200. Very good product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> First electric shaver that has actually worked for me.  3 weeks on, still at 30% charge, every day, and my old tough beard.  I have been cleaning without the built in by using a previous brush, but so far so good.  No burn like others, glides over the face and my bad chin as smooth as the single edge I was using previously. The battery life though seems to be astounding.  At 3 weeks I still have some left.  My average shave time is about 1 minute to scrape over jaws and chin good.  First one that has ever even gotten me to write a review.  Haven&#x27;t tried built in cleaning yet, has been no need to.</li>
    <li> The razor works great. The cleaning/charging station is junk.&lt;br /&gt;Will not work while plugged in, so backup razor required.&lt;br /&gt;I really like being able to use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Works best with tube non-foaming shave cream.</li>
    <li> Not that I know anything about the product, but my fella loved it!  Works great especially with his sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Smooth shaving, better than my old panasonic three blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and price are great with amazon. I don&#x27;t use the cleaning station much but it is nice, you do need to replace the cleaning cartridge every 3 months though.</li>
    <li> Thes shavers and the parts are not made like the ones i used before. I always had Panasonic shavers and they were built very different than the ones that are being made today. This last one that I bought is nothing but a piece of PLASTIC put together. Also the blades are not as sharp and don&amp;#34;t last as long as the older ones did. As of the 3 shaves that I&amp;#34;ve bought the other men 2 men don&amp;#34;t like the way they shave, i&amp;#34;m the only one that shave&#x27;s daily with my shave. Thank You, Leo Gianfriddo</li>
    <li> My review may be skewed slightly as my previous electric shaver was a 10 year old Braun model.  This electric shaver is fantastic!  It doesn&#x27;t pull any hairs which is nice.  While it&#x27;s not quite as close as a regular razor, it is pretty darn close, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like regular razor does.  I have owned this for several months now, and still every time I use it I&#x27;m amazed on how nice of a shave it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base is a little noisy, but from what I hear pretty much every brand is close to the same noise level.  Being able to clean it under the faucet is a nice touch when I travel with it, so I don&#x27;t need to pack the bulky base.  All in all this is an amazing electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Allow a few weeks(up to 4) for your face to get used to the shaver. Once my face adjusted to it, I can easily dry shave without any irritation or pain. This is a very nice electric razor and the cleaning station is a plus. I also like the fact that I can also wet shave with this as well.</li>
    <li> I like the smooth shave but the head is just a little too big. Overall, its very good. You will like it too.</li>
    <li> After reading others&#x27; ratings on this electric razor, I decided to buy it for my 94-year old father who has moderate Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and can no longer shave himself with a traditional blade razor. He&#x27;s had it for two weeks and loves it. He uses it every day now and gets a close shave. My mother appreciates the ease of cleaning and care.</li>
    <li> My ES883&#x27;s (the best electric razor) battery died and is not replaceable. I was hoping that Panasonic had made some advances in men&#x27;s electric shaving, but the Panasonic ES-LA93-K is not it. It is a good razor, but I prefer the ES-883. I don&#x27;t understand the need for the cleaner, it is a wet or dry razor, just rinse it in water after use. What a gimmick. I don&#x27;t understand the pivoting head either. Another gimmick. My wrist can take care of that as well. Basically, whatever I do with my wrist to maneuver the razor, it is countered by the pivoting head of the razor. The razor head is humungous compared to the ES-883 and does not shave any better. So far each time I have used the ES-LA93-K after 3 days of not shaving, I have gotten bumps afterwords. Possibly hair bumps or an ingrown hair from the razor pulling the hair too far before it cuts it. The side-burn cutter is useless. My side-burn hair is coarse. The razor seems to glide over the hair instead of cutting it. It does not shave as close as a blade, but you can get a smooth shave if you keep at it long enough. For me to get a smooth shave, it takes about 7 to 8 minutes constantly shaving, turning the razor, and pulling the skin over the same places to get the hard to get stubs. It is a good razor, worth buying, but get rid of the gimmicks.</li>
    <li> So far, not so good. Doesn&#x27;t glide very freely, and has a high-pitched hum as it runs. The cleaning station is pretty loud as well -- although effective. Strongly considering sending it back. Previous and preferred shaver: Braun 380s-4.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, very practical, cost-effective! Very suitable for mature men.Body wash, clean barrel, convenient and practical.So good,I like it so much！</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  I have had no battery problems.  So far I am very pleased.  Would definitely order again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver a lot, but when the cleaning unit failed I was directed to send it back to a repair place in McAllen, TX.  After two weeks with no acknowledgement I went through a two hour fiasco of evasion and non-answers.  The end result was that I discovered there is NO repair facility, just an exchange service whereby you must return the entire product: shaver, cord and cleaning unit for exchange.  On present experience this will take about three weeks with no logical explanation of how you are meant to shave in the interim! - just go and buy another shaver, I guess...I am now waiting for the return of my cleaning unit after sitting around their premises for eleven days and I must then return all components for exchange - no refunds permitted even under warranty.  I&#x27;ll have to acquire another shaver since I don&#x27;t plan on growing a beard and maybe I&#x27;ll just stay with that one going forward.  Nice way to keep your customers happy, Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many electric shavers over the years (norelco, braun, etc.) and was always skeptical about the shave quality.  I did a lot of research and found this Shaver.  When used wet with a lite coating of shave gel, this shaver actually gets closer than my Gillette 4 Blade razor!  The trick is the gel and using it wet.  For dry shaves, razors are still closer.  My only complaints center around the layout of the cleaning unit.  The unit is not as nice as the Braun models.  It has a status light which really doesn&#x27;t tell you what it&#x27;s statusing.  There is a decision tree in the manual which makes absolutely NO sense.  However, the cleaning unit does work very well; if you don&#x27;t mind the drying fan being on for 2 hours.  The other thing is that when it&#x27;s fully charged the entire display on the unit flashes continuously in bright blue, so in order to get to sleep, you need to take it out of the cleaning unit, unless you don&#x27;t mind the strobe light effect or your bathroom is far removed from your bedroom.  A small flashing or non-flashing light indicating that the unit is fully charged makes mores sense to me.  Overall, I highly recommend this shaver.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but so are those $4 gillette razor cartridges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AT 5 MONTHS - The base unit no longer functions.  It doesn&#x27;t circulate water and cleaning solution.  There is no apparent blockage, it must be the pump.  Called customer service and they informed me that the base doesn&#x27;t carry the replacement warranty like the shaver!  I have to return the base AND the shaver, at my own expense, and wait for repairs!  THINK I&#x27;LL JUST FORGET THE BASE AND USE THE SHAVER WITHOUT IT.  Good customer service would have sent me a new base in the mail sight unseen!  So much for Panasonic!  Still love the shaver itself though.  Hope it lasts as long as my Braun!</li>
    <li> Have owned many electric razors, this is by far the best one i ever had; shaves very well in or out of the shower; shaves very smooth without any nicks what-so-ever.  Will buy again from Amazon</li>
    <li> I was tired of ripping skin off with dull razor blades so started looking for an electric razor. Found this in a review of razors for shaving your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I had 5 days of growth on my head. This razor handled that amount of growth with no problem. In 5.5 minutes my head was almost as smooth as using a blade. Close enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shaved several times with it now and it seems the more I shave the smoother the shave gets. If you&#x27;re looking for something to keep your head and face smooth, that doesn&#x27;t burn, is easy to use and easy to keep clean, buy this.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Braun shaver with this one. It served me well for years but it was getting long in the tooth and I chose the Panasonic to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that struck me is how much less this irritates my skin, even when shaving dry. It&#x27;s much more comfortable than my previous razor, especially in areas that tend to annoy me, like the upper lip or around the adam&#x27;s apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed is that clean cycle leaves it looking new. The Braun system, even with a brand new cleaning cartridge, always left at least some residue. The Panasonic system appears to work much better. You cannot tell it was used to shave once it&#x27;s finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third thing I noticed is the insufferable blue blinking when it&#x27;s done charging. Other reviewers have commented on this and it&#x27;s really a design oversight. Do I need my razor to blink at me every two seconds for infinity just to indicate it&#x27;s gone from 90% to 100% charged? No. No, I do not. I will overlook this flaw since I&#x27;m so happy with it otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some Kiehl&#x27;s shaving lotion laying around that I&#x27;d never used, so I gave it a shot this morning. I&#x27;ve never experienced a wet shave with an electric razor before. Panasonic says to give any shaving method three weeks to get your face used to it. I&#x27;m already blown away by how nice it feels, and it&#x27;s only going to get better? Yeah, this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Had a Braun before; but this one does a better job.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Bought it as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. Amazon is too good. This product is not available anywhere in India.</li>
    <li> As is the case, in my experience, with electric shavers the shave is not close, especially under the neck area.  Easy and comfortable to hold, but it is rather large.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.  I would rate the the Panasonic a 4 on performance</li>
    <li> After 35 years of blade shaving I have tried my second electric shaver, the other was 30 plus years ago which was a horrible experience. I have a super hard stubble yet really tender soft skin on my face. I am prone to bad shaving burn and subsequnet rash........&lt;br /&gt;Did the research, took the plung and purchased the Panasonic ES-LA93-K after many hours of reading, it was worth it! What a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the ES-LA93-K on dry skin and had no razor burn or rash, none at all!! after a couple of weeks tried it wet and was even more surprised, what resulted was an even closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;This for me has been a revolutionary experience and can recommend this product as an outstanding performing shaver</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby who is in the military and needs to shave daily. He tried to like it, but it just did not come close to a close enough shave. He ended up having to shave twice daily: once with this, and then immediately with a regular razor. Kinda defeats the purpose. We returned.</li>
    <li> Gave me a close comfortable shave right out of the box. It&#x27;s gotten even better as my beard adjusted. Great features. I especially like the option of wet or dry shaving. Well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Expensive but looks like actually made in Japan. I use it for my face and my shaved head so need something with  some stamina and horsepower. I killed the top of the line Braum. have had this over a year.</li>
    <li> Good price and work great</li>
    <li> Shave is not as close as Norelco 3d shaver but hopefully more reliable.  I use it in the shower so the noise level is not too bad. Noise may be a problem for some.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned.  It gives a very close shave in a short amount of time, even if I miss a day or two.  Well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for more than two years.  Was a Norelco fan for years, but decided to try something different after reading all the good reviews on this one.  Says you have to replace blades and foil after two years, but mine are still fine.  I recently bought the blades and foil just to have on hand, but have not needed to install.  Even if you don&#x27;t use the cleaner, the cleaning/charging station is great to have.  You can clean it with liquid hand soap and water as the directions tell you, then just use the drying function on the cleaning station.  This keeps the blades from corroding IMO, and is probably why my blades are still cutting just fine.</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVER IVE EVER HAD . AMAZINGLY CLOSE AND SMOOTH</li>
    <li> my husband loves this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now after my last Panasonic finally died after several years of use. For the price I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m getting anything better than my last shaver provided. I was sold on the extra RPM&#x27;s and the idea of extra cutting blades, but not finding the benefit. What it will translate into is a higher foil / blade replacement cost when the time comes.  It seemed in my research I read a lot about battery life based on a 3-minute shave; are there really people that can do it in 3 minutes?!?  I&#x27;m needing as long if not longer. I thought the larger head / extra blades would make things go faster, but it doesn&#x27;t really and makes some places (ie under nose) more difficult to deal with. Granted, I have whiskers like velcro but I could have gone with a less expensive model and achieved the same result. As for folks complaining about the cleaning unit, whatever. It&#x27;s going to make some noise-- and it does take a while- but it does a pretty good job getting things cleaned.  I&#x27;d suggest going with a lower model; might make it a little easier to pack on a trip too.</li>
    <li> Quick, efficient and use it for a fast freshen up.</li>
    <li> I use this razor every day and it does a great job!  I have a job where I need to shave everyday and a face that can&#x27;t stand a traditional razor very often.  This razor gives a close shave and no irritation.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Have this shaver for a month now and still letting my face get use to a electric shaver. But so far it looks good. The shave is close and it works great.. The cleaning station takes a very long time to clean, so I use canned air to blow the shaver out to help save on cleaning chemicals.</li>
    <li> Shaves great but will not stand as shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews so was pretty hopeful.  My 8249s was stolen by customs in the Dominican (save your money, don&#x27;t waste time going there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace it.  This thing is giant.  I mean I feel like I could just set it in one place on my face and it would cut half the side.  For some reason this product greatly irritates my face.  This is my 4th pany so I love them and always recommend them but this one is just not doing it for me.  The motor seems great.  Construction is top notch.  The cleaning is easy but it just flat out does not work for my face, skin or size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get my old 82 back.  Glad everyone else enjoys it.  I love just about all things Panasonic...just not this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor two years ago, after purchasing Panasonic&#x27;s women&#x27;s razor and finding it woefully lacking.&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LA93-K was the top of the line Panasonic shaver for men and is leagues ahead.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s held up well and has a long enough battery life to shave legs and armpits (10+ minutes) - which couldn&#x27;t be said for the women&#x27;s model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pale sensitive skin and dark hair that grows fast.  Regular shaving doesn&#x27;t work well for me, because the next day I need to shave again, but can&#x27;t without seriously injuring/irritating my skin.  However, with this electric shaver the problem is solved.  It is very gentle on my skin and I&#x27;ve experienced very few irritations.  Something that used to be a constant source of stress and distress for me has become something I rarely think about - this device makes it easy and painless to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also very nearsighted, so I used to have trouble shaving since I couldn&#x27;t see what I was doing in the shower.  I picked this Panasonic shaver since it was wet/dry, and I use it about half the time wet and half dry.  It&#x27;s much safer than a regular razor, so even in the shower I don&#x27;t have to worry about injuring myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were purchasing again, I might skip the cleaning module.  I rarely use it.  It works well but is noisy and takes forever and can&#x27;t come on trips with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest model sounds even better, though I have no excuse to upgrade since my current (and costly) shaver is still going strong!  The main issue I have with it is it can&#x27;t handle longer hairs well, but luckily it has a tiny trimmer on the back which can cut the long hairs down to a length the shaver can handle.  The latest model has \\&quot;lift\\&quot; technology which might help with this.  Another option might be to have 2 devices - one trimmer and this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this helps any women who are wondering if this device would work well for them.  I strongly recommend purchasing a men&#x27;s model over the pink cheap women&#x27;s model.  The men&#x27;s model(s) are better in every way for any use a woman could have for it.  It is too bad Panasonic only markets this to men and sells a piece of junk for women, but I&#x27;m glad that the women&#x27;s model attracted my attention to electric shaving as I have become a huge fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great shaving cream that works well with this is Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Shikakai Shaving gel [[ASIN:B006NYTWLU Organic Shaving Gel Naked Unscented Dr. Bronner&#x27;s 7 oz Gel]] - it comes in unscented and several natural scents.</li>
    <li> Good item,good price,good service!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  I am glad I upgraded.  It seems to get me a quicker shave and closer then my previous lower version Panasonic.  The cleaning option is very convenient and gets it much cleaner than just rinsing alone.</li>
    <li> From some of the reviews, I expected to see a measurable difference from my Series 5 Braun, but there&#x27;s not that much difference. It&#x27;s a good razor, but it hasen&#x27;t met my expectations as of this time.</li>
    <li> Decent shaver. Still doesn&#x27;t get as close as a blade, difficulty shaving the neck line. Kinda overpriced in my opinion</li>
    <li> Works better than. I had imagined, although cleaning cycle is loud and long.</li>
    <li> Previously, I had a Panasonic ES8249 shaver and I purchased this one as a replacement/upgrade. In regards to shaving quality, I do not think that too much has changed. It is no better nor no worse than the previously model. I take the same time and effort as previously, the cleaning mechanism is the same. The extra 1000rpm&#x27;s and vibration doesn&#x27;t seem to achieve anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, a good shaver - but not a big improvement upon the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, it is as good as it gets????</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LA93 four blade Multi-flex mens shaver is all I could ask for.  I have problems with my skin and was a little worried that I would get a rash using this razor.  Much to my surprise ,not only did I get the best shave NO rash. I would endorse this electric razor to anybody.</li>
    <li> Does the job. The cleaning dock is not necessary as it takes three hours to clean the shaver, when a simple rinse will do. The shave is nice and close, both dry and wet work well. Good solid product.</li>
    <li> Panasonic ES-LA93-K&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my brother recommended this model after having it for couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;after trying 3 other models, i took my brother recommendation and bought this model. i takes me 4-6 minutes to shave because of my hair multiple directions. this model is very loud that i wakes my wife when i shave in the morning. few weeks of using it i start feel some roughness on my skin local to one spot. i found hair start growing under skin which become painful. i went back to my raiser, in one week all irritation and hair ingrowth disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m giving this model only 2 starts for its noisy operation and causing hair ingrowth. any other shaver under $100 would do the same quality job.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used, I have a tough beard and have to buy a new razor or cutters twice a year. I have tried many brands of rotary and foil razors over the years but none have worked as good or fast as this one. Normally I have to go over my face many times and directions and it usually takes me 8 minutes to shave but with this Panasonic I have cut my shaving time down to a little over 3 minutes. I know because it shows you how long you have been shaving each time you are done. I am very impressed, I have been using it for 2 months, I will let you know how long it lasts Update, it&#x27;s been 6 months, it has a timer which lets you know how long each shave takes , it used to be 2 1/2 minutes, now it&#x27;s around 4 minutes, I shave everyday and have Very thick growth, it&#x27;s time to replace the cutting heads. As for the razor and battery life, they are amazing, it still only needs charged once a week and runs great, it&#x27;s still far better than any other foil or rotary razor I have ever used( Philips, Norelco and Remington), this is my first Panasonic. I am in my fifties and have had dozens of razors!</li>
    <li> If you dont let your beard grow too long, this thing works great and doesnt leave any type of razor burn. However, if you let it get too long, you may get a few painful pulls here and there</li>
    <li> The best shave ever hands down ! I need to share with you I have always used high end Braun witch would leave my head feeling stuble. I switched to This Panasonic and dont regret one bit . When I received it the bow said try uor wet shave . I was so frustrated with my Braun shaver I thought nothing would work. I&#x27;m here to tell you I was wrong , when I tryed the wet shave I was so surprized  I had to write this reveiw.  It shaved as close as if not closer than a razor. I love it its awsome and I would highly recommend it . It better then a razor</li>
    <li> I finally retired my Panasonic ES8043 after almost 10 years of faithful service. This new shaver surpasses the shave quality of my old one. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to spend the extra money for the cleaning system, but I&#x27;m glad that I did. It seems to keep the blades in much better condition than if you were to just run it under a water stream. I use this shaver to shave my head as well as my face and can complete the task in about 5 minutes. It&#x27;s capable of &amp;#34;one pass shaving&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Very close shave. I love it. I&#x27;ve had it about two years at least I think. It would be helpful if you put the dates on this column. I think I need a new blade but I&#x27;ve used it way past the time I should have needed it. I think it&#x27;s hard to beat a hand razor but this comes very close or actually beat my closest shaves with hand razors. It&#x27;s smooth enough that I offer it to my wife. (considering)</li>
    <li> After many years of using a Norelco and getting more and more disatisfied with the shaves even after changing cutters yearly, I decided to try a foil-type shaver.  After reading many reviews on Amazon I chose this Panasonic.  Without a doubt, the BEST shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from ANY method!  Baby-smooth!  Well worth $182!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the cleaning station twice and love how it automatically cleans and dries the shaver head.  I do notice, however, that the unit is a bit sensitive to being moved because after I moved it the &amp;#34;status&amp;#34; light started blinking, which normally would indicate that the cleaning tray needed changed.  Once I pushed the tray in tighter the blinking stopped.  The shaver can also be cleaned with hand soap and water, but then it still needs to be dried so it&#x27;s just better to let the cleaning station do all the work, plus it keeps the shaver charged.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replace my old Panasonic ES8243 that I had used for 7 years.  I replaced it not because it tore up or had decreased performance, but rather because I accidentally dropped it and broke it to the point where it&#x27;d be cheaper in the long run to just buy an all new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was my first Panasonic razor (before then I had been a big Remington &amp; Norelco fan).  Panasonic has now won me over officially.  I have NO complaints about this razor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of power, super quiet, super effective, super easy on my skin (and that is saying something because I have very very sensitive skin), comfortable in the hand, aesthetically superior to other razors, and all around amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is very stylish and well built as well.  It&#x27;s easy to used and QUIET (other reviewers said it was loud -- if that&#x27;s loud then I must be deaf or dumb or both).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go Panasonic, another excellent product.  I&#x27;ve tried many razors in my day, look no further, you&#x27;ve found the keeper: BUY THIS RAZOR!!</li>
    <li> I have used Many electric shavers (Panasonic, Braun, Philips) and this is the best yet. Very quiet but powerful. My beard is quite heavy yet the shaver handles it well. You do have to over areas a few times but the best part is that there is almost no irritation. The shaver head is large but not unmanageble. The cleaning unit takes a long time but does a good job. It holds a charge for over a week, used every day. All in all, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do better than any other that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> nice shaver at a good price, the cleaner is a bit baffling and was not clear in the description when i shopped</li>
    <li> This is a great quality product. Panasonic makes well constructed products that last.&lt;br /&gt;Made in Japan. Cool cleaning system. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get a closer shave with a regular razor. In the long run this Panasonic will pay for itself when I don&#x27;t have to buy $30 replacement cartriges for my regular razor.</li>
    <li> The best shaver I have ever had</li>
    <li> My husband loves it: it works fine, cleans easily and shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;It never had a problem in the past 6 mos.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Panasonic electric razor. My first just stopped working after 3 years. The batteries they put in really last a couple years and then they just barely hold a charge but that&#x27;s the deal with anything these days. The razor cuts nice and close and barely ever nicks me. Is it better than their previous model? No not really at all. It&#x27;s more expensive though. The cleaning station sucks and mine doesn&#x27;t work properly after a year. It wouldn&#x27;t suck the water in then it wouldn&#x27;t dry etc....  Now I just plug and unplug each time and it works. Panasonic as others stated are a bunch of clowns when it comes to the warranty. they want you to send the whole thing in. Turn around is a month... So how do we shave then?  They know you won&#x27;t send it in...really angers me.  However in the end the razor does a great job.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shaver. The fact that you can use it in the shower to get a closer shave makes it a real winner. I would buy another one if this one ever died.</li>
    <li> This was well worth the the high initial cost.For me it is very comfortable.The best I have ever experienced.I like it.</li>
    <li> This shaver charges quickly and for me, lasts at least 8 days between charges.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves my face close even with my heavy beard. I have not used the included cleaning station yet.&lt;br /&gt;I just use a brush to clean off the blades about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this shaver and would buy this model again, depending how long the motor lasts.</li>
</ol>
