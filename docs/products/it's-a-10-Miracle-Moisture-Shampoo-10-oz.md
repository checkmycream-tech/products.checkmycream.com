      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used so many products out there over my life time, that didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair.  </li>
      <li>By the way I bought mine at an ULTA store, so I am sure all of them are watery and crappy.</li>
      <li>Love this product, I continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the conditioner though.</li>
      <li>that is until i tried the 1 in 10 products, i absolutely love the shampoo, conditioner, and the oil.</li>

      <li>this is an outstanding product it does what it says, it cleans your hair</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was truly that watery and yucky smelling or if I had been ripped off.</li>
      <li>I first bought the hair mask and loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;It made the color stay longer and my hair looked</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s relatively healthy, but because of its texture it dries easily on the ends.  </li>
      <li>The very first time I used this product I was very pleased with the results, it made my hair soft and more managable and it smelled good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a 10 products are sulfate free which is awesome for me because my hair tends to be dry.  </li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to brush.</li>
      <li>I am almost two weeks in and my hair is so snarly and easily knots</li>
      <li>Does not have a strong odor.</li>
      <li>so I opened the bottle and saw that it was nice and thick and smelled very pleasant!</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for this great Miracle Shampoo.</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>product is a bit expensive, however, in wanting nice looking healthy hair, I&#x27;ll shop around for best pricing.  </li>
      <li>and leave my hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Great daily shampoo--gentle on hair.</li>

      <li>The conditioner is pretty good and smells pretty good too, but the shampoo was just too watery for me, no suds, a had to pump the bottle like 5 times to cover my not so long hair, and still nothing, just using it up now</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t feel as though my hair is clean.</li>
      <li>My hair smells so good, my husband is a big fan.</li>
      <li>This shampoo kept my hair clean, but did not lather very well -- making me use more of the product to feel like I cleaning adequately.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a 10 shampoo with keratin in it before and loved how thick and nicely scented it is.  </li>
      <li>and It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-in Product and love them both, so my expectations were high for the</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure that my hair was really getting clean-</li>
      <li>I wish I would have read the reviews first!  </li>
      <li>I like the smell and that it says is sulphate free, however it is very liquid</li>
      <li>I love this product so much, it makes my hair feel so clean, and soft!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to use this product as it has so many great reviews, but in using it this morning i could barely keep the shampoo in my hands as it was completely watered down.</li>
      <li>My hair is super soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Do sent work half as good as the stuff I buy in the salon</li>
      <li>I have to use about 4 times the normal amount in order to clean my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo that made my hair feel so soft and light.</li>
      <li>Not the real product!</li>
      <li>I love this product - it&#x27;s a ten in my book.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I would really recommend this!</li>
      <li>The first time, it does not lather up at all.  </li>
      <li>but i could not find a hair product that left my hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>This is an ultra-rich shampoo that leaves my hair clean, soft, and not stripped of moisture.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product, I continue to use it.  Makes my thin hair shiny and managable.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not sud at all. I ended up giving it away becasue of how much I don&#x27;t like it. I LOVE the conditioner though.</li>
    <li> Not the real product!</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  Every product is different.  Sometimes, it takes time to find that one product for your hair and I finally found it, thanks to my hair dresser, with \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; product line for MY hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used so many products out there over my life time, that didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair.  My hair would get big in a moister type climate like the central coast of CA and the Bay area.  Using this product along with Skinny Serum and a flat iron, my hair doesn&#x27;t get big anymore when I&#x27;m in such an environment.  At home, which is a dryer climate, I don&#x27;t need Skinny Serum or a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no more split ends, my hair is healthy, manageable and the color just shines.  The product is not gooey, sticky or greasy.  I can feel my hair take in the moisture conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a bit expensive, however, in wanting nice looking healthy hair, I&#x27;ll shop around for best pricing.  Finally, a hair product that works for ME.</li>
    <li> I am a die hard fan of expensive shampoos, perfumes, make-up, etc. I don&#x27;t have flyaway or staticky hair anymore since I&#x27;ve used this. My hair smells so good, my husband is a big fan.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the reviews first!  I literally just got it in and was so excited to try it.  It was so runny that I had to use half the bottle just to get any suds.  Has no smell either!  These people are crooks!</li>
    <li> This product has been a total disappointment.  I NEVER take the time to provide feedback but felt it was absolutely necessary for this product/seller.  All of the reviews about the product have a foul smell and being watered down are SPOT ON!  I assumed the shampoo was supposed to have a watered down texture because it didn&#x27;t have sulfates.  BAD ASSUMPTION!!!  This product is not worth the reduction in price due to the quality. It will actually cost MORE because you will have to use 4 times the normal quantity.  BUYER BEWARE.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 10 products are sulfate free which is awesome for me because my hair tends to be dry.  I LOVE all their products.  Nothing makes my hair feel the way these products do.  It makes my hair feel so soft and it&#x27;s easy to brush.</li>
    <li> I love this product, It smell so good and leaves your hair soft, very manegeable, shiny, I highly recomend it specially if you have thick coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday, leaves hair so soft.</li>
    <li> Product was very watered down. Contacted company &amp; they issued a refund but acted like I was in the wrong for contacting them &amp; very defensive about their product. I&#x27;ve purchased this before &amp; I know the consistency. This was so watery it wouldn&#x27;t even stay in hand long enough to get in hair ;-(</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because I love the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle leave in Conditioner, which is an excellent product. I was very disappointed in this shampoo. It reminded me of regular old drug store shampoo, there is nothing special about it, and it didn&#x27;t do anything at all for my hair. I usually use shampoo by Matrix of Paul Mitchell and though this shampoo is in the same price range as those it just seemed to be of inferior quality to me. All in all, it is simply not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Moiturize Shampoo. It is the best I have ever used. I want to continue to use if forever!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner since I blow dry or use hot rollers in my hair daily and all of the heat styling tends to dry my hair out. I tried using the Bed Head moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this product. I definitely recommend using the shampoo and conditioner (not just one or the other). They also make a leave in conditioner that I&#x27;ve been using for years and love!</li>
    <li> This product was very \\&quot;watery\\&quot; and lacking scent.  Certainly not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;However, the conditioner is very nice and has a lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase the conditioner again, but not the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product from a seller on Amazon. The shampoo was completely watered down. I have been using this product for several months and the one that I buy from the store is much ticker than the one I received from the online seller. It is much better to go and buy from the store... it is only $7 more expensive. I do not know why I even wasted my time with an online purchase. In the store at least you know are getting the real thing and you know what you are putting on your hair. It is not worth it to risk it for a minor price difference. Or... at least buy from a trusted seller with a lot of positive reviews. Do not trust sellers with 4-5 reviews only in their profile.</li>
    <li> I know you should change shampoos every few months to prevent build up so I went into Beauty Supply Plus and this was recommended so I purchased it at $20 each for shampoo and conditioner($40) total.  I am almost two weeks in and my hair is so snarly and easily knots and it is just a mess!  I went on here to check the reviews and felt compelled to write one based on purchasing it elsewhere and being VERY dissatisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Was not happy because it was very watered down. I&#x27;ve used this product before and the consistency was completely different. You can tell it&#x27;s watered down the moment you use it. Have to use three times as much of the product because it&#x27;s so watered down. Not happy.</li>
    <li> How embarrassing. I gave this shampoo to my daughter as a Christmas gift &amp; she informed me this product in NO WAY compared to what she purchased in a salon. She was afraid to put it on her hair. What are they shipping???</li>
    <li> this is an outstanding product it does what it says, it cleans your hair&lt;br /&gt;leaving it feeling like nothing else out there. we love this shampoo, would use anything&lt;br /&gt;else.</li>
    <li> I love all of the \\&quot;Its&#x27; a 10\\&quot; products and it is much cheaper to purchase online even with the shipping costs!</li>
    <li> My stylist tried this on me 2 weeks ago and I fell in love with this shampoo. I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo that made my hair feel so soft and light. Other shampoos that I used to use, made my hair feel dry and brittle right after the shampooing. I absolutely love this line. I thought it was a new line, but I came to find out that \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10,\\&quot; has been out for a while. I am going to stock up on the shampoo and leave in conditioner with Keratin. What the heck I&#x27;ll just get the whole line of products. I am so excited. Thank you Amazon for having this line in shop!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and when I tried to save a few bucks and order from this seller, I feel ripped off. The product is 90% water....for those of you that don&#x27;t know better, it&#x27;s not supposed to feel like that. I will be returning immediately and with complaints to Amazon. They shouldn&#x27;t allow these sellers. I bought the conditioner from amazon direct...that&#x27;s perfect. This was a scam.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in the bottle I received but it certainly isn&#x27;t shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using this line of products for a year now and usually buy it from another seller but I made the mistake of ordering from here because it was cheaper. And now I wish I had read the reviews. What they sent me was the same thing that everyone else is complaining about: watered down, bad smelling, liquid stuff that I wouldn&#x27;t even call shampoo. I&#x27;m going to report them to amazon....</li>
    <li> I use both It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Daily Conditioner and It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-in Product and love them both, so my expectations were high for the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Moisture Shampoo.  I was very disappointed.  I had to re-shampoo my hair immediately with my usual shampoo (Neutrogena) right after using the It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo, as it left my hair feeling heavy and not as light &amp; easy to style as when I use Neutrogena.  Besides that, I could not seem to work up a lather with the It&#x27;a a 10, even after rinsing once and re-shampooing.  I will be sticking with the Neutrogena shampoo (and they are not paying me to say this!).</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this product as it has so many great reviews, but in using it this morning i could barely keep the shampoo in my hands as it was completely watered down. I don&#x27;t know if this is the seller watering it down or a dud but I am not happy with this purchase. I am going to go to the store this morning and check the consistency of the shampoo at the store. I feel slightly ripped off and will report back after checking out both the shampoo and conditioner at the store and retuning this item to the seller.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product given all the positive reviews, but the shampoo I received is as thin as water and takes a ton to get any suds.  I also ordered the deep conditioner and leave in conditioner, which I think are better products, but this shampoo is worthless.</li>
    <li> I have been a bleached blonde for a while now but i could not find a hair product that left my hair looking healthy and shiny. that is until i tried the 1 in 10 products, i absolutely love the shampoo, conditioner, and the oil. please never stop making them i wouldn&#x27;t know what to do with out them.  thank you so much</li>
    <li> This is an ultra-rich shampoo that leaves my hair clean, soft, and not stripped of moisture.  It is very concentrated so, even though it is expensive, it seems like it will be a good buy because a bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using the Mask and Leave in Treatment.  My hair is super soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product, best hair product out there. I do believe you need to follow it with the Miracle 10 Leave in Conditioner that you use in the shower.</li>
    <li> i have bought this product in the store and at salons.  This one did not meet the same criteria ans was not up to par.  It was watered down greatly and smelled horrible.  Extremely disappointed.  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I love this product !!!! I use the entire set. Smells fantastic. Have used several salon brands but think this is by far my favorite. Hubby always comments on how good my hair smells. This is a keeper !!</li>
    <li> Thanks so much for this great Miracle Shampoo. It&#x27;s a 10.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo &amp; most other It&#x27;s a ten products for years.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick medium length hair and it cleans my hair just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo in not meant to have a lot of lather but it&#x27;s certainly does the job. I add a small amount of hot water when shampooing. It makes your hair healthy as I use the conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery &amp; well packed.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon as well.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful. ☺</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought by its a 10 leave in conditioner spray, and was impressed by that product. But this shampoo does nothing for me. It is ridiculously runny and difficult to get \\&quot;sudsy\\&quot;. I was hoping between this shampoo and conditioner that it would help manage my tangly hair, but it didn&#x27;t make anymore difference than the pantene pro-v I was using before. I think this is way over priced for a shampoo that is so watery. This might work for other people, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> this is THE BEST PRODUCT FOR YOU HAIR.. I NOW use it all the time... and will keep getting it,,,,</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure that my hair was really getting clean- it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as all my other shampoos. But it does!!! And my hair is already softer without the greasy feeling! Love it!</li>
    <li> I should of read the reviews of this seller! Shampoo is very runny and does not suds up. I am returning both shampoo and conditioner immediately for a refund.</li>
    <li> I find that I need to shampoo my hair 2x with It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Moisture Shampoo.  The first time, it does not lather up at all.  The second time it does lather up.  I do like it, It&#x27;s a great shampoo but I feel needing to use it twice therefore going through the product twice as fast is not economical (on a tight budget).</li>
    <li> Only used once, but I like it! My hair is somewhat dry, but not frizzie. It does a good job, my husband can use it too, not much smell.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable the difference on my childs extremely curly hair!</li>
    <li> This made my hair drier than ever. I was thrilled to try this product but was very disappointed. I tried it a few times and each time my hair felt worse. Overall, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product - it&#x27;s a ten in my book.  I have thick course curly hair and I only have to use a few pumps of this product.  It leaves my hair very manageable and I only use a little conditioner after each use.</li>
    <li> I noticed a huge difference in the feel of my hair after just two uses! I have thick, semi wavy, coarse hair. I have highlights, and I dry and straighten my hair everyday. So needless to say my hair very dry and damaged. This shampoo makes my hair so soft, shiny, and straighter. It actually looks heathy! It also gives a little volume without weighing my hair down or looking too oily. The only down side to it, it seemed to make my hair more tangled when wet. However, that&#x27;s where using the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Conditioner works wonders too! I LOVE these products!</li>
    <li> Only used twice, but has not noticed any change yet. Does not have too much lather which I guess makes it a soft/gentle shampoo. Does not have a strong odor. Only used it twice with no significant difference.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and reasonable prices</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo - cleans and shines!</li>
    <li> Great product, very gentle on the scalp and leaves your hair nice and soft. Deranged knots as well</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for my fine hair.  I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair so it&#x27;s relatively healthy, but because of its texture it dries easily on the ends.  This shampoo has made a total difference.  The only drawback is that if you use any styling products with silicones this may not remove them.  It&#x27;s so mild that it doesn&#x27;t have the cleaning power to remove heavy styling products fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have thin stranded blonde hair and a ton of it.  I have been on the look out for an excellent shampoo to protect my hair, fight Florida humidity, not leave build-up. and leave my hair shiny and smooth.  This product does this!  I dont even have to use as much conditioner as I have in the past. I only condition once a week now with the mask. I LOVE this product!  AND I  only use 1/2 of the amount I have used in the past with other high end shampoos.</li>
    <li> Went from natural black hair to blone! Hair was super dry damaged...Had tried all types of shampoo over the counter and salon brands... It&#x27;s a 10 was the best treatment got my hair healthy and back it shine!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this product.. My hair looks so shiny and easy to manage...it&#x27;s the only shampoo and conditioner I will ever use.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair. This shampoo is creamy, detangles well, leaves hair super soft &amp; silky. Does not add body--but I find volumizing shampoos drying &amp; cause tangles.  No sticky residue. Will continue to purchase. Great daily shampoo--gentle on hair.</li>
    <li> It is very watery in consistency. I will be going to Salon and checking their same product to see the consistency of it. If it is not watered down, then I will know that this product is not of the same quality.</li>
    <li> This product does not strip my hair. It cleanses it nicely AND still be able to comb through it afterwards. YES!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo with the expectation that it would, at the very least, leave my hair looking and feeling healthier. I have very dry hair. After hearing all of the hype regarding the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; product line I had to try it. I also bought the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin.\\&quot; I understand that its simply a shampoo and conditioner, but for the price I was expecting that I would at least notice some sort of minimal difference in my hair, either with managability, or less frizz, or increased softness, or something. After using both products and following the directions my hair seemed to have a coating on it. My hair looked and felt worse, not better. These products didn&#x27;t live up to even one of the things it claims to do. I am very dissapointed. I won&#x27;t ever spend any of my hard earned money on a product in this line again.</li>
    <li> I refuse to buy this product again for the fact something has changed. The very first time I used this product I was very pleased with the results, it made my hair soft and more managable and it smelled good. But now, I know it&#x27;s not the same product it smells, look and feels different.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!!&lt;br /&gt;I have long ..fine..highlighted hair and this has worked the best for me so far.</li>
    <li> I first bought the hair mask and loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;It made the color stay longer and my hair looked healthier.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is great too.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the leave in conditioner my hair never looked so good.&lt;br /&gt;Love these products.</li>
    <li> did&#x27;t do anything por my hair.</li>
    <li> Did NOT care for the shampoo. My hair is just past my shoulders and I had to use a TON just to have enough to work through all of my hair. Smells good, just not a good value for the money. I did like the conditioner and leave in conditioner, which I use as a detangler for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> This bottle of shampoo has obviously been diluted! I have used this brand before and it lasted for months because only a small amount was needed to produce a rich foaming shampoo. The contents of this last bottle bear no resemblance to the first. I will not be ordering from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much, it makes my hair feel so clean, and soft! It is a little spendy, but once you try it, you will feel it is so worth the price you paid!</li>
    <li> I burned my hair with a curling iron. It felt like straw in some areas. I used this for a week and I can hardly tell I had damage. It is amazing. The shampoo is watery but I did not buy mine off the the Internet. I bought mine from the salon. My only complaint is that it is making my face break out but I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is by Far the best shampoo that I have ever used and I have been around the block with hair products lol. It smells wonderfully clean, not strong at all. You don&#x27;t get much bubbling with this one yet you only need a little bit to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Although the item was at my doorstep the day after I placed my order, I am very disappointed. I have purchased this product from Ulta before and was excited to save some money. Sadly, it&#x27;s a knock-off. It smells AWFUL (unlike the real thing--which smells quite pleasant) and I could not build up a lather. I will be sending it back for a refund immediately.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this shampoo. It is extremely watery which makes me question if it is the same as buying it off the shelf from a reputable store. I have to use 3+ pumps each time I shampoo and even then it doesn&#x27;t lather at all and I don&#x27;t feel as though my hair is clean.</li>
    <li> This product was ordered at the same time I ordered the Daily Conditioner which was also NOT the real It&#x27;s a 10 product..  For heaven sakes Amazon, check out your suppliers.  This was NOT the real It&#x27;s a 10 product.  It is definitely a cheap knock off.  I have used this very product purchased from a salon and that was a wonderful product.  This was NOT a good product by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
    <li> I love the stay in product so decided to try this out.... ummm never again. The conditioner is pretty good and smells pretty good too, but the shampoo was just too watery for me, no suds, a had to pump the bottle like 5 times to cover my not so long hair, and still nothing, just using it up now so I can get a better one. By the way I bought mine at an ULTA store, so I am sure all of them are watery and crappy.</li>
    <li> This is the part where I regret not reading the bad reviews of the product first.... I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while now, and always bought it in the salon. I decided to see if it is cheaper in Amazon, and then I found this one... The only problem is that it&#x27;s not the real thing!!! The bottle looks the same, but to pump didn&#x27;t even work. I didn&#x27;t give it too much importance. But when I opened it up the shampoo was so runny I couldn&#x27;t even keep it in my hand for long, and it had a foul smell too. Right away I noticed something&#x27;s wrong. I went to the Salon and bought the same one just to compare and the difference is so obvious! Needless to say that I&#x27;m sending it back today. I&#x27;m so disappointed that Amazon works with vendors that are crooks!!!</li>
    <li> First I want to say that I had read some reviews and some of them said that it wasn&#x27;t thick as they thought that it should be. I took a chance in ordering the shampoo because of those reviews and found that the first few times I used the product it did in fact seem not as thick as it said and it didn&#x27;t lather as much as I would&#x27;ve hoped . I thought about re-turning the product , however I decided to give it another chance or two . The third or fourth time I used the shampoo it was thick and lathered as much as any other shampoo would have. Having said that I am pleased to report that it is thicker and lathers wonderfully and gives my hair a good clean scent and it styles easily . I am happy that I gave it a chance.</li>
    <li> This shampoo kept my hair clean, but did not lather very well -- making me use more of the product to feel like I cleaning adequately. This is probably more of a personal preference than poor product quality, but it is not my personal preference.</li>
    <li> I love It&#x27;s a 10 products so I ordered their shampoo through Amazon. What I got was a slimy watered down shampoo that smells like rotten fruit. I have ordered the it&#x27;s a 10 shampoo with keratin in it before and loved how thick and nicely scented it is.  I had never ordered the moisture shampoo so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was truly that watery and yucky smelling or if I had been ripped off. However, I just happened to stumble across the moisture shampoo at Target today so I opened the bottle and saw that it was nice and thick and smelled very pleasant! The seller I purchased this product from on Amazon is a fraud! I have also had bad experiences purchasing Wen cleansing conditioner through Amazon. They were also watered down and fake. I have learned a very expensive lesson that unfortunately you can&#x27;t always trust sellers on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This shampoo came and it was diluted with water. Would never buy this again. I have to use 1/4 of a bottle to shampoo my shoulder length hair</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife after she professionally straightened her hair because they recommended this particular brand due to it&#x27;s good reputation, and it worked great. She loved it and she continues on using it till today.</li>
    <li> Do sent work half as good as the stuff I buy in the salon don&#x27;t think.it&#x27;s the same thing :(</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this shampoo, mostly because it is hard to get suds out of it.  You&#x27;ve got to use a lot of shampoo to get enough suds.  Don&#x27;t plan on buying it again.</li>
    <li> I received my bottle of shampoo and when i went to use it realized that it was extremely watered down.  I have been using the same product for the past 2 years and have never had this problem before. I have to use about 4 times the normal amount in order to clean my hair.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and that it says is sulphate free, however it is very liquid and I don&#x27;t feel like it really cleans my hair, it doesn&#x27;t make bubbles and because I have a lot of hair I use a lot of the product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look and feel so healthy</li>
    <li> Product is not the real thing.  Do not buy from Beauty It Is.  Shampoo was runny and must have been watered down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised that amazon hasn&#x27;t done anything about the pervasive sale of inauthentic product here.  My product, like so many other customers&#x27;, was super watered down, and didn&#x27;t smell anything like the product I&#x27;ve gotten in the salon.  Amazon, it&#x27;s time for you to start standing up for your customers and only allowing sellers that are selling the genuine product.  My seller is listed as IBEAUTYCENTER INC.  Don&#x27;t buy from them if you want the same as you get in the salon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love all of the It&#x27;s a 10 products and even better, my hair loves them too!  Everyone notices how silky my hair has become since I have been using \\&quot;10\\&quot;.  All of the \\&quot;10\\&quot; products are fantastic!</li>
    <li> It has a kinda strong floral smell to it and it works wonders!  Its on the expensive side for shampoo but its worth the money!</li>
