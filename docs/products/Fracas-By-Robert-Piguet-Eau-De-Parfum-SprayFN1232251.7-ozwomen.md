      <li>It&#x27;s a great price</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance!!  </li>
      <li>Love it! !</li>
      <li>I decided to buy Fracas because the reviews claim its very nice oriental, and though its been reformulated, it is still very nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like immersing oneself in a field of perfectly balanced flowers.  </li>

      <li>I love the smell ,it is a one of a kind .</li>
      <li>Old one but a wonderful one ..</li>
      <li>Juicy couture lasts longest, IMO, and men seem to mention how nice it is more than others.</li>
      <li>Just totally beautiful and classic.  </li>
      <li>I certainly took a risk buying a fragrance that I couldn&#x27;t smell in advance, but I am quite happy I did.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this perfume.  </li>

      <li>and now my 2 favorite things to wear are Fracas and Habanita.  </li>
      <li>Outstanding service and quality product.</li>
      <li>I love Fracas, but it&#x27;s definately for night, or a &amp;#34;walk through&amp;#34;....</li>
      <li>Fracas is my favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>Flowers and Tuberose are the top notes.</li>
      <li>People will constantly comment on how wonderful it is, and want to know what it is.</li>
      <li>Order arrived quickly, and I was very satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>Very unique scent.</li>
      <li>kind of sweet....not like a candy sweet.</li>
      <li>Used the perfume in the early 70s and was happy to see it again.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I made my first purchase, and will continue to wear Fracas Eau De Parfum forever!!</li>
      <li>came super fast at a great price</li>
      <li>When I tried it on at first, I liked it.</li>
      <li>The reviewers on Amazon describe the scent quite accurately.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely fresh intoxicating fragrance.</li>
      <li>The bottle appear to be genuine, well packed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>it is a page out of Old Hollywood with a unique smell of its own</li>
      <li>After a while though, it became sickeningly sweet and made me nauseous.</li>
      <li>Fracas is my sweet smelling scent that is full of jasmine and gardenia with earthy notes.  </li>
      <li>I need my own bottle on my dresser for my own little girl to smell.  </li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t really for a younger woman, but perfect for a adult.</li>
      <li>but its much too strong for summer wear.</li>
      <li>Scents are a indulgence I can&#x27;t seem to go without, and Fracas has most certainly been added to my short list of scents I love to wear.  </li>
      <li>It will be great for summer because if has a gardenia-like smell that&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s for an adult woman who is confident, worldly and doesn&#x27;t need to follow the herd.</li>
      <li>Good scent, lasting, high quality</li>
      <li>I really like sweet florals, but this is dripping in sweetness with an underlying sourness, if that makes sense.</li>
      <li>In this sense, and more, it is a very &#x27;French&#x27; scent.</li>
      <li>and it got to me really fast!</li>
      <li>I will be back for more.</li>
      <li>I really love the fragrance of Fracas, because it lasts a long time and people always comment on it in a very favorable way, when they smell it on me wherever I go.</li>
      <li>The shipment was very prompt.</li>
      <li>Came fast and use it quite a lot.</li>
      <li>I really like this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Have the name of this parfum at the ready.</li>
      <li>Imagine a 1600&#x27;s French cottage that&#x27;s been filled with tuberose and mixed, rich, flower scents for years, then vacated, yet the scent remains.</li>
      <li>It is altogether feminine but at the same time rich and sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A classic scent that inspired Madonna&#x27;s Truth or Dare ,which I really like alot and Kim Kardashian&#x27;s perfume , which I also like.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s for a woman who wants something timeless, classic and from an era (1948) when things weren&#x27;t mass produced on a minute to minute model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a classic scent that everyone has worn or heard of.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance does not have the depth or staying power this scent normally does.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a Heavy floral, appropriate for evenings.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I will continue to search Amazon and will re purchase when new stock comes in.</li>
      <li>Wish I could send it back but is was a gift from my better half.</li>
      <li>I got an off or old batch.  </li>
      <li>Old world fragrance, from the 40&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I really seem to have a affinity for french perfumes..</li>
      <li>, much prefer my regular 24 Faubourg by Hermes.</li>
      <li>Obviously, women who actually know about perfume top notes, dry downs, fades and such are the type of informed buyers for a scent like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but the scent seems to be different from the one I tried on at Nordstrom&#x27;s; it could be an older bottle? .</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not modern like the silly, light fruity, sweet smells that all these new colognes seem to have that make them all smell</li>
      <li>Something missing to be a total sub for DNA, but I have a feeling DNA really based their fragrance on this!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I decided to buy Fracas because the reviews claim its very nice oriental, and though its been reformulated, it is still very nice. Purchasing from Amazon was great with respect to delivery and price. The bottle appear to be genuine, well packed but the scent seems to be different from the one I tried on at Nordstrom&#x27;s; it could be an older bottle? . I plan to use it but likely won&#x27;t buy again, much prefer my regular 24 Faubourg by Hermes. UPDATE: perfume smells the way it was designed by its creator  to but its much too strong for summer wear. Very unique scent. I will continue to search Amazon and will re purchase when new stock comes in.</li>
    <li> I really love the fragrance of Fracas, because it lasts a long time and people always comment on it in a very favorable way, when they smell it on me wherever I go. It&#x27;s a lovely fresh intoxicating fragrance. I&#x27;m so glad that I made my first purchase, and will continue to wear Fracas Eau De Parfum forever!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know when I bought this, but Amazon will not take returns on cologne. I bought this after smelling it on another woman and asked her for the name. When I tried it on at first, I liked it. After a while though, it became sickeningly sweet and made me nauseous. The one thing I can say about it is it has holding power and lasts all day long. I really like sweet florals, but this is dripping in sweetness with an underlying sourness, if that makes sense.</li>
    <li> I really seem to have a affinity for french perfumes.. Scents are a indulgence I can&#x27;t seem to go without, and Fracas has most certainly been added to my short list of scents I love to wear.  I used to wear Casteelbajac until it became impossible to find the EDP and now my 2 favorite things to wear are Fracas and Habanita.  Fracas is my sweet smelling scent that is full of jasmine and gardenia with earthy notes.  Isn&#x27;t really for a younger woman, but perfect for a adult.</li>
    <li> Used the perfume in the early 70s and was happy to see it again.  The shipment was very prompt.</li>
    <li> Good sub. Not as pricey.Old world fragrance, from the 40&#x27;s. Something missing to be a total sub for DNA, but I have a feeling DNA really based their fragrance on this! I love Fracas, but it&#x27;s definately for night, or a &amp;#34;walk through&amp;#34;....</li>
    <li> Outstanding service and quality product. Everything as advertised and promised.</li>
    <li> This fragrance will not be for everyone...it is a page out of Old Hollywood with a unique smell of its own that I adore.&lt;br /&gt;It is not modern like the silly, light fruity, sweet smells that all these new colognes seem to have that make them all smell just alike.&lt;br /&gt;This is a Grown Up Sensual Woman!&lt;br /&gt; Fracas is basically a Tuberose scent with some cedar/sandlewood/almond in the base notes. Definitely a vintage fragrance...Fracas is not easy to carry. It&#x27;s beautiful but it&#x27;s a Heavy floral, appropriate for evenings.&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is timeless and show-stopping...I love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT AND PRICE WASN&#x27; t too bad.. Came fast and use it quite a lot. A classic scent that inspired Madonna&#x27;s Truth or Dare ,which I really like alot and Kim Kardashian&#x27;s perfume , which I also like.</li>
    <li> Good scent, lasting, high quality</li>
    <li> This is my summer scent and I love it.  It&#x27;s a great price and it got to me really fast!</li>
    <li> I purchased Fracas on a whim after reading an article about it. It&#x27;s fantastic. I certainly took a risk buying a fragrance that I couldn&#x27;t smell in advance, but I am quite happy I did.  The reviewers on Amazon describe the scent quite accurately.  It is a heavy, thick fragrance, but not heavy or spicy like Opium. It&#x27;s more like immersing oneself in a field of perfectly balanced flowers.  It is altogether feminine but at the same time rich and sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how you sometimes go into a house, or open a box or cedar chest and there is an aroma about it? That is what Fracas is like. Imagine a 1600&#x27;s French cottage that&#x27;s been filled with tuberose and mixed, rich, flower scents for years, then vacated, yet the scent remains. It doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  It smells like you, not a cover-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fracas lasts all day. One spritz is all that is needed.  It is a signature scent that captures attention without being overly invasive or offensive.  I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> Smells just as I remembered.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It reminds me of playing with my mom&#x27;s perfumes on her dresser when I was a little girl...  Now that I&#x27;m all grown up...I need my own bottle on my dresser for my own little girl to smell.  Just totally beautiful and classic.  It has a &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; fragrance, but a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; kind of sweet....not like a candy sweet.</li>
    <li> Fracas is my favorite scent.  I bought this 1.7 ounce bottle to take on a trip thinking it would be lighter and easier to carry on through airport security.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, there&#x27;s just something not quite right. The fragrance does not have the depth or staying power this scent normally does. I haven&#x27;t had this trouble before so it&#x27;s possible I got an off or old batch.  Anyone else had this problem?</li>
    <li> Have the name of this parfum at the ready. People will constantly comment on how wonderful it is, and want to know what it is. There are days I want to just have a card to hand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted in reviews - this isn&#x27;t for everybody. It&#x27;s for an adult woman who is confident, worldly and doesn&#x27;t need to follow the herd. In this sense, and more, it is a very &#x27;French&#x27; scent. It&#x27;s for a woman who wants something timeless, classic and from an era (1948) when things weren&#x27;t mass produced on a minute to minute model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White Flowers and Tuberose are the top notes. Animalic and Green add some intrigue. Obviously, women who actually know about perfume top notes, dry downs, fades and such are the type of informed buyers for a scent like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fracas is for somebody looking for a Signature Scent.</li>
    <li> If you like the strong smell of stale roses you&#x27;ll like this.  It&#x27;s awful, don&#x27;t buy. Wish I could send it back but is was a gift from my better half.</li>
    <li> came super fast at a great price</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite scents! It is a little &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; for day time use bur packs a punch for evening.</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance. It could have lasted longer for the price.  Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  Juicy couture lasts longest, IMO, and men seem to mention how nice it is more than others.</li>
    <li> This is a classic scent that everyone has worn or heard of.  Just try it it if you are a perfume wearer. This isn&#x27;t something for someone that isn&#x27;t a scent person</li>
    <li> My signature fragrance!  Love it! !</li>
    <li> Order arrived quickly, and I was very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell ,it is a one of a kind . I hope ,I always can find it ....Old one but a wonderful one ..</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance!!  It will be great for summer because if has a gardenia-like smell that&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
