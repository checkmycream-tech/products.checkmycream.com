      <li>Great for mouth sores.</li>
      <li>Great product - does wonders for mouth ulcers.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>this rinse is good for canker and mouth sores.  </li>
      <li>Good to keep on hand for when needed</li>
      <li>I am very excited about this prospect as this happens to me often!  </li>
      <li>has a nice fresh taste and is very effective.</li>
      <li>This is very mild, yet it seems to do its job!</li>
      <li>but Peroxyl tastes better and smells better.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It has a light, pleasant taste and really makes the sores feel better!  </li>
      <li>I love Colgate products and really appreciate the prompt service!!!</li>
      <li>rinse doesn&#x27;t have the burn of alcohol (so your tongue is safe), but you&#x27;ll feel it clean out your sores.</li>
      <li>: If you&#x27;re looking to stop canker sore outbreaks, I strongly suggest [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for those who have a mild to medium reaction to some foods (or other \\&quot;mouth\\&quot; consumed product).</li>
      <li>So, if you have had oral surgery (extractions, implants, etc) be sure to ask the dentist first.</li>
      <li>After reading several reviews from different websites, (all positive), I was really looking forward to having found the apparent &#x27;best of the best&#x27; products to get rid of canker sores.</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t designed to heal it immediately or to make the pain / discomfort disappear but it helps so much in making you comfortable and dulling the pain.</li>
      <li>I also alternate with warm salt water which in my opinion heals the fastest.  </li>
      <li>Unlike some of the other peroxide mouth washes, it tastes good and doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s helped me SO much!</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I used it and sure enough they healed.  </li>
      <li>Even though the flavor isn&#x27;t the best (mint mixed with peroxide) I&#x27;ll sometimes use it before eating to dull the nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After my oral surgery, things were going very well until I started rinsing with Peroxyl.  </li>
      <li>However, after every rinsing, I found that nothing really happened.</li>
      <li>I used this after having a dental procedure and it really helped.</li>
      <li>Blistex is also very soothing.  </li>
      <li>The real reason I bought this product was because I wanted my canker sores gone</li>
      <li>My dentist tech told me to get this for the sores in my mouth caused by new partials.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how fast this will heal my sore, but I am very optimistic giving how I feel just the next day!  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product last night and couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it soothed the pain!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it will do: it cleanses and promotes healing of minor oral wounds.</li>
      <li>really did make me expect big things.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Buy some alum and apply directly to the sore.</li>
      <li>While it was expensive, about 6 bucks at Walmart, it did a good job.</li>
      <li>After doing research online today, I left work to go pick some up at my local Right Aid.</li>
      <li>I take Q-tip and dip it in and rub it right on the cold sore - kind of cauterizes it.</li>
      <li>This has a sweet taste and I find it slightly stings.</li>
      <li>I suffer from canker sores occasionally and, unfortunately, passed the ability to get these wonderful little pains on to my son.  </li>
      <li>Works great - especially with cold sores.  </li>
      <li>But this time, they seemed to develop into something much more painful than before, to the point where they became 2x bigger than the original size</li>
      <li>I looked it up, this chemical has not long term harmful effects.</li>

<li> Anbesol does the same thing except it doesn&#x27;t last as long!  </li>
<li> Not a pleasant 60 seconds, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> And the price is only $1 less than the larger bottle at your local grocery store.  </li>
<li> The sores actually opened up and became even more painful to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Kanka was my previous go to for mouth sores, but it hurts with application then numbs everything it comes in contact with (especially the tongue!)</li>
<li> Timely delivery, and was as expected.</li>
<li> /&gt;Not to say that this won&#x27;t work for everyone who tries because I&#x27;ve read plenty of reviews that say the opposite...however, it is my duty as someone who has tried this product that it won&#x27;t work in ALL cases.ho</li>
<li> I get perhaps anywhere from 5 to 10 in a single year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to the store and spending quite a bit of money on such a small bottle</li>
<li> Total screw job!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money on these!</li>
<li> I suffer from extreme canker sores that are brought on by the simplest of factors - from extreme weather changes, sickness, food/acidity sensitivities, and stress.</li>
<li> , that&#x27;s the only negative.</li>
<li> Peroxyl helps cut down the time I have canker sores.</li>
<li> Other products are too harsh.  </li>
<li> in my case, all this product did was make my breath slightly fresher</li>
<li> Canker covers are gross and way too thick!  </li>
<li> This product neither of that and only made my condition worse and also formed another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
<li> It makes it look like I got in a bar fight and can get worse if split open.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with the same three in my mouth for almost three days, with Orajel making it worse</li>
<li> He suggested plain salt water.  </li>
<li> Zilactin-B stings and is a mess!  </li>
<li> I had some small sores right along my gumline that kept bleeding and were painful to brush.  </li>
<li> I usually use it once in the morning and once at night during a flareup.</li>
<li> I usually get two bottles at a time.</li>
<li> I usually dilute it.</li>
<li> but they look all weird and crooked!  </li>
<li> Over time, after every rinsing, the pain worsened and the canker sores seemed to &#x27;develop&#x27; - usually this a term I use when I see a sore is slowly going away.</li>
<li> I hardly get sores now</li>
<li> It will even help numb it enough to eat without ruining the taste of your meal!  </li>
<li> Makes it numb for hours, clears up WAY faster, and is cheaper (4 dollars and will probably last a lifetime).  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not expensive and saved me from what could have been a really painful work day!</li>
<li> But beware - this is a VERY SMALL bottle.  </li>
<li> I was very anxious to try this product as one reviewer said it helped after oral surgery.  </li>
<li> Anyone who suffers from canker sores knows that even having one for a day less is a miracle.</li>
<li> Seriously!</li>
<li> that, and the outrageous price for such a small amount</li>
<li> Why are they so thick?!!  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t numb the pain that was caused by the sores in my mouth at the time.</li>
<li> After 3 days, the site began to bleed badly; I had to see my dentist on emergency  basis</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this to help heal sores and cuts in my mouth from braces. This has a sweet taste and I find it slightly stings. It is more expensive than rinsing with hydrogen peroxide but Peroxyl tastes better and smells better.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I get canker sores and my dentist recommended this. I couldn&#x27;t always find it in local stores, but now I can get it whenever I need to. I usually get two bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it will do: it cleanses and promotes healing of minor oral wounds. This isn&#x27;t going to make your canker sores / mouth ulcers go away immediately but it helps EXPONENTIALLY with discomfort &amp; pain. I&#x27;ve been dealing with the same three in my mouth for almost three days, with Orajel making it worse it seems. After doing research online today, I left work to go pick some up at my local Right Aid. I actually used this in the parking lot and it offered IMMEDIATE relief. This product isn&#x27;t designed to heal it immediately or to make the pain / discomfort disappear but it helps so much in making you comfortable and dulling the pain. It&#x27;s not expensive and saved me from what could have been a really painful work day!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This is very mild, yet it seems to do its job!</li>
    <li> Great product - does wonders for mouth ulcers.  But beware - this is a VERY SMALL bottle.  And the price is only $1 less than the larger bottle at your local grocery store.  But this product but don&#x27;t buy it here.</li>
    <li> I was very anxious to try this product as one reviewer said it helped after oral surgery.  After my oral surgery, things were going very well until I started rinsing with Peroxyl.  After 3 days, the site began to bleed badly; I had to see my dentist on emergency  basis and he said the product probably caused wound to bleed and to stop using it.  He suggested plain salt water.  So, if you have had oral surgery (extractions, implants, etc) be sure to ask the dentist first.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product last night and couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it soothed the pain!  It&#x27;s only temporary but then I just rinse again and I am once again relieved!  It&#x27;s so soothing!  I just rinse so I don&#x27;t have to hit the \\&quot;right\\&quot; spot.  Other products are too harsh.  Zilactin-B stings and is a mess!  It makes it look like I got in a bar fight and can get worse if split open.  Canker covers are gross and way too thick!  Why are they so thick?!!  Kanka was my previous go to for mouth sores, but it hurts with application then numbs everything it comes in contact with (especially the tongue!) and if I sleep with it on I would wake up with lips like Angelina Jolie&#x27;s but they look all weird and crooked!  Anbesol does the same thing except it doesn&#x27;t last as long!  Blistex is also very soothing.  I would use it with Peroxyl for times when you can&#x27;t rinse your mouth out.  I also alternate with warm salt water which in my opinion heals the fastest.  I don&#x27;t know how fast this will heal my sore, but I am very optimistic giving how I feel just the next day!  I have heard if you bite your lip and rinse with Peroxyl, it will prevent the canker sore from forming.  I am very excited about this prospect as this happens to me often!  Oh and you can eat after using Peroxyl!  It will even help numb it enough to eat without ruining the taste of your meal!  Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I love Colgate products and really appreciate the prompt service!!!</li>
    <li> This is excellent for mouth sores...you can even apply it with a Q-tip to a specific area or for a smaller child.  It is a staple in our home.</li>
    <li> I suffer from canker sores occasionally and, unfortunately, passed the ability to get these wonderful little pains on to my son.  I tried a sample of this I had gotten from the dentist and boy, did it work well!!  It has a light, pleasant taste and really makes the sores feel better!  Now we each have a bottle in our bathrooms for when the cankers pop up!</li>
    <li> My dentist tech told me to get this for the sores in my mouth caused by new partials.  I used it and sure enough they healed.  I keep it on hand now all of the time as I do get canker sores on my tongue from time to time and they heal too.</li>
    <li> Peroxyl helps cut down the time I have canker sores. Anyone who suffers from canker sores knows that even having one for a day less is a miracle. I usually use it once in the morning and once at night during a flareup. Even though the flavor isn&#x27;t the best (mint mixed with peroxide) I&#x27;ll sometimes use it before eating to dull the nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rinse doesn&#x27;t have the burn of alcohol (so your tongue is safe), but you&#x27;ll feel it clean out your sores. Not a pleasant 60 seconds, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: If you&#x27;re looking to stop canker sore outbreaks, I strongly suggest [[ASIN:B0017QK9WK Avamin Bio-Active B12 30 Count]]. It&#x27;s helped me SO much! I hardly get sores now and when I do, they don&#x27;t get big.</li>
    <li> Good to keep on hand for when needed</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. Unlike some of the other peroxide mouth washes, it tastes good and doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> Works great - especially with cold sores.  I take Q-tip and dip it in and rub it right on the cold sore - kind of cauterizes it.</li>
    <li> Best mouth rinse for canker sores!</li>
    <li> I had some small sores right along my gumline that kept bleeding and were painful to brush.  I tried this stuff after brushing my teeth one night.  After about 20 seconds I could feel my eyes watering from the peroxide but I persisted through it.  After I spit it out I noticed my gumline was a lot smoother and tighter.  The peroxide had done its job and washed away some of the infected outerlayers.  While it was expensive, about 6 bucks at Walmart, it did a good job.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery, and was as expected.</li>
    <li> The rinse also helps with inflamed lymph nodes. Helped with some relief, but compared to my current method of getting rid of canker sores, it&#x27;s ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy some alum and apply directly to the sore. Makes it numb for hours, clears up WAY faster, and is cheaper (4 dollars and will probably last a lifetime).  Seriously!</li>
    <li> this rinse is good for canker and mouth sores.  I usually dilute it. has a nice fresh taste and is very effective.</li>
    <li> I did not realize I was ordering sample bottles! I will never make that mistake again! Total screw job!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money on these!</li>
    <li> I used this after having a dental procedure and it really helped. It also made my teeth appear whiter! I think it&#x27;s overpriced, that&#x27;s the only negative.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews from different websites, (all positive), I was really looking forward to having found the apparent &#x27;best of the best&#x27; products to get rid of canker sores. I suffer from extreme canker sores that are brought on by the simplest of factors - from extreme weather changes, sickness, food/acidity sensitivities, and stress. I get perhaps anywhere from 5 to 10 in a single year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to the store and spending quite a bit of money on such a small bottle really did make me expect big things. I followed the directions; I rinsed four times a day, once in the morning, twice after I ate, and before I went to bed. However, after every rinsing, I found that nothing really happened. It just burned/tingled, like a regular mouth wash used for breath-freshening. It didn&#x27;t numb the pain that was caused by the sores in my mouth at the time. Over time, after every rinsing, the pain worsened and the canker sores seemed to &#x27;develop&#x27; - usually this a term I use when I see a sore is slowly going away. But this time, they seemed to develop into something much more painful than before, to the point where they became 2x bigger than the original size and I could no longer open my mouth or talk. The sores actually opened up and became even more painful to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in my case, all this product did was make my breath slightly fresher (I didn&#x27;t see any &#x27;whitening&#x27; or anything like that) but htat&#x27;s about it. The real reason I bought this product was because I wanted my canker sores gone and I wanted the pain while waiting for the sores to go away to be relieved. This product neither of that and only made my condition worse and also formed another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that, and the outrageous price for such a small amount, I have to rate this one star, but I would give it zero if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to say that this won&#x27;t work for everyone who tries because I&#x27;ve read plenty of reviews that say the opposite...however, it is my duty as someone who has tried this product that it won&#x27;t work in ALL cases.ho has tried this product that it won&#x27;t work in ALL cases.</li>
    <li> I have used Colgate Sore Mouth product for over a year.  I have purchased the item from Amazon before.  It&#x27;s perfect for those who have a mild to medium reaction to some foods (or other \\&quot;mouth\\&quot; consumed product). A simple rinse for a day or so after the reaction and the soreness is gone.</li>
    <li> Superb oral rinse.  I looked it up, this chemical has not long term harmful effects.</li>
    <li> Great for mouth sores.</li>
</ol>
