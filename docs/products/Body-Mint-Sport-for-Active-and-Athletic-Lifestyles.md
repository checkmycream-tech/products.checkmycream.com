<ol>
      <li>YOU BODY MINT &lt;3</li>
      <li>this is the perfect alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I believe the body mint is the best one.</li>
      <li>Works great..</li>
      <li>Not so great tasting either.</li>
      <li>LOL.</li>
      <li>But I have to agree this stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>The best for healthy colon</li>
      <li>&lt;3 LOVE</li>
      <li>I also think the ingredients are good for you.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say I am hooked on this great product</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and it really does work Great!</li>
      <li>However I bought the crystal spray and its the best all natural deodorant ever!</li>
      <li>But this by far is the BEST!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my imagination, but I think I go bathroom more since I started taking.</li>
      <li>The Sport brand as more of an &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; than the one for ladies</li>
      <li>It has helped me be more confident and not worry about people close to me smelling me.</li>
      <li>and it also was more &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I could tell that for sure-</li>
      <li>SO I ORDER 3 MORE AND GOT THE OVERNIGHT SHIPPING</li>
      <li>I will order more.</li>
      <li>If they make it in another form i will gladly take them.</li>
      <li>SURE I ORDER</li>
      <li>but ... I would rather smell like air :)</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Now I can smell my own lite sweet smell of my skin again.</li>
      <li>and I have been really comfortable during my workouts</li>
      <li>I was working full time and going to school full time so, being around anybody stressed me out even more.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want a doctor telling me to just wash under my arms periodically and re apply deo or prescribe a super strong deo</li>
      <li>Also, underarm odor is significantly reduced, as is the sweaty shell when working out.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original</li>
      <li>I lived in Hawaii when the original Body Mint product launched, and it was always a couple of dollars cheaper in the islands (since it&#x27;s either made there or the creators are from there), so I tried it.</li>
      <li>You smell great all the time, remember how you used to have problems.\\&quot; I have used this stuff pretty much on a regular basis since then.</li>
      <li>Also, while they hint that you don&#x27;t need regular deodorant, that may be true for people who genetically smell great or don&#x27;t sweat much anyway, but I still wear an anti-perspirant/deodorant.  </li>
      <li>, my sweat was odorless even in the hot sun, my feet had no odor at all!</li>
      <li>If your a M/F looking for something that&#x27;s going to make you feel &amp; smell fresh</li>
      <li>i just want to say i honestly don&#x27;t like to make fun of people especially after going through that.</li>
      <li>To be honest I&#x27;m pretty sure that this pill has been turning my stool green.  </li>
      <li>AFTER THE FIRST WEEK OF USE</li>
      <li>First off the contents of the pills appears to be something you could replace with a cheaper alternative (but you may have to take a couple pills).  </li>
      <li>It would be embarrassing to go further, but truly, Body Mint made everything smell better.</li>
      <li>For some reason like many who struggle with this condition, several years ago I started to have repugnant body odor.</li>
      <li>They really work!</li>
      <li>We are a very active family our lifestyle is fittness and this helps keep everyone nice and fresh</li>
      <li>MY BREATH WAS FEELING ALWAYS FRESH AND CLEAN EVEN WHEN I DIDN&#x27;T BRUSHED MY TEETH</li>
      <li>i used to really stink after workouts and this really helps.</li>
      <li>and I notice I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
      <li>My husband comments that \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe how much that stuff works.</li>
      <li>I can really tell (smell?)</li>
      <li>really worked.  </li>
      <li>recommend highly!</li>
      <li>The UPC detailed Body Mint Sport, but the product was the regular Body Mint.  </li>
      <li>To pay $17 for 50+ pills that needs to be taken twice a day is kind of not enough when I could probably spend the same amount for an alternative and have 200 pills.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Which is great because Pleasures is expensive.</li>
      <li>I have purchased a few more bottles since then.</li>
      <li>I think buying regular chlorophyll works just as good if not better and would be cheaper.</li>
      <li>This was 2 months ago and now I eat much better, workout and take my body mint sport everyday and don&#x27;t skip it.  </li>
      <li>but I smell sweet instead of my usual super musk smell which some people like</li>
      <li>This pills do exactly what they claim as I hit the gym as much as possible and having B O is really shameful specially around other people</li>
      <li>I have been using Body Mint for over 10 years now, and this new Body Mint since it was introduced.</li>
      <li>I have tried other similar products that are okay</li>
      <li>Followed exact directions and even double dose.</li>
      <li>at first it works, long time use, nothing is changed.</li>
      <li>Now I can snuggle up to him after a long day and not send him straight to the shower!</li>
      <li>think if you are super active and don&#x27;t want to wear toxic antiperspirants ....</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was because of my diet (which hasn&#x27;t really changed for the past year), but there were a couple weekends in which I did not take the pills and my stool returned to normal.  </li>
      <li>you stop taking it, in about two or three days you will go back to normal smelling again.</li>
      <li>I am a female, and even though I am healthy, thin, and practice good hygiene, I have always been troubled by my body and sweat not smelling as fresh as other ladies&#x27;.     </li>
      <li>, weird kind of pill, chalky???</li>
      <li>which is kind of weird</li>

<li> So yeahhhh this stuff turns your stool green if you have a problem with that.</li>
<li> Wasted purchase.</li>

<li> Sorry!</li>
<li> and it almost drove me CRAZY!</li>
<li> I noticed I had a very unpleasant b.o.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The best for healthy colon</li>
    <li> I have used &#x27;Body ints for years!  They really work!</li>
    <li> This pills do exactly what they claim as I hit the gym as much as possible and having B O is really shameful specially around other people so I started taking this pills and I have been really comfortable during my workouts and I can honestly say I am hooked on this great product</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now.  It does reduce a sweaty smell and appears to have no detrimental side effects.</li>
    <li> really worked.  your poop to green which is kind of weird but my b.o. is almost gone even without deodorant.  i used to really stink after workouts and this really helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using Body Mint for over 10 years now, and this new Body Mint since it was introduced. I lived in Hawaii when the original Body Mint product launched, and it was always a couple of dollars cheaper in the islands (since it&#x27;s either made there or the creators are from there), so I tried it. On about Day 4, there was a *dramatic* difference in my body odor. I am a female, and even though I am healthy, thin, and practice good hygiene, I have always been troubled by my body and sweat not smelling as fresh as other ladies&#x27;.     After using Body Mint less than a week, my entire body smelled different. My underarms did not give off an odor by the end of the day, my sweat was odorless even in the hot sun, my feet had no odor at all! It would be embarrassing to go further, but truly, Body Mint made everything smell better. I do have to take it on schedule, I tried skipping days and I can tell a difference, but I am a believer in this product. It has made a big difference in my life. I used to have to take changes of clothes with me to work, I would have to worry about my odor in all sorts of situations. My husband comments that \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe how much that stuff works. You smell great all the time, remember how you used to have problems.\\&quot; I have used this stuff pretty much on a regular basis since then. I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they stopped making it!    I will caution that 1)it takes three or four days to notice a difference and 2)if you stop taking it, in about two or three days you will go back to normal smelling again. Also, while they hint that you don&#x27;t need regular deodorant, that may be true for people who genetically smell great or don&#x27;t sweat much anyway, but I still wear an anti-perspirant/deodorant.  I have tried the knockoffs that are just chlorophyll and they don&#x27;t seem to work the same.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can really tell (smell?) a difference. Especially when I exercise. I also wear Estee Lauder Pleasures perfume and I notice I don&#x27;t have to use as much. Which is great because Pleasures is expensive. I also think the ingredients are good for you.</li>
    <li> Well not roses but I smell sweet instead of my usual super musk smell which some people like but ... I would rather smell like air :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have to use deodorant if I take a half pill daily just my perfume or a scented oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you are super active and don&#x27;t want to wear toxic antiperspirants .... this is the perfect alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend highly!</li>
    <li> I received the regular Body Mint.  The UPC detailed Body Mint Sport, but the product was the regular Body Mint.  Wasted purchase.</li>
    <li> I think buying regular chlorophyll works just as good if not better and would be cheaper. I was not impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> FOUND THIS PRODUCT WHILE SEARCHING FOR ANTI SWEAT PRODUCTS AND ORDERED. AFTER THE FIRST WEEK OF USE I NOTICED MY BAD ARMPIT SMELL WAS LESS INTENSE WHILE WORKING OUT. THEN I NOTICED MY BREATH WAS FEELING ALWAYS FRESH AND CLEAN EVEN WHEN I DIDN&#x27;T BRUSHED MY TEETH THE NIGHT BEFORE. I DID NOTICED THAT WHEN I RUNNED OUT OF THE BODY MINT MY ARM PITS STARTED HAVING THAT STINKY SMELL AGAIN SO I ORDER 3 MORE AND GOT THE OVERNIGHT SHIPPING LOL. NOW I ALWAYS MAKE SURE I ORDER WHEN I OPEN MY LAST BOTTLE.  THIS BODY MINT PRODUCT DOES WORK FOR ME AND WILL NEVER EVER STOP TAKING IT.&lt;br /&gt; )))) &lt;3 LOVE YOU BODY MINT &lt;3 ((((</li>
    <li> Actually diminished body odors considerably.&lt;br /&gt;Turns stool green but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Yes I gave this product 3 stars because at the moment it is in fact working.  But there are a couple negatives to go along with this product.  First off the contents of the pills appears to be something you could replace with a cheaper alternative (but you may have to take a couple pills).  To pay $17 for 50+ pills that needs to be taken twice a day is kind of not enough when I could probably spend the same amount for an alternative and have 200 pills.&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the weird part of this review.  To be honest I&#x27;m pretty sure that this pill has been turning my stool green.  Not that it is a negative thing (did my research), it most likely is because the pills are heavily coated with some green powder.  At first I thought it was because of my diet (which hasn&#x27;t really changed for the past year), but there were a couple weekends in which I did not take the pills and my stool returned to normal.  So yeahhhh this stuff turns your stool green if you have a problem with that.</li>
    <li> at first it works, long time use, nothing is changed.</li>
    <li> This product virtually did nothing for me - I religiously took it every day as the instructions stated to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to look for another product.</li>
    <li> I tried this for a month. Followed exact directions and even double dose. No luck. I returned every bottle I purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the products for about a month now. I started taking both items (2 a day - 1 in AM and 1 in PM). I work out 3 - 4 times a week and while I still sweat I didn&#x27;t smell as &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34;! The Sport brand as more of an &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; than the one for ladies and it also was more &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34;. When I went to the bathroom it did turn my stool green...sorry to sound gross...but it did. I am anticipating on seeing additional benefits as time progresses but at this time I would recommend both or either products.</li>
    <li> I bought this so i wouldn&#x27;t have to wear deodorant anymore, does not work. However I bought the crystal spray and its the best all natural deodorant ever!</li>
    <li> It works but I don&#x27;t like taking pills and sometimes I would forget to take them.If they make it in another form i will gladly take them.</li>
    <li> I have since ran out of this product so needless to say, it works well for keeping one fresh. There are different types to choose from but I believe the body mint is the best one. I will order more.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original</li>
    <li> I have noticed I don&#x27;t need to shower everyday but my socks not smelling is the biggest improvement.</li>
    <li> I THREW THEM ALL OUT, HAD TERRIBLE  SIDE EFFECTS THAT WEREN&#x27;T MENTIONED EXCEPT ON BOTTLE.</li>
    <li> Love,Love,Love this stuff!!! My family been using this product for years and it really does work Great! Our family is never with out it. We are a very active family our lifestyle is fittness and this helps keep everyone nice and fresh 24/7. If your a M/F looking for something that&#x27;s going to make you feel &amp; smell fresh this is it!. I have tried other similar products that are okay soso ...But this by far is the BEST!! The only problem is delivery takes a while. So order before you run out!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months. But I only take 1 pill a day. I do notice a difference. When I play sports or hit the gym, I don&#x27;t have that smelly odor anymore. It has helped me be more confident and not worry about people close to me smelling me. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my imagination, but I think I go bathroom more since I started taking. And yes, your bowels do turn greenish color.</li>
    <li> First let me give you guys some past information. For some reason like many who struggle with this condition, several years ago I started to have repugnant body odor. To make a long story short, I tried everything and when I say everything I mean everything. When I came upon this product by chance on the website I was real reluctant to try it until I read a review that it helped with a few peoples&#x27; body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a bottle and tried using it. It took about a week before I started noticing any difference. This product reduced my body odor about 60 to 80 percent. I am still looking for something that will reduce my body odor to where it is not longer noticeable. I have purchased a few more bottles since then.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product with all the hype from other reviewers.  But I have to agree this stuff is great.  Now -- it does not totally eliminate ALL odors, of course.  But the BO one associates with a day or so without a shower is gone.  Also, underarm odor is significantly reduced, as is the sweaty shell when working out.  I gave some to my husband too.  Now I can snuggle up to him after a long day and not send him straight to the shower!</li>
    <li> I did not notice one bit of difference- and it was well in my system- I could tell that for sure- but none of the benefits they mentioned! Sorry! Wish it worked!</li>
    <li> After I had my child I noticed I had a very unpleasant b.o. and it almost drove me CRAZY! i just want to say i honestly don&#x27;t like to make fun of people especially after going through that. I tried every deoderant, soap, eating habit, showering 3 times a day and nothing worked, I&#x27;m not done i shaved my under arms etc what ever you can think of. I was working full time and going to school full time so, being around anybody stressed me out even more. I didn&#x27;t want a doctor telling me to just wash under my arms periodically and re apply deo or prescribe a super strong deo so i got aggressive about finding a solution. I emailed a natropic doctor who recommended going to mastercleanse.org and following the instructions. I did a 30 day cleanse and followed all instructions on the site. This was 2 months ago and now I eat much better, workout and take my body mint sport everyday and don&#x27;t skip it.  Now I can smell my own lite sweet smell of my skin again. ; p</li>
    <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t want a minty body smell? This didn&#x27;t work to bring a mint smell or diminish any other food or sweat smells that may occur over time from bad dieting, too much onion/garlic etc. Not so great tasting either., weird kind of pill, chalky???</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great..</li>
    <li> The only thing this product does is make poop green.</li>
</ol>
