      <li>This is my favorite OPI color!  </li>
      <li>It great as a top coat on top of another brown.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great Fall/Winter color with some great sparkle, and it just squeaks under the door for being office ready too.</li>
      <li>The surprise is that it is a &#x27;warm&#x27; silver, almost as though it has a dose of warm gold.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice color</li>
      <li>After looking at the polish again this morning under incandescent (warm) light, I bought another bottle!  </li>
      <li>Love love love it!  </li>
      <li>Fantastic rosy-silver shade, nice on fingers and probably toes too, depending on skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I love the compliments.</li>
      <li>(A protective top coat didn&#x27;t change the appearance.)  </li>
      <li>Love love love this collection.  </li>
      <li>Thought it would be more of a gray/purple hologram type, but it&#x27;s not...</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>I saw this color and loved it right away.</li>
      <li>It goes great with most of the fall colors I wear, and great against my skin, which is relatively pale but with a rose/peach(?) undertone.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a very warm and nearly neutral color.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>OPI is always easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy and have gotten compliments on the color.  </li>
      <li>Was delighted to find the color and deal with such a nice company.</li>
      <li>This is a truly wonderful nail color, I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovely complex color, with an iridescent quality that is very fun.</li>
      <li>the color is wonderful but the formula is a little odd.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a silver infused ever so lightly with a rose tone that appears in certain light.  </li>
      <li>Waiting for free shipping here on Amazon of course</li>
      <li>What a fabulous color.  </li>
      <li>This color is not just for holidays -- it&#x27;s a perfect color for everyday.</li>
      <li>I used this as a top coat over another suede brownish OPI color and it really made it pop!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really sure what this company did to the OPI ingredients, but it was incredibly watery!</li>
      <li>Glides on easy and gives a nice shimmery grey that is great on short nails for business or pleasure!</li>
      <li>I suspect this polish would look good with a lot of different skin tones.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I like to take time with my nails, but when I need to do a quick mani I find myself reaching for this polish.</li>
      <li>OPI sometimes re-issues a color under a fancy new name for a special collection, but my manicurist doesn&#x27;t have this one, and I really love it.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty color.  </li>
      <li>This polish would look good on someone with pink tones because of the silver and rose, and looks fabulous against my yellow tones.  </li>
      <li>Service from the seller was fast and easy.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited about getting this color because it looked so pretty in all the pictures I saw online.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, but as with other glitter polishes, the real challenge comes in removing this.</li>
      <li>It is sparkly but not over the top or too young looking.</li>
      <li>She noted whether it was pearl, sparkle and whether you need one, two or three coats of polish to attain the right coverage.  </li>
      <li>The whole 007 collection is really cool.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Awesome year round color!!!!  </li>
      <li>I had my regular manicurist put it on for me, as she&#x27;s really good at getting the most out of a little polish.  </li>
      <li>This color is very sheer and more tan than it appears in the photo.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the purchase.</li>
      <li>so this was also my first OPI</li>
      <li>loved it so much I tracked it down and ordered it.</li>
      <li>Nice polish, but a little darker than I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Thanks amazon for the fast delivery of this OPI</li>
      <li>I have not had much luck with the polishes that have the purple swirl through them.  </li>
      <li>Any attempt to just smooth it back out resulted in wiping the nail polish off instead.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Stays on better than any other brand!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The product was brand new with no separation.  </li>
      <li>so I only paid $6 (instead of the usually OPI $8) and no shipping!</li>
      <li>It takes 2 or 3 coats for opacity, but it goes on smoothly, dries fairly quickly, and lasts sufficiently long without any chips and doesn&#x27;t go dull (then again, I&#x27;m very OCD about my nails and like to avoid doing things that might damage the manicure).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been staring at it under three different lights so far to see if the color is the same (natural light, fluorescent, and incandescent) and so far, it is.</li>
      <li>complaints were that it needed two layers to be opaque, though I went ahead and did three, and that if you dinged it up a little you couldn&#x27;t just smooth it off.</li>
      <li>My fav color by far.</li>
      <li>After all this, I was still pleasantly surprised with the results of &amp;#34;The</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I bought the Skyfall Bondettes mini collection and have tried just &#x27;The World is Not Enough&#x27; so far.</li>

<li> \\&quot;I bought the Skyfall Bondettes mini collection and have tried just &#x27;The World is Not Enough&#x27; so far.</li>
<li> LOVE THIS POLISH, PURCHASED 2 BOTTLES AT 6.93 EACH, BUT VERY NEXT DAY PRICE WENT DOWN TO 2.00 PER BOTTLE, NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT.</li>
<li> (Coloration-wise, I&#x27;m formerly a dark-ash blonde with dark blue eyes, now platinum-white haired, if that helps.)</li>
<li> My skin color is on the yellow side rather than pink.  </li>
<li> The polish was described by another customer as taupe with flecks of pink, but that&#x27;s not enough to descibe what this polish looked like on me.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s very small glitter in very bronzy tones with other colors accenting it, but the overall color you see is a bronze glitter.</li>
<li> The sparkles jazz it up and keep it from being too \\&quot;dark\\&quot; for a professional setting and keep it edgy enough for any evening plans you may have.</li>
<li> I contacted the seller, I returned the polish (in which I had to pay for to send back) and they claim they &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t receive it!!!&amp;#34; So there goes $16 down the tubes for the two polishes I ordered.  </li>
<li> I was expecting a grey with micro flecks of other colors, looking at the bottle.</li>
<li> Base coat, one coat of The World is Not Enough, and a quick-drying top coat</li>
<li> The OPI formula is terrific as usual, and this is a one coater for me.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sort of a dark champagne with pink and green shimmer.</li>
<li> As nice as the color looks online, it was made awful.  </li>
<li> This was not as hard to get off as the other polish.</li>
<li> After giving my nails the usual clear base coat, two sheer coats of this produced a warmer color than what I would call taupe, with hints of champagne, bronze, and micro flecks of green as well as pink.</li>
<li> This OPI polish is very subtle and eye-catching at the same time.  </li>
<li> I usually change my polish every few days</li>
<li> Usually darker than what I would go on finger nails</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to purchase nail polish online.  </li>
<li> Every time I wear this polish, I get stopped by at least one women admiring the color.</li>
<li> ordered the wrong shade as the colour was too dark for me which is my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As nice as the color looks online, it was made awful.  I&#x27;m not really sure what this company did to the OPI ingredients, but it was incredibly watery! The polish dried horribly.  I was extremely disappointed.  I contacted the seller, I returned the polish (in which I had to pay for to send back) and they claim they &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t receive it!!!&amp;#34; So there goes $16 down the tubes for the two polishes I ordered.  Never again will I purchase anything from this seller! Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> OPI is always easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Thanks amazon for the fast delivery of this OPI Polish.&lt;br /&gt;Stays in place for one week.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the wrong shade as the colour was too dark for me which is my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my daughter &amp; she likes it.</li>
    <li> Awsomes color. The wife had a bottle that got stolen. I searched locally for a replacement. Found that the color had been discontinued. I found it on the web at your sight,first off. Was delighted to find the color and deal with such a nice company. Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS POLISH, PURCHASED 2 BOTTLES AT 6.93 EACH, BUT VERY NEXT DAY PRICE WENT DOWN TO 2.00 PER BOTTLE, NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT.</li>
    <li> This is a great, shimmering color that works for all seasons.  It&#x27;s subdued but glamorous at the same time.  My fav color by far.</li>
    <li> This is a truly wonderful nail color, I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovely complex color, with an iridescent quality that is very fun. It really&lt;br /&gt;goes with everything!</li>
    <li> I quite like this polish. It&#x27;s sort of a dark champagne with pink and green shimmer. It takes 2 or 3 coats for opacity, but it goes on smoothly, dries fairly quickly, and lasts sufficiently long without any chips and doesn&#x27;t go dull (then again, I&#x27;m very OCD about my nails and like to avoid doing things that might damage the manicure). I work in a theatre and may I just say that it looks incredible under the stage lights...haha. Looks really nice under any lights, perfect shade for the holidays. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about getting this color because it looked so pretty in all the pictures I saw online. Thought it would be more of a gray/purple hologram type, but it&#x27;s not...it&#x27;s very small glitter in very bronzy tones with other colors accenting it, but the overall color you see is a bronze glitter. I&#x27;ve been staring at it under three different lights so far to see if the color is the same (natural light, fluorescent, and incandescent) and so far, it is. I had to use 3 layers to stop the show through of my nail tip. I like the overall look, the glitter is not garish nor is it offensive, but it&#x27;s just not what I wanted. I am olive skinned and I&#x27;m wondering if your skin tone can alter the overall color.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite OPI color!  Service from the seller was fast and easy.  The product was brand new with no separation.  Glides on easy and gives a nice shimmery grey that is great on short nails for business or pleasure!</li>
    <li> Looks great in the bottle not so good on the nails.  I have not had much luck with the polishes that have the purple swirl through them.  Looked murky on my nails.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!  Awesome year round color!!!!  I would definitely recommend.  Stays on better than any other brand!  Love!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful brown iridescent color! The OPI formula is terrific as usual, and this is a one coater for me. Base coat, one coat of The World is Not Enough, and a quick-drying top coat and I am out the door...I like to take time with my nails, but when I need to do a quick mani I find myself reaching for this polish. It&#x27;s a great Fall/Winter color with some great sparkle, and it just squeaks under the door for being office ready too. If you&#x27;re on the fence, I say try it!</li>
    <li> Love love love this collection.  The color is perfect and the name is awesome.  OPI nailpolish is the best - consistent and goes on well.</li>
    <li> This color is very sheer and more tan than it appears in the photo. It is a nice color but I had to apply 3 layers to get the coverage I wanted.  All in all it is a good polish.</li>
    <li> Saw this at the nail salon and decided to try it! loved it so much I tracked it down and ordered it. Waiting for free shipping here on Amazon of course so I only paid $6 (instead of the usually OPI $8) and no shipping! Love it looks great with everything!</li>
    <li> Have had the polish on now for 2 weeks and the only place it is even wearing is the tips of my fingernails (from typing).  Goes on easy and have gotten compliments on the color.  Very pretty color.  Now after 3 weeks it is finally beginning to chip at the corners.  GREAT polish.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> What a fabulous color.  Usually darker than what I would go on finger nails but I can&#x27;t help myself !</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this polish, I get stopped by at least one women admiring the color. It&#x27;s difficult to desribe -- it&#x27;s like a pinky-silver color. Works great as a metallic neutral!</li>
    <li> My wife is reviewing this one. She says:  \\&quot;I bought the Skyfall Bondettes mini collection and have tried just &#x27;The World is Not Enough&#x27; so far. I was expecting a grey with micro flecks of other colors, looking at the bottle. I had my regular manicurist put it on for me, as she&#x27;s really good at getting the most out of a little polish.  Fashion Alert!  The polish was described by another customer as taupe with flecks of pink, but that&#x27;s not enough to descibe what this polish looked like on me. After giving my nails the usual clear base coat, two sheer coats of this produced a warmer color than what I would call taupe, with hints of champagne, bronze, and micro flecks of green as well as pink. (A protective top coat didn&#x27;t change the appearance.)  This OPI polish is very subtle and eye-catching at the same time.  I immediately bought a full-sized bottle from Amazon when I got home.  After looking at the polish again this morning under incandescent (warm) light, I bought another bottle!  OPI sometimes re-issues a color under a fancy new name for a special collection, but my manicurist doesn&#x27;t have this one, and I really love it.  It goes great with most of the fall colors I wear, and great against my skin, which is relatively pale but with a rose/peach(?) undertone. I think it would look equally great on me in spring or summer. (Coloration-wise, I&#x27;m formerly a dark-ash blonde with dark blue eyes, now platinum-white haired, if that helps.) I suspect this polish would look good with a lot of different skin tones.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love it..gotta get more!!!</li>
    <li> Nice polish, but a little darker than I had hoped.  This was not as hard to get off as the other polish.</li>
    <li> Very pretty &amp; beautiful nail polish color ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> Fantastic rosy-silver shade, nice on fingers and probably toes too, depending on skin tone.  This is definitely a fall-winter go-to color!</li>
    <li> I saw this color and loved it right away. I&#x27;ve only bought China Glaze until now so this was also my first OPI polish.&lt;br /&gt;The color is excellent. When the lady showed me the color on the wheel it looked totally different. On me in yellow lighting, it looks like a rosy-silvery-champagne. Different angles and different lights bring out different parts of that combination but it&#x27;s a very warm and nearly neutral color.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaints were that it needed two layers to be opaque, though I went ahead and did three, and that if you dinged it up a little you couldn&#x27;t just smooth it off. Any attempt to just smooth it back out resulted in wiping the nail polish off instead.&lt;br /&gt;So the color is wonderful but the formula is a little odd.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this for the Christmas season as well!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, but as with other glitter polishes, the real challenge comes in removing this.</li>
    <li> Perfect for work. The sparkles jazz it up and keep it from being too \\&quot;dark\\&quot; for a professional setting and keep it edgy enough for any evening plans you may have. I usually change my polish every few days but I&#x27;ve kept this on for going on 5 days. I love the compliments.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to purchase nail polish online.  I did some research and found a video of someone polishing their nails with each of the OPI Skyfall colors, describing the color as she went.  She noted whether it was pearl, sparkle and whether you need one, two or three coats of polish to attain the right coverage.  Then she showed her nails in daylight and evening, describing the nuances.  After all this, I was still pleasantly surprised with the results of &amp;#34;The World is Not Enough&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a silver infused ever so lightly with a rose tone that appears in certain light.  The surprise is that it is a &#x27;warm&#x27; silver, almost as though it has a dose of warm gold.  My skin color is on the yellow side rather than pink.  This polish would look good on someone with pink tones because of the silver and rose, and looks fabulous against my yellow tones.  This color is not just for holidays -- it&#x27;s a perfect color for everyday.</li>
    <li> This color  is amazinly beautiful! I love it! It is a fall color so i am sad I will not be wearing it all spring or summer. It is sparkly but not over the top or too young looking. It great as a top coat on top of another brown. I used this as a top coat over another suede brownish OPI color and it really made it pop! The whole 007 collection is really cool.</li>
