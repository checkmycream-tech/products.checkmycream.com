<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use the Jergens  Healing Lotion Daily, I love this lotion, great price for the Jergens Healing Lotion</li>
    <li> Great lotion but bottle was damaged upon arrival, squirt pump never worked. Recommend the lotion though.</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying that I am a Registered Nurse and the mother of two toddlers. I have always been a frequent hand-washer, and have always struggled with dry hands. This is especially true in the fall and winter, when I am prone to small bleeding cracks on my fingers.    This lotion is the best daily lotion that I have found. If I use it nightly before bed, the condition of my hands is greatly improved. If I miss even one day of using it, I get bleeding cracks. I have been using it for years, and although I have occasionally tried other lotions (usually for only one or two applications!), I always return to this, and here are my reasons:  1. It doesn&#x27;t sting my hands if they happen to have small cracks or cuts.  2. It has only the very faintest fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like fruit or flowers.  3. It is not greasy in the least bit. I hate having greasy hands, and this is one of my favorite things about this lotion.  4. It absorbs quickly, and noticeably lasts through at least one or two handwashings.  5. It is affordable.    So I hope that I have convinced you to try it! I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. I have used this product daily for years and it is amazing!</li>
    <li> Must have for elbows and knees</li>
    <li> I bought a goody box of stuff for my daughter who is a single mom and this is one of the things in it. You can&#x27;t complain about this product and the price was as good as Walmart too. It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it. She called me up and said MOM what surprise and thank you! I put in many items on here for her and the kids. She runs a child care and even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...lol Thanks for the  great prices too AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Came super fast still the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily and you can almost hear your skin going ahhhhhhhhhh! Lol</li>
    <li> My son had nasty, red and itchy eczema patches on his skin. The pediatrician told me Eucerine, it did absolutely nothing. The dermatologist prescribed Desonide, it barely worked at all. I tried Aveeno, Cetaphil, and a slew of other expensive brands and nothing touched his eczema. I tried this lotion and was blown away at the results after just 1 use. His skin is back to being baby soft. No rough patches, no itching and no red patches. My baby boy has baby soft skin again and I have Jergens to thank for it. I will buy this lotion for as long as they make it. Thank you so much Jergens</li>
    <li> I use this lotion to wackoff. It is almost the consistency of petroleum jelly and dries up quickly just leaving a greasy sticky layer.  However, if used when wet, makes for a very slick medium. If you&#x27;re looking to be Michael Jackson and &amp;#34;just beat it&amp;#34; there are better ways to go. I&#x27;d also never use a petroleum product to &amp;#34;soften my skin&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Because of a previous satisfied customer posting I purchased this product.  The review was spot on.  So I am posting in the hopes another customer will be as satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have a daughter with eczema and dry skin problem, especially during winter months.  Every year we tried something new from the local stores and for years we used Cetaphil until recently discovering Jergens.  Jergens is by far much cheaper than Cetaphil and works better than Aveeno, Lubiderm, Gold Bond, Vaseline, etc.  It&#x27;s not that other products don&#x27;t work, Jergens just works better than all of them.  The eczema is under control and the dry skin feels much better and stays calm much longer.  It took us 12 years to eventually get to try Jergens, so take it from me and try this lotion next.  Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> What can I say? This is a genuine Jergens lotion. Very surple on skin. Amazon you are the best. I believe you guys make a decent effort in quality control giving the size of your store-100% score. Get one-you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I am so used to this lotion that I cannot use any other brand. Amazon has it at cheaper rate than wall-mart.</li>
    <li> Always my favorite lotion.  Not oily. Use it right out of the shower.  My skin is always so silky smooth, people get surprised when they come into contact with my skin and always ask about how I get it so smooth.  The key is to use the lotion right out of the shower</li>
    <li> I was looking for a every day lotion after showers and read previous reviews so I decided to try this product.  I like it very much and as I mentioned before I use it every day and one bottle lasts me about 2 months so it is worth the money.  I love how my skin feels soft all day,it took about 2 weeks of daily use to get the results the bottle promises but my skin is very healthy now.  I absolutely recommend this product because it does not burn damaged skin and has a light fragrance so I can wear my perfume and the 2 scents do not clash together.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t used this lotion previously you will be happy to know that you made a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion will surely rescue your skin if it is dry and you will enjoy soft, supple skin. It is truly an awesome product and my personal favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Feels a bit think/ oily at the beginning.  Gets absobed very fast.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams but this one really works! And is better than those small tubes you pay $10+ for so its a great deal too. However I did find a better deal at my local BJ&#x27;s I bought a pavkage there that comes with 2 of these and a smaller one that&#x27;s still pretty big for $10.99 I think it was.</li>
    <li> Great for the whole family!  This is a very good lotion. It absorbs well and smell absolutely amazing! It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day. This is really good for extra dry skin, my son has eczema and this works wonders on his skin for daily use. I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  This body lotion is great for feet especially for those who are very active.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  Works well for ultra healing and the aroma is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> No kidding! I wrote the company and asked them to never, ever change Jergens Ultra Healing. I LOVE IT so much that I used ALL CAPS in most of my title! I never do that!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a little background...I am a lotion junkie. I have bought oodles of it over the years, based on scent, reviews, price, even container. Also, I have the driest skin ever in the winter due to our heat running. Then, I get sore areas on my shoulder blades and my thumbs start to crack a bit. If this sounds like you, you need to try Jergens Ultra Healing. I love this so much, I could marry it :D I always get the huge motherlode bottle seen here, with the pump. Then I get their smallest bottle and carry it in my purse. I also leave one at work. There&#x27;s the real rub (lol) because lots of the folks at work bring in lotion. (I work at a BBQ pit/restaurant.) Well, I am constantly filling my bottle and bringing it back to work, everyone loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion lasts. I do rub it in and then often use a paper towel so I can run the register right away, but I think the fact that it lasts on your skin is a good thing. Also, this is my first winter where I have gone the entire season and not had that issue with my thumbs cracking because they are so dry and constantly being washed, doing laundry, dishes etc. I attribute this to Jergens, for sure. As for the dry area getting sore on my shoulder blades, it happened once this year, and I used Jergens and it was gone..GONE the same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent. I love the big bottle with the pump. I love every single thing about it and you know what?? It&#x27;s so affordable! I have used that fancy line of fragranced lotions (you know the one, sweet pea and cotton etc) and if we are being honest, it may smell good but it doesn&#x27;t work as a lotion for dry skin. I have also gotten lots of lotions and samples of lotions that make all kinds of promises, including pharmacy lotions that cost a ton and promise real healing. Skip all of that. Get Jergens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side story, my father had really dry skin. It was a constant issue with him his entire life, year round. Well, I got him to try this and he loved it so much, he took my motherlode bottle home with him, then got a lotion applicator thing (who knew they had them??) so he could put it all over his back. LOL He brought it up a few times when I talked to him on the phone, how he wished he had found Jergens Ultra Healing a lot sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the BEST and at this price point you can get the motherlode and few on back up!  By the way, it lasts a long time in the bottle. I&#x27;ve seen no color change or consistency issues etc. All good, all the time. Not at all an overwhelming scent either.gens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side story, my father had really dry skin. It was a constant issue with him his entire life, year round.

    <li> I have extremely dry skin on my hands and feet that usually gets so bad that they begin to peel and sometimes bleed. When I use this lotion, my dry skin completely heals. I always try to have some around because whenever I&#x27;m out of it, the dry skin comes right back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had an eczema break out last year that disappeared after I started using this lotion. Its great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time, and I love it. However, the bottle was packed improperly and the moisturizer had leaked inside the packet. Then when I tried to open it, the pop-up top wouldn&#x27;t open and broke off in my hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for a really long time, I thought I&#x27;d try ordering it for a change instead of going to the store to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Jergens fan. The Ultra Healing was nice. I don&#x27;t know that it totally cleared up my dry skin. My feet in Winter were about to cry uncle. But it went on smooth and light and felt good and I think it did help. I liked the cute little bottle too (version I picked up). Yes. I know. I&#x27;m one of *those* girls that buys things because they&#x27;re cute. Don&#x27;t care. Makes me happeh :D I&#x27;ll buy this one again no probs.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion.  Have been using it for over 10 years.  I use it on my entire body after every shower and cannot complain.  There is no strong smell and it leaves my body feeling clean.  No sticky feeling.  I used to get these bumps (like flesh colored goose bumps) on the back of my arms and all over my legs.  They didn&#x27;t itch or anything, but they didn&#x27;t look very attractive either.  Nothing worked, so I tried the Jergens.  I used it twice a day, and after every shower.  It did take a month or so, but they eventually disappeared.  No more icky looking bumps on my arms or legs.  Just nice smooth looking skin.  I have also tried their hair thinning formula (haven&#x27;t seen it for a few years now), and that also worked.  It just thinned the hair on my legs so even if I skipped a day or two of shaving, you couldn&#x27;t really tell.  And the price, It&#x27;s less than $8 a bottle at Wal-Mart so please do not pay this ridiculous $20-something a bottle here or anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I am a guy who suffers pretty bad from dry skin/irritation in the winter months, especially when it becomes extremely dry and cold outside. I have tried numerous brand name lotions that are readily available over the counter and they all did not work as well as this specific lotion (ultra healing) and I keep coming back to this one time after time. It definitely penetrates the skin pretty deep and seems to work pretty quickly — absorbs very fast &amp; does NOT leave a greasy feel on your skin. The other TOP brands that claim to be healing, do not work as well because the lotion seems to just stay on the surface of the skin — it doesn&#x27;t seem to be actually be fixing the dry skin problem, but just temporarily gives the skin a smoother appearance, which is completely useless if can&#x27;t heal at the source. The other brands are just exceptionally good at advertising/marketing and will get people to buy their products just for the name. Jergens is a really good brand, and although it is advertised towards women more so than men… I find it to be the best lotion out there for extremely dry/cracked skin. It works A LOT better than the lotions that claim to be &amp;#34;for men&#x27;s skin&amp;#34;, etc….</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I have dry skin and moisturize every single day.  I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of different moisturizers, and this one is the best.  It absorbs well, smells great, and makes my skins soft and smooth all day.</li>
    <li> So far the only moisturizer that plumps up my arms and hands skins so wrinkles disappear - and skin does not look scaly, unlike other lotions.  Fair skin and turning 40 has made me aware of my hands and arms looking weird and wrinkly. I drink plenty of water but my skin still has those millions of tiny wrinkles (I can see even better(?) because I now have to wear glasses). I put on 2 thick layers of this stuff after my nightly shower, in the morning my skin looks younger again. This stuff is cheap and actually works so I&#x27;m very happy.  I would take a picture of before and after but I do not want to revert back to wrinkles. Maybe I can update later with photos.</li>
    <li> This is awesome silky smooth</li>
    <li> Came on time, no damages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price. Plan to getting some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;saves me a trip to CVS.</li>
    <li> Good lotion, a good portion for the price. It is scented though.</li>
    <li> Great price and does the job well.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. This is what I use every day for my dry skin. I have dry skin even in 100% humidity. I even take this when I travel north where it&#x27;s colder and dryer.</li>
    <li> My  mom used Jergens when I was a child and now I do -  works great - love it as always.</li>
    <li> This is definitely worth the money. During the winter time especially, since it is soo moisturizing! The bottle is also very big so it will last a long time!</li>
    <li> The product is very good end effective. Problem is that it contains dangerous ingredients like &amp;#34;parabens&amp;#34; - which is linked to breast cancer, breast growth in males and diminished muscle mass. Unfortunately, ingredients were not clearly indicated. Otherwise I would not buy this product. I hope you&#x27;ll find this information helpful.</li>
    <li> Jergens is the only lotion that actually heals my dry hands and prevents hangnails while keeping them soft.  I have purchased dozens of expensive lotions in the past but always come back to Jergens.</li>
    <li> A very nice product that is reasonably priced and very effective.  I was getting this on my subscribe and save but amazon just took this product off this program.  So now I will have to look for a substitute</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion now for over 4 years and it is my preferred lotion. After a shower or washing dishes it is all I need to bring back the smooth, softness to my skin.  I&#x27;m now 66 years old and my skin still looks and feels great thanks to God grace and the use of Ultra Healing Lotion.</li>
    <li> I normally do not write reviews for things like lotion, but Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion is amazing. I have struggled with severly dry skin my entire life. I have tried pretty much everything (i.e. Aveeno, Gold Bond, Neutrogena, etc.). I&#x27;ve had lotions, creams, moisturizers, treatments, perscriptions, and have never been completely happy with what I got. When I started using this lotion, I had incredibly chapped hands. They were red, cracking, and painful. I now have soft hands!!!! The redness is almost entirely gone!!! I apply multiple layers of the lotion at a time because it absorbs super quickly. I will continue to use this amazing, fantastic, skin saving lotion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent for dry skin . It moistures and keep your skin soft . It also last all day until you shower . No reapplying</li>
    <li> i bought three bottles. one of them was broken. I feel annoying coz i cannot find someone take responsibility for it. The Jergens should take more attention on the package.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion.  I have been using Jergens for years and it does a great job of keeping my whole body moisturized and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is my 4 - 5 purchase. Worth purchasing if you have a dry skin and low humid weather conditions.</li>
    <li> The best place to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> From serving overseas in a very very dry area, I feel as if my skin will never recover. I used Jergens when deployed and the change to my skin was almost immediate. Note that I slathered this on as often as possible. I continue now so use it. Having returned, I&#x27;ve tried every lotion it seems, but always come back to Jergens because for the money, it does just as well, if  not better, than other more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot of lotion in my day. Most of them have done fairly ok but this is the one I have found to be the best for me. I have pretty much normal skin except in the winter when I turn into a crocodile or some other kind of flaky reptile. Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion does such a good job keeping me from scratching myself to death. Without it especially in the winter, I would scatch my legs until they just about bled. The more you scratch, the more you itch. I know that to be true but it does not matter when you have such scaly, itchy skin. Jergens seems to truly heal my horrible winter skin and I am most appreciative of that fact. It isn&#x27;t particular fancy or high dollar but it is an old favorite for lots of people. The Jergens smell reminds me, too, of days gone by and people who are no longer here. That&#x27;s a nice aspect of Jergens, too, I think. It is just a very good product and I am appreciative of that fact. It sure beats spending lots of money for prescription stuff.</li>
    <li> Good value for the $$ Lotion is pleasantly scented, thick and creamy and actually makes skin softer.  In harsh weather this can be a lifesaver to prevent cracking or chafing. I like this as much as Gold Bond Ultimate Healing (which is more $$, but better for faces and individuals with allergies or really sensitive skin) The bonus is the long lasting protection you can feel through several light hand washings.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this in one product that has never bothered me. It has a nice consistency that is not runny, but neither is it thick or sticky. It goes on easy, keeps hands from chapping in winter. I use it on hands, elbows and legs throughout the year. Works every bit as good as more expensive products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. Have been trying different lotions for the past couple of years... this is by far the best (mind you I did not try buying anything crazy expensive). It is very thick and feels great. Very happy</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. non-greasy but lasts. Wish they had it in Alphahydrox version with all of the same benefits in this one.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great, it absorbs easily and quickly. My skin was very dry when I moved to a colder climate and this really helped. The fragrance isn&#x27;t strong so that&#x27;s a bonus too. I find the price on amazon really good especially when I S&amp;S.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, great price!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion! No matter how many times I try something else, I always come back to this. It has a very light scent, is non greasy and very moisturizing. In the winter, my skin is so dry and ashy. This lotion brings it back to life. I also use this for my two year old. He has mild eczema and this doesn&#x27;t exacerbate his condition. In the winter, I&#x27;ll use this with petroleum jelly to seal in the moisture. This lotion is our skins holy grail!</li>
    <li> Lotion does what it says it does. Not fraganced and not thick but its a great deal price wise for such a big bottle.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using various Jergens moisturizers for a few years now, and it’s still my #1 go-to lotion. Even though I would consider myself quite young and not consider myself to have “very dry skin”, I still use this one because I suppose that it provides extra nourishment for even those of us with relatively normal skin. I often use it right after a shower, or after I wash my face, and my skin feels and looks smooth for most of the day as a result. Recently, I have been applying this on my hands and feet whenever they feel a little dry and so far I have been pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jergens offers great value for the amount you spend. I’ve searched for all kinds of skin care products, and while there are others out there that seem to be of impeccable quality, they’re usually more expensive than Jergens, hence I stick with this baby. I hardly ever go a day without it!</li>
    <li> The best price for the biggest jug of the best lotion. Keeps my hands moisturized better than almost any other lotion. I suffer from severely chapped &amp; cracked hands in the winter, and this is great. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This is a good skin calming lotion. Sometimes in winter my skin gets itchy or after leg shaving skin feels dry. This lotion makes my skin feel moisturized and smooth. I bought all sizes to take with me on trips and to keep on night stand. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Really pleasantly surprised. Randomly picked a travel size up and am so happy I did. I recently destroyed my dry cuticles from picking at them due to anxiety. I&#x27;m talking they were a mess--a bit bloody and way dryer afterward than they even were before. After applying this lotion twice and 12 hours later my hands and cuticles were significantly noticeably better. Much more hydrated, smooth, and less painful. Two days now using it with like 3 applications per day they look almost back to perfect health. It just looks like I had my cuticles removed as a part of a manicure treatment. Everything is healed up and super moisturized. I&#x27;m really pretty amazed. Also it absorbs quite quickly, for me it takes about 10 minutes so I just make sure to apply it when I&#x27;m home and not about to jump in the car. Really impressed and plan on buying another small tube to keep in my bag at all times; I get dry skin on my nose which makes makeup look funky if not treated in the winter. As well as a large bottle for home. Not at all a lotion person but this stuff is more like a skin elixir! And totally affordable to top it off.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! My skin looks healthy and beautiful since using. Could not live without it! Not too greasy. Perfect formula!</li>
    <li> Wonderful item smells great too, makes skin soft and smooth, love the product, thank you much for putting it out there.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I brag about this lotion so much my entire family and relatives are hooked too.  It’s lusciously thick and really deep moisturizes skin.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I liked the Jergens Natural better but I guess thy discontinued that so this will do.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion for healing dry, rough skin.  Use daily.  Great bargain 32 oz!</li>
    <li> Other lotions don&#x27;t last or become watery. My hands can feel dry shortly after using other lotions. This is my go-to body and hand lotion.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best products for its price. Really moisturizes, dries easily and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong. The large quantity means you&#x27;ll be using this for months even if the whole family uses it.</li>
    <li> Great service and great product!!</li>
    <li> Really great if you have really dry skin, if your skin isn&#x27;t very dry you might get a sticky feeling for a bit if you use too much. I&#x27;ve tried lots of brands but I keep coming back to this one. Even when I was swimming 20 hours a week (my skin would get ridiculously dry) this kept my skin nice and happy when I used it every day</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the feel of this lotion.  This is also cheaper here on Amazon compared to other stores.  I&#x27;m buying this again for sure.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Very creamy lotion.  Cheaper brands are watery. Not jergens.  Love your product.  Maybe you can add some more scent for those willing and able to use scented products. I personally would love two or three choices for a scented lotion.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the changes you made with this great cream, you have taken away the nice smell and now it feels kind of sticky, you did not have to do anything to it it was great before, i hope you go back to the original since is the only cram i have ever bought all my life, i am disappointed a lot, sincerely Susan</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that helps my extremely dry skin.. especially palms after cleaning up .. I do have eczema and once I apply this lotion it feels like giving water to my thirsty skin.. I know it sounds lil weird but this is exactly ho good it feels.. I have been using Jergens ultra healing lotion from last 8 years and have no complains what so ever.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells soooo good and levies your skin feeling moisturized and fresh. I would highly recommend this lotion to everybody!</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve tried so far. Not greasy and leaves hands moist. I have rough dry hands as a guy and nothing really works 100% but this stuff has worked better than anything so far.&lt;br /&gt;One star because ir&#x27;s not perfect and the fact it was leakng when arrived. Manufacturer evidently doesn&#x27;t pock down pump like others. Packer put plastic around it yo help.</li>
    <li> This one is really good, I love it! It is yes a little sticky but better than the one CVS sells (copy version from CVS)</li>
    <li> Good old Jergens....nice that&#x27;s still around and still a quality product!  Very impressed with this lotion...I swear I could feel healing begin :-)</li>
    <li> Good product for everyone here at the office.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! I&#x27;ve tried others but found them to be thin and basically useless....this really helps those dry hands!!! Great transaction - quick and smooth.</li>
    <li> Jergens has been my family favorite since I was a child. Great price for the size and is worth every penny. I keep a few around so I don&#x27;t run out too often.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for many years.  I love how it feels and how long it lasts on my skin,</li>
    <li> Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion, 32 Ounce, very satisfied with this item. It exactly what it said it would be. Love it!</li>
    <li> i love how this makes my skin so soft and smooth, it is scentless so you can add whatever you want to it</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. Leaves no residue or itch. Non greasy. Just as good as any more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> Moisturize your skin quiet well. It&#x27;s usually the best alternative to my favorite body lotion. Price is also reasonable on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Given that i never write reviews for anything, i was blown away with the results of this lotion to the extent of writing a review.   I have been a victim of dry skin on my legs throughout my life and i had used expensive moisturizers to conquer this evil to no avail. After searching online i found this lotion recommended for my condition so i tried it.     I initially bought the 21oz pack of three since i particularly love to save money. I was amazed at the result. I haven&#x27;t seen a part of the former dry area of my skin with any dry patches. Even more, the lotion gave an even tone and smoothness.  This is highly recommended. I will keep purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this lotion is one of many that I&#x27;ve tryed and I&#x27;ve found it to be the best.  I&#x27;ve placed this on my &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; list. This is my favorite lotion and now I don&#x27;t have to think about buying it at the store.  It is delivered to me every couple of months.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Since I started using this and gave up the highly fragrance lotions, no more scratchy itchy skin.</li>
    <li> This is God&#x27;s cream. It will make all of your cracking, dry, flaking skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom. Best lotion. PERIOD!</li>
    <li> I buy this in my local store, but wanted to review it as it&#x27;s that good. I actually use this as my face moisturizer. My face/skin is VERY sensitive, but I found even expensive face lotions were either too runny or didn&#x27;t make me feel like my face was moisturized. When I get out of the shower, or wash my face, if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on, my face starts getting tighter and tighter and not comfy. Also, in winter my face can get very dry, so I needed something that was thick, but not sticky, would absorb, and last all day. I have bought so many face lotions and body lotions so I have tried dozens and dozens. At some point I tried this lotion as a face moisturizer, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. I&#x27;ve used this now for at least 2 years and it leaves my face in a great balance. It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and best part, not only is it for my face, but I can use it for my arms, feet etc. I don&#x27;t buy any other. You would be shocked by how many I&#x27;ve tried, and it will take me a few years for my household to use up the &#x27;store&#x27; I&#x27;ve accumulated. Thankful that I can save a ton of money and hope Jergen&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t stop making this. (and no, I don&#x27;t work for the company, I just have had great results)</li>
    <li> First bottle of lotion I&#x27;ve bought in years. I usually use body oils but I live in New Orleans now and oil and summer do not go together out here. The lotion is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. It does not have a scent which is fine with me. Read the other post and it convinced me to by. I do not have dry skin but figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to use something that had healing properties.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to be able to purchase such a very good lotion at such a fair price.  I&#x27;ve been paying more than twice as much for the same size bottle of a lotion that works not quite as well to moisturize.  I wish this ultra healing lotion came in the original scent.  But, honestly the original scent is a wonderful moisturizer too. I ordered the 2l oz bottle of the original scent and use it on my hands and arms as \\&quot;extra\\&quot; just when I&#x27;m moisturizing those areas. I&#x27;ve always loved Jergens lotion and I can purchase this from Amazon for less than I pay for the store brand lotion at a drug store.  I use a lot of body lotion.  And, no more dragging heavy bottles of lotion home from stores. This is just wonderful. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Also, I&#x27;ve been reading reviews of the night repair  lotion and the firming lotion.  Since I&#x27;m 76 years old I do believe the \\&quot;firming\\&quot; ship has sailed. I&#x27;ve used body lotion all over at least once a day for at least 50 years so don&#x27;t feel that I need the extra strength of the night repair.  Thanks to slathering on all that lotion for all those years, my skin is pretty nice for my age. So, I&#x27;ll stick with this Ultra Healing Lotion as it is doing a great job for me. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my daily use lotion. Not much of a lasting scent, not too watery, not to thick. It works just fine and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this lotion. It&#x27;s no frills, effective moisture. I have been using this lotion for years. I find it gives good moisture without feeling greasy or heavy. In the winter, I would move to a heavier cream but this is perfect for 3/4 of the year in a location with actual seasons. I docked one star because I have decided to focus on all natural skin care but the product performs great.</li>
    <li> Great lotion i&#x27;m still using it.</li>
    <li> I like Jergens Ultra Healing&lt;br /&gt;lotion.  It leaves your skin VERY soft.&lt;br /&gt;It will be my favorite Winter and Spring.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, this stuff is great!  Smell isn&#x27;t too perfumey or two medicinal (like some lotions can be)</li>
    <li> nice silky feel. skin is smooth entire day and it smells amazing</li>
    <li> Jergens has been my standard lotion for a few years now. Its simple and nourishing. I didn&#x27;t want anything too strong with a lot of fragrance but still wanted a pleasant light scent. It&#x27;s light and easy to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I used to ONLY use cheap cocoa butter lotion on my skin because I thought it was the only lotion that would be keep my body moisturized. however, i started using this as a substitute when my store was out of cocoa butter and I will never go back. this lotion is so thick and so creamy- ican&#x27;t believe how good my skin feels now. I also don&#x27;t have to use as much lotion as I used to. My skin feels much softer now!</li>
    <li> This is the only body lotion I regularly use.  My skin is really dry and other lotions soak into my skin quickly, leaving it just as thirsty as before.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the only lotion that remotely keeps my skin from getting dry, especially during the cold Chicago winters. I have strictly been using this product for about seven years now and will never change to anything else. The moisture is retained until I take a shower--even then, my skin feels smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it dries off pretty quickly too. I used Vaseline and Aveeno but it doesn&#x27;t work as well for me. But Jergens Ultra healing works so well! After every shower, I put it on and it gets absorbed right away unlike Vaseline that stayed on the surface for a bit and needed some hard work to get it into the skin. Also for me, Aveeno was not able to truly moisturize my skin - I can&#x27;t describe it. If you have dry skin - you will know what I mean. But with Jergens Ultra Healing - no dry skin anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Just something to consider though - my sister who has a similar sensitive skin prefers Aveeno to Jergens. So you should probably try different products before you settle on something.</li>
    <li> I used the old formula for years and recently picked up the new one that&#x27;s in a new package. I don&#x27;t know which ingredient is the culprit, but something in the new formula caused me to break out in a rash all over my arms. I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, but there is definitely something in here that is causing the reaction. The old formula was wonderful, such a shame!</li>
    <li> As a new user, I have nothing but praise for the effects and results of Jergens Ultra Healing lotto; it soaks in quickly and leaves no greasy film or residue. Though I strongly prefer smaller, more portable sizes that also give the user the satisfaction of finishing one and starting another, with the 32 ounce container, you even get a lot of lotion for a little price! I couldn&#x27;t identify the mild, pleasant scent, but it&#x27;s not the classic almond Jergens I loved long ago. Happily, this soothing, healing product comes in a wide variety of sizes and packagings.</li>
    <li> The bottle that I received in the mail isn&#x27;t the bottle that I ordered. The product page clearly display&#x27;s the list of ingredients but upon receiving my package these did not match what was featured on the product page. The item I received was Jergens &amp;#34;Now Even Better&amp;#34; Formula for the Ultra Healing line of creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this as I was specifically looking for Jergens Ultra Healing (without the illuminating HYDRALUCENCE)</li>
    <li> I have many allergies, and, even though Jergens Utlra Healing Lotion is not advertised as being hypoallergenic, it works for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!  It has a very light fragrance, and does an excellent job of keeping my skin moisturized during the winter months.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough for rough heels, but for all-over and everyday use, it&#x27;s perfect.  It&#x27;s light enough to use during summer time as well.</li>
    <li> Its soft on the skin.  Work really good on my dry skin.  Long lasting moisture on my skin. Great Product.</li>
    <li> the exact something you will find at wal-mart. order it if you are lazy like me. mail it to meeeeee. good lotion.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for the past 50 or so years.  i have bought more expensive lotions -- lubiderm, etc -- that claim to to be better moisturizers but i have not found this to be the case.  my comments apply only to jergens ULTRA HEALING LOTION and not to it&#x27;s other lotions.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this size in stores anymore. I also like that the fragrance is not too much and it provides the moisture I need .</li>
    <li> It works better that average lotion. My hands are softer and skin moist. It&#x27;s a little bit greasy and make your hands shiny, but the results are satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Before Jergens, I&#x27;ve tried a dozen of other lotions and NOTHING works as well for my skin.  I have now used Jergens Ultra Healing for close to 2 decades.</li>
    <li> I have very dry mature skin and I used this stuff on my face and it broke out. This cream absorbs into your skin and leaves it very dull and weird feeling. I returned it.</li>
    <li> But it doesn&#x27;t have that fabulous almond-y smell from days of yore.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different lotions but nothing to beat Jergens for the quality and smell. These are really good.</li>
    <li> Ultra Healing is my go-to lotion.  I moisturize every night before going to bed as my hands get severely dry during the winter.  Sometimes they get so bad they crack and bleed.  I have tried lotions that are allegedly Dermatologist recommended and have found them to be greasy, but not Jergens!  This is also the type of lotion I can apply throughout the day occasionally without the greasy feeling left behind.  It soaks right in with just a little dab (if used daily and frequently.  I used a quarter size at bedtime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky with lotions as I dislike applying them to begin with.  Jergens makes this task a bit more pleasing as it soaks in and leaves no film or greasy feel.</li>
    <li> bottle was open when arrived. half of it had leaked out.  nice lotion if I could actually use it. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Tried Nivea and many other non-expensive products...Jergens wins hands down. I recommend this product for best protection and healing of skin during the rough winters.</li>
    <li> My husband, myself and my son have extremely dry skin. We went through number of products till we found this at BJ&#x27;s. We only got it as it said for extremely dry skin. A day or two into using it, it worked.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time we were able to get through winters without having dry,itchy skin. It works equally well on my son. It has a mild fragrance, so if you are looking for unscented, this is not the one. I love the smell though. Also, it works best if you apply it after a shower on damp skin. You can get throughout the whole day without reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy it from BJ&#x27;s though as it works out cheaper.</li>
    <li> This lotion is excellent for male purposes and looks very prominent and pretty whilst sitting next to my laptop and a box of tissues.</li>
    <li> It is so good. It works like magic, really does. I had really dry and bumpy skin in some parts. I used to use coco butter intensive lotion by vaseline, then i switched to suave, but they didn&#x27;t solve the problem. I finally tried this product, and problem solved! My skin feels so smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing i really love about this product is that the scent is not too strong; it&#x27;s nice and mild.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with my dry, goose skin for over 20 years. I went to skin doctors, they said it will not with any cream. But I couldn&#x27;t give up because I was just 10 years old at the time. I tried a lot of cream(most of them was Japanese product because I am.), it had never treated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I got this product is I just saw the CM of this cream, also read some reviews then I decided to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally impressed about this product, it is not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way they smells, and after I apply this product on my skin, it become like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin very very smooth, silky, beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t even believe there is a product it works to my skin!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> I have loved this lotion for years. It is not greasy and always leaves me feeling soft. Great subscribe and save item!</li>
    <li> Stays on for 24 hours! Non-greasy and leaves skin feeling soft and moist. I have tried almost all body lotions (Lubriderm, Cetaphil, Aveeno, Nivea, etc.). This one beats them all!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until I ordered it that it has parabens in it.  On the upside, it keeps my legs moisturized when I do use it.</li>
    <li> Great for any skin. I&#x27;ve been using it last for the last 5 years. It wont leave a greasy feel to your body and quite refreshing during the summer.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion (non-greasy and is a great moisturizer) and was pleased to see a large bottle at this price.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like lotions with scents or ones that leave a greasy feeling.  This one is great for everyday use, even with frequent hand washing and dry hands.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product!  Jergens has been around a long time, most lotions are priced higher and are not better in my opinion.  They are packaged in fancier bottles and may smell nicer but Jergens does the job</li>
    <li> I recently went to Warped Tour and on a float trip, all within the same week and right after the other. Soooo, I got pretty sunburnt, and it hurt whenever I moved or brushed against something. My bra straps and shirt barely bringing my shoulders really hurt it was that bad. After applying this lotion the burning feeling went away immediately and within a few hours the sunburn doesn&#x27;t even hurt anymore! Plus it has kept me from peeling like crazy!</li>
    <li> Jergens has been a great product for years, love this large amount at a low price. You won&#x27;t go wrong if you try it.</li>
    <li> Made my skin sticky/tacky when it dried. I didn&#x27;t appreciate the fake smell either. It also didn&#x27;t really moisturize my skin at all. I&#x27;m going back to coconut oil instead of chemical lotions.</li>
    <li> I love the Jergen&#x27;s Ultra Healing Lotion.  My hands used to be so dry, but by using the Jergens, they are not broken out and dry any more.</li>
    <li> I buy Jergens Ultra Healing over and over because it is simply the best!  If your hands get dry and cracked, this stuff will heal them overnight.  Love it!  :)</li>
    <li> This is my families favorite all-purpose lotion. I use it everyday so auto-delivery was perfect!  Smells so good, big size helps, love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It works all day long and feels amazing on my skin. I have eczema and I will continue to keep buying!</li>
    <li> unlike most of the other reviewers,  Jergens wasn&#x27;t effective with \\&quot;healing\\&quot; my dry skin problems.  I use it as a lubricant wiper to remove makeups.  But I always have to use other moisturizer to keep my skin soft. Since there are so many other options (e.g. St. Ives, Cerave, Centaphil), I probably will not buy Jergens in the future.</li>
    <li> this is a great product, I moved to a new city that is very dry and hot. I had lots of problem with my skins, my legs skin became too dry and I couldn&#x27;t keep it humid and soft. I have tried Aveeno products, even baby oil or vasiline...non of them worked so a friend of my suggested this product and in a week my skin was totally soft and healed... this is fantastic body lotion</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I suffer from extremely dry hands working with papers all day.  Not only did this cream hydrate and moisturize my skin for hours at a time, but I noticed that after a year of use, my skin looks lighter, healthier and smoother.  Of course I keep this cream at work and everytime I use the ladies room and wash my hands, I always rub this cream on both of my hands to retain moisture again.</li>
    <li> The product itself is excellent but the bottles were defective as the pumps were broken and package was full of cream in most cases. Had used the return policy to exchange for defective items, but replacements were just as bad. Will not reorder unless it&#x27;s fixed.</li>
    <li> Jergens Ultra Healing iis a great moisturizing lotion. The fragrance is not overpowering and my legs feel so much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an ER nurse, so daily I wash my hands a lot and use quite a bit of the drying hand sanitizer. In colder months my hands get extremely irritated, dry and cracked. I stumbled upon this lotion in the travel size and after using it for a day my hands miraculously started getting better. I went and bought a larger size of it and now use it regularly. I&#x27;m so impressed with this lotion I&#x27;ve started bringing it to work for everyone to use. We all think it&#x27;s the best lotion we&#x27;ve used. I tried some heavier lotions I thought would work, but they don&#x27;t even come close to the Jergens. I notice that it absorbs quickly, so I don&#x27;t have sticky or oily hands. The scent is very light and neutral. It&#x27;s affordable, so I don&#x27;t mind using it all over my legs also. I haven&#x27;t found a bad aspect to it.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my kids at the high school where I teach and they really like this lotion.  That is a great recommendation.  Even kids who are not in my classroom come for some lotion.  Great stuff and I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and am unable to use it without breaking out into allergies. I gave it to my husband to use as a foot cream instead.</li>
    <li> Some Good Samaritan purchased Jergen&#x27;s Ultra Healing Lotion to go in the ladies restroom at church, and this is where I first became acquainted with it.  I was so impressed with how it softens and is not greasy after using it, that I bought some for myself.  I &amp;#34;added on&amp;#34; the 3oz tube (original cherry almond scent) and now I am set!</li>
    <li> Doctors are way to expensive but i thought for sure i&#x27;d have to go see one so i barely used this the first week i had it(someone purchased it for me). By the 2nd week(still hadnt gone to the doctor) they were starting to heal a little, started using jergens ultra healing 2 or 3 times a day and they are now no longer bleeding and i figure 2 more weeks and they will no longer be dry either if not sooner.  So yes i reccomend this product it works suprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps I had done some research online and found 3 methods that i was going to try since they were posted by knowledgable people on net and one of them was supposedly directly from a doctor but never had to use anything else the Jergens ultra healing actually worked far better than i expected didnt think any lotion could do that.  Couldnt reccomend this more saved me from the doctor fees.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having the craziest, itchiest, dryest skin ever from our -20 degree winter we are having and I have been completely miserable. I read all the comments for this lotion and I was sold. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this. My skin has been so relieved and I can&#x27;t imagine life without this lotion anymore. It&#x27;s also not greasy as well, which is what I&#x27;ve always hated about lotions. Great all around!</li>
    <li> I live in the Northeast. Lately, it has been so cold up here. By cold I&#x27;m talking single digits and in the negatives at night. My skin on my hands has been extremely dry, cracked, and flaky thanks to this cold air. Finally, I decided to exfoliate my skin first (I used a facial scrub to do this on my hands) and then I put on Jergens Ultra Healing lotion before I went to bed. There was definiely a noticable difference the next day. My skin was smoother and had a lot less flaky skin. I continued to do this for about 4 or 5 days (exfoliate skin with my facial scrub, then moisturize my hands with Jergens immediatley afterward).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I type this review, my skin is perfectly healthy. My hands are very smooth. I no longer have that dry, cracked, flaky skin anymore. It&#x27;s healthy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion religiously at least once a day for 5 or 6 years. I have very dry skin, and this helps a lot - I can definitely tell when I don&#x27;t use it. It is unscented, but doesn&#x27;t have one of those gross un-scented scents - just a pleasant lotion-y smell.</li>
    <li> I needed something duable. This lotion fit the bill. Just right. Only wish the product was scentless. All in all, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years now. It is good for oily skin.</li>
    <li> Jergens is an amazing product for keep my skin smooth and itch free during the winter. The smell is unisex so even my husband can use the product.</li>
    <li> True to Jergens reputation, they have created another excellent product to help us all take care of our skin.  This product is very soothing and moisturizing while it nourishes dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great smell. Great texture!</li>
    <li> The product is great, but the pumps for the three Jergens lotions that I ordered did not work. Hence I decided to cancel my auto delivery.</li>
    <li> Top of  the line product..I have tried it and it works...dry skin is gone..hope you have confidence in my 5 star rating</li>
    <li> In the past the only lotion that worked for me was Curel, however I tried a sample of this when it was first introduced and have been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me a small bottle of this as a stocking stuffer.  I refilll the small bottle and keep this on the nightstand.  It works great on dry skin and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I normally use Jergens original (cherry and almond) lotion and love it but decided to give this a try for the winter as the other reviewers said it was a bit more moisturing.  They were right!  It&#x27;s not greasy but it does provide a bit more moisture and that&#x27;s a great thing for the winter months in Indiana.  Would definitely purchase this lotion again.  It is moisturing without being greasy and has a nice clean scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years, and just love it. Smells very nice, goes on smoothly, is non-greasy, and mosturizes my skin extremely well. Very healing.</li>
    <li> As a frequent hand-washer (just *this* side of obsessive) my hands are usually dry. During the winter, they are so dry they become scaly and itchy. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different lotions; rare ingredients, completely organic, prescription, drugstore-cheap to exclusive-boutique-in-France-pricey and everything inbetween. Hands down, Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion is the very best. It absorbs quickly, has a very light scent, isn&#x27;t greasy, and pampers my skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This lotion has the loveliest scent, very soft and nonintrusive.  I like it even better than my longtime favorite Original Scent.  It also does a great job of moisturizing and is easily absorbed, without leaving a greasy feeling.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else to moisturize my skin.  Jergens always makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> A terrible twist for a great cream. If you have not yet tried the new variant of this cream, don&#x27;t! I bought 8 32 ounce ultra healing lotions a few days ago just like I always did and discovered that they now look different, smell different and above all feel different. They tweaked the ingredients and chemical balance enough for this to feel like a whole different cream. It has lost everything that I appreciated in it but retained the price! It now feels as cheap as Suave or other cheaper ones. I am really very disappointed in them. Why fix it when it ain&#x27;t broke? I am returning all the ones I bought and not looking back. Sad end to a beautiful 20 year long story.</li>
    <li> great lotion.  I dont like lotions with smells.  this one was great</li>
    <li> Winter months my hands and face are very dry.  I use this every night on my hands and each morning on my face - it&#x27;s not greasy, barely has a smell and really works well. I think it has made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> In the winter I get really dry legs, especially after a hot shower. This bottle will keep my skin smooth and healthy for months. It&#x27;s huge, definitely adequate for a whole family.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion...thick and creamy and smells great! A bargain too here on Amazon :)</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming (my husband HATES smelly lotion) and it moisturizes very well, it also doesn&#x27;t leave that film on your hands that most lotion does.  I will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Ok so I am a girl that works at a autoparts store so my face gets super greasy so I try to wash it atleast twice a day and wow was my face and hands getting super dry and my face even had like little bumps idk what that was from but It was between this and St.Ives boy am I glad I went with this!! The first time I used it I could so feel the difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for like 3 days and I love it! Idk how but all the little bumps on my face are gone and my whole body is smooth. So I say just get it!!</li>
    <li> I have a trouble with my dry skin, and I changed the body cream to this one.&lt;br /&gt;This one seems so different from other body cream, and I keep on using this.&lt;br /&gt;I think the quality of this body cream is so much better than others.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion that really helps my super dry skin. I bought it for less than $7 which, as far as I&#x27;ve seen, is a bargain for a big bottle of great name brand lotion. It absorbs quickly into my skin and has a pleasant, mild, clean smelling fragrance. I highly recommend it (as long as the price is right) and would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Chose this rating because its a good product. I like the thickness of the lotion and the moisturizing effect. Do recommend.</li>
    <li> The bottle cap wasn&#x27;t secured.  But, the produce is good.</li>
    <li> I have skin like an alligator and this product really does make my skin soft. I would recommend this product to anyone who has tried the gamete of lotions with little to no success. This product works great for me. I have scleroderma which causes hardening of the skin and this is the first product I have come across that really does help, and I have tried everything. Lets not forget that it is really reasonably priced, unlike many other products that I have tried unsuccessfully.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this lotion! Works great for daily skin hydration and smells good. Have not had dry skin since using this lotion daily.</li>
    <li> Good for everyday use After pool time or shower. Way better price than retail</li>
    <li> was really expecting/hoping lotion would not be loaded with fragrance.  but, alas, it is.  i&#x27;d give it 4.5 stars except for the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it was an excellent price. It was also much more convenient to have it shipped to my house than having to find the best deal at the stores I shop at.</li>
    <li> I use to use wibi lotion for facial under makeup for many years( I thought it was the only one good for skin) and now days it became very expenssive so I tried  this lotion because of the review not expecting so much. Wow, does it say removes wrinckle? I start to see noticeable wrinkle above my eyes and tried this. It can&#x27;t be but it&#x27;s gone!!!! next day. I&#x27;m sure the wrinkle will be back but I&#x27;m going to fight with this lotion.Thank you Jergens Lotion!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if its just me but it seems as if this winter is so dry.... nothing seemed to be moisturizing my hands enough so I finally logged on to Amazon to see some reviews and get something.. I tried this and it is the BEST lotion I have ever used.. no need for those expensive hand creams either! It worked better for me than Gold Bond Aloe cream</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best lotion ever, it keeps my whole body smooth and not dry. It moisturizes better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and I have tried a lot of them because my skin is dry. This lotion keeps me super hydrated.</li>
    <li> Lotion is excellent but the pump on top was broken.</li>
    <li> Due to the medications I am on, I have a lot of problems with dry skin.  This lotion works great on moisturizing my skin.</li>
    <li> the jergens is the best i love it its so good moisturizes the best bester than any other lotion. i love it</li>
    <li> 2-Year Update: Still fantastic.  This lotion hardly has a scent (a pleasant one if you really sniff for it), rubs in well so as to not leave skin feeling oily, and has completely resolved my skin dryness issues.  I can hardly remember what it was like to have my skin just crack and bleed from being so dry, even after having tried other lotions and healers.  Several years in, this is still the best lotion I&#x27;ve found.    Original review:    I&#x27;ve never been one to use skin lotion, and I&#x27;m also rarely happy to put on sunscreen for similar reasons -- I don&#x27;t like the way my skin feels oily after using it and that it makes everything you touch feel slick, sticky or slippery.    However, after living my whole life in the south, I spent a few years farther north, enduring colder, longer and harsher winters than I&#x27;ve ever been through before.  In fact, going from a warm, humid (wet) climate to a cold, dry, windy climate really did some damage on my skin, particularly a few different areas on my hands.  I tried using some lotion my girlfriend had on it, and it seemed to help, but the redness, dryness and itchiness would only be alleviated for a day or two at most before it would come roaring back.    I consulted a doctor who suggested that it might be a fungus (apparently, it can be hard to distinguish between skin irritation and fungus), so I went through a tube of Lotrimin AF trying to treat this.  I&#x27;ve also used Neosporin and maybe some other products trying to get my skin to heal.  Nothing was working.    Even after I moved back down to a warmer climate, my skin irritation lingered.  Finally, I read some reviews of this lotion on Amazon.  Others had noted similar stories to mine, that they had tried other products, even doctor prescribed medications, on skin issues and nothing had helped until they tried this Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion.  I was hopeful that it would work for me, and I&#x27;m happy to report that it has.    This stuff works wonders, and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily afterward.  After using this for a few days, my irritation was almost completely gone.  For a few weeks, it was still in this state of coming and going, but NOTHING like what it had been before I started using it.  My skin had gotten to the point that every few days, my skin would crack and bleed, and bending my fingers or washing my hands would be extremely painful once all these cracks and cuts showed up.  Since using this lotion, my skin hasn&#x27;t come anywhere near this point of irritation.  I also ordered some smaller bottles of this so that I could keep some in my car, some at my office, etc., and I could just apply a little any time I started to feel dryness coming on.  Now that it has been a few months, I&#x27;m hardly even using the lotion anymore and my hands are completely back to normal.  Seriously, before, my hands did not look normal -- the redness, the cracking, the cuts, it was awful, and it was far worse on one hand than the other.  Now, my hands look exactly the same: completely normal.    Every few days, I can feel it starting to come back, but I just apply a little at night and wake up feeling smooth and normal again.  This lotion does have a faint scent, but nothing irritating.  As I have said, it seems to run in rather quickly and does not leave me feeling like I can&#x27;t go typing, grabbing the mouse or my phone without leaving that object oily.    My girlfriend has abandoned her old lotion.  I actually forgot I put this item on subscription and a second, huge bottle came that we didn&#x27;t really need.  However, she simply took that one for herself and put it at her bedside to replace whatever lotion she had been using.  She is completely on board with how fabulous this lotion is, and so am I.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion, however both bottles came with broken heads not allowing her to pump out the lotion.  Instead she has to unscrew the top every time to get lotion out, which is extremely annoying.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best lotion I have tried thus far for healing extremely dry, cracked skin.  Mosturizes all day with a single application in the morning.  Seems to have extra skin moisturizers that other skin mosturizers don&#x27;t.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for the price. Hydrates very well.</li>
