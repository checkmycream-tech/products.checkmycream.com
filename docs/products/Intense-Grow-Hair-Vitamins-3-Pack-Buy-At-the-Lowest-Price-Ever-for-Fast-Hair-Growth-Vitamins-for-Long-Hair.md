<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair is very curly. My mother is Caucasian and my father is African American, therefore my hair is that (trying not to brag) perfect mix between. When it gets dry it shrinks up and looks short. After using Intense Grow Hair Vitamin for exactly a month I think it has been going great. My hair has actually grow a little which is awesome because my hair seems to NEVER. My hair is noticeably healthier and I don&#x27;t feel bad for going a week without washing it. Also, it does not get tangled as easily as it used to. I recommend these pills to all!</li>
    <li> This pills make my hair so much healthier and stronger, my hair is been growing super fast!</li>
    <li> My hair is bleached platinum blonde. I have been taking this product for about a month now and my hair has grown an inch. My hair usually grows at a slower rate because it is overly processed. I can&#x27;t wait for the full 90 days. Even my nails are stronger and longer.</li>
    <li> I am white with thin straight hair. I always rock a pixie cut. I took these to try to grow it out. I forgot a night pill. The next day I took my AM pill then around lunch I took the one I missed the night before. This made me super sick and I dont recommend it! BUT my hair grew a good half inch after 3 days of puking everything including water. This product works as long as it is taken correctly and don&#x27;t over does like me! haha</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Really does work.</li>
    <li> This is exactly one year of hair growth to the date! I was so happy with the results of this hair growth pill, that of course,  I bought more. I just loved the texture of my hair and the shine. I think it was the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been! Now if you have thin hair life me, I do not recomend anyone to color strip their hair, I did and had major damage and had to cut off about 4inches sadly. I am still taking the hair growth pills to refix the mess I made.  Now remember everyone&#x27;s hair is different. Mines took some time, because it always has but other people have gotten much more inches in one year than I have. Try the product for a year yourself!</li>
    <li> Working great so far!</li>
    <li> Since Ive been using this pills for 2 years my hear is no only longer but so much healthier, I will not change this product ever. Note: I only drink them 5 times a week and got excellent results, I imagine if you want faster results drink them every day</li>
    <li> They really really work try them!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the results...but I must say I am taking it with a biotene supplement...the growth is slow but the thickness and overall health is awesome</li>
    <li> am purchasing another set ,my hair has thickened and is growing</li>
    <li> I buy mine every three months..love them</li>
    <li> Love these vitamins. They will make your hair grow faster and thicker. Its a good deal to get them in a pack.</li>
    <li> I am still in awe on how well and fast this vitamin works.  Great great stuff !</li>
    <li> Only one bottle down, but so far so good! I can tell my hair is thicker.</li>
    <li> This product is working wonderfully on my hair, growth, shiny and thickness.</li>
    <li> My hair seems stronger with improved growth, but I haven&#x27;t taken it long enough to truly know final results.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all!!!felt very disappointed with it.i don&#x27;t recommend it to no one.please don&#x27;t waste your money on it.its not worth it!</li>
    <li> I am have only been using for a couple of weeks and it does feel like it is working a bit. Caution...only take one twice a day. It has niacin in it so i was turning red the first week not realizing that i should not take two once a day.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair healthy but don t help grow it</li>
    <li> I only have been using these vitamins for about 3 weeks now , and I already have half a inch growing, I can by my natural hair colour and the dyed part . These vitamins work well .</li>
    <li> Fantastic product that really works in improving the health and growth of my hair!</li>
    <li> Ladies every one is different you just have to be patient trying to speed up may be harmful if you try to do it with other vitamins if it doesn&#x27;t work stop the vitamins and try something else</li>
    <li> Hey, I have been using Intense Hair Growth not even a month and I have had 1 inch of growth, and I&#x27;m not even finished with the first bottle and got 2 more to go, but normally you only get 1/2 of an inch a month. So I had my husband to wash my hair and blow dry it and he noticed that I had allot of new growth, and I asked him \\&quot;how much new growth is it\\&quot;? And he told me \\&quot;1 inch\\&quot;. So of course I&#x27;m astounded!!! And I also notice the hair on my legs is growing like crazy as well, that&#x27;s how I know that it&#x27;s growing my hair. I hope that this has inspired someone out there. But make sure you eat right and exercise!! Thanks Intense!</li>
    <li> With the first bottle I saw growth.  With the second bottle my hair became very brittle and dry.  I stopped taking them, I still have one bottle left.</li>
    <li> I just received my 3 bottles the other day . i take multiple vitamins such as 1000 mcg of biotin ( 4 a day ) and prenatal with folic acid ( 1 a day )  , currently i have a lot of new growth at the top of my head so hopefully i will have more new growth due to Intense Grow !!! I am determined to find the right vitamins for hair growth . i hope this is it ! My hair is about a tiny bit more than shoulder length .</li>
    <li> hi the ups didn&#x27;t drop off this item to our house could not find item anywhere, I think it was dropped off at a different home  which happens here quite a-lot in Barstow. I really like this product but can&#x27;t enjoy it due to not coming to my home even if it said delivered. I didn&#x27;t get it at my home . So what do I do to get the product.? this is not your fault.&lt;br /&gt;here is my email lorrieann1959@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;Lorrie</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that will make \\&quot;hair\\&quot; grow fast and stronger this is it. I am a skeptic and I do believe in doing research reading reviews before I order any product and also sharring with others the pros and cons.  I have baby fine hair that breaks easily and making things worse my hair started receding around the crown of my forehead and thinning everywhere a few years ago related to my medication and just aging. I started taking Intense Hair Growth and just 3 weeks later my hair started growing like crazy.  Now my roots are thicker, stronger and those thinning spots have disappeared with new hair growth. Three months later I am truly pleased at how well this product works I am going to reorder some more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not doing anything to promote my hair growth other than taking one of these pills in the morning and one at night. My hair already grows pretty fast, but it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous how fast it&#x27;s growing now. While I haven&#x27;t been keeping track of it, a few people have commented on how quickly my short haircut is growing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a major indicator is how rapidly my nails are growing!  Holy smokes! They become long way too quickly now.</li>
    <li> It is really good, I can see the difference already after a month of used. Great deal.</li>
    <li> These hair vitamins are quite effective. I see results already.</li>
    <li> I am an African male almost turning forty and I just completed my third bottle of this hair growth formula. I must be honest; I was very hesitant to write a review until I was certain that I had really noticed hair growth improvement on my scalp. Two years ago I was diagnosed with Androgenetic Alopecia and I have been on Minoxidil, Ketokonazole 2%, 1mg Finpecia tablets, a hair follicle stimulating shampoo and hair growth vitamins. Within the two years my hair loss had lessened and I have noticed hair growth that has slowly been converging onto the center of my scalp where the severe balding is. Three months ago I came across this hair growth vitamin online and decided to have a go at it while sidelining my other prescribed hair vitamins I had been taking prior. To my delight, I have noticed healthier and more regrowth after just having gone through my first batch of three bottles. I am now on my second batch of three and will continue to take them alongside my other prescribed meds. I am very sure that this product has worked for me but I am not guaranteeing that the same results would be obtained by another individual as we all have different responses and metabolisms plus varied hair growth periods. I have not attained the full head I anticipate but the best advice I can give is that only with patience and perseverance will one fulfill goals. Hair regrowth does not happen like magic. I hope all that want to give this product a try will experience the same positive results I have experienced or even better.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with these hair pills. My hair has grown since I started taking these pills and people have noticed. I cant go anywhere now without getting hair compliments. Although my hair is not down to my buttocks area, it has still grown enormously and I can say that I officially have long enough hair. Give it a couple months for these things to start kicking in, and once they do, you&#x27;ll see a difference. WORTH the money and results.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it definitely had some doubts at the beginning stay dedicated to it it does work</li>
    <li> I have finished one bottle and started another one, haven&#x27;t seen a lot of results yet but am hoping to when I finish taken all of it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. no hair growth</li>
    <li> I have used this product before with successful results. An internet search found that your prices are the most economical.  I had hair loss because of medications and this is a product I am continuing to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just over a month.  I have been taking it along with Biotin and a B vitamin complex, and I have noticed about 1/2 inch of growth, maybe slightly more.  Taking it twice a day can be sort of a hassle to remember, but I have become religious about it.  The high dosage hasn&#x27;t upset my stomach at all, like some hair vitamins can, and I will definitely be ordering more.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Been using this product since February 2015 have not seen ANY results yet I have two more bottles to go so I&#x27;ll be back in two months to really rate this item</li>
    <li> So far these work. My hair was really thin and weak but once I started taking these my hair is a lot healthier.</li>
    <li> So far so good, my hair grew 2 and a half inches in about a month and I&#x27;m not even done with the first bottle yet!! I&#x27;ll be ordering more for sure!!</li>
    <li> It was a pain to take 2pills twice a day so if I wasn&#x27;t home I didn&#x27;t get that second dosage. But all in all it did grow faster.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and have noticed my hair is getting a bit thicker which surprised me since I am on chemo</li>
    <li> Great product and noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is stronger already and not falling out as much.&lt;br /&gt;So happy I bought the product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in hair growth.</li>
    <li> Best hair vitamins I have ever used.  I have been taking them for probably 5 - 6 months now and will continue taking them.  It really helped my hair loss and breakage.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s hair grow so fast. His Beard got very long QUICK!! He is now know as the Big Sexy Hairy Munky Man!!</li>
    <li> this totally works. had my hair in braids for a period of 6mths (change them out every 2mths) and my hair grew really well. but of course i messed up all that growth with the blow dryer and have to cut it again. but even with the cut a month ago and can see growth and changes in my hair texture, positive. Oh yeah, I&#x27;m black with natural hair and not mixed, staright black. awesome product.. will use again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting my third bottle and so far I&#x27;ve only seen about a normal amount of hair growth. Nothing extraordinary or more than usual. I dye my hair so I am able to see how much growth there is, and after 60 days of taking it, I have only had about an inch of growth. I see better results when taking10000 mcg of biotin daily!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m halfway into my 2nd bottle. Started taking 2 a day on Dec. 20, 2013. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t see anything other than normal hair growth. I am able to tell because I color my hair and can actually see how much has grown from the root color. While in Paris last Sept. I fried my straight iron and my hair as well. Got most of the damaged hair cut off. I was hoping to speed up hair growth with this. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> HAVE NOTICE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN GROWTH FOR MY DAUGHTER SINCE SHE STARTED TAKING THEM.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this even works</li>
    <li> Loved the products...</li>
    <li> My hair grew over an inch in one month. No lie!!</li>
    <li> These have worked pretty well for me, I got my hair cut short to get rid of dead ends and it was a lot shorter in the end than I would have liked. Because my hair normally grows at a very slow rate, I bought the 3 month package of these hair growth pills after seeing an ad in a magazine for them and upon reading many good reviews for them, hoping to speed up the growth process. My hair grew a noticeable amount within those few months so I ordered my next 3 months to try to continue the effects and achieve longer hair again. I would say it has grown roughly 4 inches within the 4 months I&#x27;ve been using this supplement, so an inch per month, which is great compared to the quarter inch per month I was getting before. Some other helpful things have been not using any heat on my hair, especially the ends, and making sure to use conditioning products. I have also been using scalp stimulating products which seem to help too. I also appreciate this supplement because it is easy, convenient, and discrete to use. I haven&#x27;t been 100% at keeping up with taking them twice daily so I think the results may be even better if I was more consistent in using them. Definitely above my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I bought because where I moved has really hard water and it was taking a toll on my hair. I have been taking it about 2 months and have noticed some growth, but more importantly my hair is a lot healthier. Also, I have always had great nails, they are even stronger. I clipped them the other day and it was almost hard to do they were so hard. I will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> It works very well! I&#x27;ve been trying different theories such as the inversion method and oils along with these multivitamins, and the results were amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;My nails looked amazing, but then I ran out and hadn&#x27;t ordered any. So my nails have a DEEP indent at the base, due to the change in nutrient levels.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m very happy with the results. My hair grew three inches within the first few weeks!</li>
    <li> This is a great product I love it like so so so  much better than Hairfinity Better than just taking biotin I&#x27;m ebony by the way so this is my second order and I&#x27;ve been taking intense hair growth for like a week now and I&#x27;ve noticed growth in my hair nails and my belly has toned up a bit more since taking these supplements I&#x27;m 21 so this doesn&#x27;t mean this will work for you Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s different But the supplement did work really well for me&lt;br /&gt;Ps; I bought mine off of eBay and it makes your hair really intchy</li>
    <li> Bought his for my wife, and honestly it didn&#x27;t work at all. It was a disappointment to say the least.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two months and nothing! My hair does grow fast, but, I wanted it to grow much faster. I am getting the same results as if I was taking nothing! Ultra Hair actually made my hair grow faster. I will be going back to that. Very dissappointed with this product! Maybe that is why you can get three bottles for $24.00!</li>
    <li> My hair has filled in patches and grown, and is still growing,  it really works.</li>
    <li> Started taking these because I was losing my hair. The pills helped save a lot, and also made my hair grow longer. I&#x27;ve been taking the pills for only a month</li>
    <li> It took a year and two months for me to see result in my hair and it&#x27;s still not longer as I won&#x27;t and a hold lot of white flakes all over my head and clothes.</li>
    <li> I have not had any growth at all and I am on my 2ed bottle and I also take 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening would not order them again :(</li>
    <li> The vitamins do help with growth,  but I have thinning on my crown part that has grown but not to the point where it has thicken as much.</li>
    <li> It really does work! I have been lacking the discipline in taking them twice a day, but my hair has grown within a month of taking them once a day.</li>
    <li> seriously, am still waiting. i have used these pills for a little over a month. am not seeing any difference.</li>
    <li> many comments on how long my hair has gotten....</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a while ..I stopped for a couple of months and I just remembered how fast my hair and nails grows even only after taking it for a week</li>
    <li> I read positive feedback on this product so I  decided to take a chance and I am on my third bottle . I am starting to see growth and my hair is fuller . I already ordered another 3 pack. My hair growth length goal is mid back length.  I think you have to be patient and follow the directions as well as eating right and exercise not to mention drinking a lot of water.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any change in my hair yet. I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> I have finished the first bottle and my hair has grown, I definitely see a difference. I would reccomend these hair vitamins to anyone who wants to grow their hair long.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical, but I thought it was worth a shot.  I am a woman of color, and I have been wearing my hair completely natural for about a year now (before then, I used texturizers).  I knew my hair wouldn&#x27;t grow overnight, but still wanted a boost to get my hair going (my hair was right at shoulder length, but I wanted it a little longer).  I must say that I have been pleasantly surprised with this product.  It says to give 45 days for the product to kick in, but I&#x27;m already receiving results, and I&#x27;m only on my third week of taking it.  I had to cut of lot of my hair recently because of damage, but, my hair is almost back to it&#x27;s original length IN UNDER 3 WEEKS!!!!.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I think that if you take the supplement as presribed, drink plenty of water, and learn how to really take care of your hair, the results will be outstanding.... they have been for me!!</li>
    <li> great bang for the buck</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a returning customer and I love this product!</li>
    <li> i cant tell if these pills really work. i use these pill with another hair pills and i cant tell which ones are doing good with my hairs.</li>
    <li> I do not see gray hair growing in as fast on this supplement!  Is it because of this product?  Weird.  It&#x27;s been four weeks since I colored my hair...and no gray!!  I take only one per day.</li>
    <li> I JUST OPENED MY THIRD BOTTLE I HAVE GOT 4 1/2 INCHES OF NEW HAIR GROWTH . I DO TAKE 2000 OF BIOTIN PILLS WITH IT BUT DIDNT START THAT UNTIL  NOW ON MY 3RD BOTTLE. INTENSE GROW MADE MY HAIR GROW REALLY FAST. FOR YEARS IT STAYED AT THE SAME LENGHT. I WANT LONG HAIR AND THIS IS THE BEST. IT DYED MY HAIR FOR OVER 25 YEARS AND GOT REALLY BAD HAIR IT KEPT FALLING OUT EVERYWHERE SO I DECIDED TO GIVE THIS A TRY. I DONT HAVE HAIR FALLING OUT ANYMORE AND HAIR IS GROWING LIKE CRAZY...... COUPLE MORE INCHES TO HAVE MY HAIR TO MY BUTT YAY :) I DO TAKE MULTIVITAMS , D3, BIOTIN AND INTENSE GROW ALL AT ONCE. I BOUGHT THESE FROM THERE WEBSITE. GOING TO BE ORDERING MORE :) NOTICED ITS THE SAME PRICE ON HERE AND THERE. YOU GOT TO REMEMBER EVERYBODYS BODY IS DIFFERENT IF IT DONT WORK FOR YOU I HEARD JUST TAKING BIOTIN 5000 A DAY WILL MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW SO GOOD LUCK :)</li>
    <li> This product got to me so fast!! I was so happy. It was exactly what I wanted and I wasn&#x27;t let down.</li>
    <li> I have just started my first  bottle so but taken every day</li>
    <li> Even before I finished one bottle of Intense Grow hair vitamins, I noticed my hair was growing faster than I can ever remember.  I have finished about 4 bottles and can wear my hair in totally different styles.  My hair had been getting thinner each year because I take a lot of medications.  All my thin spots have filled in and my hair is very healthy and strong.  Thank you so much for this wonderful product.  I feel more attractive, and someone tells me almost every day how pretty my hair is. Intense Grow is truly amazing and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m halfway through my second bottle and I can definitely tell it&#x27;s helping. Before I began using these I colored my hair and I now have over an inch of regrowth. My hair grows very slow and even biotin hardly helps. I&#x27;m super glad I tried this out. Can&#x27;t wait to finish all the pills.</li>
    <li> I found with this product my hair is actually starting to grow back.I&#x27;ve used several products before but none worked as well as this one.</li>
    <li> Its not helping my hair grow. It is growing at the same pace as it was on normal vitamins.  So not impressed!</li>
    <li> I keep ordering and will continue to order this product! It has done amazing things for my hair, it&#x27;s longer, thicker and fuller. I picked up a scalp fungus from a hairdresser I went to and it left me with a tennis ball sized patch. I started using this after nothing else would work and now my patch is almost completely covered with thick full shiny hair.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to grow your hair longer, and faster, look no further.These vitamins work wonders!!! Back in November &#x27;12, my hair was 1&#x27;&#x27; past my shoulders. Now, 3 months later, it is up to mid-chest! I am looking forward to seeing more and more results, as well as my next purchase ^^</li>
    <li> If you take these please make sure you are not taking a bunch of other vitamins along with this. If you start taking these and quit abruptly,you will reverse the progress and may go into a manic shedding stage. Read about niacin before taking. I had a adverse reaction and have lost 50% of my hair and it is still shedding like crazy. If you want your hair to grow fast,take biotin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Intense Grow Hair Vitamin for 2 months and it works! It includes almost all of the vitamins and nutrients your body needs to grow hair quickly, and I can say with regular use, my hair grows twice as fast with the help of this vitamin supplement. Intense Grow Hair Vitamin is a powerful combination of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, which are commonly used to promote hair growth and health. This hair growth vitamin formula is not only proven to grow my hair quickly, but it also grows stronger, more resilient and helps prevent subsequent hair loss than it would without the supplement.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, Intense Grow Hair vitamin revitalizes the hair growth pattern within a short period of time and more importantly without causing any complications or various side effects. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Starting tomorrow!! If I finish all bottles with no results I will be writing another review.</li>
    <li> I think I do  see some results, although I just finished my first bottle.  I really need hair on top and both sides.  My hair is full of life and crackles when brush it and I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> If you want amazing results, you should try this product!  It works!</li>
    <li> I just started about a week ago but it is making my hair look healthier already but not seeing growth yet but it&#x27;s a good product so far</li>
    <li> Just placed my second order.  It is important to take two vitamins a day.  My hair growth and my nail thickness are impressive.  I had given up with my thinning hair.  I ordered my first order in January 2015.  I was slow to take two vitamins instead of one.  I can really see the difference in growth.  I highly recommend.  The biggest surprise was the hair on my legs growing so fast.</li>
    <li> Has anyone experienced a bit of hair loss after taking this product? I have not seen much shedding, however my hair just FEELS thinner, lighter and drier. I am currently taking a women&#x27;s multivitamin as well as prenatal vitamins sporadically as I find it useful for skin improvement, but I&#x27;m wondering if this is perhaps what is affecting my hair.  Does anyone have any insight or similar experience?</li>
    <li> not Working at all, i wasted my money, if i can get it back, i would like to have it.....</li>
    <li> This product really really works.</li>
