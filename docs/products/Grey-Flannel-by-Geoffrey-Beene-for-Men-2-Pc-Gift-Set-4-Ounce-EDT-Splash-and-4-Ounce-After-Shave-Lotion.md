      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Boyfriend likes the scent I LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>Happy to find this item still available.</li>
      <li>It was popular about a generation ago.  </li>
      <li>I have not seen it in retail stores, so I am very glad to be able to find it on amazon.  </li>
      <li>I also love the smell too.</li>
      <li>My favorite for years</li>
      <li>AND THE COLONGE, AFTER BETTER.</li>
      <li>but we haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
      <li>I just love to smell it.</li>
      <li>HE &amp; I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t like flowery or perfumy scents, and it seems like most are.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this Gray Flannel for around 35years</li>
      <li>Glad to find it boxed on line.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely love the scent.  </li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Should have known better than to buy unsniffed.</li>
      <li>Love the set with the aftershave as well.</li>
      <li>A nice clean scent without being over whelming.</li>
      <li>, I also enjoy the woodsy smells of oakmoss and sandalwood, but when I wear this fragrance the odor I can smell is overwhelmingly Patchouli.</li>
      <li>I have been using the after shave &amp; that is fine.....</li>
      <li>It has a nice clean and crisp sent.</li>
      <li>is a powerful manly scent - the most powerful notes being violet and bergamot - which give it a very unique almost Parthenium-like smell.</li>
      <li>manly.&amp;#34; No one else that I know wears it, which is a plus if you&#x27;re looking for something unique, and</li>
      <li>I like the clean smell of citrus</li>
      <li>I fell that I did not get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received compliments the many times I&#x27;ve worn this - but at the same time I have been asked not to ever wear it..</li>
      <li>Definitely masculine and doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>exactly the smell</li>
      <li>This product is a personal favorite of the reviewer.  </li>
      <li>I love the stuff, this will be my second order</li>
      <li>I agree with some of the other reviews, this is a nice winter cologne.</li>
      <li>I always love the smell of Grey Flannel cologne.  </li>
      <li>The spray top on the bottle of cologne does not work--won&#x27;t even go up and down--cannot pump it &amp;  the cap will not come off--at least easily..</li>
      <li>I wasnt familiar with the fragrance prior to ordering, but reviews sounded positive.</li>
      <li>He really likes using the set.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed that amazon.com doesnt have an option retrurn because they consider it a flammable liquid.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s very inexpensive</li>
      <li>My husband really can&#x27;t smell much of anything</li>
      <li>To begin, I seem to be half the age of most reviews on here as most were apparently alive when it was initially released...</li>
      <li>this isn&#x27;t one of those colognes that could be confused for a &amp;#34;uni-sex fragrance.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;d call it &amp;#34;seductive&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sexy,&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s more of a woodsy, rustic, masculine smell</li>
      <li>It is a classic scent with high notes and should be used in moderation.</li>
      <li>However, unless it just doesn&#x27;t smell right on you, Grey Flannel is classic.</li>
      <li>bought this as an inexpensive cologne to keep in my gym bag for when I go straight from a workout to the showers to a social event.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used the Grey Flannel that comes in a clear bottle (the liquid is a light blue).</li>
      <li>Great cold weather cologne.</li>
      <li>When the person opened the package, it was clear that 1/2 of the spray bottle had spilled out.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>The clear bottle version was given to me as a gift about a year ago</li>
      <li>It will never grow old.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cologne since I was about 13 years old.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the early scents that I was given as a young teenager</li>
      <li>I went on the internet to find out the name of the maker and was surprised at the rather inexpensive cost for a name brand.  </li>
      <li>An old friend had been given a sample.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just old stock, where the ingredients just changed their composition (or decomposition?).  </li>
      <li>Maybe the fact it is rare is due to unpopularity.</li>
      <li>This stuff lasts for about 6 hours or so, goes on a little strong, mellows out after about ten minutes and dissipates over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received a couple of compliments on the sent from women of all ages (Literally all ages, a 60+ year old woman asked me about the scent at a bar and told me she wanted to buy some for her grandson...) and the general consensus is that it smells &amp;#34;so</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s another Grey Flannel spray that comes in almost the same exact bottle, has the exact same name, but the colour of the bottle is actually lighter.</li>
      <li>and I recently found the bottle with a few drops left and had to have more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m dumping it and instead bit the bullet and grabbed some Mont Blanc aftershave balm that&#x27;s double this price, but doesn&#x27;t smell like old produce.</li>
      <li>Nice scent, does dry down to smelling a little like baby powder so be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but the product being reviewed seems to be a bit \\&quot;stronger\\&quot;, which is fine with me, as I just use a little less.    </li>
      <li>Well, maybe I got a bad batch, but it came to me today smelling like vinegar and not anything remotely good.  </li>

<li> He told me Grey Flannel</li>
<li> What happened to the Grey flannel powder?</li>
<li> It lasts quite long - though I would recommend this as a winter/autumn fragrance rather than a summer one.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great value . Arrived fast and it is a scent I can wear as its very subtle. Great service.</li>
    <li> I love the stuff, this will be my second order</li>
    <li> I like this,but my Husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> An old friend had been given a sample.  I complimented him when he wore it.  He said it was too expensive to use regularly, but when I found it here for half the price, thought it would be a nice Christmas present.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a friend in Florida and asked him what it was.  He told me Grey Flannel and I absolutely love the scent.  My husband really can&#x27;t smell much of anything so I buy aftershave in scents that I like.  I went on the internet to find out the name of the maker and was surprised at the rather inexpensive cost for a name brand.  Ordering it via Amazon was great, too, as it came within days (it was a Christmas gift).  My husband alternates his aftershaves each day, but I only like the days when he is wearing Grey Flannel!!!</li>
    <li> Dont sendme the spray</li>
    <li> This product is a personal favorite of the reviewer.  It was popular about a generation ago.  I have not seen it in retail stores, so I am very glad to be able to find it on amazon.  Great price, too!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product!&lt;br /&gt;Two different products: cologne and after shave&lt;br /&gt;in a nice gift box!  Your man will love it too!</li>
    <li> This is the \\&quot;cleanest\\&quot; scent. I always get compliments .Not one of those \\&quot;Too much\\&quot; scents. What happened to the Grey flannel powder? I used it in my salon as a talc after a hair cut. Is it gone forever? Seems I&#x27;ve been looking forever. I also am not a fan of the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Grey Flannel in the turquoise bottle. The original is the Best!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> Happy to find this item still available. Shipped fast. Although I don&#x27;t think this men&#x27;s fragrance is being made anymore, the scent is great. It didn&#x27;t smell stale at all. Grab some while you can!</li>
    <li> Great smell for not a lot of money. Lasts all day and then some. Even the aftershave lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> I received the package promptly, but I could smell the product.  It was a gift for someone and so I wrapped the package and then took it with us to California.  When the person opened the package, it was clear that 1/2 of the spray bottle had spilled out.&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t want to return it so they were happy with the 1/2 bottle.  I am not... I hope that someone will immediately return a bottle when the fragrance comes through.  Had it not been sealed in plastic, I would have checked it prior to us leaving, but then this would mean that I couldn&#x27;t take the gift with me.  I fell that I did not get my money&#x27;s worth.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> very good at a great price</li>
    <li> Grey Flannel is frankly one of those hit or miss fragrances. Folks either love it or hate it. There can&#x27;t be any middle ground.&lt;br /&gt;This is a powerful manly scent - the most powerful notes being violet and bergamot - which give it a very unique almost Parthenium-like smell. It lasts quite long - though I would recommend this as a winter/autumn fragrance rather than a summer one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received compliments the many times I&#x27;ve worn this - but at the same time I have been asked not to ever wear it.. lol I still love it.</li>
    <li> I always love the smell of Grey Flannel cologne.  My husband loves that 2 containers were in the package.  I ordered it as a surprise for him.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, which they loved!  The pricing, packaging was great!  Too much of a great buy to pass up!</li>
    <li> HE LOVES THE AFTER SHAVE! AND THE COLONGE, AFTER BETTER. SINCE I FOUND IT ON LINE HE WILL ALWAYS BE BACK TO PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> This was a on the spur gift.  My husband has been using this for years but we haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
    <li> My husband said he wore this cologne back in his younger years so I found it and order it for his birthday and he was very happy. I also love the smell too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive cologne and after shave for my husband&#x27;s everyday needs.  I like the scent of Gray Flannel and isn&#x27;t that all should matter?</li>
    <li> This item is not readily available in stores.  I am delighted that Amazon has it in stock.  I love this fragrance. It will never grow old.</li>
    <li> I loved smelling this on my husband; so I thought I&#x27;d purchase it for Christmas.  Well, maybe I got a bad batch, but it came to me today smelling like vinegar and not anything remotely good.  The Amazon rep said perhaps I should keep it in my glovebox to throw at any potential attackers it&#x27;s THAT BAD.    Of course, I could&#x27;ve just received a bad batch, but I won&#x27;t order through Amazon again.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just old stock, where the ingredients just changed their composition (or decomposition?).  I&#x27;ll head to the department store, where at least I can smell it before I buy it!</li>
    <li> My favorite for years</li>
    <li> IT WAS A FATHERS DAY GIFT. HE &amp; I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> something was wrong with this bottle - lost my money - not the same as I recall</li>
    <li> One of bottle leaked, so only got about 1/4 of one bottle.</li>
    <li> The description states this fragrance was Introduced in 1976. Fragrance notes: orange, lemon, bergamot, oakmoss, sandalwood and patchouli. I bought this aftershave because I was looking for an affordable Sandalwood-ish fragrance. I like the clean smell of citrus, I also enjoy the woodsy smells of oakmoss and sandalwood, but when I wear this fragrance the odor I can smell is overwhelmingly Patchouli. If you are nostalgic for the 70s you may like it but I think it smells a bit dated...If a scent can be considered dated?? reminds me of the perfumes my mom and aunts used to wear in the 70s when I was a small fry. I also think the Patchouli makes it smell too feminine. Definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like flowery or perfumy scents, and it seems like most are.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this Gray Flannel for around 35years and my wife says it &amp;#34;smells like me.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll take that as a good thing...</li>
    <li> This is one of the early scents that I was given as a young teenager and I recently found the bottle with a few drops left and had to have more.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, does dry down to smelling a little like baby powder so be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filling this review with nonsense</li>
    <li> David Abraham makes a very good point. I&#x27;ve also used the Grey Flannel that comes in a clear bottle (the liquid is a light blue). Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but the product being reviewed seems to be a bit \\&quot;stronger\\&quot;, which is fine with me, as I just use a little less.    I&#x27;ve used Grey Flannel off and on for what must be 20 years. The clear bottle version was given to me as a gift about a year ago and I simply thought that they changed the packaging. Now it seems that there may be two versions if my nose is working properly.     It&#x27;s difficult to \\&quot;rate\\&quot; a scent as it depends very much on one&#x27;s body chemistry. However, unless it just doesn&#x27;t smell right on you, Grey Flannel is classic.</li>
    <li> The spray top on the bottle of cologne does not work--won&#x27;t even go up and down--cannot pump it &amp;  the cap will not come off--at least easily..so  I have been using the after shave &amp; that is fine.....exactly the smell I  remembered from yrs ago.</li>
    <li> To begin, I seem to be half the age of most reviews on here as most were apparently alive when it was initially released... but it has stood the test of time it would seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as an inexpensive cologne to keep in my gym bag for when I go straight from a workout to the showers to a social event. I&#x27;ve received a couple of compliments on the sent from women of all ages (Literally all ages, a 60+ year old woman asked me about the scent at a bar and told me she wanted to buy some for her grandson...) and the general consensus is that it smells &amp;#34;so manly.&amp;#34; No one else that I know wears it, which is a plus if you&#x27;re looking for something unique, and this isn&#x27;t one of those colognes that could be confused for a &amp;#34;uni-sex fragrance.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;d call it &amp;#34;seductive&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sexy,&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s more of a woodsy, rustic, masculine smell and you probably need some grit to your look/personality to pull it off. This stuff lasts for about 6 hours or so, goes on a little strong, mellows out after about ten minutes and dissipates over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a back-up scent, something a little different that&#x27;s very inexpensive, I&#x27;d recommend this to you, regardless of your age.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gray Flannel For A lot of years,Still one of my favorites. Very good not over powering and not too Flowery are sweet</li>
    <li> Kids said it smelled like lettuce. I think it smells like vegetable compost and turpentine. Maybe this is a bad batch. I wasnt familiar with the fragrance prior to ordering, but reviews sounded positive. I just wanted a clean smelling aftershave that wasnt old spice, aqua velva, or royal copenhagen, nor an expensive designer fragrance. I&#x27;m dumping it and instead bit the bullet and grabbed some Mont Blanc aftershave balm that&#x27;s double this price, but doesn&#x27;t smell like old produce. Should have known better than to buy unsniffed. Maybe this smells good to/on others. Maybe the fact it is rare is due to unpopularity.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s another Grey Flannel spray that comes in almost the same exact bottle, has the exact same name, but the colour of the bottle is actually lighter. For those who have the lighter one and like it, DO NOT pick this package up as the fragrance is way too sharp, rough, and horrible. It was so bad that I had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently they stopped making the lighter version, but you can find a few bottles still every once in a while.</li>
    <li> Great buy - smells great too!</li>
    <li> I get this for my husband. I agree with some of the other reviews, this is a nice winter cologne. Definitely masculine and doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. Love the set with the aftershave as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne since I was about 13 years old.  I love it!  I think it&#x27;s the best out there.  I just love to smell it.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend likes the scent I LOVE it!  Glad to find it boxed on line.  Great for gift giving.  Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my father for Christmas. He really likes using the set. It has a nice clean and crisp sent.</li>
    <li> Great cold weather cologne. It is a classic scent with high notes and should be used in moderation. Very long lasting.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot.  A nice clean scent without being over whelming.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast but when I opened the package I saw that the edt. has spilled out  around 1/5 of it and even melted the plastic box. I am not satisfied with the product at all. Very dissapointed that amazon.com doesnt have an option retrurn because they consider it a flammable liquid.</li>
