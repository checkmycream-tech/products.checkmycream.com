      <li>It&#x27;s a good body wash, I like old spice and</li>
      <li>Thanks for keeping this in stock Amazon!!!</li>
      <li>This is more of a packaging review, but I wanted to post here too so people can be aware.</li>
      <li>After a couple of years with him having to settle for less desirable fragrances, I was delighted to find his favorite available through Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Product is good overall.</li>
      <li>One thing I don&#x27;t like is that the scent seems to fade away really quick even though it says &amp;#34;8 Hour Scent Technology&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>The smell is the best out of all of the other old spice body washes and the scent lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I love old spice,,,,,After</li>
      <li>But for the deal amazon had these for it was a STEAL and totally worth it.</li>
      <li>My husband smells good - up close - not from the other side of the house.  </li>
      <li>Arrived super fast.  </li>
      <li>My 16 year old son uses this and goes through quickly!  </li>
      <li>I wanted to buy more than the 3 bottles that I got, but was told that I could only get 1 3-pack.  </li>
      <li>But this smell is only okay.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Love it can only find it on Amazon</li>
      <li>I very much enjoy the scent of all Aqua Reef products by Old Spice.</li>
      <li>The three body wash bottles come in one big bag, which is fine unless one of them leaks.</li>
      <li>I consistently used this product for years until I noticed three or four years ago that this particular smell was no longer being sold in stores.  </li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Its so much cheaper on amazon than in stores.  </li>
      <li>I was very surprised!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the bulk pack.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a particularly honed palette, but it is a very subtle, manly smell, without being overbearing like many of the new \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; body sprays and washes that are more likely to be used and abused by teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He usually stinks so that is good!  </li>
      <li>Smells refreshing but not overwhelmingly so.</li>
      <li>My hubby loves Old Spice!</li>
      <li>The scent is little strong but the it does not absorb into your skin to the point you smell like a perfume aisle.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent is still Swagger, but the price on this was hard to beat when it had a Coupon.</li>
      <li>Old Spice body washes are the way to go.</li>
      <li>I like the Old Spice body washes.  </li>
      <li>I hope Old Spice doesn&#x27;t discontinue this scent.  </li>
      <li>This led me to search for other hard-to-find products, with much success.</li>
      <li>If you suddenly find your favorite products missing from store shelves, try Amazon!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it seems less available in local stores.</li>
      <li>I instantly purchased the 3 pack and awaited my old smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had this line of personal hygiene products (body wash, antiperspirant, body spray) selected by an old girlfriend after several hours of standing and having her and her friend sniff every deodorant in the aisle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s a good body wash, I like old spice and the scent is pretty good. But for the deal amazon had these for it was a STEAL and totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I had this line of personal hygiene products (body wash, antiperspirant, body spray) selected by an old girlfriend after several hours of standing and having her and her friend sniff every deodorant in the aisle. I haven&#x27;t had any complaints in the last 10 years, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I consistently used this product for years until I noticed three or four years ago that this particular smell was no longer being sold in stores.  Dismayed, I grabbed a different bottle and walked out of the store none the wiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a lark last year, I decided to search Amazon and lo and behold, they have aqua reef.  I instantly purchased the 3 pack and awaited my old smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived and smelled as good as ever.  I don&#x27;t have a particularly honed palette, but it is a very subtle, manly smell, without being overbearing like many of the new \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; body sprays and washes that are more likely to be used and abused by teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do mark it down one star because it is no longer the gold standard in Old Spice body wash scents.  This is a sweeter smell than I remember, so I no longer use it exclusively.  I alternate with another scent to give me a bit of a break.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this scent the best (and so do I), but you cannot find it in the stores any more!!! You can still find this scent in the deodorant, but not the body wash.  I wanted to buy more than the 3 bottles that I got, but was told that I could only get 1 3-pack.  Love this item!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love it can only find it on Amazon thank goodness</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, it is great.  There is a problem in finding Aqua Reef scent, Amazon.com is the only place left to order it.</li>
    <li> This is my go to body wash. Cleans well and long lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves Old Spice! These smelled fantastic.</li>
    <li> I very much enjoy the scent of all Aqua Reef products by Old Spice. It&#x27;s the best smelling product line in my opinion!</li>
    <li> My son loves this scent and used this product for several years. Imagine my dismay when it suddenly disappeared from local shelves. After a couple of years with him having to settle for less desirable fragrances, I was delighted to find his favorite available through Amazon.com. This led me to search for other hard-to-find products, with much success. If you suddenly find your favorite products missing from store shelves, try Amazon!</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with the old spice scent. This particular scent is very cool and refreshing to most people.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and I like the scent.</li>
    <li> I like the Old Spice body washes.  I always get Swagger, but this time I got this because of the 3 pack and the price.  It does the trick and is almost as good as Swagger.</li>
    <li> Product is good overall. Nice fragrance. I really wish they thought of the cap and understood how painful it is to open.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative to AX Body wash and this Old Spice did the trick, it Smells Great and Rinses Off Great.</li>
    <li> One bottle has lasted me a handful of months since you don&#x27;t need to use much to get a nice lather. Smells great and it&#x27;s a nice bundle.</li>
    <li> It is so difficult to find the Aqua reef fragrance of Old Spice in stores. I was so happy to find on Amazon and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I do like the wash as it keeps my skin from drying out. The scent is little strong but the it does not absorb into your skin to the point you smell like a perfume aisle.</li>
    <li> This smells pretty good.  The pricing was a little cheaper than the store so I sprung for the 3-pack.  I tend to like ocean-smelling products so this one was a win for me.  One thing I don&#x27;t like is that the scent seems to fade away really quick even though it says &amp;#34;8 Hour Scent Technology&amp;#34;.  Old Spice body washes are the way to go.</li>
    <li> My 16 year old son uses this and goes through quickly!  It is a great deal and I love the fact that it comes in a three pack.</li>
    <li> Its so much cheaper on amazon than in stores.  The smell is the best out of all of the other old spice body washes and the scent lasts all day.</li>
    <li> My son loves this product and it was a lot cheaper here on Amazon. I bought the 3 pack set for not much more than the price of 1 bottle in a retail store.</li>
    <li> Smells great and it is cheaper than most of the products of same quality. I highly recommend the bulk pack.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best scent that there is .... unfortunately, you cannot buy this in stores anymore! Thanks for keeping this in stock Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> the best body wash i use every day #1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that Aqua Reef body spray was apparently discontined by Old Spice. I thought this body wash might smell the same as the spray but it doesn&#x27;t. Just another soapy wash.</li>
    <li> This is more of a packaging review, but I wanted to post here too so people can be aware. The three body wash bottles come in one big bag, which is fine unless one of them leaks. That was the case with my order. The inside of the bag and all three bottles were covered in body wash. Very messy and annoying having body wash everywhere and having to immediately rise everything off.</li>
    <li> I like this soap.  I use it everyday.  My wife likes the way it smells.  My son started using it as well! He usually stinks so that is good!  I hope Old Spice doesn&#x27;t discontinue this scent.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it seems less available in local stores.</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast.  Don&#x27;t use this if you don&#x27;t like women crawling over each other to tell you how awesome you smell</li>
    <li> fast shipping. Smell&#x27;s great . Manly smell!! lol</li>
    <li> great product, love the scent</li>
    <li> Great scent but not overpowering. My husband smells good - up close - not from the other side of the house.  :o)</li>
    <li> favorite scent. hard to find nowadays.</li>
    <li> Great price, good quality</li>
    <li> I love old spice,,,,,After showering with this, i smell so good and it cleans great,,,,,I hate the old fashion soap bar.</li>
    <li> I like the product, been using showtime and swagger for years... But this smell is only okay. I&#x27;m definitely going back to the other scents.</li>
    <li> I like this liquid soap because it leaves my skin clean and with a pleasant aroma, plus I feel clean and confident ...</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. It&#x27;s getting harder to find it on the store shelves, so I was ecstatic when I found it online. I can only tell you what I&#x27;ve been told... The ladies... They like it! Enough said.</li>
    <li> We can no longer find this product in stores.  It comes it packs of 3 and I purchased 4 containers.  It seemed a bit expensive at $20 for 3 when it&#x27;s $4 in the store, but glad to have found it.  I was very surprised!</li>
    <li> i like to smell good do you? there is your answer buy this</li>
    <li> Bought it hoping it would smell like the deodorant, and it met my expectations. Smells refreshing but not overwhelmingly so.</li>
    <li> Really good shower gel can&#x27;t complain does the job well I purchased these because the ones at the store are little bit more expensive so I&#x27;m glad with my purchase</li>
    <li> Great Scent!!! definetely would buy it again.... However a pack of 3 may be a lot! ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great price for being 3 products</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s body wash, not much to review here. As long as my fiancee loves the scent I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, quick delivery!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent is still Swagger, but the price on this was hard to beat when it had a Coupon. I like this line of body wash. I like how it makes me smell.</li>
