    <li> I really like this spray.  I only gave it 4 stars because this color is very black and not brown at all.

    <li> Great gray hair coverage. Blend well. no smell to it</li>
    <li> Happy with color and results.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I definitely get more time in between hair appointments. I am naturally dark blonde and when my roots start to come in it looks like I&#x27;m going bald! My only wish is that they would come out with a true black, not just a black/brown so it wouldn&#x27;t look like I have roots at all. But this definitely helps my roots not be nearly as noticeable.</li>
    <li> This product is great for in between hair appts. As others have said its brown though, not black.</li>
    <li> Hate having to get my hair colored but the root grow out always necessitated heading back into the salon.  This spray is so easy to use and a couple quick sprays to my roots and I&#x27;m good to go.  Can&#x27;t tell at all that it is spray on color and lasts until you shampoo it out.  Not permanent so no harm to your hair.</li>
    <li> Covered gray nicely without changing the hair texture like other products</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Does a great job hiding grays in my part. I have very dark brown hair which looks black. Easy to rub it off skin if you do it immediately. I use the black/dark brown color. It extends my color appt for a week or more.</li>
