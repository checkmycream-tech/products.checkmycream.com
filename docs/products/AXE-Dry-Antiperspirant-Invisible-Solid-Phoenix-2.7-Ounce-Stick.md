      <li>The guys in the house just love opening the linen closet door and finding a good stock of their tried-n-true favorite.</li>
      <li>been sing this brand for years and nice to be able to buy in bulk</li>
      <li>Smells good and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>It can be found on sale for a better price but</li>
      <li>, I tend to work with my shirt on most of the time.</li>
      <li>I wear dress shirts most days</li>
      <li>I have this on a subscription order. :)</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I like AXE deodorant products, they are OK.</li>
      <li>Deodorant/antiperspirant is more than just how you smell.  </li>
      <li>It works well and smells better.  </li>
      <li>It does a pretty good job for a day.</li>
      <li>It arrived just fine, and all three sticks come packaged</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the scent of axe deodorants more than any others, but they also scare me as I&#x27;m getting near the end of a cartridge.  </li>
      <li>Has a light powder smell that lasts all day</li>
      <li>This is a great smelling axe and last all day.</li>
      <li>The phoenix scent is as fantastic as ever.</li>
      <li>Not only that it smells GREAT.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call this antiperspirant an &amp;#34;invisible solid&amp;#34; because, like another reviewer mentioned, the deoderant can still be seen most of the time.  </li>
      <li>Pheonix has a light powder smell to it and it lasts throughout the day, what is odd about this deodorant is that the more you sweat the stronger the powder smell becomes, but it is a lot better than smelling your own foul body odor</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Axe Phoenix and it really works for my hubby.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved Axe dry since it originally came out.</li>
      <li>While I like the smell of this (clean, fresh scent), I also like the fact that it is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>shirtless, lucky for me</li>
      <li>It fades into the background quite quickly and throughout the day you do not smell like you just came from the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>the best i ever had a chance to smell last long and is just like</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really popular deodorant, shampoo among teen boys right now.</li>
      <li>Most important for me is that it keeps me dry all day.  </li>
      <li>Once my son uses it he smells nice and it keeps him dry.</li>
      <li>What I especially love is that it doesn&#x27;t leave yellow stain on white t-shirts as my last deodorant did (the reason I switched).</li>
      <li>It also go on clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have gotten some positive comments on my smell from females.</li>
      <li>I sweat pretty easily and Axe keeps me dry.</li>
      <li>I also really like the matching Axe Phoenix shower gel.  </li>
      <li>put it on before I shave and by the time I am ready to get dressed is has \\&quot;dried\\&quot; and does not get on my shirt while getting dressed.  </li>
      <li>You do have to be careful, though, because like the shower gel, it does have a strong smell.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that Amazon stocks it, and buying it in bulk packs saves me a few dollars.</li>
      <li>I like it better than typical deodorant like Old Slice.</li>
      <li>This product is very dry and really dries out your underarm, so much so that when taking a shower you really need to scrub it to get soap on the area.</li>
      <li>Exactly the same product you would get in the store.</li>
      <li>There are other products like Certain Dri which are more serious but pretty much an irritant.    </li>
      <li>Contains aluminum, if you are looking for a natural deodorant product this is not for you</li>
      <li>I mentioned to my son that he should stop using AXE because he has sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I did some research on the web and found out from the Silent Spring organization that AXE is made by Unilever and is a real toxic soup of chemicals.</li>
      <li>They are all half full.</li>
      <li>The reason is that the vast majority of them have that classic deodorant smell that just signals to others that you have a sweaty underarm problem.    </li>
      <li>This particular antiperspirant is milky white and not invisible as the description claims.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than that minor complaint, this is a pretty decent antiperspirant (even if I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell).</li>
      <li>And with enough fragrances to make your head spin, find the one that is least obnoxiously fitting for your taste.</li>
      <li>and I get no wet spots under the arms and this product does not stain the underarms of my shirts.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Invariably I end up nearly scraping my armpit with the cartridge because as it gets near empty the remaining deodorant falls out</li>

<li> Highly recommended, lasts all day under heavy working conditions.</li>
<li> I purchased the AXE Dry Antiperspirant Invisible Solid Phoenix 2.7Ounce Sticks (Pack of 4sticks)  in an effort to save some money.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used the same product before, however, the one I got delivered by Amazon wasn&#x27;t quite what I had expected.</li>
<li> My son got a sudden, strange, blotchy but not itchy rash all over his body the other night.  </li>
<li> maybe colorize the last half inch or so of the product.</li>
<li> The wet version though was bothering my skin, so I try and apply one layer of each which seems to work well.</li>
<li> and I sometimes pull an empty stick across my arm.</li>
<li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> only complaint I have is that when I get to the end, often the product actually falls off in chunks and makes a mess.  </li>
<li> It leaves white substance under arms after applying unlike the ones what I have used in the past.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarm the way other deodorants do.</li>
<li> As is the case with past experience, when the product is white it isnt going to be invisible.</li>
<li> usually i the blue one but this</li>
<li> Sounds weird, but I have spent way too much time sniffing deodorants/antiperspirants at drugstores.  </li>
<li> I am not widely familiar with other antiperspirants, but this one has been working well for me, so I am sticking with it.  </li>
<li> While I usually prefer other smells, this one still does the job.  </li>
<li> Listen, if there is one thing I would never be caught dead with it&#x27;s stained underpants or underarms.</li>
<li> I do not enjoy hanging out at the drug store.</li>
<li> Unfortunately advertised invisible, but it&#x27;s actually white...</li>
<li> When I say everyday, I also mean that it is not the strongest.  </li>
<li> I bought it from my vendor because it was much less expensive.</li>
<li> Where I live it is difficult (actually, impossible) to buy Axe deodorant.</li>
<li> Leaves disgusting white residue under armpits and on clothes.</li>
<li> What a rip-off!</li>
<li> It can cause violent coughing, skin rashes and worse.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> As is the case with past experience, when the product is white it isnt going to be invisible. it still can leave marks. Id get one that is see through, those are the ones that dont leave spots</li>
    <li> This is the only type of deodorant my husband will use. It works well and he smells great all day!</li>
    <li> You can obviously try this out at your local Target or Walgreens.  It works well and smells better.  I bought it from my vendor because it was much less expensive.</li>
    <li> great price.. easy to reorder. cheaper than Walmart</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the scent of axe deodorants more than any others, but they also scare me as I&#x27;m getting near the end of a cartridge.  Invariably I end up nearly scraping my armpit with the cartridge because as it gets near empty the remaining deodorant falls out and I sometimes pull an empty stick across my arm.</li>
    <li> Sounds weird, but I have spent way too much time sniffing deodorants/antiperspirants at drugstores.  The reason is that the vast majority of them have that classic deodorant smell that just signals to others that you have a sweaty underarm problem.    AXE Phoenix has an awesome, musky, manly smell without any of that classic deodorant smell.  You do have to be careful, though, because like the shower gel, it does have a strong smell.  Think of it as concentrated -- a little goes a long way.  I find it is a great \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; antiperspirant when used lightly.  If you have a forest of hair and cake on 1/4 of a stick, then yes, you will probably reek for a mile.  In that case, you may also wish to take a look at the Philips Multigroom Pro (not Bodygroom which is junk).  When I say everyday, I also mean that it is not the strongest.  There are other products like Certain Dri which are more serious but pretty much an irritant.    Axe Phoenix works great when used lightly.  I also really like the matching Axe Phoenix shower gel.  I also do have the Dove Men + Care unscented antiperspirant for when I don&#x27;t want any scent, but don&#x27;t buy the Dove&#x27;s scented ones as they smell like baby diapers.</li>
    <li> does what its made for</li>
    <li> Deodorant/antiperspirant is more than just how you smell.  While I like the smell of this (clean, fresh scent), I also like the fact that it is not overpowering.  It fades into the background quite quickly and throughout the day you do not smell like you just came from the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on before I shave and by the time I am ready to get dressed is has \\&quot;dried\\&quot; and does not get on my shirt while getting dressed.  Most important for me is that it keeps me dry all day.  I wear dress shirts most days and I get no wet spots under the arms and this product does not stain the underarms of my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price on Amazon is good.  It can be found on sale for a better price but the convenience of having it delivered to your door is great.  I do not enjoy hanging out at the drug store.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years and the best thing about getting it through Amazon is that I can subscribe to it and have 4 of them delivered every 3 months.  Loving not having to remember to go out and buy it.</li>
    <li> Always loved this product, it&#x27;s always worked for me. If you want a scratch and sniff, go to a store. I have this on a subscription order. :)</li>
    <li> Thought it was a good deal.  It says 12 in the summary and that is what I thought I bought.  I feel lied to and pissed!</li>
    <li> I like AXE deodorant products, they are OK. Their deodorant definitely works, it lasts all day for me whether I am at the office or at the gym. Pheonix has a light powder smell to it and it lasts throughout the day, what is odd about this deodorant is that the more you sweat the stronger the powder smell becomes, but it is a lot better than smelling your own foul body odor smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Has a light powder smell that lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;- Works great whether you are at the gym or at the office&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Contains aluminum, if you are looking for a natural deodorant product this is not for you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country of Origin: USA</li>
    <li> Great Value! I love the smell of Axe Phoenix and it really works for my hubby. So we&#x27;re both happy.   Thank you Axe and Amazon!    Jackie</li>
    <li> My son got a sudden, strange, blotchy but not itchy rash all over his body the other night.  I had just listened to a  discussion on NPR about the toxic chemicals used to make fragranced products.  I mentioned to my son that he should stop using AXE because he has sensitive skin.  He kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the rash went away during the day.  That night, Nate took a shower and then put on AXE.  He immediately got the red, blotchy rash again.  He realized it was the AXE deodorant he uses that was causing the rash and we tossed it all out.  I did some research on the web and found out from the Silent Spring organization that AXE is made by Unilever and is a real toxic soup of chemicals. It can cause violent coughing, skin rashes and worse.  It&#x27;s suspected to be carcinogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let your sons, husbands, friends know that they should toss this stuff if they use it, and to let their friends know about it, too.  It&#x27;s a really popular deodorant, shampoo among teen boys right now.</li>
    <li> Where I live it is difficult (actually, impossible) to buy Axe deodorant. I&#x27;m glad that Amazon stocks it, and buying it in bulk packs saves me a few dollars. It arrived just fine, and all three sticks come packaged together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish I could get a variety pack of scents.</li>
    <li> bought that for my boyfriend and he always use this, it smells really good and I am gonna keep buying that</li>
    <li> I purchased the AXE Dry Antiperspirant Invisible Solid Phoenix 2.7Ounce Sticks (Pack of 4sticks)  in an effort to save some money.&lt;br /&gt;It worked!</li>
    <li> the best i ever had a chance to smell last long and is just like wearing cologne definetely recomend</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite deodorant. Works just as it should and also smells great. What I especially love is that it doesn&#x27;t leave yellow stain on white t-shirts as my last deodorant did (the reason I switched). It also go on clear and smooth. no clumps.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what to say... It&#x27;s antiperspirant. I have gotten some positive comments on my smell from females. Not like the commercials but it&#x27;s something.</li>
    <li> Came on time ,,excellent product excellent value I buy it repeatedly</li>
    <li> They are all half full. What a rip-off!</li>
    <li> Leaves disgusting white residue under armpits and on clothes. Stick with non-dry \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; version.</li>
    <li> It AXEs perspiration!</li>
    <li> Great product. Once my son uses it he smells nice and it keeps him dry.</li>
    <li> arrived broken (on all four, you would twist the bottom and a clicking sound would occur, but the stick would not advance).</li>
    <li> Exactly the same product you would get in the store. Smells great, works great. Comes wrapped in two packs of two.</li>
    <li> While I usually prefer other smells, this one still does the job.  I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call this antiperspirant an &amp;#34;invisible solid&amp;#34; because, like another reviewer mentioned, the deoderant can still be seen most of the time.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear this if I was going to be going shirtless, lucky for me, I tend to work with my shirt on most of the time. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that minor complaint, this is a pretty decent antiperspirant (even if I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell).</li>
    <li> Listen, if there is one thing I would never be caught dead with it&#x27;s stained underpants or underarms. If you are just as anti-pitstains as I am, you can definitely trust your pores to Axe. The branding is for tools, no doubt, but you cannot knock the effectiveness of the product. And with enough fragrances to make your head spin, find the one that is least obnoxiously fitting for your taste. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last several years.  I am not widely familiar with other antiperspirants, but this one has been working well for me, so I am sticking with it.  I always get the \\&quot;Phoenix\\&quot; scent, which a couple of times, strangely, I&#x27;ve actually been complemented on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that when I get to the end, often the product actually falls off in chunks and makes a mess.  I would like some some way of knowing when I&#x27;ve reached the end-- maybe colorize the last half inch or so of the product.</li>
    <li> I have used the same product before, however, the one I got delivered by Amazon wasn&#x27;t quite what I had expected. This particular antiperspirant is milky white and not invisible as the description claims. It leaves white substance under arms after applying unlike the ones what I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Smells good and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> been sing this brand for years and nice to be able to buy in bulk</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling axe and last all day. Bough it on Amazon because of the deal. Would reccommend this smell to anyone who likes AXE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Axe dry since it originally came out. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarm the way other deodorants do. The phoenix scent is as fantastic as ever. Highly recommended, lasts all day under heavy working conditions.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this item through Subscribe &amp; Save for over a year.  The guys in the house just love opening the linen closet door and finding a good stock of their tried-n-true favorite.</li>
    <li> I sweat pretty easily and Axe keeps me dry. Not only that it smells GREAT. Phoenix is my favorite scent but all of the Axe products do a great job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good antiperspirant. I like it better than typical deodorant like Old Slice. It does a pretty good job for a day.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Unfortunately advertised invisible, but it&#x27;s actually white...</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. Good deodorant.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years and I love it, just this time I order a wrong one usually i the blue one but this ok&lt;br /&gt;for now</li>
    <li> This product is very dry and really dries out your underarm, so much so that when taking a shower you really need to scrub it to get soap on the area. The wet version though was bothering my skin, so I try and apply one layer of each which seems to work well.</li>
