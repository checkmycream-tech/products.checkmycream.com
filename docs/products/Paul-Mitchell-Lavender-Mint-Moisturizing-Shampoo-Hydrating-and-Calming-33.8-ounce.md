      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier to find my favorite moisturizing shampoo in a pump dispenser.  </li>

      <li>Just OK.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping that the scent would be a bit more calming.  </li>

      <li>we love this shampool.  </li>
      <li>What more could you ask for in a shampoo?</li>
      <li>Even though they taped the top it had leaked all in the box.</li>
      <li>What more is there to say I do think it&#x27;s more of a guy smell</li>
      <li>I think it would have been better if they would have just wrapped the bottle.</li>
      <li>Love the shampoo though.</li>
      <li>If you love lavender, THIS is the shampoo for you.  </li>
      <li>more to that, it&#x27;s not always that you can find a quantity of this size in a salon as the price point would be</li>
      <li>and I love the feel...</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>I love the smell, the effects, etc.  </li>
      <li>But, I still love it.</li>

      <li>Still, the quality is far superior to cheap shampoo because of how nice it leaves the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, the lavender stood out more, but I am happy with the product because it not only keeps my head feeling clean, but it smells so good!!</li>
      <li>The 33.8-ounce size is very economical, and the pump makes it easy to use.</li>
      <li>Have several grandchildren and great grandchildren using it for that reason.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, it really actually does a great job at moisturizing my hair.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Thought I would try this, last time I bought the Paum Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo (which is great).  </li>
      <li>one feels with the original tea tree shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo clears that up immediately and keeps my hair moisturized and clean.  </li>
      <li>nice product - have been able to cut back on conditioner</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells nice and keeps my scalp clear!</li>

      <li>Good thing it came in massive quantity.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo is divine!  Such a treat smelling this in the shower.  It makes you feel more awake and energized!  Plus it makes hair feel so soft!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year.  It is difficult to find the large size bottle in stores.  I was happy to find this size available online.  The price was right, the service was quick and efficient.  I will definitely order this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> The pump for the bottle was broken, won&#x27;t pump at all, so needing to improvise.  I love the product though!!</li>
    <li> We have used this product for two years. We love that earthy mint coolness on our scalps.</li>
    <li> I usually use paul mitchell tea tree shampoo (original) for my dry scalp and because I love the tingling feeling.  When I saw this product, I thought, \\&quot;moisture is good for dry scalp, plus I can smell lavender AND have tingling? Yes please!\\&quot;  However, I was very disappointed in the product.  I used almost all of it, but the whole time I had a flaky scalp and there was NO TINGLING, minty sensation one feels with the original tea tree shampoo.  I am very disappointed and have already gone back to my usual.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizing shampoo, it&#x27;s everything I was looking for!!!!  Leaves my hair soft, shiny and smelling great. Will definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Received broken. Seller would not respond to my e-mails. Amazon refunded my money minus shipping. I protested the non refund of S&amp;H and Amazon gave me a credit for future purchase.</li>
    <li> Hairdresser recommended for my daughter with sensitive skin. We had tried everything and this product is wonderful! Has improved scalp condition and hair texture! Love the scent! A little goes a long way! Love the pump!</li>
    <li> I do like the smell of this. Ok So I&#x27;m bald but I still use it as a body wash. What more is there to say I do think it&#x27;s more of a guy smell but that sort of thing is very subjective. regardless it is a quality product. I&#x27;d give it five stars if the price was less it is somewhat over priced.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this so, I ordered it online and am very pleased - love the scent/</li>
    <li> I received my order of Paul Mitchell Lavender Mint Moisturizing Shampoo in a timely way.  However, a lot of shampoo leaked in the shipment.  The box fell apart since it was so soaked through.  The top of the bottle was taped up which makes me wonder whether they shipped the product knowing it was broken and would leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is totally broken.  Which really sucks since it is such a big bottle of shampoo.  A broken pump will be a daily inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent in a complaint, and I was advised I would receive a new pump and they \\&quot;will process a particular refund\\&quot; to my order.  It has been 10 days, and still no pump or \\&quot;particular refund\\&quot;.  Seeing that I paid almost 9 bucks for shipping, and it arrived damaged, I feel like I got completely jipped. I will not buy from vendor Beauty Unlimited again.</li>
    <li> it took a long time to get here and it was leaking when it arrived and all over the insid eof box. Good thing it came in massive quantity.</li>
    <li> I have used tea tree oil shampoos for some time.  I love them as shampoos, but also the fact that I am told head lice do NOT love it.  Have several grandchildren and great grandchildren using it for that reason.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I thought it would be mintier (to help with the hot weather), but it had a very subtle mint fragrance. Overall, the lavender stood out more, but I am happy with the product because it not only keeps my head feeling clean, but it smells so good!!</li>
    <li> The product I received might have been opened before. The screw top has tape around it. Also shampoo was all over the plastic bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a good shampoo that helped with dry itchy scalp. The lavender mix with this shampoo makes all the difference. I highly recommend this product if you have a dry scalp!</li>
    <li> My husband and I were very excited to try this new shampoo because we&#x27;re fans of mint and the reviews were so good. To be honest the smell was a bit weird at first. It was kind of bitter herby like chinese medicine. As we continued to use it, we stopped noticing or thinking the smell was weird. I still notice it after I let my hair down from a bun and all I smell is chinese medicine in my face. Anyway, it really actually does a great job at moisturizing my hair. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed its smoother, shinier and softer than it usually is. My husband&#x27;s stiff locks are now soft also.</li>
    <li> Just OK.  I was hoping that the scent would be a bit more calming.  Ended up being too complex of a smell and did not bring out the Lavender like I thought it might.  Going to stick to their other scents.</li>
    <li> Love it. Went through dozens of shampoos over the years but have been using this one exclusively for the past 3.</li>
    <li> I have used Paul Mitchell in the past and loved it. This particular shampoo smells like dog shampoo and leaves a film on my hair that is sticky to the touch once dry. Not what I was after at all.</li>
    <li> Even though they taped the top it had leaked all in the box. It was kind of a mess. Then the bottle had tape glue all over it. I think it would have been better if they would have just wrapped the bottle. Love the shampoo though.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! It really helps keep my scalp clean and moisturizes my hair. Love the smell too!! Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> My beard sucks this stuff up. Nice smell and certainly a nice beard feel for hours after.</li>
    <li> Love the scent the shampoo is in a easy to use bottle with plunger which makes it eady to get to eith one gane</li>
    <li> Have seen an improvement in my hair.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> not a good shampoo at all - does nothing for your hair</li>
    <li> This started drying out my hair really bad after about a month.  I had to use a repair kit for a few weeks to get my hair back to normal and then switched back to my usual Aveda shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of this shampoo. I have long wavy hair that can get oily near the roots and dry towards the tips.  This shampoo felt like it dried my hair out in general.  If I mixed it with Joico moisture shampoo it worked relatively well (2-3 pumps each).  The aroma wasnt bad, not my favorite, but not too bad.  I wish it had a stronger mint fragrance to it.</li>
    <li> I used  Remede actif shampoo at a hotel and it was awesome. Limited access on line though there are a couple options for the shampoo and conditioner together. I went searching for something similar and PML had the most positive ratings. Unfortunately, to me, the smell is less lavender and mint and more on par with the smell of Lestoil. It&#x27;s very thick too so transferring to a smaller bottle for get aways is tougher. I&#x27;ll use it until finished because I bought it but will try something different next. If anyone knows of remede and where I can purchase a larger size bottle or an equivalent please let me know!</li>
    <li> We love the tea tree special and like this better than  so many other products on the market even without a complex ad campaign</li>
    <li> I have very little hair but this moisturizers scalp well.</li>
    <li> If you are suffering from dry hair and you need to moisture it, I highly recommend this shampoo. It&#x27;s smells great and after using it for a mouth you can tell that you hair is much healthier. I don&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner anymore.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is fair to good at cleaning hair and scalp. If oily conditions are present, will only clean partially, maybe need a second application. Otherwise product is good for average hair/ scalp types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this shampoo, but it&#x27;s expensive and hard to find, so when I found it here on Amazon in a larger size I was happy.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier to find my favorite moisturizing shampoo in a pump dispenser.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Interestingly enough, this product is of the same quality at a better price than what you would pay at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;Even more to that, it&#x27;s not always that you can find a quantity of this size in a salon as the price point would be quite high.&lt;br /&gt;One thing to watch out for is it did not come with a pump, so if you have one from a previous bottle then save it, otherwise you&#x27;ll have to buy one.</li>
    <li> we love this shampool.  it smells really, really, good.  and it works really well to give your hair that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; look that makes you so attractive to the people you are attracted to.  use this shampoo, and your chances of getting lucky will go up by 3 points.</li>
    <li> This product has put my psoriasis in a halt and my hair looks great. Thank you Paul Mitchell for thinking of us with Psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and it&#x27;s always been great for my hair. At first I thought the price was a tad bit too high, and then after realizing how long the shampoo last I was ok with buying it.</li>
    <li> So worth the price. I have really bad psoriasis on my scalp and I use this every over day. This had helped clear it up .</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been a godsend!  I went to the salon the other day to get a haircut and my stylist was out of the Tea Tree Shampoo so instead she told me about this new shampoo from Paul Mitchell.  It has a great fragrance and it tingles as well.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much it has helped with my dandruff and dry scalp.  And I have tried so many shampoos in the past that never worked.  But this one is great! And supposedly the tea tree oil and lavender oil in this product helps with dandruff.  And it makes your hair so soft as well.  My head hardly itches now.  Thanks Paul Mitchell!  What a great product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is at a larger quantity for a cheaper price than what it costs to buy at my salon. I already loved this shampoo, so the large quantity will hold me over for a while.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo every day, and my hair is always moisturized and shiny, never dry looking. The 33.8-ounce size is very economical, and the pump makes it easy to use. This shampoo also seems concentrated, so a little goes a long way. Excellent product overall!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d buy it just for the scent however it&#x27;s a great shampoo.  Very calming and relaxing.</li>
    <li> We have been using the Lavender Mint Shampoo for years.  It&#x27;s a nice shampoo and an aroma therapy every morning.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Tea Tree Oil.  I love the smell, the effects, etc.  This product brings it to a shampoo. I love how you can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it cleaning with the slight tingle it gives you. The scent and feeling of clean is great.  Due to its cost, I like to buy it in the larger container which has a handy pump, so it is easy to dispense in the shower.  This has become my favorite shampoo/conditioner. I have been using it for about 5 years now and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo it makes my hair more manageable and sofr. I feel that my hair is cleaner and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Tea Tree Paul Mitchell shampoo a while ago and love it but like to switch it up every few shampoos so decided to give this a try. I am very impressed and maybe even more in love. The lavender mint smell is amazing and wonderfully soothing. Just a small amount works itself into a creamy lather and it washes out easily.  The pump bottle works well too. Hope these Paul Mitchell shampoos are never discontinued.</li>
    <li> The scent of this shampoo is lovely; however, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well. Even though my hairstylist recommended it to me to cure my itchy scalp, it didn&#x27;t do so.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is SO  hydrating, you may not feel the need for conditioner after using it.  My hair tends to be on the dry side and I&#x27;ve found this shampoo REALLY helps.  My hair is soft and smooth using this product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is pretty good.  It leaves my hair feeling incredible after the shower is done and hair is all dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t have any mint &#x27;tingle&#x27; at all, which I was really hoping for.  The texture and consistency is nothing special, feels just like pert plus.  Still, the quality is far superior to cheap shampoo because of how nice it leaves the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping wasn&#x27;t so smart.  The bottle arrive crammed into a box that was too small inside some other packaging.  It cracked in shipment, the seller sent me a free replacement and it arrived fine, but to my surprise they used the same too small box packaging system I complained about in my contact over the broken bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, this shampoo is a solid 4/5.  If it were $10/bottle I&#x27;d give it 5/5.</li>
    <li> Love this and packed great didn&#x27;t have a broken bottle or spill awesome product super happy</li>
    <li> Excellent product and Excellent value as all the Paul Mitchell hair line.</li>
    <li> nice product - have been able to cut back on conditioner</li>
    <li> I love the smell and I love the feel...It really clean my hair and leaves it looking good...I also like the combination of lavender and mint...</li>
    <li> BAD PACKAGING, and when you spend this much on AWESOME shampoo, I want all of it to go on my head, not the plastic, bottle, and box it is shipped in.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. It is very soothing for our scalps.We have used this shampoo for a number of years.  Thanks for still making it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist to fix my dandruff when I mentioned that head and shoulders no longer kept my scalp clear. This shampoo smells nice and keeps my scalp clear! What more could you ask for in a shampoo?</li>
    <li> Great smell and refreshing result. Its a great shampoo. However, since using this product my hair is easy to comb, soft, healthy looking and smells wonderful. This is worth every cent</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  I have some issue with my scalp being dried out especially during the winter.  This shampoo clears that up immediately and keeps my hair moisturized and clean.  I keep a tub all year round and use regularly.</li>
    <li> Thank you! This shampoo is great, leaves my hair smelling wonderful and feeling clean.  The only con is sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get a good lather if I have a lot of product in my hair. Buying this big size saves money too!</li>
    <li> Product as described - received quickly.  Only problem I had was the shampoo somehow leaked all over.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s like having a mini spa vacation at home everytime I shower!! It cleans my hair &amp; makes it smell awesome (not to mention that great tingly feeling)... a bit on the pricey side, but compared to going to a salon it&#x27;s well worth the $$</li>
    <li> I love the product but it came with a broken top. Good thing I saved the one from my last bottle.</li>
    <li> Thought I would try this, last time I bought the Paum Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo (which is great).  This stuff is not tingly, and a little &amp;#34;waxier&amp;#34; than the tea tree oil.  Its not a terrible shampoo, but not as nice smelling or feeling as the tea tree oil</li>
    <li> Love it!! Smells great!</li>
    <li> I hate to admit it, but I bought this shampoo because I had really bad dandruff.  That is now a thing of the past.  This works and I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I like the way it makes me hair feel, smell, and look. I went through a lot of products and this is the best. I HAD greasy, flat hair...not anymore.</li>
    <li> My daughters didn&#x27;t like the shampoo.  Said,  it spells like sour lemon scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo. You guys could package it better, tho. The pump lip broke during shipping. But, I still love it. I will order again.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this shampoo!  If you love lavender, THIS is the shampoo for you.  Lathers up very well, the bathroom/shower smells heavenly, and best of all, the scent lingers on your hair very well.  Hair feels soft and shiny when done.  Cannot say enough about it!!  If you want more mint/tingly feeling shampoo, you should probably go for the teatree mint shampoo by Paul Mitchell - tingly and refreshing and also a very nice shampoo.  This one has such an overwhelmingly lavender scent that you don&#x27;t really appreciate the mint at all.</li>
