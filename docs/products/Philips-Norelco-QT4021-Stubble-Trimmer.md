      <li>175-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s absolutely the best in the business because it’s guard is made as a part of the body</li>

      <li>The hair collector is a nice feature.  </li>
      <li>I’m not paying them $320 for any kind of trimmer.  </li>
      <li>, folks, it was nice while it lasted.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about attachments to change out and keep up with.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s what my partner liked about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This will do the job nicely.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My brother had this and I wanted one. Its costly but I&#x27;ve had others and this is the best. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have had a full beard for most of my adult life.  This will be my third Norelco groomer/trimmer.  I have had other brands, but the Norelco is by far the best.  There are two key features on this trimmer.  The AC/DC power supply not only charges the trimmer for cordless use, but can be plugged in for use when the charged battery drains down.  Also, the plastic guide follows the contour of your face and keeps the blades at their proper cutting angle.  The guide can be removed for finer trimming for those with a steady hand.  Take it from a seasoned user of trimmer/groomers, this will do the job.</li>
    <li> I agree with one of the other reviews that questioned why they call it a stubble trimmer. It is pretty much a beard trimmer, since it doesn&#x27;t work especially well at a very close trim. It works quite nicely for me though ... although somewhat annoyingly the adjustable guard / length adjuster tends to pick up the hair more than the usual type, so you have to stop and unblock it fairly regularly. But without having to carry all the different guards for different lengths, it is very convenient to travel with. I took it on a trip for a couple weeks, I didn&#x27;t bring the charger but I was able to use it as often as I needed.</li>
    <li> I had to get a second one because I was taking it to my dad&#x27;s and bringing it back for my husband. Love these things. If you want a close trim without having to break out the old sharp razor (that usually makes you bleed), this is your trimmer. I use this on my dad&#x27;s face. He has a very stiff beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now and it&#x27;s amazing! My beard looks a lot better now because I can trim it regularly without having to go real short. My old trimmer had adjustable combs that easily slipped back to the shortest length and I hated it. The adjustable length system on this trimmer is solid and doesn&#x27;t slip at all. Overall, this is a great beard trimmer!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in December of 2010-- or 1 1/2 years ago-- and I&#x27;ve used it almost exclusively throughout.  I trim 1-3 times a week.  I&#x27;ve traveled with it all over the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;-battery life has always been exceptional.  Never had it run out of power unless I just flagrantly didn&#x27;t charge it for weeks on end.&lt;br /&gt;-if the distance you want trimmed is the amount the head offers, it will trim is evenly and reliably&lt;br /&gt;-very very easy to clean, and to clean well.  I never feel like it&#x27;s building up residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s always felt plasticky.  It works as well or better than my previous $50 (at target) trimmer, but it feels a lot less glamorous in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;-the 10 settings are worlds apart.  The difference between any two settings is pretty dramatic, and it took me months to find setting I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for $30 on Amazon.  That seems like a good price.  For a cheap-to-midlevel trimmer, this is a good bet.&lt;br /&gt;I see it priced over $100 now on Amazon.  That&#x27;s absurd.  Absolutely not nice enough to be worth over $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(minus one star for being plasticky, and having too little control over trim-setting length)</li>
    <li> A stubble trimmer literally does that - allows you to \\&quot;create stubble\\&quot; on your face from a longer beard. You might find this a little silly, but in the end it&#x27;s no sillier or more normal than choosing any other hair style or face style. If you enjoy having the James Bond five o&#x27;clock shadow stubble beard look, then this would be the device to help you maintain that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works the same way an eyebrow trimmer does. You have the trimmer part, and then a comb that sets the height of the hair. To be more precise, it is exactly a beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s first setting - the smallest one - gives you a stubble. The second one maybe does. By the third setting you&#x27;re at \\&quot;normal\\&quot; beard or mustache trimming lengths. There are settings out past a half inch. I&#x27;m not sure how that qualifies as stubble. From that perspective, this is really just a beard trimmer that does have a \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; setting at its lowest point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item 2. The unit is fairly large. If you&#x27;re trying to keep some facial hair and stubble the rest, it&#x27;s hard to detail with it. The blades are fairly deep in the unit, making it hard to make an edge. The only way to edge is to remove the whole outside part and edge with the naked blade. The plastic blade \\&quot;bounces\\&quot; in and out away from the blade area which doesn&#x27;t seem to be useful or helpful at all. It seems to gather a lot of hair inside the unit when it trims, rather than letting it fall into the sink. I would count that as \\&quot;bad\\&quot; in terms of that area filling up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does clean very easily because the entire top unit is press-fit into the main unit. It comes with a little brush. Most units of this type come with a little tube of oil. This one doesn&#x27;t - but maybe long term it doesn&#x27;t need one? Or do they assume you&#x27;ll buy some of your own?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have other beard trimmers which can do stubble and which work much better than this unit. If anything, this might be useful for someone looking for a crew cut - set it to notch 4 or 5 and run it over your entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For charging there is a cord you plug into a wall, which you can detach from the hand held unit part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really seems to be a beard trimmer with a new, trendy name. It works well enough at that role - I&#x27;ll give it four stars - but it&#x27;s nothing different or special.h 4 or 5 and run it over your entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For charging there is a cord you plug into a wall, which you can detach from the hand held unit part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really seems to be a beard trimmer with a new, trendy name. It works well enough at that role - I&#x27;ll give it four stars - but it&#x27;s nothing different or special.</li>
    <li> I had an older model of this trimmer.  I was expecting a completely revamped product, but all that&#x27;s change is the marketing material, the box, and the color design (old one was a lightish blue).    That said the trimmer is a good one, you can easily dial in the length, be careful though, even though 1-2 seem long, when you actually cut with them, it&#x27;s down to pretty much nothing.    Overall it&#x27;s a good trimmer, new color pattern on an old good model.</li>
    <li> This shaver works great for what it was designed for.  You can decide how \\&quot;stubbley\\&quot; you want to be.  Trims evenly and does not pull</li>
    <li> I am most pleased with this product. I received it through Amazon&#x27;s Vine program and although I do not use it on a daily basis, I have used it for many weekend evenings out when I wanted to look well-groomed but did not necessarily want a full, clean shave. This will do the job nicely. Of course, evening use for a good \\&quot;5:00 shadow\\&quot; is not it&#x27;s only function. If you don&#x27;t have a heavy beard (the case with me) you may enjoy using it in the morning as a quick alternative to shaving that will still leave you looking well-groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product with confidence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got clippers to clip my hair.  And I used those to clip my body hair.  Then I bought the Norelco BodyGroom, because they convinced me it was better for shaving everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Then I got tired of shaving everyday with my Norelco Cool Skin razor and decided to let my facial hair grow out, but keep it trimmed to stubble.  I like to call it \\&quot;the weekender\\&quot;.  Anyway, I was using my normal clippers for this, but they were large and corded and rough on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;In comes the Norelco Stubble Trimmer, tailor made for guys like me.  I can keep my stubble, groom it with a smaller tool that is more facial friendly.  Plus it is easy to adjust the level of stubble cut off.  And if you remove the guard, you have a nice little trimmer for detail work.&lt;br /&gt;I charged it fully when I got it, and have been using is a bit over 2 weeks without a recharge.  Now admittedly, I don&#x27;t use it everyday (more like twice a week).  It did sound like it was slowing down  when I used it today so probably time for a charge.&lt;br /&gt;All in all it does the job well.  I use the guard at the lowest setting, and it evenly cuts my beard, even the hard to get places like the mustache area and chin.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because there are other clipper/trimmers who do this and more, but if you like gadgets (and I do) then this one is a good one to add to your grooming arsenal.</li>
    <li> I bought this so-called \\&quot;stubble trimmer\\&quot; to replace a worn-out Philips T860 beard trimmer.  I&#x27;m at a loss to see how this has been re-branded as a Stubble Trimmer! The blades are a bit different, but the main trimmer part is exactly the same as the 7-year-old beard trimmer. People don&#x27;t have inch-long \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; ! I was expecting this product to have very fine adjustment over the trimmer length, for STUBBLE, but no...exactly the same beard-length settings as the old T860.    Other than that, the old one was made in Austria, and this one is made in China. The old one also had a built-in charger, but this one has an external one (less convenient). So how is this progress???</li>
    <li> This product is perfect to maintain that scruffy (not just shaved) look.  It is adjustable so you can get exactly the look you are after.  Being cordless it is convenient and it holds a charge for several trims.</li>
    <li> The truth is, I&#x27;ve never considered 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (stubble) to be a fashion statement.  Ok, I&#x27;m hopelessly out of date, but my son is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this trimmer for my son who&#x27;s not big on stubble but who does have a mustache that he likes to keep trimmed and neat.  He found that this shaver is OK for trimming jobs, but not much more than OK.  The trimming tool on the head keeps his mustache at a reasonably consistent length, but the trimmer itself performs at an average level - not so bad, not so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tool for a specific job.  Whether it&#x27;s worth your time and money depends on just how long the stubble look remains fashionable.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does the job, but in my opinion is very similar to our other trimmer(Wahl 9906-717 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer), but double the price. This one does work as both a stubble/beard trimmer, or you can take the plastic attachment off the top for a precision trimmer. That&#x27;s a nice feature to have, since I use it often when giving my boyfriend a haircut, around the ears and on the back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big con: this trimmer is larger then the Wahl trimmer, so it makes it a real pain in the neck to get the spot under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little plastic bit on the top that does the adjustment on length is, well, its plastic. Which is fine, but you&#x27;d think for something in this price point they might have a heavier material that would stand the test of time. It seemed a bit flimsy, like if I were to drop it on a tile floor, it might crack or break. He didn&#x27;t like it nearly as much as the classic slide on attachments because it didn&#x27;t seem to get every single hair, and he found he was struggling with it a bit. Though it&#x27;s nice not having little bits and parts everywhere, he really much preferred picking out the length attachment to trying to figure out the little swivel adjustment on this particular trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the trimmer is a good weight, not too heavy or light. Fits well in the hand and isn&#x27;t slippery, which is great. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s the only thing it holds above our other trimmer, is that it&#x27;s more attractive and a little nicer feeling body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable is nice, but how do you know when the battery is low? There&#x27;s no indicator on it. It&#x27;s preferred to batteries, but they should definitely add some indication of juice left. All in all, its ok and definitely an attractive trimmer, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I was very unsure about which of these trimmers to buy, but I&#x27;m glad I went with this one.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about attachments to change out and keep up with.  All you have to do is simply twist the dial and you can cut your hair to have the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, turn the dial and trim your goatee/side burns, or change it to one of the higher settings and actually cut your hair..  It&#x27;s truly an all in one device.  This replace my Mach 3 Fusion razor and my hair clippers.  All for this amazing price.  I&#x27;ve had it for a little over 2 weeks now and i use it every few days, it&#x27;s still on it&#x27;s first charge.  The good thing about it is that you can simply plug the adapter into the wall and use it while it&#x27;s charging if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue i have against it would be the fact that it does kind of throw hair, but that&#x27;s just because it cuts so fast.  The only time it has done this bad was the first time i used it and my facial hair was a little thick, I was waiting to see how well it would perform.  But if you keep everything cut every 2 or 3 days it&#x27;s not that bad at throwing hair..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Fully Recommend this..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these.  The first lasted less than a month.  It wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I figured, must be a bad example of a good shaver.  The second lasted less than a year. Same problem.  Reading the reviews, I&#x27;m not alone.  I&#x27;ve recently gone with a Wahl trimmer.  I&#x27;m impressed so far.</li>
    <li> This Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer was offered to me on the Amazon Vine Program and I decided to give it a try to test on my husband.  My husband has been &#x27;stubble shaving&#x27; his head now for several years...meaning he shaves his head but leaves a bit of stubble so he&#x27;s not sporting a Mr. Clean look.  Since his current shaver left him with track marks all over his head, I thought this would be perfect to test on him.  He tried it on himself a few times then I had to test it as well since I have to submit the review, right? :-)  A huge pro about this model is that the guard does not come off but adjusts easily.  He&#x27;s misplaced his favorite sized guard before (another brand) and the vendor didn&#x27;t sell them individually so that was a hassle.  Another one a couple years back fell in the toilet - blech.  This Norelco model is great that it&#x27;s very easy to adjust yet never comes off so there is no way you can lose it.  I haven&#x27;t used it on him as many times as my husband has but he said that this model holds it&#x27;s charge much longer than some other electric shavers that he&#x27;s used as trimmers in the past.  It works like most other trimmers, very easy to use, self explanatory, really basic so it works just as advertised.  I think the only downside to this model - although it&#x27;s not a fair comment because it&#x27;s not advertised as a &#x27;shaver&#x27; but this doesn&#x27;t shave at all...you can&#x27;t get that clean close shave should you want one...again, this is marketed as a &#x27;Stubble Trimmer&#x27; and NOT a shaver so I acknowledge that this is not a fair comment however, our only negative observation is that he now keeps TWO trimmers / shavers out.  A Shaver for his facial hair and this stubble trimmer for his head hair and his chest and arms.  He did tell me that he likes how this works better than his other model in that it doesn&#x27;t clog as easily if he ever decides to let his hair grow out a bit so it&#x27;s worth it to keep both on hand.  I&#x27;d say if this &#x27;Stubble Trimmer&#x27; would provide a clean shave as well, this would be \\&quot;THE\\&quot; shaver / trimmer to have on hand however if you are looking for a really great stubble trimmer, look no further! This is an awesome one!   PS- To the ladies, in case you are considering getting this for your significant other and use it on occasion for yourself, I would NOT recommend this for your own use...the shaver width is way to wide for us. GREAT for the guys though!!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great and appears heavy-duty enough to stand up to long use.  I especially like the flexible head, which allows you to smoothly trim around the chin.  I tried two different trimmers, which either broke or were not solid enough to reliably use (e.g., the length setting would slip as I used it, so I would end up with uneven beard length).  The Norelco trimmer is a huge step up.</li>
    <li> After looking at many different models in many different stores, and actually ordering and returning one (thanks Amazon) due to not trimming close enough, this one gets it right. And it&#x27;s not that I am looking for a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow; for me, it&#x27;s lowest setting is way too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pinch, bind or cut my face and is easy to hold and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why four stars and not five? Krappy old-tech battery that can&#x27;t (shouldn&#x27;t) remain plugged into the charger. In order for the battery to last, it needs to be charged and then run down - not topped off. A pain for something not used everyday. It could also use a travel case, as the first time I took it with me it switched on and ran down in my bag. Glad I brought the cord.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is just great. You can keep your beard at any length you want; from just a hint of stuble to about an inch long. It makes it super easy to maintain your hair at an even length. Its really light weight, and actually feels a little less sturdy than other Norelco razors I own, but it seems to be just as sturdy. I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and its still like new. Anyway, I would definitely buy this if you want an easy way to maintain your beard.</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer on a whim since I&#x27;d run out of razors, and it works pretty great. I don&#x27;t have much of a beard to contend with, but it&#x27;s an excellent alternative to shaving all the time.</li>
    <li> Its a nice trimmer because it gives you the number 1 &amp; 2 stubble. I purchased the Wahl beard trimmer and its pretty good too, but it doesn&#x27;t give you the number 1 &amp; 2 stubble like the Philips QT4021. Its comfortable to hold and it is very comfortable on the face. The problem I have is with the battery. It doesn&#x27;t seem to keep its charge well. I charged it the other day for about 3 hours and I used it for a few minutes and I noticed the trimmer slowing down. As soon as you plug it in the charger, it speeds up again. I am also noticing a problem with the trimmer motor, it just isn&#x27;t as fast as it was when I first purchased it. And I&#x27;ve only had this thing for a month. It seems that a lot of hair gets trapped under the blades and that could be slowing down the motor. I tap the trimmer on the side of the sink and a ton of hair comes out of there. Well, for now it is working OK, it is getting the job done. If they fix the battery and the motor issue, this trimmer would get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, cuts nice, great height/length control, good price.  The hair collector is a nice feature.  All in all I am very pleased.  My beard is heavy and this keeps my mustache/chin whiskers looking great with very little effort.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.  I like the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look and this is perfect for that or even if you have a semi-long beard.  It can cut the hair anywhere between 1-15mm.  The guard comes off easily for trimming sideburns or anything else.  It holds a good charge, it&#x27;s quiet, and cleaning is easy.  This is a great product for any man looking to stay well groomed.</li>
    <li> Works well but head is bulky with cover on which makes it hard to trim around nose and lip area</li>
    <li> This is basically a completely normal shaver with a couple finer settings for \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;.  Philips Norelco generally makes good shavers and this one is no exception.  I use several Philips shavers weekly and never had any problems with them.  I expect this one is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the finest stubble setting to still not take enough hair off of my thick-dark beard.  In otherwords -- I still looked too scruffy.  I prefer the standard method of looking scruffy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Single blade razor and light pressure from top to bottom WITH THE GRAIN along your face/neck.  You&#x27;ll look like Duchovny every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as everyday trimming the shaver I prefer most is a different Philips model [[ASIN:B000FEF1V4 Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer]].  It has a vacuum which prevents my sink from being filled with hair :)</li>
    <li> As others have pointed out, Norelco has repackaged a facial hair trimmer as a stubble trimmer with various settings that determine the length of one&#x27;s facial hair.  Although Norelco advertises this product for the man who wants nine stubble length settings to create the apparently desirable five o&#x27;clock shadow, for me, only the first closest setting achieved that result.  The other settings were more appropriate for trimming beards, mustaches, goatees and even soul patches.  Therefore, this product has more varied uses than emulating the look of Ryan Seacrest, and for that reason, I would recommend it if you lack a trimmer in your arsenal of hair cutting products.  In sum, unless you are set on the Seacrest look, you can probably survive just fine with a good electric razor, such as the excellent Braun 8995 shaver or the various Wahl trimmers.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is worst grooming product I have every used.  The top fell apart within the first few uses and the blades catch and pull hairs instead of cutting them.  I have used trimmers for 10+ years and this one is awful.</li>
    <li> A great trimmer rivaled only by its Norelco predecessors. Nonetheless, a more expensive version with few improvements. Battery override is very helpful as one does not have to recharge every time prior to using it. I would rate the performance 5 stars. Giving it 4 stars only due to the price increase.</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for one month now.  I use it twice a week to trim a goatee.  The length selection is easy to use and very nice.  The only drawback is that it is hard to get close under the nose.  You also have to push somewhat firmly to get the best trim because of the flexible guard.  Also works ok on body hair.</li>
    <li> This trimmer I love because of its simplicity, ease of cleaning, and versatility (operates by battery AND direct plug-in).    The previous posts that downrate the product because of the battery probably don&#x27;t know how to use Nickle-Metal-Hydride batteries.    The trimmer is clearly labelled on the back with a battery icon in which the letters \\&quot;NiMH\\&quot; are written. This trimmer runs on a Nickle-Metal-Hydride battery, which experiences depletion or voltage depression, or what&#x27;s commonly called a recharge \\&quot;memory\\&quot;.    So all you have to do to keep this trimmer in top shape is FULLY discharge the battery BEFORE recharging it. For years I&#x27;ve successfully used various sorts of NiMH-powered devices by maintaining care.    All batteries eventually wear out, or gradually deplete voltage levels, even Lithium batteries (which do not have memory, and are increasingly used in cell phones, electric cars, and sonic toothbrushes). Hopefully we&#x27;ll be seeing new beard trimmer models with Lithium batteries soon.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my purposes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many beard trimmers but this is by far the best.  The powerful unit trims stubble beards cleanly.  It&#x27;s also great for trimming the nape of the neck and outer ears.  I can really not think of a reason not to buy this trimmer.</li>
    <li> After trying out bunch of other trimmers , I did find this one .. I must say this is an excellent stubble trimmer and the charge holds up for a very long time ..I would consider this as a very good buy!</li>
    <li> This is the second trimmer I bought after I busted my first one after using it for over 5 years. I use it to trim my beard and also at time to trim my hair. The product is extremely good. I have seen make people ask if it works on dual voltage: The answer is YES, it does. 100-240 volts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer.  I have a full beard and the trimmer keeps it perfectly trimmed.      One advantage is that the adjustble head is all in one piece.  You don&#x27;t have to change heads to get different lengths of cut.  That makes the job quick.    The head lifts up easily for quick cleaning; I clean it every time I use it to keep the motor unincombered.      Note:  The manual suggests to run the battery down all the way before recharging; it is easy enough to follow that counsel.    The trimmer comes with 9 stops to designate the length of the hair.  I use stops 3-5 which is perfect for me.    Before buying this my old trimmer was a Remington, which I thought was great, but this shaver is clearly better.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of the Norelco beard trimmers from this line over the last 6-7 years. I believe they were models Norelco T-6000 and Philips Norelco T-860.     The 6000 was designed such that it couldn&#x27;t be used corded... if it was plugged in, the motor wouldn&#x27;t run. The motor only ran off the unit&#x27;s internal, non-replaceable batteries. And when the batteries died after about 4 years, the clipper died. Planned obsolescence.     But I guess I hadn&#x27;t learned my lesson yet. I liked it well enough that I went out and bought a T-860. I mean, this line does have some nice features, such as the ability to dial up 9 different length settings without switching blade guides, a feature I truly like. Cleaning is easy, the way the head is designed... just pop it open and brush the hair out of the blades, no tools required. The 860 even touted the fact that the motor took precedence over the charger, so it could be used corded. Perfect, I thought.     Now I learn the truth... the truth is that if the battery won&#x27;t hold any charge at all, the motor still won&#x27;t work, whether it&#x27;s plugged in or not! Again, planned obsolescence.     So the battery on my T-860 just died flat dead this morning after only about 3 years this time (getting shorter), and I&#x27;m out looking for a new beard trimmer. But now I&#x27;ve learned my lesson... stay away from these Norelco battery-operated trimmers! The fact of the matter is, the only time I&#x27;m ever away from an electrical outlet is when I&#x27;m camping, and I generally don&#x27;t trim my beard then anyway! After about the first year, I always ended up using the T-860 as a corded trimmer anyway, because it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for 5 minutes while I trimmed my beard. So I&#x27;m used to working with the cord at this point.     I can save the environment the little bit of toxic heavy metals in the NiMH batteries, and just buy a corded trimmer that has no batteries at all. It will probably last the rest of my life.     Bottom line: These Norelco trimmers have some nice features, but obsolescence is built into them and they only last a few short years.</li>
    <li> This product is good. It is pretty Stylish, comfortable to use and easy to clean after usage. I do refer this product for stubble looks.  Yet to see the battery life since i always plug the charger to the 110VAC outlet.</li>
    <li> I traded in my 8 year old Norelco for this unit because my old ones battery was dead and would not function without a charged battery. I specifically ordered the QT4021 because its one of the few beard trimmers that will run just off of wall power no matter the battery&#x27;s condition. The vast majority of beard trimmers must be charged for some time before they will do one trimming. Most beard trimmers have very low quality NiCad battery&#x27;s which dont hold a very big or very long charge. Even the lithium-ion battery chargers which come at a real premium only have a duty cycle of maybe 500 charges (by charge they mean every time its plugged in for any amount of time). Even with 500 good charges that&#x27;s only a few years of service and honestly I dont want to throw out a trimmer just because the battery is dead while everything else about it works great. This trimmer with its ability to run off just wall power with or without the battery means a much longer functional life span.     The only downside is the guard cannot be removed. Its a much nicer guard as an end result but it cannot be used to get an exposed blade right next to your beard to make nice sharp lines or to trim the hair from your neck. For close precise work I have purchased a small no guard corded trimmer and together its the perfect combination.</li>
    <li> I have been a proud owner of Philips Norelco electric shavers and beard trimmers for over 10 years.  When other boys got their first set of a razor and shaving cream, I got an electric shaver.  My electric shaver and trimmer are two electronics that I don&#x27;t want to be without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my 10 years of ownership, I am currently on my 2nd shaver and 2nd trimmer.  This speaks very highly of the quality of Philips Norelco products.  In fact, my 1st shaver and 1st trimmer were still fully functional when I gave them away.  I was unable to find replacement heads, which forced me to buy newer models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to talk about this specific stubble trimmer, the QT4021.  The QT4021 is designed to fit a very small niche market.  We see them occassionally on the street - the person who has the finely sculpted, very thin beard.  We all think that he must have spent hours by the mirror before he left his house.  It is a work of art that must be maintained with vigil every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who needs 9 lengths ranging from 1 mm to 1 inch?  This guy does.  And not many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, my Philips Norelco beard trimmer has enough setting to keep my facial hair groomed.  Very rarely do I use the shortest settings on my own trimmer - my facial hair just isn&#x27;t full enough for low height settings.  However I do know people who will find this stubble trimmer useful.</li>
    <li> I had to let my facial hair grow for a few days in order to be able to see this shaver have an effect.  It is exactly as advertised: it will get hairs short, but not shaven.  The charge lasts for a while, and the motor is strong with no pulls or other owies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a trimmer set to do stubble, it&#x27;s inability to fine tune is a big drawback.  Where setting 1 is stubble, setting 2 is basically a thin beard.  And there&#x27;s no setting 0, so you can&#x27;t completely shave places, like the back of my neck.  It would be nicer to have ten settings that went from 0 to (what is now called) 1.5 instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the previous version of this trimmer (with vacuum) and I love them equally.  Both travel great, cut precisely and are great general purpose trimmers for the whole body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few electrical shavers and trimmers from various manufacturers through the years as I have been keeping the five o&#x27;clock shadow look for a quite sometime. I always pick up what&#x27;s available on the shelves of Target or Walmart. They come with many connections and plugins but never do what I want them to do, a close shave that can be accomplished rapidly and easily. This one does. At the lowest setting I get the look that I want without too much fuss. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hi,    This is an excellent trimmer. I have used it mainly for my beard, but also other parts. Its head is very flexible, its battery life is long, and is very comfortable on the skin.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re trying to maintain the stubble look, it&#x27;ll do the trick, but there isn&#x27;t a fine enough selection to really get the stubbly-but-not-a-beard-look you may be going for.  I found that the finest setting is much too short, like a days worth of growth.  The second setting is maybe a day and a half of stubble.  And 3 is more like a week. If there were a few steps between 2 and 3 it would be perfect.    With this trimmer, I like that there are no attachments to lose.  The battery life is decent and it seems to have enough power to cut through the tough stubble.  The comb attachment does an OK job of trapping the hair, but it can also get clogged.  Another nit is that the power switch is in an awkward spot, and it can be hard to find.  The body of the trimmer has a rubberized coating that makes gripping it easy, but hair trimmings tend to stick to it.    Also, please note that because it doesn&#x27;t have a vacuum, your sink will be covered in trimmings.    Overall, decent trimmer for someone just trying out the whole stubble thing but may not be a long term solution.</li>
    <li> Five o&#x27;clock shadow, was once considered a no-no, (even a sign of poor grooming), and was definitely NOT a fashion statement. I remember a time when men went to great lengths (no pun intended) to keep their stubble invisible. Some guys even kept an electric razor in their car or briefcase for touch-ups as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know this has changed, and now, a slightly-bearded look is acceptable. If you want to acheive that look, this trimmer makes it easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what my partner liked about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It can be used cordless (corded it you prefer).&lt;br /&gt;--The lowest setting gives a neat, very short \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;--It can be used to trim beards, sideburns or a mustache.&lt;br /&gt;--It&#x27;s easy to handle, and stores easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn&#x27;t mention anything not to like about the product, but if he does, I&#x27;ll return to edit this review.&lt;br /&gt;For now, it gets five-stars for providing him with a short, dark, and handsome result.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says, trims beards to stubble up to almost an inch long.  It isn&#x27;t an universal as other products, but you can use it all over your body.  It is easy to clean. I also love that you don&#x27;t need different attachments or change the length it trims just rotate the razor and it adjusts.  If you ever want a clean shave you will still need a different razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this type of Philips Norelco beard trimmer for more than 15 years.  My only complaint is that the battery wears out after about 5 years but that seems about right for a product at this price point.  Since my first, I&#x27;ve never considered buying any other type of beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to have that stubbly look around my short goatee. This product is perfect for achieving that look. However, it is worth noting that it will not give you a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. It is more like a \\&quot;next morning\\&quot; shadow. It is a little unrealistic to expect any trimmer to give you less than 1mm stubble, and when I wake up the day after shaving my stubble is at about 1mm, so that&#x27;s why I call it the \\&quot;next morning\\&quot; shadow.    In some of the other reviews people have complained about the dial mechanism slipping and having their beards gouged. I have not had this problem, and I have pressed in on my skin so hard that the skin starts to fold and ripple. So, I am not sure what these other people are doing, but they must be seriously dominating their face skin.     I will say that the battery life is so-so, and for about $40 it really should be better. Other than that, it is all good. Great quality, and the trimmer really manhandles those thick beard whiskers.</li>
    <li> Looking for an easy method to groom you facial hair? Look no further than the Philps Norelco Stubble Trimmer.  My review was based on using this device for a total of 9 months. In short, the product works as advertised - trimming facial hair with ease. The unit maintains its charge well; I charge mine every month. I recommend using this device when your beard is dry for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stubble Trimmer includes one plastic clip, which attaches to the unit. It can be easily removed for cleaning. Also included in the package is a small cleaning brush, which you are supposed to use on the device after each trim. The unit is incredibly portable, making it easy to pack and go for frequent travelers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this device on a beard I grew for 4 months. These days, I use it for trimming my sideburns and goatee. I&#x27;m very pleased with the Stubble Trimmer. It&#x27;s versatile, convenient, and easy to clean and maintain. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer. It has one setting for stubble, but that setting works as advertised. All the other settings are more for beard trimmings. The batter seems to last a while. I&#x27;ve trimmed about 20 times before I needed to recharge it.</li>
    <li> Best BEARD trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. Small, light weight, powerful, trimming length locks very well so no worries about accidentally cutting too short. Not so much of a STUBBLE trimmer though, at least not for my type of facial hair (thick and black).</li>
    <li> My Phillips t980 broke so I ran out to Rite Aide and purchased this trimmer as I needed something fast. Compared to the T980 which is in the same price range I&#x27;m very upset with this trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t shave as fast... Meaning that I have to go over a spot 2-3 times compares to once with the T980. The most upsetting thing to me is that this trimmer doesn&#x27;t go short enough when taking the adjuster off. The T980 gave me the perfect stubble, this trimmer makes my stubble 2x longer than the T980.</li>
    <li> It was great when it was working.  The green LED light won&#x27;t light up anymore.  Either the battery is bad or the charger is bad.  Anyways, it not working anymore after 4 months of use.</li>
    <li> I have gone through many beard trimmers and this one is the best so far!  The adjuster dial on the trimmer makes it easy to set the desired length, from a couple of days old stubble to over an inch long beard.  You can remove the guard and trim to 5 o&#x27;clock shadow if you want.  The trimmer is very sharp and trims my thick coarse beard very fast with no problem.  The guard has a spring loaded guide that feels like it combs your beard as you trim which makes for a more even and consistent trim.</li>
    <li> This thing is really good! The blades on this thing are incredible really does leave you with perfect stubble. Also i love that its just one piece, you don&#x27;t have to go through a bunch of different tops. Really good purchase, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and want to stop paying $15 or $20 per haircut, are okay with wearing a simple one-length crewcut, and also have a short beard of somewhere around the same shortish length, then this tool can make you pretty happy.    I do not like haircutters that have many loose parts, and this one is just one simple unit with the length adjustment intergrated in with a slick length-dialing collar, so that&#x27;s a big plus with me.  The blades, how long they stay sharp, and the battery, how long it holds up, will probably be what determines the long-term satisfaction this unit provides, and I have only had it for a month or two so I cannot say on these.  The blades are supposed to be self-sharpening and the battery is currently (sorry, loose pun attack) very peppy and lasts plenty long enough for more than one haircut now.    In order to get the really uniform length that makes for a sharp appearance it does take lots of repetitive passes over the same hair spot, but the batteries are well up to this challenge.  Are you?  If you are looking for a one or two pass sort of thing, then you need to look at some much more pricey pro equipment, I imagine, (and maybe hiring a barber to use it, too).  This thing gets me free from the barber, beard and all, as long as I am willing to run the thing all over my hair about a dozen swipes at minimum over all hair surfaces, including the beard.    Wearing a one-length crew cut and a one-length full beard is the way I have found that best reduces the fuss and cost factors of grooming from the neck up.  I make only one exception to this uniformity, and that is that because my mustache is thicker than the rest of my beard I cut only it one click closer than the rest of my beard. After I do this it looks more uniform than if I left it all the same length!  Now all I have to do on a daily basis is use a disposable razor to maintain a clear bottom line and top edge-line on my full beard, and that&#x27;s it for me.    I tried that vacuum trimmer a few years ago and found it to be a not-so-hot gimmick then so I didn&#x27;t go back there when I bought this new one.  I do not think I can find anything that works better for me than this one, at this price point.  The length adjustor is trustworthy in design, doesn&#x27;t threaten to accidentally slip to another setting.      At the end of my beard trim I usually have to take some small pointy scissors and trim a few hairs a little shorter directly under my nose.  Tha&#x27;s the only place where the built-in adjusting guard stops me from using it to cut every hair.    And when I am done giving myself a haircut I take the guard off, call in my wife, and she uses the unit without the guard to cut a clean hairline at the nape of my neck in back where I can&#x27;t see to do it well enough for myself because I am not coordinated enough to do that reverse-my-hand-motions-because-I-am-looking-in-a mirror thing.    Cleaning the unit: if you are cutting dry hair, the clumps of cut hair usually just fall off into to sink area.  Once in a while and when I am all finished with it I take the adjustable guard off and blow the loose hair off with a puff of air from my mouth.  The guard slips off and goes back on with zero effort and no accidental length-setting changes.    This thing is nicely thought out and has very good \\&quot;human-use engineering\\&quot;.  I am really satisfied so far.  Of course, one day one even better will be built, but this seems to me to be the best one for now.    The name &#x27;stubble&#x27; is sort of misleading, because it is more than that.  It is just as much a very good \\&quot;shorter-hair-and-beard trimmer\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for several weeks now and it seems like a pretty good buy.  It cuts well, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean, and I like that it remembers the last setting used.  I also haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet, which is nice.  To be fair, I only use it a couple of times a week, but my last trimmer needed charged pretty much after every use.</li>
    <li> This is the second Norelco product that has died on me. First I bought the T980, which had a good vacuum and all.. but the battery died within a week, even though i had plugged it in while i was using it. The second one, this stubble trimmer, barely went thru 4 uses. No matter how many hours i charge it, it doesnt work. It is not working even when I have it plugged in. Something fundamentally wrong with all these Norelco products. Seeing so many good reviews, I bought it. Terribly disappointed. Will never buy a Norelco product again. EVER.</li>
    <li> As many reviews say, this is not a \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; trimmer, but a regular beard trimmer. It has only one level that does stubble. All others are way too far from the skin.  As a regular beard trimmer, I think it does a good job. It&#x27;s light and easy to handle. However, it&#x27;s a bit bigger than all the previous trimmer I had, so all the pockets I had are useless.   There is one thing that does annoy me. After shaving, the red rubber ring gets full with hair. And no matter how much you brush it, it&#x27;s too sticky to be clean. Henceforth the trimmer is constantly &#x27;hairy&#x27; and looking dirty.    In sum, I would go for something else. The trimmer does its job fine, but there are definitely better options around.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my previous Philips Norelco groomer, and instantly regretted not going with this model first!  The moment you switch on the trimmer, the smooth, quiet hum tells you this one is different.  No loud, grating buzz that was probably damaging my hearing.  No strong, numbing vibration in my hand that probably was doing something bad also.  The plastic guard has thicker \\&quot;spokes\\&quot; than the various clip on guards on cheaper models, and the flex hinge feels confident, solid and travels across my jaw without jabbing.  Fewer removable or interchangeable parts also makes dusting off and cleaning easy.  Charge lasts and lasts, but unlike previous models, this one allows the charger to work as an adapter, so you can plug in and run despite low or no charge.  As for clipping and trimming, despite being labeled for \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;, the guard allows for lengthy whiskers.  Be careful on your first clip because the \\&quot;2\\&quot; on this model is closer than a \\&quot;2\\&quot; on your old clippers.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has the two features I used most on my old trimmer and a cool easy way to adjust height. It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I have owned two, the second one just died. Pro&#x27;s and cons ...&lt;br /&gt;1) Each has lasted about 2 years; average (just when the warranty runs out). Weekly use.&lt;br /&gt;2) The design (fixed comb, moveable blades) is genius. No messing with accessories.&lt;br /&gt;3) The battery, terrible. The decision to use NiMH not a good one in my opinion. It&#x27;s yesterday, and better options exist.&lt;br /&gt;4) Materials/Workmanship. You are seriously overpaying at list price or even 1/2 list price. This is a $40 trimmer at best.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is extremely light-weight (meaning cheap). The battery giving out, you can live with that by using it as a corded device. That&#x27;s about 6 months into ownership. Gradually, the motor loses it&#x27;s torque, resulting in stop and go service (waiting for the motor to cool). You live with that until it becomes unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t over-analyze the expiration of my first unit, dismissing my experience as &amp;#34;bad luck&amp;#34;. I wanted the same convenience (no accessories) in my replacement. Expiration of my second was a bit tougher to stomach. I contacted customer service. They function as a &amp;#34;help desk&amp;#34; and are there to perform little more than execute on the written black and white warranty terms. They aren&#x27;t empowered in helping you beyond a 15% discount for purchase on their overpriced on-line store (because it is not designed to compete with retail distribution) . If your experience parallels mine, you will be thrilled when you first buy, disenchanted but &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; after 6 months (that&#x27;s about 24 usages as a beard trimmer for me), gradually and steadily diminishing from there.  I cannot recommend this unit except as a $40 disposable.</li>
    <li> it works fine for 6 months or so, but the battery is not lithium ion, so it dies out quickly, loses power. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Philips-Norelco beard trimmers for the past thirteen years.  They have, in fact, gone down in quality and features, but are still my most favored trimmer: they are compact (the ones w/o a vacuum or base-docking feature), minimally pieced together (I hate ALL the attachments from the other vendors&#x27; products), and normally not too expensive.  I hate that my last P/N Trimmer, like the reviews of this and some other products. lost its battery capacity over a short period of time, and I was required to charge it before every use.  That is not a deal-breaker for me, just a minor nuisance.   I use this trimmer for cleaning up my goatee (in season) as well as cutting my hair (I am mostly bald, so it works very well for this use as I haven&#x27;t been to a barber since 2000 - seriously!).  Think of the savings!!!!  Now why I am writing: I looked here several weeks ago, and this trimmer was available for $99.99 with Philips noted as the supplier.  Now they are out of stock, and you have to buy it from other retailers / sources.  I cringe at buying from secondary sources (having been burned a few times on out-of-print books and other products, so I want the source to be as close to the initial supplier as possible).  Well, I tried going online at Walmart, Target, JCP, Dillards, etc, and I finally found a similar trimmer, #QT4019, at Bed Bath and Beyond (both in-store and online), and it was only $39.99!  You don&#x27;t need to pay these inflated prices when you can easily obtain a close-matching product for much, much less.  I stopped by BB &amp; B this morning (in Dallas), and they said they stock it all year round - I bought four to safeguard any near-future searches when this one wears out (they seem to last 2 - 3 years for me).  Good luck, and I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked that this trimmer has gotten so many positive reviews. It sucks. Trust me. Bad. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Well made, easy to use.  The shortest setting is perfect for short stubble...goes shorter than other trimmers.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this item as I wear a permanent stubble look on my face. I typically use a Wahl beard trimmer which gives me the trim I need but has its own limitations. So I figured this Philips Norelco unit might offer some improvements. The Norelco is much more sophisticated than my old-fashioned  Wahl in terms of the design - it is lightweight, has a rubberized finish that feels less likely to slip out of my hands, has no attachments to lose and has a nifty turn dial to change length settings. However as others have noted this is a beard trimmer rather than a stubble trimmer. I wish there was a setting between 1 and 2. I find the 2 setting to be a bit too long. I also would not classify anything beyond 2 as \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;. All of the settings beyond 2 are of no use to me - if you like to trim a beard then these settings might be useful, but this is not a \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; trimmer.    The other major difference between this unit and my old Wahl is that the head on the Norelco is wider. This is good for covering larger areas more quickly but when you want to remove the comb/guard in order to do some shaping I find the head size to be a bit too large. This is personal preference and not a product design flaw.    Overall I like this unit and can recommend as a beard trimmer. It is however limited if your objective is stubble.    Also as of this review, the Amazon listing is for Philps rather than Philips. Not sure how you can have a typo error in a product headline but I guess it happens.</li>
    <li> I was first anxious if this will deliver on its promise of Stubble length uniform cutting. But it does a very good job. The lowest setting gives me a very close stubble. And by removing the comb it works as a liner for mustache and sideburns, but not very good as the dedicated ones we get on other norelco product (I used to use a norelco that has all the interchangeable heads). Good battery capacity too. But it is to be noted that it is a very specific type of beard trimmer and will not satisfy all needs. But anyone considering maintaining a stubble should consider getting this as a beard trimmer in addition to whatever hair groomer already in use.</li>
    <li> Worked just fine for a few hours. Now it will not hold a charge at all. Unusable. The worst product I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t get much easier than this. I could use this with my eyes closed and still get a perfect trim. Yeah, a 1.5 setting on the comb would be nice, but as fast as my beard grows it really doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m really not sure why there are settings 3-9.</li>
    <li> This product has worked out great for me. I love it. Does exactly what I need it to.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this trimmer for what seems like forever. I shave my husband&#x27;s head with this and he also trims his beard with it. Our old Norelco trimmer finally wore out after about eight years of use. We wanted to replace it with the exact same trimmer, if at all possible. We finally found it on the Philips Norelco website but kept searching and found it on Amazon. The price on Amazon was considerably cheaper for the exact same trimmer. Our transaction was smooth and we received the trimmer quickly! It arrived in perfect condition and was exactly as described. Hope this trimmer lasts ten years! Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this item for my boyfriend as a birthday gift. It&#x27;s exactly what he wanted however, I&#x27;m giving it one star because the item does not work. DO NOT BUY THIS TRIMMER!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for 8 months, and it is AWESOME. The selectable length of the trim makes for an easy, neat trim. Recharge lasts for months. The only caveat is make sure what length you are on BEFORE you start trimming..I wanted to trim my eye brows and wound up shaving them off..</li>
    <li> You wouldn&#x27;t know it by the model number or the name, but this seems to be the successor to the long-discontinued Norelco T860 Beard and Mustache Trimmer. My T860 lasted for years and years, and in fact it&#x27;s still working, although the battery now only lasts a few days. The QT4021, besides changing the color to black/red and adding a more grippable rubber coating on the handle, upgraded the battery from NiCad to NiMH.    As others have pointed out, this is more of a beard and mustache trimmer (as it was originally named as the T860). This trimmer is smaller than the gargantuan vacuum trimmers such as the [[ASIN:B000FED5D0 Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer]], and fits into smaller spaces like the area between the nose and the upper lip. If the QT4021 holds up for me as well as did the T860, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> I had this trimmer for close to 4 months. I got it from Walmart. Could not turn it on/off towards the end. Had to trash this and get a new one. If you care about $30 dont buy. Its not worth it.</li>
    <li> Since I only have a goatee to trim this product is perfect for my needs.  There are no other attachments to keep track of since it&#x27;s just a trimmer.  I like that.  This QT4021 trimmer has a very strong and solid feel in my hands. I&#x27;ve been using it over one month already, every other day, and it&#x27;s still on the original charge.  It&#x27;s recommended to fully drain the trimmer before recharging again. Along with the strong and solid feel, it glides along nicely with the contours of my chin/goatee area.  The rubberized grip feels very secure in my hands.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this product.  I get a very even and consistent look after using it each time.</li>
    <li> **UPDATE**  The Norelco QT4021 stubble trimmer is a source of total amazement to me.  I had owned various kinds, usually made by Wahl which don’t live very long.  They are shipped with a package of loose pieces and parts guaranteed to get separated from the trimmer.  If you use a guard it’s going to get lost, and you’ll be putting batteries in to the grave.  I inherited the first Norelco QT4021, and when it’s not replaceable batteries fizzled I threw it out and ordered a new one for $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That one is still in service, and it’s batteries wouldn’t hold a charge any more about 3-4 years ago.  So, I went back to e-bay and amazon looking for another one and find these things with a retail price of $175 from the manufacturer. WHOA!  What happened here causing this ordinary trimmer to be priced as if it’s a precision scientific instrument or something?  I still don’t know, but I again look today and most retailers are wanting $320 for this thing, with a few still at $175-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s absolutely the best in the business because it’s guard is made as a part of the body and there are no loose parts to get lost.  The cutter flips open for cleaning, and it’s made of rugged plastic.  But, it is NOT worth any $320 by any means, nor $120 either.  I have am still here totally in disbelief because I have personal knowledge they sold them for many years for $30 and then WHAM!  The price went soaring and it’s still climbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been running it with the cord connected which is a royal pain in the back side.  I like it so well I’m almost afraid to take it down to batteries plus to see if they can open it without damage because they might ruin it.  When it dies, Norelco gets a money back warranty I’m not paying them $320 for any kind of trimmer.  It’s most attractive selling point is the no loose parts, but that is NOT worth an extra $200-something dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m still sitting here wondering what provoked this price to go soaring, and I’ll probably never know.  I’m reminded that I DID NOT WANT A DRILL; I wanted a hole. If you’ll spend $175-$320 on a new one you get free shipping!!  WELL HOW SWEET OF THEM!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Original review***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already owned one of these and wore the batteries completely out, so I knew exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper out paces any other similar size clipper from other brands, or styles.  It&#x27;s blade guard is permanently affixed, and adjustable, so it can&#x27;t get lost, and eliminates the need to protect the blades with a separate cover when stored.  The blade assembly flips open so you can clean and lubricate the drive mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fault free example of excellence in engineering.  I only wish the batteries were user replaceable, but if they did that, their sales of new units would plummet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned many of these over many years, and the Norelco is consistently better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever owned or used.er know.

    <li> \\&quot;Flexible\\&quot; comb is just on a hinge with a spring.  When bent in all the way, it catches beard hairs leading to \\&quot;ouch.\\&quot;  When not bent in all the way, results in uneven trimming.  This feature does nothing except cause trouble and add moving parts that can break.    Cord on charger is annoying.  Not coiled, so makes a mess.  But they do provide an incorporated velcro strip to keep it tidier when not in use.    Trimmer throws cut hairs for miles around, much worse than my previous old Panasonic trimmers, which cut equally well.    Depth adjustment ring (\\&quot;zoom\\&quot;) is made from a tactilely nice soft material, but this material is very effective at clinging to cut hairs which are very hard to brush off it, just like tacky glue.    Note that this unit uses NiMH batteries, much better than NiCd&#x27;s used on cheaper units, but not as good as Li-ion used on more expensive units.    Norelco&#x27;s customer service which I contacted was in New Brunswick, Canada (NJ-ites: note CANADA), unlike Panasonic&#x27;s, which was in the Phillipines.  As you would expect, the folks in Canada were intelligent, informed, with good communications skills.  The Panasonic people in the Phillipines -- well, you know.  Also, the Norelco people indicated that the comb part typically would be covered under warranty if it broke.  The Panasonic people said the combs on their units (complained about on these pages) are not covered, because they are \\&quot;replaceable.\\&quot; The Panasonic people also were unable to provide consistent info about the length of their warranty.</li>
    <li> Bought two within a 1 year period, Both had same issue. Switch and led indicator light stopped working after3 months of use. Unit would not shut off Had to unplug it to stop it.Could not be charged because of faulty switch. Did not learn my lesson when the first one broke, so I bought another one. Same issue. My bad. Other than the switch issue, the unit is fantastic.For some unknown reason, the cost of the unit jumped from the mid $30&#x27;s to well over $100.00 Too much money for a unit with a poorly engineered switch. Back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> great product my 2nd one</li>
    <li> I was give this same trimmer as a gift. My son borrowed it and requested it for xmas This trimmer is expensive but worth the price.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t fully charge for at least 24 hours. It will run on battery power for about 3 days. Therefore waiting at least 24 hours or more to fully charge the trimmer is just too long.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace older model I had for years. Just like first one, the cordless operation failed to work almost right away. The batteries suck. If you plug it in and don&#x27;t mind being near outlet, it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me this trimmer years ago for Xmas.  What a crappy trimmer.  The settings are two too big for stubble.  It&#x27;s like a full beard trimmer.  The cord curls up like a tightly wound spring which means you can&#x27;t pull it very far from the wall.  That&#x27;s a problem because the battery is weak and won&#x27;t hold a charge after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to do any fine trimming you can take the guide off but the trimmer is so wide that fine trimming is a bit risky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife spent so much on this that I didn&#x27;t want to hurt her feeling by replacing it until it died.  Thing lastest forever and I hated trimming my beard with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for nearly 8 years, and my girlfriend still forces me to go with the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look. I haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
    <li> ***Just noticed this is 130 dollars? WTF? I bought it for basically 100 dollars cheaper 3 or 4 years ago, what happened?...Regardless, still a great product, but man***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this a few years ago and it is still going strong!! This was my first electric trimmer and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. I use it to keep my beard at a nice length and I use it on my sideburns and neck. I also use it for maintaining other areas of my body as well. It requires very little maintenance - it involved me opening it up after using it and dumping the hair out, that&#x27;s it and even that literally takes 5 seconds.  It allows me to maintain that nice stubble look. I remove the guard a lot to get more precision in tough areas. The adjustable guard is nice, but I usually only use 1 length (to keep it clean for my job). The only chance you have for getting cut by this is if you remove the guard and trim, but other than that I feel very safe running along my face. I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends already.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer several years ago. I used it about once a week to shave down my stubble. I don&#x27;t really have a beard but was too lazy too shave. This product worked very well for a year (I&#x27;m guessing) I&#x27;d charge it over night and it would hold the charge for several uses. Again, I only used it once or twice a week. After a year, the battery would not hold a charge for more than 2 uses. Now it&#x27;s barely one if I charge it overnight. I have to race to shave before I run out of juice. I ordered a newer model Philips recently; one with a lithium ion battery. So long and thanks for the memories QT4021. It was hot in the beginning then our relationship fizzled.</li>
    <li> The reason this product received 4 stars is because it is a great trimmer. I purchased this trimmer to replace the one I have had for about 10 years. The old trimmer worked great but the battery gave out. The style is the same and I am happy they did not change the features on the new one. I am sure I will get many years service out of the new one.</li>
    <li> this is THE BEST stubble trimmer available, consistent length all over AND very powerful since it does not run off batteries or charge, but plug right into wall. very easy to clean,,,,the best!</li>
    <li> I was excited when the Vine program offered this as my 18 year old son loves having the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look but has found it hard to maintain. His feedback on this Norelco Stubble Trimmer is:    - easy to use  - comfortable to hold  - great for its intended purpose, i.e.,  having a constant light beard of stubble  - not so great at any other trimming level  - no battery indicator  - ability to use cordless in shower or away from bathroom/outlet is a bonus    Overall, he&#x27;s really happy with the unit and has used it regularly for about a week. Simple, easy to use, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - what&#x27;s not to like?    This is his only experience with a stubble trimmer, so keep that in mind when evaluating this item based on its usefulness and purchase price. It was a free item for us from Vine, but my son said he&#x27;d have used his own money to buy it for under ~30.</li>
    <li> Norelco&#x27;s new shaver really does a good job in removing stubble from hard to reach areas.  I always have problems in removing stubble from areas under the chin and at the neck.  This is the first shaver that does a pretty good job in taking care of that problem. It provides nine different settings to assist with your particular problem areas.  My main reason for trying this shaver was to reach these tough areas, and not for trimming stuble, sideburns, etc.  The price is a little high, but Norelco products generally last a long time, so it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does the job but it&#x27;s a pretty basic product. It doesn&#x27;t have an indicator to tell you the battery is fully charged or low, uses a nicad battery that has memory effects, and only the shortest setting is really a stubble setting. The other settings are too long and are more for trimming bears and sideburns.    Essentially it&#x27;s a clipper that has a swiveling guard that you can rotate to adjust the length it will cut to.    After using a high-end Braun or Norelco shaver this feel like a cheap toy. But it works. I haven&#x27;t shaved in two weeks and I&#x27;ve been relying on just the stubble trimmer to keep things under control.</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t buy this item from Amazon, I bought a different Norelco that I returned because it didn&#x27;t create that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look I was going for. This razor, however, did. The number 1 setting is perfect for 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and the settings are in really nice, short, increments. I would recommend this to anyone looking for short stubble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl&#x27;s 9854L All-In-One Lithium Ion beard trimmer for several months as a stubble trimmer. It seemed to take 20 or more passes over all my face to get an even cut because the lifting blade guides were designed so poorly. SO GLAD I SWITCHED. I only need to do one or two passes over for an even cut with the Norelco. Huge time saver.</li>
    <li> This is nothing more or less than a beard trimmer. It does a poor job as a stubble shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my second one that I have purchased.  I gave the first one to my son.  Excellent trimmer and the first one is still going after 3 years.  I recommend this product very hihgly.</li>
    <li> A decent shaver. I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 weeks now. The build quality is OK, but nothing special. The adjustable levels of the shaver is quick &amp; easy. The lowest level 1 is OK for stubble, but I often take the guard off for areas for a better stubble look. No charger, or stand, so expect to just plug this in &amp; leave it on a shelf or the side of the sink. Cleans fairly easy even with the guard on, with no real problems yet with hair getting stuck &amp; difficult to remove from the trimmer.    I&#x27;ve been using it for a goatee, and there is no precision/small head, so getting more elaborate beard/goatee looks isn&#x27;t possible with this unit alone.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Much better than the newer one from Philips.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a foolproof way to shorten your facial hair (or body hair for that matter) this is great.  It works fantastic, cuts quick and easy, doesn&#x27;t get clogged up with hair, easy to adjust, holds a charge for a LONG time.    Only downside is that you cannot use without the guard.  So if you want to do any &#x27;edge work&#x27; or shaping, you need to have another trimmer.     Seems like an obvious decision to just use the other trimmer for everything, why on earth would you want two?  Let me tell you, this sucker works SOOOO much better than any other facial hair trimmer (or body hair) that its not even fair to compare them. The fact that the guard does not come off, only adjusts, is excellent as it wont get lost.  It is very easy to adjust, simply rotate, it has nice secure click-stops at every length.  Doesnt shift or change heights while in use.  This thing just hands-down beats everything else when it comes to speed, power, consistency, battery life, and ease of use.    Like I said, the only thing that&#x27;s not perfect about it is that you need to use something else to do any shaping you require.</li>
    <li> I have used several beard trimmers in the past, and this one is the best. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is light and maneuverable.&lt;br /&gt;* It is self-contained: there are no separate parts and trimming guides to lose.&lt;br /&gt;* You can adjust the trimming length WHILE the unit is running, unlike other brands where the unit has to be off to adjust the length.&lt;br /&gt;* The trimming guide is removable, so you can adjust hairlines directly with the blades.&lt;br /&gt;* The battery charge lasts for weeks with typical use. [EDIT, DECEMBER 2009: NEVERMIND! See below.]&lt;br /&gt;* The blades are sharp and can be used to trim your beard very precisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure why they call it a \\&quot;Stubble Trimmer\\&quot; as it doesn&#x27;t seem any different than all the other beard trimmers that I&#x27;ve used in the past -- the length goes from longish stubble to full beard length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A real \\&quot;stubble trimmer\\&quot; would have far more precise trimming abilities at the low end. The trimming guide goes from 1-9 in length, and the only setting that could be said to be \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;-like is setting 1. Anything more than that and you&#x27;re into short beard territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for something for excellent detail work with your stubble, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. But if you&#x27;re looking for an all around excellent beard trimmer, I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT, DECEMBER 2009 -- Reduced to 2 stars because of poor battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, folks, it was nice while it lasted. When I first got this stubble trimmer it held a charge for weeks. Now it barely holds enough charge to get through a couple trims. I will plug it in overnight and get perhaps 5 or 10 minutes of usage out of it -- and the motor doesn&#x27;t stay fast throughout that whole time, but rather starts getting slower and slower until it is almost useless long before it COMPLETELY stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same thing happened with a previous Norelco trimmer of mine, and a Norelco shaver. They are very impressive when you first get them, but within a few months the batteries just won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very frustrating.arge anymore.    Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough but this was the only \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; trimmer I could find on the market. I have been using the same beard trimmer for about 10 years simply because I couldn&#x27;t find anything that could cut shorter unless it was a clean shave. When I found this I was ecstatic cause on the 1 setting, I finally got the look I&#x27;ve wanted for over a decade. It cuts the hair roughly 1mm high which for me is perfect, not too high, not too low. It&#x27;s light, the ergonomic shape feels good in the hand, and the spring guide makes the head glide over your face, so all in all, this is great for the price.     To avoid putting my foot in mouth I will say this...I did just get this and even though I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the charging, when it starts to lose power, it loses it fast, so the other reviewers are on to something with the battery life. It comes with a cord to recharge it or to use plugged in so I don&#x27;t see that being an issue for me.     Hopefully if a new version comes out in the future Philps can improve on the battery life...but for now, good job and Thank You Philps!!!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great. It&#x27;s easy to use. The price is right. I am completely satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone. That&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works exactly as it says it would with one small caveat.  THE BATTERY SUCKS SOOOOO BAD ON THIS THING!!!  I cannot state this any louder.  I got the trimmer in the mail, plugged it in for about 2 hours to give it a small charge, then used it.  WORKED GREAT!  Then I went to use it the second time and it died within 30seconds of turning it on.  THIS WAS THE 2ND TIME I HAD USED IT!!  Then I charged it all night a full 10 hours like it says in the directions.  The next day I used it again to finish the job from earlier, and it died again after about 5 minutes of use - this was after a FULL charge.  However, if you don&#x27;t mind plugging it in and using it with the cord, it works absolutely wonderful.  But if you are planning to not be with electricity for a while, you may want to consider something with a MUCH MUCH longer battery life, or better battery altogether.  I give this a 4 out of 5, solely because of the battery issue, other than that, the shave is perfect for what I want.  I trim about 2 times a week to keep the stubble nice and neat, and it does a great job at stubble trimming!</li>
    <li> Closest trim was not close enough and did not hold it&#x27;s charge after about 4 months.</li>
    <li> PROS: love it and I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it since I want it for life&lt;br /&gt;CONS: This was made back in 2010 I think and it&#x27;s still this expensive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave in on the high price since stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore, Target used to carry it for $60.00 US&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love it so much that I didn&#x27;t mind spending the money.</li>
    <li> After meticulously following the charging instructions/warnings for this product, it worked like a dream twice. It never turned on again afterwards, regardless of what I tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s well designed; that&#x27;s obvious from the packaging.   - Only one attachment for all length levels (As opposed to 9 like nearly every other trimmer)   - looks great and feels great in your hand    BUT, the materials are cheap. It&#x27;s light and feels flimsy. The adjustable attachment sometimes goes closer to the blades if I press it hard agains my face - that&#x27;s a big deal because now I&#x27;ve got to trim the rest of my face at that length! The top part of the blades will swing up so you can clean the inside, however it also comes off by accident sometimes when I tap it against the sink.    My biggest complaint is regarding the blades. I have a full beard and need a nice, consistent, even trim. However, the blades are cheap and give me split ends and kinked hairs. Drives me crazy and I end up picking at my beard all day.    My next complaint is that the adjustable attachment doesn&#x27;t pull my hairs up enough to cut all of them. So, I have to trim more often trying to get an even trim.    In all, it&#x27;s ok. If you&#x27;re looking for a close trim (level 1-5), then this is fine but if you want longer facial hair, go with something better like a Remington or Wahl.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s utility as a beard trimmer, but the first setting really does create a nice stubble look. It has been holding up well, it holds a charge, and is evidently not painful.</li>
    <li> I opened the box and read he instructions.  It told me to plug it in for 10 hours to get a full charge.  The charge light is supposed to come on and stay on even when fully charged.  I plugged it in to several outlets but the charge light won&#x27;t come on.  I&#x27;m taking it back.  Reading other reviews, it is obvious that many of them are junk.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer....had the T765 before this and its now the replacement for it.....great trimmer and works terrific</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the Norelco QT4021.  I had an earlier version that was outstanding but after 5 years the internal battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge so I purchased this one as a replacement thinking I was buying the same if not even improved performance.  Not true, this is a classic case of should have left well enough alone.  The handle is now a rubbery material that&#x27;s very hard to clean and while it&#x27;s only a month old it looks to be a year old.  And while brand new this one is not as sharp as my first one and I get some beard-pull while trimming.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.  I bought this because my previous one was superb and this is the identical design, the only problem is all the cosmetic changes prepresent a step backward and as for the blade not being as sharp, that&#x27;s a mystery - I won&#x27;t think that technology has gone backwards.  I would not recommend this unit - the old version definitely, the new version is a thumbs-down!</li>
    <li> very consistent and easy to use</li>
    <li> even stubble all the way around</li>
    <li> Been trimming the beard short for quite some time. This trimmer is the bomb! There are many choices when trying to keep the beard the way you want. This unit does it all at a fare price.</li>
    <li> Great! I have had some form of beard for over thirty years. This is far and away the best trimmer I have ever had. Last three Wahls died almost immediately. Buy this one. I am very satisfied with all aspects. One thing - buy a small brush for cleaning the handle. The rubber makes the beard hairs stick to it. Love the feel, though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer after having read almost all reviews of it on Amazon. Most of them say that it&#x27;s a good trimmer although it&#x27;s battery won&#x27;t last.  I can verify the second, but I can live with it since I get the job done.    The problem is that this trimmer leaves patches on the stubble because the outer plastic comb&#x27;s (see picture) teeth are not closely packed enough. Although I can estimate that this trimmer is good enough for beards, it CERTAINLY ISN&#x27;T good enough for your stubble.    2/5</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal Trimmer - I&#x27;ve used mine for about half a year and love it - HOWEVER - I bought this Trimmer for $30 at a Shoppers Drugmart. DO NOT PAY $127.00 for it, under any circumstances.</li>
    <li> The shaver works great, though I&#x27;m not sure why it gets the designation \\&quot;stubble trimmer.\\&quot; It&#x27;s just a regular beard trimmer, and to really get a short stubble look you&#x27;ve got to take off the comb entirely and use the blades directly on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given this two stars because the battery life is absolutely unacceptable. The \\&quot;35 minutes\\&quot; stated in the product description is, in my experience, not accurate. Even after a full over-night change, the battery lasts just a few trims - the motor gets slower and slower until it finally dies. Really disappointing, as otherwise it&#x27;s a great shaver. But the battery issue is a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wanted to try out the stubble look, so I bought this for him a few weeks ago. He uses it every other day and it really looks good on him. He says the guard feels really smooth on his skin and gives him that perfect rugged shadow look he wants. Take off the guard and the trimmer gets a nice close cut on the neck and face, but I still refer when he uses a traditional razor to clean up these areas. Not everyone can pull off the stuble look, so save the receipt just in case.</li>
    <li> Got it in 2010, using it every week to fix my beard, able to get wet with no issues, still works great, battery keeps charge for 2-3 uses,(when new charged it every 5-10 times).... but now at 3 years old and it has seen a lot of miles.  I clean it and oil the blades after each use, blade on it is still sharp and no rust. Would gladly get again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this same trimmer for three or four years now, and it works just as great as day one. I use it about twice a week on average. Great for stubble or a full beard of a reasonable length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to charge it maybe once a month or so. There&#x27;s no indication if needing to replace it!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Not only do I save a boatload on razors, but the women I date LOVE the beard and even 5 o clock shadow look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single, lazy, men - this is for you.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco QT4021 is a quality product that has never disappointed me.  It holds a long charge and I have never had the experience where it did not power up as soon as I hit the ON button.  The trimmer easily cuts and trims my beard with good results.  Setting the depth of the allowed beard length takes the guessing game of making a symmetrical trim of the beard.</li>
    <li> I bought these on 2010 and still works OK.  Of course I have to charge it every 3 shaves but not a problem with me.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend Norelco Products.</li>
    <li> Great razer was very suprised</li>
    <li> Does it all.  No pain.  No pulling. Really works! And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer probably 2 years ago, and immediately I LOVED IT! I still have it, hoping that if I charge it long enough it will work again. I used it weekly to keep my beard trim and neat, and I was never dissatisfied with the results. It never pulled hairs, was always even, and easy to clean. For not being a vacuum trimmer, it was perfect -- except for the battery life. Every product wears down over time, but this one just suddenly died. It stopped holding charges and would only work when plugged into the wall. Then one day it died completely. I can&#x27;t turn it on anymore, and it will not charge. This was the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, and any product I get to replace it will be hard pressed to live up to it. If I could improve it, there would only be two things -- better battery life, and a vacuum function.</li>
    <li> It was not very long after I started using this trimmer before the battery did not hold a charge for very long.</li>
    <li> Wow. I guess I got a real bargain for this razor. I purchased at TJ MAXX on sale. and there were at least 10 in stock. I have not used it much and have no idea if it will be as good as my previous Norelco. But I will now appreciate it more considering it is on here for over $100 bucks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a goatee or beard for the last 15 years on or off and mostly on.  I also buzzed my head for 5 years before I gave up and just started shaving it.  So I&#x27;ve seen a LOT of beard trimmers in my time.  Corded or Cordless, no accessories, tons of accesories including a nose hair ripper, a lot of different ones is my point.  This is the only one I&#x27;ve bought twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given this \\&quot;stubble trimmer\\&quot; 4 stars, even though I would, and have bought it again.  Here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Lowest setting is a good stubble length for body hair&lt;br /&gt;Lowest setting is nice for starting over on a beard or goatee&lt;br /&gt;Good, even cut and you don&#x27;t have to go over an area 15 times.  Hair moves though, so no trimmer allows you to go over a spot only once.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rechargable, and while the battery is good it holds a long charge&lt;br /&gt;The blade guard comes completely off and it&#x27;s easy to clean up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is poor, and that&#x27;s really the difference between 4 stars and 5 at this level of trimmer.  I can get a good solid 2 years out of one, which isn&#x27;t bad all in all, but I use it for 10-12 minutes at a time a few times a month.  That&#x27;s not a ton of usage over it&#x27;s lifespan.  I think it should last quite a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one con wasn&#x27;t enough to stop me from purchasing the same one again and the new one is working great right now 2 months in.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice beard trimmer.  It is very smooth on the face, unlike many others I have used.  It quickly adjusts without having to switch blade adapters (I always seemed to lose those).  It holds it&#x27;s charge well even 5 years later.  Size-wise it&#x27;s perfect -- not too big or too small.  It is very light.</li>
    <li> Great product but this was so expensive. I still wonder why the price is so variable on this thing.</li>
    <li> Works very well and blade settings are easy to use.  I use it weekly.  Battery life is also very good.</li>
    <li> The trimmer has a very good precision as expected from the stubble trimmer. It is easy to clean and use. However the battery life is terrible. I noticed that Norelco hair trimmer, built probably on the same base, has the same problem.</li>
    <li> for $80 was expecting this thing to be a bit nicer. it works.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this thing is selling for around $100. It&#x27;s a questionable value at half that. Not a bad trimmer when it&#x27;s working but it never holds a charge. I think I spent around $50 for this and if I had to do it over, I would not. A hundred, you have got to be kidding me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/7/2013 Edit - reduced to 2 stars because battery is worse than bad, it&#x27;s horrible!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these a few years back and really liked it. Its started acting up recently, so I thought I&#x27;d shop for another one. How is an item that I bought new for maybe $40-$50 a few years back now selling from $100-$200? If someone can explain this, I&#x27;d certainly appreciate it. Seems a bit fishy to me though. Maybe I&#x27;ll buy several of Norelco&#x27;s current model run-of-the-mill trimmers now, then sell them at a 200 percent mark up a few years from now. Weird. Any thoughts on this?</li>
    <li> I like the trimmer and I would recommend it to anyone. I usually use it mostly for facial hair but have also used it multiple times for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Writing this review on September 2014 while Amazon is showing me &amp;#34;You purchased this item on November 28, 2010&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this, its not the end all of stubble trimmers. Works fine for my needs of my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Consistent, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big thing, flip up clipper head, to knock out the the cut hair from the trimmer. Does not require screw driver or anything else to clean.</li>
</ol>
