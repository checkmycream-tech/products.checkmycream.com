### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Also the the shipping speed was great!</li>
      <li>Very impressed with my remington and their parts.  </li>
      <li>The Nerds&#x27; price was the among the best for the item, and with shipping, was the best deal.  </li>
      <li>i have used Remington for years and find it to be an excellent choice.</li>
      <li>Remington SP-390 Foil and Cutter Set ... perfect and lower cost than I could find elsewhere...</li>
      <li>a great deal</li>
      <li>It is a great comfort to her to know this tool could be a life saver.</li>
      <li>Product was great until the foil broke causing skin to be exposed to the cutters.</li>
      <li>Good product,</li>
      <li>This item is a good buy for the price.</li>
      <li>Good way to keep your razor running well and not hurting your face when you shave.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and works perfectly.</li>
      <li>I was happy with the price but the product did take longer than most shipments to receive.</li>
      <li>Each one has been great, no issues, no manufacturing glitches, and a much better price/way easier to find, then in a store.  </li>
      <li>Amazon was very good about a full refund.</li>
      <li>Outstanding!  </li>
      <li>Nice...</li>
      <li>Perfect, very fast shipping, Thanks!</li>
      <li>so they would lock into the razor with more pressure on them so they would stay on the razor when you shaved with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to get the replacement OEM parts.</li>
      <li>pleased with the quality and value.</li>
      <li>Okay.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was satisfied with the purchase price and with the quality of the item.</li>
      <li>have read many reviews for both the Remington shaver and the replacement heads and&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the head design and no razor burn.</li>
      <li>The closeness of the shave improves greatly when they are new.</li>
      <li>Sure, but in all my years, I have come to know how valuable a comfortable razor is, and for me, I&#x27;d rather spend money replacing the foil and blades.</li>
      <li>Love this shaver and these are the original replacements</li>
      <li>Installed easily.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good product and fair price.</li>
      <li>When new, this foil and cutter set works well, giving a good shave.</li>
      <li>Otherwise product works fine.</li>
      <li>Everything fit easily and</li>
      <li>That works fine.  </li>
      <li>They work fine</li>
      <li>It does fit though</li>
      <li>It fit and has worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
      <li>bought the shaver at Target, which has never seen fit to offer the replacement cutter and foils.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this product with the expectation that it would fit my razor.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The cutters fit, but their supports are flimsier than the originals.</li>
      <li>I have tried workarounds like trying to bend I wider for tighter fit but problem reoccurs...dissappointed.</li>
      <li>Nice reasonably price product.</li>
      <li>Regardless, the plastic foil housing doesn&#x27;t fit the shaver.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I had not discarded the original foil.</li>
      <li>The foil housing is shorter than the original one that came on the razor.</li>
      <li>While the cutters snapped into place, I had to swap the foil from the plastic head in came in to the original plastic head that came with my razor.  </li>
      <li>I took out the original parts and replaced them with these.  </li>
      <li>times a day for 10 minutes each, i just used the shaver to give me a clean start for when&lt;br /&gt;i would use my shaver and shaving cream or for a quick touch up at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love the Remington razor, but was unable to find this set at a brick and mortar locaction - was very happy with price, service, and promptness of getting my replacements.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly.  </li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t fit the shaver exactly.  </li>
      <li>My old head on my electric shaver wore out and was cutting me up, this replacement part is perfect for my razor and in some regards superior to what I originally came with it</li>
      <li>This is an exact duplication of the original equipmnent.</li>
      <li>Shame on Remington for offering this kind of shoddiness to their (former) customers!</li>
      <li>This product was exactly as stated and works great and was half the price if purchased from Remington.  </li>
      <li>Ok so why is the replacement foil assembly smaller than the original part.  </li>
      <li>but I had problems getting the first of the three cutters in its slot.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are exact replacements</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>There are no surprises with this, it is an exact replacement.</li>
      <li>The package clearly states it is made to replace the cutters and foil head that were originally included with my razor model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The noise was three times as loud as my original shaver head and it seemed to take longer to shave.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, when the day comes that simply replacing the cutters and the foils isn&#x27;t good enough and I need to buy a new shaver, guess what store I won&#x27;t be shopping at?</li>
      <li>As hard as this was to find at a good price, I have to ask is Remington out of Business?</li>
      <li>Thanks again.</li>
      <li>Not so much a problem with The Nerds as with Remington</li>
      <li>Probably because I forget and apply too much pressure.</li>
      <li>If you are like me, and you find a razor that you really like, then you want to keep it until it dies.</li>
      <li>It seems not to fit the shaver head as snugly as prior replacement sets did.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these replacement heads when i purchased my Remington shaver just over a year ago in April of 2011, and what a piece of junk, the original heads only lasted about 2 months&lt;</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t 100% the same as the original foil.  </li>
      <li>Appears the same size as the original foil, but the rear anchor slot does not engage and when razor turned on to shave, the foil pops out.  </li>
      <li>I used the original parts for a long time, much longer than recommended by the manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>Could have purchased two new razors with cost of replacements to date!  </li>
      <li>Great price on an item that is hard to find in local stores.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it had been previously used, but couldn&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My original foils lasted only 7-8 months and then developed holes.</li>
      <li>A new shaver screen has a raised pattern around each hole inside the screen.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d recommend getting this rather than getting a new razor.</li>
      <li>I wonder what happens if you buy a new Remington shaver now - does the head pop off when you turn it on?</li>
      <li>I ended up purchasing a new shaver.  </li>
      <li>I got when the razor was new.</li>
      <li>All is well with the new blades/foil --- thank you.</li>
      <li>Could I go buy a new razor after about three of these replacements?</li>
      <li>Pull off the foil and cutters and just snap the new ones into place.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically like having a brand new razor.</li>
      <li>You can hold it in with your fingers or use a piece of duct tape to hold it in position, but the best thing to do is SAVE YOUR OLD PLASTIC SHAVER HEAD foil holder, remove the bad foils and replace them with new foils from this kit.  </li>
      <li>Maybe Remington will start making parts that fit properly  again later.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, this price point is low enough to justify purchase.  </li>
      <li>The cutters/blades seem exact, but the foil/cover is slightly different.  </li>
      <li>I had to take the new screens out and put the new screens in the old plastic.</li>
      <li>The Remington SP-390 Foil and Cutter Set was rec&#x27;d quickly and as expected.</li>
      <li>The new assembly actually forces the blades down just a little bit more than the original part.  </li>
      <li>The fit varies just a little with each set.</li>
      <li>The original foil and cutters that came with the razor lasted less than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Why?  </li>
      <li>It does cut smoother than my old worn out blades.  </li>
      <li>This was a replacement for my dad&#x27;s razor as at 75 years old, he is kinda set in his ways.</li>
      <li>I replace these when my old screens get a hole in them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If you are like me, and you find a razor that you really like, then you want to keep it until it dies. Unfortunately, the foil and blades don&#x27;t last nearly as long. I replace mine about every six months. Could I go buy a new razor after about three of these replacements? Sure, but in all my years, I have come to know how valuable a comfortable razor is, and for me, I&#x27;d rather spend money replacing the foil and blades.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t 100% the same as the original foil.  The cutters/blades seem exact, but the foil/cover is slightly different.  It does fit though and I&#x27;ve had no issues with the shaver using this replacement.</li>
    <li> See above ^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the product numerous times. It&#x27;s basically like having a brand new razor. Good product, and I&#x27;d recommend getting this rather than getting a new razor.</li>
    <li> Screens never seem to last very long! Develop cracks and scratch face.  Not sure how long they should last, but should definitely be longer than 45 days.  Could have purchased two new razors with cost of replacements to date!  Would not recommend a Remington Razor!</li>
    <li> i have used Remington for years and find it to be an excellent choice. Love the head design and no razor burn.</li>
    <li> Remington SP-390 Foil and Cutter Set ... perfect and lower cost than I could find elsewhere... Usually the price of the shaver is low enough and the price of the replacement foil and cutters was high enough that I have simply purchased new shavers... As usual my purchase was as described and arrived sooner than promised... Nice...</li>
    <li> I received it in the requested time frame and it was a pleasure when I shave the first time as my old blade was cutting my face. Thanks!</li>
    <li> There has been a design/manufacturing change in the black plastic retainer that holds the flex screens. The head assembly will not stay in place when the shaver is running. It is fairly simple to remove the 3 individual screens from the old retainer and replace them with the screens from the new retainer, just be sure not to discard the old black plastic retainer.</li>
    <li> Okay.  The original foil and cutters that came with the razor lasted less than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Why?  Because I was pressing hard to get it to cut decently.  This replacement foil and cutters&lt;br /&gt;work a great deal better.&lt;br /&gt;It is STILL not as close as a blade or as close as my old Remington razor, but the old Remington&lt;br /&gt;is falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;This foil and these cutters do give a decent, if not spectacular shave.  Everything fit easily and&lt;br /&gt;worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Still, it isn&#x27;t as close as the previous razor OR a blade, but it works decently now.</li>
    <li> I purchased these replacement heads when i purchased my Remington shaver just over a year ago in April of 2011, and what a piece of junk, the original heads only lasted about 2 months&lt;br /&gt;then i used these replacement heads and they barely lasted 2 months, it&#x27;s not that i shave&lt;br /&gt;4 times a day for 10 minutes each, i just used the shaver to give me a clean start for when&lt;br /&gt;i would use my shaver and shaving cream or for a quick touch up at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I have read many reviews for both the Remington shaver and the replacement heads and&lt;br /&gt;see the majority were negative, so now i live and learn not to purchase another&lt;br /&gt;Remington foil head shaver and the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t fit the shaver exactly.  The new plastic is not the same as the old one.  So to get it to work I had to take the new screens out and put the new screens in the old plastic. Probably got sold a defective product and got it at retail prices.  Or maybe there was a design change along the way.  Regardless, the plastic foil housing doesn&#x27;t fit the shaver.</li>
    <li> It may be me or I could be a little off ,but the blades brought here seam to last longer than others I have order. There seams to be a difference in the the design of the blade holder making me think there could be a aftermarket production of these blades. What ever it is I will be ordering my replacement blades here.</li>
    <li> I got it in Feb. It fit and has worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
    <li> Because the shaver is not that expensive, there is no point in spending a lot of money for parts. Fortunately, this price point is low enough to justify purchase.  My original foils lasted only 7-8 months and then developed holes. Probably because I forget and apply too much pressure. Yes, I use the spray lubricant after every time I wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are exact replacements but I had problems getting the first of the three cutters in its slot. After several frustrating minutes, it just popped in. Note that force is not needed, just the proper angle. The other two went in with little trouble.</li>
    <li> Replacement foil does not fit my electric Remington model number f5790.  Appears the same size as the original foil, but the rear anchor slot does not engage and when razor turned on to shave, the foil pops out.  Fortunately, I had not discarded the original foil.</li>
    <li> When new, this foil and cutter set works well, giving a good shave. However, the foil doesn&#x27;t last long enough. This is the third set I have had to buy in the 18 months I have owned the shaver. In fact, the shaver is now just a spare that I keep for travel. For daily use it has been replaced by a Braun.</li>
    <li> Works for us, as we have few choices locally, once again the internet saves my day.  Peace out shaving souls</li>
    <li> Product arrived in short order, but the packaging for the screen and blades had been opened and scotch taped back.  I don&#x27;t think it had been previously used, but couldn&#x27;t be sure.  It does cut smoother than my old worn out blades.  I&#x27;m guessing this company receives product that has been opened and can&#x27;t be sold at the store, so they discount it online.</li>
    <li> Once I found the part number, I ordered. It was shipped quickly.  I took out the original parts and replaced them with these.  They work fine and I no longer am nicking my face.  I used the original parts for a long time, much longer than recommended by the manufacturer.  The parts work the same as new.  I would recommend to anyone using these parts.  This is an OEM part number.</li>
    <li> Outstanding!  Received my item in less than a week. I will do bussiness with them again.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as stated and works great and was half the price if purchased from Remington.  Thank You</li>
    <li> I have had my Remington Electric shaver for 3 years now and use it 5 days a week (one real shave every sunday, 5 electric shaves each weekday morning) and I am on my third purchase of these replacement foil/cutter sets.  Each one has been great, no issues, no manufacturing glitches, and a much better price/way easier to find, then in a store.  Very impressed with my remington and their parts.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that this item did not work well with my Remington shaver.  The noise was three times as loud as my original shaver head and it seemed to take longer to shave.  I ended up purchasing a new shaver.  Perhaps there was some defect in the replacement head and cutters.</li>
    <li> The plastic holder for the foils does not fit properly, so the vibration of the shaver causes it to pop out.  I&#x27;ve checked other sources and similar comments appear elsewhere, so I guess it is a Remington manufacturing problem.  You can hold it in with your fingers or use a piece of duct tape to hold it in position, but the best thing to do is SAVE YOUR OLD PLASTIC SHAVER HEAD foil holder, remove the bad foils and replace them with new foils from this kit.  That works fine.  Maybe Remington will start making parts that fit properly  again later.  I wonder what happens if you buy a new Remington shaver now - does the head pop off when you turn it on?</li>
    <li> Ok so why is the replacement foil assembly smaller than the original part.  The new assembly actually forces the blades down just a little bit more than the original part.  So, the blades pop the foil assembly out of the razor when its on.  I had to use a piece of packing tape to keep the assembly attached to the razor as I shaved.  WTF!</li>
    <li> The kit works as expected. I was happy with the price but the product did take longer than most shipments to receive. Other than that it&#x27;s a good product and fair price.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Perfect, very fast shipping, Thanks! This was a replacement for my dad&#x27;s razor as at 75 years old, he is kinda set in his ways. I&#x27;m glad I was able to get the replacement OEM parts. Thanks again. Jerry Baker</li>
    <li> My old head on my electric shaver wore out and was cutting me up, this replacement part is perfect for my razor and in some regards superior to what I originally came with it</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the expectation that it would fit my razor.  Pull off the foil and cutters and just snap the new ones into place.  While the cutters snapped into place, I had to swap the foil from the plastic head in came in to the original plastic head that came with my razor.  As hard as this was to find at a good price, I have to ask is Remington out of Business?</li>
    <li> The Remington SP-390 Foil and Cutter Set was rec&#x27;d quickly and as expected. It return my razor to the close shave I got when the razor was new.</li>
    <li> This is the replacement foil and cutter for my Remington shaver.  Love this shaver and these are the original replacements (is that an oxymoron?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time and as expected!</li>
    <li> All is well with the new blades/foil --- thank you. Old foil had hole in it and was nicking my face.</li>
    <li> These cutters and this screen need replacement about once a year. The closeness of the shave improves greatly when they are new. The fit varies just a little with each set. When I remove the screen to blow dust from the cutters, the cutters usually stay in place. But, I have had some sets which allow a cutter to fall out too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did return a set once. I had just bought a new set and shaving was suddenly painful with each stroke. Then I noticed blood on my skin. A small corner on the screen cracked and raised to make a small razor point. Amazon was very good about a full refund.</li>
    <li> Product was great until the foil broke causing skin to be exposed to the cutters. After only 2 months of use I had to purchase another replacement. This is a last chance purchase....next time I&#x27;ll buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> Great price on an item that is hard to find in local stores.  Online price beats local merchants once again.</li>
    <li> Great!&lt;br /&gt;Quick  -  Complete.  No fuss no mess.  Saves a lot of wear and tear from going to Walmart or the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I was unable to find this product at local stores. I was surprised to find this value pack of factory replacement  blades and foils.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the quality and value.</li>
    <li> This item is a good buy for the price. I saved money over buying it at the local store, and it works as expected. I recommend this product for any one that is in need for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was satisfied with the purchase price and with the quality of the item. Also the the shipping speed was great! As usual, Amazon delivered on time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item will save you money and will save you the hassle of going to a store to pick it up.</li>
    <li> This tool stays in my wife&#x27;s car all thee time. It has not been used in an emergency but then we hope there will not be one. It is a great comfort to her to know this tool could be a life saver.</li>
    <li> The foil does not stay hooked in its position while the razor is turned on, I have to push against my chin while I am shaving.</li>
    <li> There is a problem with this product. The unit pops loose periodically in use. I have tried workarounds like trying to bend I wider for tighter fit but problem reoccurs...dissappointed. Otherwise product works fine.</li>
    <li> Good way to keep your razor running well and not hurting your face when you shave.  I replace these when my old screens get a hole in them.</li>
    <li> was exactley what I ordered.  Installed easily.  Will order here again. A A A A A A A A A</li>
    <li> I love the Remington razor, but was unable to find this set at a brick and mortar locaction - was very happy with price, service, and promptness of getting my replacements.</li>
    <li> This is an exact duplication of the original equipmnent. It arrived quickly and works perfectly. Nice reasonably price product. I would order again.</li>
    <li> The foil housing is shorter than the original one that came on the razor. It would&#x27;nt stay locked in to the razor when you would be using it. I took it out to my shop and used my heat gun to make the plastic housing pliable so I could bend the sides outward so they would lock into the razor with more pressure on them so they would stay on the razor when you shaved with it. They need to change their process on making these foil covers. Dennis Geiken.</li>
    <li> Not so much a problem with The Nerds as with Remington, I suppose. I opted to order the replacement foil and cutter set on-line after having difficulty finding it in local retail stores.  (Is Remington still making shavers??  Seems like no one carries them if they do.) The Nerds&#x27; price was the among the best for the item, and with shipping, was the best deal.  The item arrived as promised within 4-6 business days by FedEx Ground.  The product, which had the Remington brand name and licensing info on the package, was \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot;, and definitely seemed to be of poorer quality that prior replacement parts I&#x27;ve purchased at a Remington \\&quot;brand\\&quot; store and in Target and WalMart.  It seems not to fit the shaver head as snugly as prior replacement sets did.  I don&#x27;t doubt that the item was \\&quot;genuine\\&quot;, but I do think the tolerances allowed are too lax.</li>
    <li> There are no surprises with this, it is an exact replacement. It&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the shaver at Target, which has never seen fit to offer the replacement cutter and foils.&lt;br /&gt;So, when the day comes that simply replacing the cutters and the foils isn&#x27;t good enough and I need to buy a new shaver, guess what store I won&#x27;t be shopping at?</li>
    <li> A new shaver screen has a raised pattern around each hole inside the screen. As it wears out, this pattern disappears and the screen doesn&#x27;t cut as well. This one appears to be wearing faster than Braun heads and even earlier Remington heads that I have owned. Since I bought it to replace the original head which failed, it seems Remington is using a slightly softer alloy for these screens now. It is however working so I plan to use it to failure unless it stops adequately cutting.</li>
    <li> I was VERY careful to read everything before I ordered this. The package clearly states it is made to replace the cutters and foil head that were originally included with my razor model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutters fit, but their supports are flimsier than the originals. I don&#x27;t look for them to last long. The big problem is with the foil cover, which fits, but not tightly enough to lock as intended. So, when you turn on the shaver, the foil head pops off. I have now TAPED it on so I can shave! I feel like Red Green with his duct tape he uses to fix everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At nearly HALF THE COST OF THE SHAVER itself, I&#x27;m disappointed in the quality of these replacement parts. I&#x27;m SICK of having to throw away items that could still be useful but for which viable replacement parts can&#x27;t be had. Shame on Remington for offering this kind of shoddiness to their (former) customers!</li>
