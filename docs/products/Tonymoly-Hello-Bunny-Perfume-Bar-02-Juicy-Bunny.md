      <li>Smells like peaches and maybe lemon in the summer, more of a perfumy scent.</li>
      <li>Its my favorite from the collection.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this &amp; most likely</li>

      <li>I thought it was going to be the same size as the Moist Mist, but it&#x27;s not; it&#x27;s so cute and tiny!(a</li>
      <li>BUT it is also pretty floral as well.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s overall very worth it!</li>
      <li>It dries pretty fast so no yucky residue.</li>
      <li>Smaller than I expected, but super cute!</li>
      <li>Otherwise the product itself is great- smells a bit strong but once applied its perfectly fine:) a little small in size, but can last REALLY long.</li>
      <li>The picture on the screen is the real size.</li>
      <li>The shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
      <li>The smell is subtle and lasts for most of the day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yum!!!  So light and yummy!</li>
    <li> This bottle is so cute it&#x27;s not funny and it smells really nice. It&#x27;s for a child but I want one of my own now...lol</li>
    <li> Very cute &amp; easy to wear! I like rubbing it on rather than spraying liquid. I wish the scent was a littler stronger &amp; didn&#x27;t fade. I&#x27;m the kinda gal that likes to be smelled!! I wish I could describe the scent but it smells amazing. It has a fruity essences, maybe a tangerine and it also has a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell similar to a females deodorant. It dries pretty fast so no yucky residue. I&#x27;m really happy with this &amp; most likely I will be buying many more in the future.</li>
    <li> The TONYMOLY Hello Bunny Perfume Bar arrived in great condition with good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Though the box was dented, it did not affect the perfume bar inside.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the perfume was pleasant and not too strong, perfect for any season.&lt;br /&gt;I usually rubbed it on my wrists and on some other pressure points.&lt;br /&gt;As a first TONYMOLY customer, I am very satisfied and happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The only complaint was that the ad did give off the impression that she would be getting the whole box set but only received one.  Although, she loves the perfume and is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I think I might purchase another one.  It&#x27;s about the size of a chapstick/lipstick (in height) but it&#x27;s definitely wider...maybe the size of a quarter in width.  I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to perfumes and oils and this one has been great so far.  No reaction, no change in scent. It smells fruity and girly. Which is what I was going for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive with shipping but it&#x27;s overall very worth it! Smells amazingly! I&#x27;m a huge fan of TONYMOLY quality and packaging.</li>
    <li> The picture on the screen is the real size. Smaller than I expected, but super cute! Not much product for the price but I still love the smell and how you can take it anywhere. Smells like peaches and maybe lemon in the summer, more of a perfumy scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I love solid perfumes.  They work great in my opinion and these looked adorable.  I had tried one at the store and liked it, so i decided to order one here!  the moment iIput this one on, an irritation spot formed!  I was shocked because irritation bumps usually take longer to form but I am guessing because the wrist is a senstive spot.  The tester at the store actually didn&#x27;t give me this issue... I am hoping that this is only once but have not tried it again since.  The fragrance is really light and you don&#x27;t need to rub a lot on.  This item is great for travel which is actually one of the main reasons why I had made this purchase!  I will try this product again and hopefully it will not cause more bumps!</li>
    <li> This bar is literally the best smelling things ive ever had, its light and you can smell it if you&#x27;re close to the person wearing it, perfect for a date :b</li>
    <li> I got this thinking the smell would be fruity, and it is. BUT it is also pretty floral as well. It still smells nice though, just not what I am looking for. I wish they would make scent that was a mix of fruity, and candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It last a long time, I put it on my wrist, my neck, and clavicle. The smell is subtle and lasts for most of the day.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend. I thought it was going to be the same size as the Moist Mist, but it&#x27;s not; it&#x27;s so cute and tiny!(a little over 2 inches) I was hesitating about giving it to her xD I will buy this again in a different scent~</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent and such a cute bunny.</li>
    <li> I got a Green Tea perfume bar back when I was in seoul, when I got home I was so upset i didn&#x27;t get any others and i just had to order this.</li>
    <li> It says the list price is $59 something and that&#x27;s NOT true. Otherwise the product itself is great- smells a bit strong but once applied its perfectly fine:) a little small in size, but can last REALLY long.</li>
    <li> It smells delicious and is super adorable. Its my favorite from the collection. Its lasted for a while even though I wore it to the gym. 10/10</li>
    <li> The shipping was incredibly fast. The packaging of the product is absolutely adorable. However, I was extremely disappointed about the fragrance. It just wasn&#x27;t for me. It was strong and a bit chemical-y. I bought this perfume in hopes that it would smell like the wonderful scent of TONYMOLY&#x27;s peach hand lotion.</li>
    <li> The description says it has notes of peach, but I didn&#x27;t get that at all. There&#x27;s something about the fragrance that is just wonderful. Also, it lasts longer than regular perfume, because of the stick application.</li>
    <li> smell wonderful but don&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soft peachy scent I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Stupid waste of time and money. It&#x27;s a tiny scented perfume stick.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase! This person is excellent to do business with. Everything was perfect (shipping, price, etc)</li>
