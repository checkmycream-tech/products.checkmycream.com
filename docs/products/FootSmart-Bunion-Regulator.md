      <li>it aches, but in a good way.</li>
      <li>This thing is awesome, you really FEEL it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I am sure it will not \\&quot;cure\\</li>
      <li>We just ordered two more</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this product and hope to see more results in the coming months.</li>
      <li>It is pretty good</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>and sure it&#x27;s a secure fit</li>
      <li>I am not sure how good it will be for large bunions that may need surgery but for the beginning stages of a bunion this is a perfect remedy.</li>
      <li>Not too comfortable when trying to sleep, but I still try to use it in bed.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t walk freely with device.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for one week now and it is comfortable to wear at night.  </li>
      <li>I am 8 months pregnant and the added weight is bothering it.</li>
      <li>So far the pain has reduced significantly.</li>
      <li>I purchased the FootSmart Bunion Regulator to try to straighten out my large toe and reduce the size/intensity of the bunion on my foot.  </li>
      <li>but I do have the large lump on the side of my foot.</li>
      <li>and I assume after time it would really make a difference.</li>
      <li>I do not wear it at night as the covers against it sometimes pulls too much.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>When you put it on, you feel like you should really tighten it, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They haven&#x27;t really prevented shifting of toe to progress.</li>
      <li>Has really helped my foot.</li>
      <li>I have changed shoes, added supports for my high arch and use this at night.  </li>
      <li>However, I must use it at least 3 times per week for effective treatment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is definitely ment to be worn at night or while relaxing since you are pretty immobile with it</li>
      <li>I helps align my big toe, but the plastic stick does tend to bend if you use it too much.  </li>
      <li>but I was extremely conscious of it every night that I decided to wear it.    </li>
      <li>So far I give it 5 stars, I&#x27;ve been using it every night.</li>
      <li>He always bought shoes for work and home that were not tight but still a bunion developed.</li>
      <li>I have only worn it a few times because it presses on my toenail and makes it feel ingrown, so I had to retro fit it to wear it by putting a little bit of cotton in between  the foam and my nail, but then that moved around</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have only worn it a few times because it presses on my toenail and makes it feel ingrown, so I had to retro fit it to wear it by putting a little bit of cotton in between  the foam and my nail, but then that moved around and it still hurt so I stopped wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I did notice my toe was straighter in the morning after wearing and I assume after time it would really make a difference.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I didn&#x27;t know about it until I searched online. Went to a podiatrist several years ago and all that was mentioned about the problem was an operation. Oh yes, the good doctor sold me orthotics! I use this product at night and when I awaken in the morning there is no pain and my toes are aligned. However, I must use it at least 3 times per week for effective treatment. It&#x27;s not permanent like an operation, however a lot easier to go through. I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I helps align my big toe, but the plastic stick does tend to bend if you use it too much.  Not too comfortable when trying to sleep, but I still try to use it in bed.</li>
    <li> This unfortunately has not given me the results and comfort I hoped to get. They haven&#x27;t really prevented shifting of toe to progress. I can&#x27;t keep them on throughout the night, they are just too uncomfortable :(&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for each foot and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Y&#x27;know this thing would probably work if I could actually wear it. (lol) It was just too uncomfortable to sleep in. I tried to wear socks over it but nothing helped. I kept waking up to make the thing was still on my foot.  ..and sure it&#x27;s a secure fit but I was extremely conscious of it every night that I decided to wear it.    I&#x27;m not sure what I was thinking when I bought this thing but I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the FootSmart Bunion Regulator to try to straighten out my large toe and reduce the size/intensity of the bunion on my foot.  I have used this product for one week now and it is comfortable to wear at night.  I have noticed a slight straightening of my toe, but no lasting effect during the day.  However, this condition took years to create, so I don&#x27;t expect miracles overnight.  I will continue to use this product and hope to see more results in the coming months.</li>
    <li> This has worked well for my bunion. I am training for a minimarathon and triathlons.  So, my bunion has been painful.  I have changed shoes, added supports for my high arch and use this at night.  So far the pain has reduced significantly.</li>
    <li> I used a couple of devices. This is hard so that cause some pain on feet. You can&#x27;t walk freely with device.</li>
    <li> My husband has a bunion that just began to bother him. He always bought shoes for work and home that were not tight but still a bunion developed. He started to where this about 2 weeks ago. In the beginning it was not through the night. Now he has graduated all night. The difference in the look of the toes and the foot is unbelievable. He doesn&#x27;t have anymore pain during the day/night and he has space between the toes again. He would definitely recommend it.  Update: definitely still giving this product 5 stars. Worked well and saved on costly doctor appointments. No more pain and toes have straightened. We just ordered two more</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it works to prevent bunions. I noticed that i was starting to get a bunion and i wanted to be proactive in preventing it from getting out of control. This works perfectly. I am not sure how good it will be for large bunions that may need surgery but for the beginning stages of a bunion this is a perfect remedy.</li>
    <li> Although the premise seemed suspicious, I was talked into buying it anyway.  It&#x27;s completely useless and  a total waste of money</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be used at night only. It is pretty good but I removed it to wash it and then I didn&#x27;t know how to put it back. It just doesn&#x27;t feel the same. I will keep trying. This is not supposed to remove your bunion, it separated your big toe and it is uncomfortable to walk because it was not make for that. Overall I like it.</li>
    <li> It truly is.  I wear it every night for 1-3 hours and it is helping my bunion pain.  I do not wear it at night as the covers against it sometimes pulls too much.</li>
    <li> Despite the indication that it was for up to a woman&#x27;s size 11, it was not large enough for a size 10 foot.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome, you really FEEL it. it aches, but in a good way. Has really helped my foot.</li>
    <li> This thing didn&#x27;t even wrap around my narrow foot!  Don&#x27;t waste time or $ on this piece of plastic crap.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my bunion had begun to hurt me. I do not have a serious big toe deviation just yet but I do have the large lump on the side of my foot. I am 8 months pregnant and the added weight is bothering it. I bought this in hopes to relieve some pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to adjust your toe. I can&#x27;t wear it very long because it actually gets painful after awhile. When you put it on, you feel like you should really tighten it, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget trying to walk with it on. It has absolutely no give. You have to walk with your foot completely flat as if it were in a cast, and even that is almost impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely ment to be worn at night or while relaxing since you are pretty immobile with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am sure it will not \\&quot;cure\\&quot; my bunion, I feel like over time it can help stretch the toe muscles and help with the pain.</li>
    <li> So far I give it 5 stars, I&#x27;ve been using it every night. Does not cause me to lose sleep as it is adjustable.</li>
    <li> Seems to releave pressure from bunion.  I hope it will help in the long run.</li>
    <li> This thing does not work. I wore it for a month while sleeping and it just made the joint hurt ans swell</li>
    <li> ITS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE, THOUGH IT DOES HELP WITH PAIN AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT HELPS TO STRAIGHTEN THE TOE AND KEEP IN FROM CRAMPING, BUT IF YOUR FOOT CRAMPS, IT IS A HINDERANCE TO HAVE ON.</li>
