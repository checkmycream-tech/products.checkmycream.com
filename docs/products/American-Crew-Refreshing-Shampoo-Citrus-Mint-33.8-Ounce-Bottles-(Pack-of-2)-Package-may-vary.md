      <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>I liked this one because of it&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>I tried all kind of shampoo</li>
      <li>I have 2 sisters and they own a bunch of shampoos and conditioners from Pantene, Tresemme, Herbal Essences,</li>
      <li>Seems like the price was to good to be true on this one.  </li>
      <li>love the shampoo...26 dollars for 2-33.8 ounce bottles.</li>
      <li>I am sure that some would consider the formula \\&quot;harsh\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>He says they feels tingly and refreshing on his scalp.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo..</li>
      <li>Last forever, awesome price - free shipping too!  </li>
      <li>Excellent value on one of my all-time favorite poo&#x27;s, the American Crew Citrus Mint.  </li>
      <li>This is still my favorite.</li>
      <li>Most of my friends and even some of my brothers do as well.  </li>
      <li>Made with natural ingredients, it leaves my hair and scalp feeling great.</li>
      <li>Super refreshing and (mostly)</li>
      <li>you are better off with the original crew Shampoo.</li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves my hair looking clean, shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an OK shampoo, but it is merely adequate.</li>
      <li>Although the product was shipped quickly and came as described, the bottle top broke in the box and leaked out.</li>
      <li>Super deal!</li>
      <li>but my hair won&#x27;t feel as clean as when I used the original shampoo.</li>
      <li>I used to love this shampoo for its refreshing smell and it leaves my hair soft and manageable with or without the conditioner.</li>
      <li>But finally the product was really GOOD at A CHEAP PRICE....</li>
      <li>you get 2 big bottles,smells good</li>
      <li>Last couple years I was happy to find the large size bottles at Nordstrom Rack,  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, I have all kind of hair problem such as dry, oily and all kind of stuff.</li>
      <li>but this is the only one that i am stick with since it leaves a very fresh smell after shower and make my hair looks healthy and clean.</li>
      <li>It smells really good, and it leaves my very thick hair manageable and nice.</li>
      <li>I had been using another product (Origins Clear Head) for many years.</li>
      <li>By far my favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>Many other brands try to compete in this mint category, notably Aveda.</li>
      <li>This one is just right.  </li>
      <li>B000XJF1AC American Crew Citrus Mint Refreshing Shampoo</li>
      <li>I use about a quarter size dab in the shower and im going 7 months and just about finished with my first bottle.</li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my hair feel light, unlike most shampoos, not weighted down with slimy conditioners, and the wave is really bouncy as it air-dries.</li>
      <li>Too bad the bulk size from Amazon didn&#x27;t work out, but I am glad the good product is still available from stores.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Much Much lower in price than others on the site.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, long hair</li>
      <li>Go to Target and buy a decent quality shampoo on sale and forget it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The prduct does not come straight from the manufacturer, so there is a chance the product is old, or has been tampered with.  </li>
      <li>Normally runs 11 dollars for 13 ounces in the store or salon.</li>
      <li>I like the shampoo, but if you have normal to oily hair</li>
      <li>I always use classic American Crew shampoo, for the first time wanted to get the citrus collection.</li>
      <li>Origins no longer offers the large bottles of Clear Head</li>
      <li>May be too intense for more delicate souls.</li>
      <li>Plus the price was much less than what was available elsewhere.</li>
      <li>It is old school, in the sense that it sudses-up into a huge mound of minty lather, which more modern shampoos tell you is bad-- all of those detergents and surfactants, blah blah blah.</li>
      <li>all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this shampoo was old or if the formula is not as strong as it used to be</li>
      <li>It just feels like a completely different product than before even though the packaging looks exactly the same.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a generic equivalent of Clear Head and this shampoo superficially looks the same as Clear Head</li>
      <li>The cost is more than half off of what you pay for small bottles in the store.  </li>

<li> The shampoo is not as refreshing as I hoped it would be and the conditioner just seemed flat with a weird smell.  </li>
<li> When I use it, which is almost every day since I have zero self-control, I feel like the girl on the old Herb Alpert album \\&quot;Whipped Cream and Other Delights\\&quot;.</li>
<li> The bottles are big and last a long time.</li>
<li> I keep my old small bottle in the shower and just re-fill it with these giant things.  </li>
<li> Apparently, you&#x27;re not cool unless you use this stuff.  </li>
<li> , my hair felt the same as if using any other shampoo that&#x27;s in the my bathroom.</li>
<li> This product smells like the other \\&quot;mint\\&quot; products, but does not have the same performance.  </li>
<li> Can&#x27;t say for sure if I got a bad batch, but I would not recommend this specific product.</li>
<li> This version of the product leaves my hair dry and it even makes my scalp itch.</li>
<li> I have tested it and the soft manageable hair returned and there is no more scalp itch.</li>
<li> and it was wet all over the box.</li>
<li> the scalp like other prducts in this class.  </li>
<li> there is nothing that sets this product apart from any other shampoo, you are paying for the name hype...</li>
<li> I was then glad to find it on Amazon, but what I got really disappointed me.</li>
<li> I usually use different shampoos every time I shower.</li>
<li> I am saving a TON of cash over buying it at other local retail stores (or worse yet, local hair salon).</li>
<li> Its not worth all that...</li>
<li> But apart from the olfactory, aromatherapeutic effect, which is sort of like jamming an entire box of Altoids up each nostril (subtle, it ain&#x27;t)-- the other selling point is the way it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
<li> but a little goes along way.</li>
<li> Since I shampoo my hair every day, I have to have a shampoo that is not to harsh.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t bother with this expensive product and then the extra cost of shipping heavy liquid.</li>
<li> But CVS will charge you $12 for a small bottle.  </li>
<li> I have medium-coarse hair, wavy, very thick, slightly oily scalp and skin.</li>
<li> This one is really bad, it is making my hair very dry and also am noticeably loosing hair</li>
<li> I will crawl over broken glass for this shampoo.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this shampoo was old or if the formula is not as strong as it used to be but I was not happy with the product.  The shampoo is not as refreshing as I hoped it would be and the conditioner just seemed flat with a weird smell.  Can&#x27;t say for sure if I got a bad batch, but I would not recommend this specific product.</li>
    <li> I had been using another product (Origins Clear Head) for many years. Origins no longer offers the large bottles of Clear Head so I figured I would try this shampoo. I was hoping for a generic equivalent of Clear Head and this shampoo superficially looks the same as Clear Head but it is quite different. It&#x27;s an OK shampoo, but it is merely adequate. I will continue to use it but I don&#x27;t know if I will re-order or not.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo that I have tried. It smells really good, and it leaves my very thick hair manageable and nice.</li>
    <li> The cost is more than half off of what you pay for small bottles in the store.  Great value for price.</li>
    <li> I always use classic American Crew shampoo, for the first time wanted to get the citrus collection. This one is really bad, it is making my hair very dry and also am noticeably loosing hair</li>
    <li> Seems like the price was to good to be true on this one.  Much Much lower in price than others on the site.  Product does not \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; the scalp like other prducts in this class.  The prduct does not come straight from the manufacturer, so there is a chance the product is old, or has been tampered with.  This product smells like the other \\&quot;mint\\&quot; products, but does not have the same performance.  So if you are looking for a good (as claimed) \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; shampoo......This is not your product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.. its smells so refreshing (not flowery or perfumey at all) and lathers beautifully. This shampoo leaves my hair looking clean, shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> love the shampoo...26 dollars for 2-33.8 ounce bottles. Super deal! Normally runs 11 dollars for 13 ounces in the store or salon. I didn&#x27;t just buy it for the great deal though. It has a great smell to it and cleans my hair without stripping it out. I have fine, long hair so I need a lot of shampoo when i wash it.</li>
    <li> I use American Crew hair products.  Most of my friends and even some of my brothers do as well.  We did not get together and decide to use the same hair-care products, I just came about this information by accident.  Apparently, you&#x27;re not cool unless you use this stuff.  I use it.  I have for years now.  I remember when you could only get it in hair salons. Now you can find it at CVS.  But CVS will charge you $12 for a small bottle.  Here, you can get 2 GIANT bottles of the shampoo for $30!  Awesome!  Each of these big bottle of shampoo will equal 3 of the smaller ones you&#x27;ve been buying.  I keep my old small bottle in the shower and just re-fill it with these giant things.  They rule.  Last forever, awesome price - free shipping too!  Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over 3 years now and cannot think of using another. The smell is not overpowering and a pleasant citrus. It leaves my hair manageable and good looking. And definitely a very good buy at Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo, but if you have normal to oily hair you are better off with the original crew Shampoo. I liked this one because of it&#x27;s scent. but my hair won&#x27;t feel as clean as when I used the original shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product that is a really good price on amazon. This runs about 1/2 of retail at the finest salons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000XJF1AC American Crew Citrus Mint Refreshing Shampoo 33.8oz/liter]]</li>
    <li> Although the product was shipped quickly and came as described, the bottle top broke in the box and leaked out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s all the hype with these reviews..I bought both the shampoo + conditioner. It does smells good but aside from that, my hair felt the same as if using any other shampoo that&#x27;s in the my bathroom. I usually use different shampoos every time I shower. I have 2 sisters and they own a bunch of shampoos and conditioners from Pantene, Tresemme, Herbal Essences, Suave..you name it! they have it! and yes I use them!</li>
    <li> My second bottle.Value set, love the scent, works great on oily hair.</li>
    <li> I have fairly short hair but a little goes along way. I use about a quarter size dab in the shower and im going 7 months and just about finished with my first bottle. $17 for one bottle of quality shampoo. I definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Use the shampoo daily.  Love it and Amazon sells it at a great price -- figure it out per ounce!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves the CREW mint products.  He says they feels tingly and refreshing on his scalp.  I have shopped around and Amazon had the best deal that I found.  The bottles are big and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I will crawl over broken glass for this shampoo. It is, I suppose, for men -- don&#x27;t care (I&#x27;m a chick). It probably contains sulfates? Don&#x27;t care. Probably not recommended for dyed hair (I color mine) -- don&#x27;t care. Many other brands try to compete in this mint category, notably Aveda. This is still my favorite. I am sure that some would consider the formula \\&quot;harsh\\&quot;. It is old school, in the sense that it sudses-up into a huge mound of minty lather, which more modern shampoos tell you is bad-- all of those detergents and surfactants, blah blah blah. When I use it, which is almost every day since I have zero self-control, I feel like the girl on the old Herb Alpert album \\&quot;Whipped Cream and Other Delights\\&quot;. But apart from the olfactory, aromatherapeutic effect, which is sort of like jamming an entire box of Altoids up each nostril (subtle, it ain&#x27;t)-- the other selling point is the way it makes my hair look and feel. It seems weirdly moisturizing and hydrating- yet the hair is uber-clean. I have medium-coarse hair, wavy, very thick, slightly oily scalp and skin. This shampoo makes my hair feel light, unlike most shampoos, not weighted down with slimy conditioners, and the wave is really bouncy as it air-dries. May be too intense for more delicate souls.</li>
    <li> Excellent value on one of my all-time favorite poo&#x27;s, the American Crew Citrus Mint.  The poo came well-packaged and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing anytime of the year.good quality and you get a lot.worth buying it you get 2 big bottles,smells good</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. Last couple years I was happy to find the large size bottles at Nordstrom Rack,  but then they stopped carrying it.  I was then glad to find it on Amazon, but what I got really disappointed me. I used to love this shampoo for its refreshing smell and it leaves my hair soft and manageable with or without the conditioner. This version of the product leaves my hair dry and it even makes my scalp itch. The smell is similar but muted. It just feels like a completely different product than before even though the packaging looks exactly the same. To test my theory I went and bought a smaller bottle from the store and compared them. The one from the store has the citrus mint smell that I was used to,  and its color is a shade lighter like I remembered it to be. I have tested it and the soft manageable hair returned and there is no more scalp itch. Too bad the bulk size from Amazon didn&#x27;t work out, but I am glad the good product is still available from stores.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, I have all kind of hair problem such as dry, oily and all kind of stuff. I tried all kind of shampoo but this is the only one that i am stick with since it leaves a very fresh smell after shower and make my hair looks healthy and clean. The only problem i have is somehow the shampoo leaked inside the package and it was wet all over the box. But finally the product was really GOOD at A CHEAP PRICE.... The cheapest i can find outside amazon is around [...] bucks for each bottle.</li>
    <li> Of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve used through the years, this is one of the best smelling. Since I shampoo my hair every day, I have to have a shampoo that is not to harsh.  This one is just right.  Plus the price was much less than what was available elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Super refreshing and (mostly) all natural ingredients. By far my favorite shampoo. By getting the larger 2 bottle package here on Amazon I am saving a TON of cash over buying it at other local retail stores (or worse yet, local hair salon). Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  Made with natural ingredients, it leaves my hair and scalp feeling great. Also, the smell is awesome.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> We were looking for the best value for ordering this product and we found it.  Very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shampoo! It cleans you hair. It&#x27;s way too expensive. Go to Target and buy a decent quality shampoo on sale and forget it. Don&#x27;t bother with this expensive product and then the extra cost of shipping heavy liquid. Its not worth all that... there is nothing that sets this product apart from any other shampoo, you are paying for the name hype...</li>
