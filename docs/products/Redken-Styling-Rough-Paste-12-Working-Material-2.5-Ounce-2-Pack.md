    <li> Product arrived in good condition and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love buying in bulk and saving money, especially on something as (usually) overly priced as hair products. Now it looks like I almost give a S***.</li>
    <li> Works great &amp; easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> Always loved this product.  Has so many uses and is great on my hair.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the styling paste. Not much product in the tube for the money. Switched to a salon brand which comes in a soft tube. I know what I&#x27;m getting. 2.5 oz is nothing, even though one only had to use a pea-sized dab.Over-priced. Many good brands right at your chain haircut shop. More bang fo&#x27; buck.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for short hair to give it hold, a little curl, and a little texture.  With wet fingers, I finger comb it the next day and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>

    <li> I have purchased this product from a salon in the past, but it&#x27;s getting so expensive that I decided to go on line to see if I could find a more affordable solution.  THIS is it!  I was able to buy TWO items for the price of one, basically.  The hair paste itself is a great product for providing a little oomph to my short hairstyle......it enables me to spike it up a little and to keep my fine hair in place better, once styled.  I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, but he was verydisappointed with the results. His hair is blond, thin and straight. This product leaves his hair looking wet/greassy. Luckly, I was able to find &amp;#34;Redken Defining Wax Shine Form, 2.5 Ounce&amp;#34; for him to use, and he is happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Would not have short hair without this product!</li>
    <li> this product is good for short fine hair like mine as I&#x27;ve using it for years. a little bit gives hair some texture/body. if you use too much it has opposite effect. better price for set of 2.</li>
    <li> Good price, excellent delivery. I&#x27;m about to reorder!</li>
    <li> This product works very well, love the texture when you have short hair. Received my product in good time as well.</li>
    <li> this s*** is the bomb works great for slick hair or euro styles that need to stay in place</li>
    <li> The best hair product</li>
    <li> This styling stand-by is so versatile.  Prompt service.  Good value.</li>
