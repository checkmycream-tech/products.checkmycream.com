      <li>add water makes its own sauce</li>
      <li>This gel isn&#x27;t as good as the original- gets sticky more easily.</li>
      <li>Without being graphic I would say this product is the best we have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>We use it every morning :-)  </li>
      <li>Highly viscous clear water-based gel does the job perfectly and stays where applied.</li>
      <li>It lasts and it washes up quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>Absolutely a good water based lube...lasts long... love it</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.</li>
      <li>Very economical 6-pack purchase is, per item, near half regular single item retail price.</li>
      <li>In fact I found this product to decrease sensitive and pleasure compared with the regular liquid.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews. But this product was a total disappointment. I have had a great constant success with their liquid version, but this gel is too thick, too sticky.</li>
    <li> I thought the thicker Gel would cause it to last longer but that isn&#x27;t the case.  In fact I found this product to decrease sensitive and pleasure compared with the regular liquid.</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there, it feels great and lasts longer than others ones like it!</li>
    <li> Good enough and I read that it is also a moisturizer for a female so I guess it treats the reason I had to find this stuff , it&#x27;s really slippery so carefull don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
    <li> best lube ever! perfect consistency</li>
