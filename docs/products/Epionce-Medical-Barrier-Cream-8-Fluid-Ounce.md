      <li>I&#x27;m 34 and my whole life I&#x27;ve suffered from mild to moderate excema on my chin and cheeks.</li>
      <li>is a way better value), so a tube will last me several months, even with generous use.</li>

      <li>(I live in Las Vegas).</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I use it pretty much all year round - in winter</li>
      <li>I have tried other Epionce products and each one proves to enhance my facial skin.</li>
      <li>I just got this a few days ago so maybe too soon to tell exactly</li>

    <li> it smells different than im used to but works fine.It may have sat on a shelf too long.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Love it.  I could only get it in az through my dermatologist.  I am happy I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great for after laser or peel treatments.  Also good for skin irritations.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Epionce&lt;br /&gt;Medical Barrier Cream.  I live in Arizona and this cream keeps my skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I can use it on my face as well.</li>
    <li> This cream is great after a Lazer Treatment.  In fact, the Medical Spa that I go to carries this product and sells this to you after treatment.  I was so pleased to find on Amazon.  A lot less money then Spa and a much bigger tube.  This is very very good for your skin and a little goes along way.  You will not be sorry for this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from eczema all my life. Epionce has been a wonderful relief</li>
    <li> Great communication from seller and item is as described. I just got this a few days ago so maybe too soon to tell exactly but seems like a great product so far. It is pretty thick and plan to use it short term and as needed for very dry skin but has been better than my usual cerave moisturizer. I plan on ordering some other epionce products for maintenance as this seller has other products in the line. Glad I found this cheaper here on amazon!! The bottle is huge and will last forever!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best and most nourishing cream out there.  I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all.  People comment on how incredible my skin looks and I would have to attribute most of that to this amazing cream.</li>
    <li> First time in my life I don&#x27;t have to use hydrocortisone cream to keep my excema under control! I&#x27;m 34 and my whole life I&#x27;ve suffered from mild to moderate excema on my chin and cheeks. In tbe past the only thing that helped was to use hydrocortisone cream along with my daily moisturizer however this is not the case with the medical barrier cream. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 weeks and I have had to use a topical steroid to control my excema. This lotion is perfect for those with dry skin/mild excema... Especially for those living in very dry climates (I live in Las Vegas). The price is outstanding too... Around $40 for an 8 oz tube. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this cream to me as method for improving and reducing neck winkles and a slightly sagging jaw line.  When applied twice daily, morning and night, the skin on my neck and along my jaw appeared hydrated and less wrinkled.  It may take a couple weeks of repeated application to see noticeable results but given a little time it has made a noticeable improvement in areas of my skin exposed to the Florida sun and that I had neglected to moisturize on a regular basis.  I&#x27;m pleased with the results and will continue to use Epionce Medical Barrier Cream.  It&#x27;s a very good product, at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years ,recommended by my dermatologist. I use it on my face,hands and arms.&lt;br /&gt;The retail price from Epionce is 46 dollars. Never pay more ...</li>
    <li> Best barrier cream on the market! It soothes, moisturizes, and acts a a barrier.</li>
    <li> Love the whole line. Makes my skin like silk</li>
    <li> This cream helped my skin heal quickly after a dermabrasion procedure, and I liked it so well that I&#x27;ve continued to use it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know much about the cream, but I love it. I put it over my face cream or by itself&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband is uesing the cream</li>
    <li> This stuff is frickin awesome. One of the few moisturizers that don&#x27;t dry out my face. Not sure why the other manufacturers make &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; that dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Brings life tho my skin...</li>
    <li> Good product. Read reviews before ordering , dermatologist recommended. My skin&lt;br /&gt;barrier compromised from seborrheic dermatitis , quite severe for the first time&lt;br /&gt; presumably from an allergic reaction to something. I have very sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;and this product helps in relieving the dryness and flaking. I don&#x27;t use it everyday and&lt;br /&gt;hopefully when my skin gets much better use it with other skin products to improve my&lt;br /&gt;skin . I most likely will use it more that the winter is coming.</li>
    <li> This stuff is working very well after having a baby via C-section!</li>
    <li> This cream is great to use when you take a retinal product to offset the dry, patchy skin. I apply it 30 minutes before the renova product and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the quality of the retin-a.</li>
    <li> Love this product will definately order again.</li>
    <li> Epionce Medical Barrier Cream is great cream. I have tried other Epionce products and each one proves to enhance my facial skin. I am sold on this products and all the others also recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> delivered promptly at a good price</li>
    <li> I actually thought I ordered a different Epionce product, but I&#x27;m glad I messed up the order!  This cream doesn&#x27;t smell as good as others, but I like the results on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product for very dry skin and for after a peel.</li>
    <li> I am very unsatisfied with this product. It smells old and not original. In addition,  it does not provide the nurishment my last medical barrier cream from my dermatologist office did. This is NOT an original product. Buyer be aware. I want to return this product.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and the winter is brutal for me -- I constantly have flaking/painful/red skin. I was using CeraVe body creme which was helped temporarily but not when it was below freezing! My friend is a plastic surgeon and let me try and sample. It was a god-send and helped me greatly. It&#x27;s unscented and slightly oily when first applied but great for my face! Also it&#x27;s non-comedogenic.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good cream but if you can take the smell. The smell is pretty bad.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the absolute BEST product I&#x27;ve ever found for dry, rough skin - anywhere on the body. I use it almost every night on my face, but also on my feet, knees and elbows. I use it pretty much all year round - in winter I want protection from the weather, in the warmer months I keep using it because I also use Retin A. I found that my skin was irritated with use of Retin A more than a couple times per week - once I started topping the Retin A with this product, I discovered I can use it every day if I want to. Giving me all of the antiaging benefits with practically no irritation at all! Also - this stuff comes in an 8 oz. tube ( there is a smaller size available as well, but the 8 oz. is a way better value), so a tube will last me several months, even with generous use. I also do regular chemical peels, and there is nothing better than this to help my skin heal. I&#x27;ll always buy this product - and through Amazon, I get it for an excellent price. VERY happy with this!</li>
