    <li> I just love this toner and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands but keep coming back to this one.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, you spray it on and it dries quickly leaving a light dewy glow.  My pores thank me everyday!</li>
    <li> Same great spa product without the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved it and the fact that it comes in a glass nar is great for product freshness. I love the way it smells!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the Bioelements line and love the fact that I can get it on line super fast!</li>
    <li> I use this equalizer twice a day and feel it helps moisturize my skin.  I have sensitive skin so would not use a toner.  There is very little scent, and the hydration is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Such a value- The bottle is glass- very cool- I use it at home and have a smaller one that I travel with for the gym.  Best stuff ever!</li>
    <li> I use it after washing my face and before applying moisturizer. Love most bioelements products</li>
    <li> Use a lot of bioelement products.  Very happy with them...</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I don&#x27;t need to use it every time as long as I keep up with the cleanser my face keeps clear.</li>
    <li> When I don&#x27;t use this, my face feels tighter/more drawn with less elasticity through the day. Really helps lock in moisture.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner for several years.  It does exactly what a toner should do, without alcohol.</li>
    <li> All of Bioelements products are superb and surpass any competitor. Equalizer is an incredibly refreshing product that establishes a balance upon the skin&#x27;s surface, preparing it for their serums and moisturizers. Since discovering this product, I always keep a back-up bottle. This was recomended by the person who did my facials; I can&#x27;t do without it. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I experienced Bioelements Equalizer tonner/mist during my recent visit to salon that uses this product line.  Esthetician used it after cleansing and in between peelers, serums and mask to refresh the skin and reset PH levels of the skin.  She used it as a mist and I absolutely loved the pleasant scent of the product.  The product uses chinese herbs and natural extracts such as: ginseng, watercrest, Sumac, rose oil, nobilis oil and many others.  6 oz bottle can go a long way.  This is professional product and it can be purchased at salons that use Bioelements line.  It prepares skin for mosturizer and I use it at day and night.  It works as a mist and instead of using cotton puffs/pads, I apply paper tissues and gently dab it on my skin to remove any access and help absorbtion.  This technique allows better product absorbtion in the skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product line. Makes my face feel like a babyS bottom</li>
    <li> After cleansing, prior to moisturizing.  GREAT product. I really like the Bioelements line. Nice to find it a bit lower in price online than at the spa.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than 3 years and loved it.  I feel very refreshing after applying it.</li>
    <li> My wife has been buying this exact same product at the salon for many years and the markup is outrageous. Great professional skin care product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> great to use instead of lotion once in a while.</li>
    <li> I love this product! After a shower, my face tends to get dry and flaky, particularly around the forehead since I have combination skin. With a few light spritz, the equalizer evens out my skin texture in a matter of seconds, making it smoother to apply serum or moisturizer right afterwards. It has definitely become a staple in my skincare regimen!</li>
    <li> Smells clean, works to keep my skin moist after washing and before applying moisturizer.  Good product.  A facial therapist introduced me to this line of skin care.  They know best, right?</li>
    <li> I ordered a set from Hautelook around my birthday and two weeks later, extra excited to receive my package I noticed it was extra &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;. My toner had broken. I was sooooo upset to wait all this time for something and that one of my pieces was broken. I then thought about amazon and found what i was looking for. I love this toner, it means more to actually have found it and now I can know where to come when I run out of everything I received at Hautelook.</li>
    <li> Great product! My face has never looked so good.</li>
    <li> One of the best toners.  Once you get out of the shower, just spray it on your face and neck while it dries.  So refreshing.</li>
    <li> My aesthetician recommended the Bioelements line to me. I have very dry skin with occasional oiliness. I use the decongestant cleanser with the Equalizer and the Really Rich moisturizer. Love this line. Haven&#x27;t had any problems in 2 years and my skin feels and looks great</li>
