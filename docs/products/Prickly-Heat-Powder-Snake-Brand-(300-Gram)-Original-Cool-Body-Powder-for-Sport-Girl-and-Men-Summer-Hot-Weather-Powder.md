    <li> I had problems with severe prickly heat and no matter what I tried failed. I saw this powder and figured I had nothing to lose. What I had to lose was the prickly heat. I now use it all the time and haven&#x27;t had any problems since. I would recommend it to one and all.</li>

    <li> I bought this powder at a store in my area. I am going to order it again as I am running out and it is no longer available locally. I am so glad to find it online. It is so soothing for rashes that I get in the hot weather.</li>
    <li> When I went to Thailand, I picked some of this stuff up and fell in love with its cooling, drying properties. It&#x27;s like baby powder on steroids. Despite the intense heat of equatorial climates, I stayed dry where I wanted to stay dry. No longer on vacation, working far away from Thailand, I still use this stuff every day. Fresh. Cool. Dry. Prickly Heat.</li>
