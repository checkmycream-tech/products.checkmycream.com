      <li>Since I have silver hair..and love silver jewelry..</li>
      <li>I love this polish so</li>
      <li>Deffinatly will reccomend to friends :)</li>
      <li>I always love OPI nail colors.</li>
      <li>OPI Radiance is a really great, high quality silver.</li>
      <li>The nail polish is very true to color, so if you like silver you&#x27;ll be pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good nail polish wasn&#x27;t the chrome look</li>
      <li>Holds up pretty good to day to day wear.</li>
      <li>It does take a bit of nerve to wear it (a brilliant solid metal!)</li>
      <li>I looks just like tin foil and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>in just one coat u can see the strong metal coloring and shine.</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful color.</li>
      <li>If you do your nails at home, this is a bright and brilliant silver that&#x27;s great for an accent color or base that you should have in your collection.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply, and dries super fast!</li>
      <li>There was a problem with my original order and the nail polish had somehow exploded during delivery.</li>
      <li>This is a rich opaque silver.  </li>
      <li>OPI is always worth the price!</li>
      <li>This is a True Silver.</li>
      <li>&quot; is a true silver.</li>
      <li>This color is so bold</li>
      <li>Beautiful if you like a little &amp;#34;Bling&amp;#34; on your nails!</li>
      <li>This is very shiny and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>It is really bright, but not what I expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of creating intense, gaudy glitter looks with silver and gold polishes.</li>
      <li>OPI makes such nice nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Love this color, lasts longer than most of my other polishes!</li>
      <li>I am really running out of this product already and will definitely buy more!</li>
      <li>radiance looks like pure liquid silver on the nails!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately I never received that color.</li>
      <li>This is the exactly color I have been looking for.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would be pretty on some occassions.  </li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve stated in a review for another polish in OPI&#x27;s Designer Series line, I first came across this polish in Google Images.</li>
      <li>They last a long time and the colors are great.</li>
      <li>I was looking for that crushed diamond look, instead it is kind of foiled looking.</li>
      <li>This would be great for a silver dress to complete the look but it is not for everyday wear.  </li>
      <li>Love the color and it lasts a long time!  </li>
      <li>We all know that OPI makes a superior product--excellent brush, proper consistency, and long wear.  </li>
      <li>OPI is certainly making me pay attention to my fingernails..</li>
      <li>I love to put down a gold or silver polish and then put the corresponding color of glitter on top (i.e., Sephora for OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Charge It!\\&quot; followed by Sephora for OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Only Gold for Me\\&quot;).</li>
      <li>However if you wish to put 2 coat&#x27;s on for a longer lasting effect that&#x27;s fine too.  </li>
      <li>Very opaque.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t chip fast</li>
      <li>it took forever to take off and it was too much of a metallic look to it</li>
      <li>It dries fast.  </li>
      <li>this color is really flexible in the sense that it can be worn alone or dressed up.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just a really sparkly silver</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Beautiful if you like a little &amp;#34;Bling&amp;#34; on your nails! This is a True Silver. Very easy to apply, and dries super fast! And that&#x27;s a big plus!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS COLOR! Great product</li>
    <li> This is a great OPI color that stays on pretty well I only have to reapply it every five or six days. It doesn&#x27;t look like tinfoil and it doesn&#x27;t reflect imaging it&#x27;s just a really sparkly silver</li>
    <li> OPI Radiance is a really great, high quality silver. It looks like you glued tin foil to your nails! That being said, I expected a holographic polish because all of the other OPI DS polishes I have are holographic. I do like this polish, but if you are wanting a holo, buy OPI DS Coronation.</li>
    <li> I love this polish so much.color is so nice! Metallic silver color its beautiful. I wear it every day. Bye</li>
    <li> I like this nail polish.  It looks like you painted your nails with liquid metal.  It dries fast.  It is hard to remove though.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color. I am very pleased with this nail polish. It was just the type of silver color I was looking for. Buy it, you will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I love love love this polish!  It&#x27;s the same color as shown in it&#x27;s picture, everywhere I go I am complimented on how great it looks.  Most polishes require 2 coats, this one does not. The color is vibrant enough that it&#x27;s not needed.  However if you wish to put 2 coat&#x27;s on for a longer lasting effect that&#x27;s fine too.  Deffinatly will reccomend to friends :) One down fall, it&#x27;s hard to remove, takes some good scrubbing to remove. The plus side is that it takes longer to chip/wear off :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a polish like this for a long time.  I used to use this other polish called aluminum that was discontinued.  This doesn&#x27;t chip fast and I only polish my toes, I&#x27;m a germaphobic and wash my hands quite often, so I can&#x27;t tell you how long it would last on you hands. This polish usually last about 2 weeks with maybe a little touching up but not much.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous silver color, very thick - you won&#x27;t need two coats with this polish.  Holds up pretty good to day to day wear.</li>
    <li> This color is so bold I luv it! I use Black Onyx as a base coat then I layer this over it n I get a breathtaking result. This is a new staple in my nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> Love it. Looks like foil affect. :-)</li>
    <li> I looks just like tin foil and is easy to apply. The color looks just like the photo show. You will not regret owning this shade or opi</li>
    <li> We all know that OPI makes a superior product--excellent brush, proper consistency, and long wear.  This color is marvelous.  It does take a bit of nerve to wear it (a brilliant solid metal!), so I first used it on my toenails and could not stop looking down!  That extreme flash of metal peeking out of my high heeled sandals was &amp;#34;just the thing&amp;#34;.  I felt amazing.  Now that the weather has turned in the Pacific Northwest and I need to switch to high heeled boots, I&#x27;ve tried this color on my hands, and while it&#x27;s wild, it&#x27;s also completely neutral, which doesn&#x27;t take away the flash, but it does make it un-gaudy, if you know what I mean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing color and superb product.  An opaque metal in a lesser brand would show brush strokes, bubbles, and general flaws, but this OPI color goes on like car paint.  It couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
    <li> I bought it from Drugstore.com. Usually I love OPI polishes but with DS Radiance DS038 I have a love-hate relationship. It goes on great and is almost opaque in one coat. I have always been a &amp;#34;two coat minimum&amp;#34; gal though. It looks phenomenal! What I do not like is the wearability factor. DS038 started to chip, peal, and rub off in just a day. Last photo shows the extreme wear on day 2. For that reason, I gave it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Amazing color and consistency, allowing for even application with a stunning result. Bonus - if you have a really thin color that takes several coats to get anywhere, you can use a base like this and give it a whole new look! If you do your nails at home, this is a bright and brilliant silver that&#x27;s great for an accent color or base that you should have in your collection.</li>
    <li> It is really bright, but not what I expected. I was looking for that crushed diamond look, instead it is kind of foiled looking.</li>
    <li> This is a rich opaque silver.  Beautiful under dark crackles , also makes classy, high shine French tips over black polish.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this online because it was out of stock locally.  Worried that freezing temps would ruin it in transit like paint can be ruined by freezing but it appeared to not be a problem.</li>
    <li> This flakes off quicker than other colors, but having said that, the color is a true silver and I love it!</li>
    <li> Having seen X-Men 2 a few times, I&#x27;ve always admired Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s manicure.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a metallic silver polish that will have effect you want.  I wanted an opaque color with a beautiful luster and received the best silver yet.  I&#x27;ve tried many other brands from Formula X to Essie and none have the same effect as this; it doesn&#x27;t look flat or dull but bright and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love, love, love.</li>
    <li> Pretty good nail polish wasn&#x27;t the chrome look I was looking for more of a glittery finish. It does coat well and stay on for a long time.</li>
    <li> I always love OPI nail colors. They last a long time and the colors are great. This is a unique color for sure!!</li>
    <li> Love this color!! I use it all the time when I go to the nail salon so I decided to buy me some for at home use!</li>
    <li> Love the color and it lasts a long time!  Great color and great for the holiday season.  Looking forward to wearing it often!</li>
    <li> Sorry all,I reviewed the color Coronation instead of this one in doing reviews. Unfortunately I never received that color. Shipper said it was delivered but it never got to me. I asked to reship but they were out of stock. All in all OPI ROCKS and the Designer Series of colors is amazing! radiance looks like pure liquid silver on the nails! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this color!! The metallic finish is gorgeous, you get the minx feel without having to pay an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend and would use this vendor again :)</li>
    <li> I had an old nail polish which looked like mirrored chrome when I put it on, and I purchased this thinking it would give me that same look.  This has some texture to the silver.  It isn&#x27;t bad.  But I read the reviews saying it looked like liquid silver and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> OPI makes such nice nail polish.  This is very shiny and goes on smoothly. It covers well and lasts for days</li>
    <li> This polish is amazing, perfect for stamping and it&#x27;s so pretty! I am really running out of this product already and will definitely buy more! Nice color.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shade of silver, very light and bright but with a very smooth finish. I think you can probably get away with 1 coat although I did use 2 coats. Like all OPI polish it is very smooth and flows well. My little girls love it too.</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty color.  Since I have silver hair..and love silver jewelry..I thought this would be pretty on some occassions.  I say why not.  OPI is certainly making me pay attention to my fingernails..I even wear my gloves to garden in now.  Making a woman of me.  :)</li>
    <li> it took forever to take off and it was too much of a metallic look to it but it arrived on time</li>
    <li> Love this color, lasts longer than most of my other polishes!</li>
    <li> great shine like aluminum foil. Has stayed on for two weeks on toes. Have not tried with manicure yet</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT cover! I use this for nail stamping art.  Works very well.  Very opaque.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is a silver foil looking polish.  Only on coat is needed and I did not need a base coat.  Great formula.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve stated in a review for another polish in OPI&#x27;s Designer Series line, I first came across this polish in Google Images. (I find Google Images to be indispensable when I&#x27;m researching a new polish--many nail bloggers post pictures of the color on their nails, in vast varieties of lighting.) \\&quot;Radiance\\&quot; is a true silver. If you could melt a bar of silver and then slather it on your nails, this is what it would look like. The color is bright and opaque with only one coat, though it takes at least two to achieve its full potential.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of creating intense, gaudy glitter looks with silver and gold polishes. I love to put down a gold or silver polish and then put the corresponding color of glitter on top (i.e., Sephora for OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Charge It!\\&quot; followed by Sephora for OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Only Gold for Me\\&quot;). I was searching for a high quality polish that would amp up my silver looks, and boy did I find it. I&#x27;d recommend this color to anyone searching for a silver color that is in no way shy.</li>
    <li> Definitely the truest silver I have found!</li>
    <li> i love this color. lots of compliments. want other colors that are meticlla. opi has the greatest polish and colors</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a much more bright and shiny holo, but to me it just looks like a silvery metal. It&#x27;s pretty enough, but it&#x27;s basically the exact same as a shade of Sally Hensen I bought from the drugstore (can&#x27;t remember the name at the moment).</li>
    <li> Love the nail polish! The color is great, nail polish is not old/thick, goes on very smoothly. There was a problem with my original order and the nail polish had somehow exploded during delivery. I contacted the sellers, sent them a picture of the damaged package/product, and they were quick to replace it at no extra charge. The nail polish is very true to color, so if you like silver you&#x27;ll be pleased with it.  Also, I see a couple reviews that say the polish is hard to remove--I personally didn&#x27;t have any trouble removing it.</li>
    <li> This is the exactly color I have been looking for.  It looks like you have metal toenails LOL!  OPI is always worth the price!</li>
    <li> I liked it. I&#x27;d recommend this product to those girls that like sparkly nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;OPI products are not toxic per what I read.</li>
    <li> Thought it would have a mirror effect</li>
    <li> got rave reviews from the girls</li>
    <li> Thought this would produce a mirror-like effect, but unfortunately, that is not the case. Nice silver metallic though.</li>
    <li> This color is like molten metal that just shimmers and shines, but without being too overpowering or ostentatious. I know, hard to imagine molten metal as being understated, but it really kinda is - and goes with everything!</li>
    <li> This would be great for a silver dress to complete the look but it is not for everyday wear.  Gave it away.</li>
    <li> this is the most amazing silver polish I have ever worn! in just one coat u can see the strong metal coloring and shine. in 2 coats it almost has a platinum look to it that is....well, RADIANT! this color is really flexible in the sense that it can be worn alone or dressed up. wearing 2 coats with a clear topcoat gives u a mirror-type look. you can also wear a glitter coat over it for extra PARTY fun. LOVE LOVE LOVE this color!</li>
