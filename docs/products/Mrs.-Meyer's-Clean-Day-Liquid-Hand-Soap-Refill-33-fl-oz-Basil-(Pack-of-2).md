    <li> I ordered two bottles, but only received one. Will return.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff is great.  Smells wonderful and it is a lot less thick than other hand soaps.  I would and have purchased again.</li>
    <li> Beware!!!! I received this order and it was actually the DISH SOAP - NOT the HAND SOAP as described and pictured.  It was also only 32 total for both containers.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The best hand soap ever. The double refill is very cost effective since I have 3 original dispensers to refill.</li>
    <li> Love that it is gentle on hands and smells good too</li>
    <li> All I can say is this is the best, most effective and efficient household cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Floors come clean with no effort.  No rinsing, no film.  Really light, pleasant smell.  Strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Exactly the high quality you&#x27;d expect from this company. Also- this soap is particularly good if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I saw some complaints that people did not receive the correct amount of soap.  I received 2 bottles that were 33 ounces each, for a total of 66 ounces of soap.  This is a great deal on a great smelling, environmentally friendly soap.  I would buy this item from this seller again and again!</li>
    <li> Love mrs. Meyer&#x27;s  do not like  this sent..  cannot detect basil</li>
    <li> Not just soap, this is a hand washing experience!  Looks good, smells good and does the job of making suds and cleaning my dirty, dirty hands.&lt;br /&gt;We keep re-ordering this stuff and you should too.</li>
    <li> This hand soap is sudless?</li>
    <li> Heaven on my hands.. Love love love!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap, and my house guests always comment on how lovely the scent is and how clean there hands feel afterwards.</li>
    <li> Came as 2 x 16oz bottles! Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this soap. I use them in the bathrooms and always receive compliments.</li>
    <li> Purchased at a great price. Great product and much more healthy, earth and animal friendly  than mainstream brands.</li>
    <li> I enJOY Mrs Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day products. This was a better price than purchasing directly from Mrs Meyer&#x27;s. Fast shipping. Will order again.</li>
    <li> What a product. I love Mrs. Meyer products.  Such a nice smell and soft feeling to my hands. I buy this all the time &amp; recommend this to everyone. The best soap.</li>
    <li> Misleading product description. It said 33oz 2 pack with a picture of 2 x 33oz jugs, then came as 2 x 16oz bottles.... which does not in fact add up to 2x 33oz bottles. Very disappointed with this misleading product listing.</li>
