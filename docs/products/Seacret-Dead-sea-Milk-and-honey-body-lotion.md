      <li>This is one of my favorite lotions.</li>
      <li>Received this item fine.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my arms and legs regularly and it works great.</li>
      <li>It is light enough for summer, soaks in quickly, and smells great.</li>
      <li>For example the body lotion ( by the way best lotion I have EVER used by far) I bought two bottles at a mall kiask for 19.99, when a week earlier they told me they were 30$ each!</li>
      <li>i have purchased seacret products for a long time and i am always most satisfied with all of the product(s).  peace:-)</li>
      <li>It is a great lotion with very little smell and leaves a smooth feel without the oil.  </li>
      <li>It hydrates ok and smells good, not overwhelming fragrance.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>A soft, thinner lotion which applies easily and is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used any other kind of lotion since I found the Seacret lotion years ago.  </li>
      <li>Last throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;A fresh clean scent, not over powering at all.</li>
      <li>One huge problem is the prices, they are never the same where ever you go and are always changing.</li>
      <li>This lotion works very well to soften skin.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to have that kind of texture.  </li>
      <li>The first was a gift and when it got really low, I ordered this one.  </li>
      <li>This cream did not come out as thick and nice as the same scent  of Seacret that I bought from their kiosk, very runny.</li>
      <li>Right out of the shower or a bath ,i have dry skin</li>
      <li>My skin feels silky soft after applying.</li>

    <li> This lotion is good.  However, it felt watery by the time I received it.  Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to have that kind of texture.  Prefer the body butter.</li>
    <li> Right out of the shower or a bath ,i have dry skin so i use some cocunut oil to seal it in and smells sooo good</li>
    <li> This is the softest silliest lotion I have ever used. I have to use it after I shave it just makes your legs feel so silky and sexy.</li>

    <li> This is the second tube of lotion I&#x27;ve gotten.  The first was a gift and when it got really low, I ordered this one.  It is a great lotion with very little smell and leaves a smooth feel without the oil.  I use it on my arms and legs regularly and it works great.</li>
