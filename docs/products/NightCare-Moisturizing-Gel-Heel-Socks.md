      <li>Will be buying more especially since they are more fashionable than others I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
      <li>product came quickly and it is just as pictured.  </li>
      <li>Helped heal my heel quickly when combined with a cracked foot cream.</li>
      <li>Every morning I&#x27;ve been able to slough away more dry skin.</li>
      <li>These really help to moisten my heels!</li>
      <li>I gave these to my grand daughter as a present</li>
      <li>I do wish that the sock was longer to cover my toes, but sometimes my feet get too hot</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want my feet to be too hot, but I&#x27;d like to soften them.  </li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>I have worn them at night several times, and when I remove them in the morning, my heels feel completely moist and hydrated, like my skin has been nicely plumped.  </li>
      <li>After two evenings my heels were so much softer and improved.  </li>
      <li>There is a print line running down the front and back - but they are LOADS better than light colored ones and won&#x27;t get grungy</li>
      <li>My heels are so soft and pretty.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
      <li>would highly recommend these</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Not too heavy a material, stretchy nylon is more comfortable than expected.  </li>
      <li>but they fit similar to prior purchases.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>Just put them on before bedtime - no sweaty feet and in the  morning soft heels!</li>
      <li>The other socks I bought showed soil&lt;br /&gt;and did not come clean even with stain remover.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;To be clear this product retains the moisture in your feet, but doesn&#x27;t seem to add any to them.</li>
      <li>So after my nightly shower, when my feet still soft, I add the balm and put the socks</li>
      <li>Works like no other foot socks have!</li>
      <li>reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the softening is relative to how soft your feet are when you use the socks.  </li>
      <li>heel socks are very beneficial in treating rough heels.  </li>
      <li>These certainly live up to other recommendations.  </li>
      <li>hard to walk in but worth the money</li>

    <li> hard to walk in but worth the money</li>
    <li> I love these socks. Fit is great and I have thick ankles. Very comfortable. Not too heavy a material, stretchy nylon is more comfortable than expected.  I&#x27;ve been using with heel rescue cream for about a week.  Every morning I&#x27;ve been able to slough away more dry skin. Really works!</li>
    <li> WOW!  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  I recently found that&lt;br /&gt;gel heel socks are very beneficial in treating rough heels.  I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;around five different brands and overall this product is the best.&lt;br /&gt;It works with and without creams and is very comfortable (e.g., wearing&lt;br /&gt;all night in bed works fine).  The best reason to buy this particular&lt;br /&gt;brand is because they stay clean over extended wear and wash well (on&lt;br /&gt;gentle cycle of washing machine).  The other socks I bought showed soil&lt;br /&gt;and did not come clean even with stain remover.  The leopard material&lt;br /&gt;on this sock not only does not show the soiled spots but it also cleans&lt;br /&gt;up like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these (I just ordered two more pairs for myself).</li>
    <li> great product they are good for about a month wearing.</li>
    <li> I love the way these heel socks make my feet feel.  I have worn them at night several times, and when I remove them in the morning, my heels feel completely moist and hydrated, like my skin has been nicely plumped.  I love these and will definitely purchase more!</li>
    <li> These are great. The heel has a jelly, waxed feel. Great to wear while sleeping!  Leaves no residue.  Looks like picture.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t hardly believe it (I was skeptical), but these really did soften my heels. They&#x27;re a keeper!</li>
    <li> I love these. Helped heal my heel quickly when combined with a cracked foot cream. Will be buying more especially since they are more fashionable than others I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> these do work - they are a bit tight - and I have a small foot - so if you have a bigger foot that could be a problem</li>
    <li> Cute and does the job.  My heels are terrible, and these have helped, however I still need to use a pumice stone on them for a finished look.  They are not too tight either.  I guess I have a medium size foot - perhaps a little on the wide side?  I wear a size 6.5 and these fit perfect.  They do not bother me at all during the night.  Be careful walking in them though, the gel heel can make you loose your balance, almost feeling as though you are slipping.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing gel heel socks for years to keep the callouses on my dry AZ feet to a minimum. When it came time to replace a recent pair I was euphoric to find these - not only NOT white - but whimsically patterned.  I was concerned they would run small but they fit similar to prior purchases. There is a print line running down the front and back - but they are LOADS better than light colored ones and won&#x27;t get grungy (I tend to sometimes walk around in them if I am up at night with a kid or whatnot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and YES these DO work. I recommend a cream with UREA in the ingredients. It seems to work best even though it feels a little funky. I have used many brands.  I would not recommend using the BodyShop Shea cream with them. I woke up in the morning to this putrid smell when I used it. I washed the socks and they still smelled do bad I threw them in the trash and ordered these!</li>
    <li> Absolutely in Love with these.....not just because it&#x27;s Leopard print but because these feel Sooooo gooood on...I have severe cracked feet and when I take them off in the morning my cracks are alot softer and not as hard and sore...&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
    <li> The product is a great choice for summertime softening.  I don&#x27;t want my feet to be too hot, but I&#x27;d like to soften them.  This is a great option for both.  It has the silicone or gel padding in the heel and you can sleep with them and your feet stays cool.&lt;br /&gt;The product came quickly and it is just as pictured.  I use it with a cracked heel balm, but it says you can wear them alone for softening.&lt;br /&gt;*The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the softening is relative to how soft your feet are when you use the socks.  It doesn&#x27;t do any additional softening (as it says)but seems to maintains what you already have. So after my nightly shower, when my feet still soft, I add the balm and put the socks on.&lt;br /&gt;To be clear this product retains the moisture in your feet, but doesn&#x27;t seem to add any to them.</li>
    <li> These certainly live up to other recommendations.  After two evenings my heels were so much softer and improved.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with very dry skin on my feet. I have tried cream and plastic bags with socks over the top for an hour. I have tried cream and socks at night. But nothing has worked as well as cream and these gel socks. A marvellous difference from dragon feet to almost silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Ohhhh! These are perfect. I have used them for about 2 weeks (2-3 times a week) and the difference is amazing! My heels are so soft and pretty. I do wish that the sock was longer to cover my toes, but sometimes my feet get too hot so this is ok for now.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my dry cracked heels.  Just put them on before bedtime - no sweaty feet and in the  morning soft heels!</li>
    <li> These are the best for keeping my heels soft, the gel keeps your heels moist (I&#x27;m 50). I used them every night (applying my own lotion on my heels), and they were perfectly soft. I tried a little experiment, doing without the gel socks and just applying my lotion and wow...in a few weeks I had the worst looking heels...they had to do a little extra work when I got my pedi. I&#x27;m back to using them, they work and come on, just don&#x27;t be lazy...have nice heels for those sandals :)))</li>
    <li> I gave these to my grand daughter as a present and she loves them.</li>
    <li> Love this. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> Works like no other foot socks have! Probably won&#x27;t work well for wide or swollen feet!</li>
    <li> These really help to moisten my heels! and they are really cute!</li>
