      <li>I feel like it still kind of does its job because it&#x27;s an oil, but I don&#x27;t think it is what it is supposed to be.</li>
      <li>Smells like cotton candy and provides a nice shine, without looking oily.  </li>
      <li>This product normally smells wonderful and like cotton candy.  </li>

      <li>Does a great job smoothing my wavy hair after I&#x27;ve blown it straight and leaves a nice fragrance which always draws compliments.</li>

      <li>I have been using TIGI products for years and, in my opinion, most are quality products.  </li>
      <li>I really love shine blaster.  </li>
      <li>Too thick/heavy for my hair (might be better for curly hair).    </li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>and i found it on Amazon (LOVE AMAZON)</li>
      <li>It smells like candy, sure, but it smooths out your mane without making you look greasy.  </li>
      <li>Have used this for years and love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff....</li>
      <li>Have been searching hair salons but haven&#x27;t been able to locate it.</li>
      <li>I love the fruity fragrance.  </li>
      <li>So glad I can get it online.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this line.  </li>
      <li>it puts a nice glow to your hair, but do not use too much because it acts to condition also.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a light, non-greasy, cotton candy smelling, smoothing, detangling product...  </li>
      <li>Light, non greasy and smells like candy.  </li>
      <li>That bottle was clear and smelled good.</li>
      <li>The price use to be cheaper but still worth the price!</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this after reading reviews for its cotton candy smell.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;d use this product even if it didn&#x27;t work because I love the fragrance so much!</li>
      <li>This is NOT like the original product you would buy in a salon.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant enough.  </li>
      <li>I love the Tigi line to begin with, but this really makes your hair silky and the reviews, so true, it smells yummy like bubble gum.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells like cotton candy left out in a hot car - kind of sweet, but not too sweet.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more.  </li>
      <li>I used this many different ways, and I just could not get this to work with my hair at all.  </li>
      <li>This product came exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I first tried this out at the salon.  </li>
      <li>I have very high expectations when it comes to Tigi products.  </li>
      <li>Buy in any store and youll pay twice as much</li>
      <li>I know this is called a shine blaster, but I really think the power comes from its ability to control flyaways.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this, but nothing they make compares to the old Shine Junkie.</li>
      <li>Go to a salon the price is about the same and worth the drive.  </li>
      <li>I like this product normally , but when it arrived it was cloudy and smelled like vegetable oil.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without my Rock Star.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Rockaholic Shine Blaster for about 6 months and have found it to be a nice product without weighing down my hair or making it feel greasy; however, the shine and smoothness do not last in extreme dry weather (live in Phx) or perform well against humid climates (travel to Tampa 4 or more time/year).  </li>
      <li>Keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Just a small amount rubbed through wet hair and my hair dries smooth and sleek.</li>
      <li>and I have SUPER DUPER thick, coarse hair.  </li>

<li> Sad they don&#x27;t make it anymore!</li>
<li> The oil smelled rancid and nasty--like bad vegetable oil.  </li>
<li> Disappointed!</li>
<li> This is lower quality and smells awful--</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this product! Found it at Marshall&#x27;s. Have been searching hair salons but haven&#x27;t been able to locate it. So glad I can get it online. It is better than Moroccan oil!</li>
    <li> I have been using TIGI products for years and, in my opinion, most are quality products.  I have used the Rockaholic Shine Blaster for about 6 months and have found it to be a nice product without weighing down my hair or making it feel greasy; however, the shine and smoothness do not last in extreme dry weather (live in Phx) or perform well against humid climates (travel to Tampa 4 or more time/year).  In my opinion, CHI Silk Infusion is a superior product in these climates and adds a silky feel to my hair.  For reference, I have thick hair with a natural tendency to curl (somewhat coarse hair).</li>
    <li> I was exposed to this product in my hair salon, however when I received this product the packaging did not appear to be in &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; condition and when I opened the container the product was not the same consistency as what was used in the hair salon.  Overall I was not satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> If you have thick and wavy hair, this is the product made for you!  It resists humidity and frizz.  I have used this product for a year now and it is the best product that I have ever came across that tames my hair and makes it look soft and smooth.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have very high expectations when it comes to Tigi products.  In fact I ONLY use Tigi products.  I was very excited to try this line.  The Shine Blaster is great.  Smells like cotton candy and provides a nice shine, without looking oily.  I have long, thick hair (almost down to my waist) and only use about a dime sized amount.  I found that for my wavy hair, this product is perfect.  I&#x27;ve also tried S factor&#x27;s Lusterizer.  Too thick/heavy for my hair (might be better for curly hair).    So if you&#x27;re looking for a light, non-greasy, cotton candy smelling, smoothing, detangling product...  This is it!  Oh BTW, salon price is around $20.  I save about $6 buying it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like this product normally , but when it arrived it was cloudy and smelled like vegetable oil. I returned it and went to the store and bought it. That bottle was clear and smelled good.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!!! I love the Tigi line to begin with, but this really makes your hair silky and the reviews, so true, it smells yummy like bubble gum. I will forever think Tigi Rocks as they truly know about hair!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I first tried this out at the salon.  My stylist put something deliciously cotton candy smelling in my hair and I knew I had to have it.  I know this is called a shine blaster, but I really think the power comes from its ability to control flyaways.  It&#x27;s some of the best smoothing serum I&#x27;ve tried.  It smells like candy, sure, but it smooths out your mane without making you look greasy.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair shines, not gooey or hair drys out</li>
    <li> Keeps flyaways in place.  Keeps my hair soft and manageable. Love the scent and always get complemented when put it into my hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. smells Delicious, like cotton candy and works great on my hair. My local beauty shop is no longer carrying this and i found it on Amazon (LOVE AMAZON) i got this super quick and i am very happy with my purchase. I bought two so i don&#x27;t run out anytime soon!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like cotton candy left out in a hot car - kind of sweet, but not too sweet.  It is honestly the best hair product I have ever used.  I will buy it till there is no more.  One bottle lasts me about 3-4 months and I have SUPER DUPER thick, coarse hair.  I&#x27;m obsessed.  Sad they don&#x27;t make it anymore!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It helps manage the every day problem with frizz. Meanwhile, it adds a beautiful shine without making my hair greasy. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and love it.  Smells like cotton candy</li>
    <li> When this arrived it had leaked a little less than 1/4 of the product out in the packaging, but I could deal with that. I was excited to try this after reading reviews for its cotton candy smell. What I received does NOT smell like cotton candy. In fact, it has no smell at all if maybe SLIGHTLY like olive oil as other reviewers have said. I feel like it still kind of does its job because it&#x27;s an oil, but I don&#x27;t think it is what it is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> I love rockaholic! Light, non greasy and smells like candy.  Will definitely be buying more.  Buy in any store and youll pay twice as much</li>
    <li> I had the same experience as another reviewer.  The oil smelled rancid and nasty--like bad vegetable oil.  This is NOT like the original product you would buy in a salon.  This product normally smells wonderful and like cotton candy.  This is lower quality and smells awful--do not buy from here!!!  Go to a salon the price is about the same and worth the drive.  This was NOT--yuck!  I&#x27;m returning and will probably have to pay shipping to return--not worth it at all! Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great Seller, great price and fast shipping...5 Stars all the way!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without my Rock Star.  I love the fruity fragrance.  It&#x27;s a perfect compliment to Foxy Curls.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.... It works wonders.... It never leaves your hair greasy but tames the frizz, I wish they had bigger bottles...</li>
    <li> This product came exactly as advertised. A very small dab of it makes dry hair looks sleeker and shinier. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I used this many different ways, and I just could not get this to work with my hair at all.  It left a greasy residue, and not enough shine to make up for it!  It just made me sad.  The smell is pleasant enough.  I really wanted to like this, but nothing they make compares to the old Shine Junkie.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hair can get a little frizzy at times and this is the only product that does wonders to my hair! The price use to be cheaper but still worth the price!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the awesome price..!!</li>
    <li> Love the product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> My stylist got me hooked on Rockaholic.  It is the best hair oil that I have ever tried.  Plus it smells great, like cotton candy.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this product..........it puts a nice glow to your hair, but do not use too much because it acts to condition also.</li>
    <li> This  is not the same product smell like olive oil and is very heavy  on hair very disappointed</li>
    <li> I really love shine blaster.  It does a lot for my hair that nothing else can do.It is just perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Does a great job smoothing my wavy hair after I&#x27;ve blown it straight and leaves a nice fragrance which always draws compliments. I think I&#x27;d use this product even if it didn&#x27;t work because I love the fragrance so much!</li>
    <li> This is lighter than most of the popular oils.  I LOVE the scent!</li>
    <li> Just a small amount rubbed through wet hair and my hair dries smooth and sleek. Dry hair it shines up wonderfully!</li>
