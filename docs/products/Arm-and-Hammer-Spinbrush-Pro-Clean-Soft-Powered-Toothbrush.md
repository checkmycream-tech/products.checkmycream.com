      <li>I received one of these for Christmas many years ago.</li>
      <li>This is simply the best toothbrush that I have used.  </li>
      <li>I was able to do it by gripping both ends with rubber grippers.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time, packaging ok, no bumps, both worked.</li>

      <li>Nice clean teeth.</li>
      <li>Its pretty decent, not the best, but its ok.</li>
      <li>I love my new one very much!!!!!</li>
      <li>Good product, work well, last about 6 months which is good.</li>
      <li>, my teeth are super slimey feeling, like when I first got my braces off 7 years ago, lol.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s insanely easy.</li>
      <li>weeks of use and seem to be going strong.</li>
      <li>good value and decent performance.</li>
      <li>I liked it for the first two weeks.  </li>
      <li>Ok so i love these kind of brushes your teeth feel super clean but at a cost iv been using this type of tooth brush for about 2 years now and my gum line is deteriorating they are really receding away.</li>
      <li>but when i went to the dentist she did an x ray and said my teeth were fine</li>
      <li>Amazon had a fantastic price on these when I purchased them.</li>
      <li>I suffer from receeding gums from overbrushing and this brush works really well without damaging the gums and leaves my teeth feeling nicely polished.</li>
      <li>I guess this is what you can expect from a cheap product.</li>
      <li>A bit tricky to find how to change the battery, but, overall, it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
      <li>So much that both husband and son are getting their own.</li>
      <li>dental hygenist while not suggesting a particular brand said that it wasn&#x27;t necessary to pay a lot for one either that good electric toothbrushes that would do a good job could be purchased</li>
      <li>The cons: first, the brush head apparatus is huge!</li>
      <li>Works great, lasts a long time and cleans my teeth thoroughly, preventing tartar build up and tooth decay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this device is just dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My dentist couldn&#x27;t get over how clean my teeth were and said I would never have gum disease if I kept up my regimen.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Right away I noticed how clean my teeth feel.  </li>
      <li>This part is supposed to easily slide inside the main shaft of the toothbrush, but more times than not, it ends up blocking the cap from locking into place.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for years and my dentist tells me my teeth are always clean.  </li>
      <li>I feel my oral health has greatly improved since using this and needless to say I am happy.</li>
      <li>now hooked on that clean feeling</li>
      <li>Brush battery lasts a considerable time, and the nice feature is the heads are replaceable.</li>
      <li>Compared to my old manual toothbrush the Spinbrush always does a  nice</li>
      <li>Teeth feel super clean after use.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it two stars is because it does do a good job of cleaning your teeth when the water isn&#x27;t leaking in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m all for going for super clean teeth</li>
      <li>The pros: it was very affordable and cleaned better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>This was quickly taken care of with a toothpick.  </li>
      <li>The batteries that come with the brush, run out of charge quickly.</li>
      <li>I considered an electric toothbrush but quickly realized I&#x27;d be paying for bells and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an electric toothbrush &amp; does that job exactly adequately</li>
      <li>But, it will hopefully last a lot longer, and be more reliable!</li>
      <li>During that time the brushes seemed to clean pretty well.</li>
      <li>I got it about 4 months ago because it was cheap, and I have been using Crest toothpaste for my whole life.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t worth it for what it&#x27;ll do to your blood pressure when you try to replace the battery.</li>
      <li>I noted the Spinbrush had a nice review from a study done by the American Dental Association noting that up to 70% of dental plaque was removed with a Spinbrush.  </li>
      <li>hardly worth it at all.  </li>
      <li>Bought two and two packs of replacement tip well worth it for me.</li>
      <li>And the batteries are really powerful.</li>
      <li>The brush is gentle enough that my teeth feel a very refreshing feeling after each use and no pain or bleeding in my gums.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel extremely clean not just after brushing but through out the whole day.  </li>
      <li>My husband is very strong and even he struggled to open this compartment, when the batteries needed replacing.</li>
      <li>I bought two of these because I wanted to try something different than the cheap ones directed for kids, and these are way way way better quality, and do a much better job at actually cleaning my kids teeth.  </li>

    <li> Great toothbrush love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Good power. Soft tips. Nice feel. Good strength. Nice clean teeth. Wish replacement tips were cheaper. Bought two and two packs of replacement tip well worth it for me.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is not rechargeable.  Not what I expected.  Should have paid closer attention to ad.  But it has held up well so far.</li>
    <li> This is a great little electric toothbrush for a very good price. It works great and is a huge improvement over my manual brush. I have no idea why so many people are complaining about how hard it is to open the battery case. It&#x27;s insanely easy. Just follow the little picture at the bottom which tells you to open the case at an angle. I&#x27;m assuming maybe the company redesigned it or something, because I can&#x27;t see how so many people could find it so hard to open....  EDIT: Had it for about 3 months and threw it away. Seemed to be \\&quot;eating away\\&quot; at the battery.. causing battery acid to leak which made a terrible smell and completely killed the battery life. Had to switch the batteries three times (even used different brand of batteries)... and this happened every single time. Piece of junk...</li>
    <li> Despite taking good care of my teeth, it seems that the dental hygienist always finds alot of buildup on the lingual side of my teeth. After doing some research it seemed that this brush was the best choice for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay $100 for all the bells and whistles.  I have noticed a difference and I hope that with time the dental hygienist will as well.</li>
    <li> Once I forgot my Sonicare on a trip, and I picked up this brush as an emergency replacement for the week. The pros: it was very affordable and cleaned better than a manual toothbrush. The cons: first, the brush head apparatus is huge! It was almost uncomfortable, and I don&#x27;t have a tiny mouth. Second, it was difficult to thoroughly clean the brush head afterwards, as it has two sets of moving parts. Finally, the battery cover is VERY hard to remove. I never did manage it. Perhaps the design is intended to protect the batteries from water, but if you have to throw the whole thing away because you&#x27;re unable to replace the batteries, I think that&#x27;s counterproductive. I definitely won&#x27;t be giving up my Sonicare, but in a pinch, I felt that this brush performed adequately enough. It is an improvement over manual brushing.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get to open the covers to replace the batteries. It&#x27;s maddening! Why in the world would they make something so tight and impossible? I live alone, so what do I need to do to pop it open? Search for Mr Ironman with incredible Hulk strength to split it apart? I have tried everything from pulling it at every possible angle while pressing the dents, and its still stuck. Is it a good toothbrush? Its pretty decent, not the best, but its ok. The bristles are hard though, even when it says \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot;. So be careful about not pressing this so hard on the gums.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrushes.  I received two colors which was good for me and my husband.  Cleans better than my regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I got it about 4 months ago because it was cheap, and I have been using Crest toothpaste for my whole life. It worked really well and got most of the stains off my teeth from drinking coffee every day, among other things. Two major drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: Do not brush your gums with this or any e-toothbrush while it&#x27;s on. It will eat them away to the point where your roots are exposed and it&#x27;s painful to even drink warm water. My gums have grown back somewhat since I realized this was happening, thankfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: The design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed within a few weeks that this thing eats batteries. Every week or sooner I was changing them, just from one 2 minute brush a day. So 14 minute battery life? I thought it was ridiculous. So I got my rechargeable batteries. They were slightly larger than standard double A&#x27;s so I forced them in. Why did the battery compartment have to be such a tight fit? But they lasted a month between charges. Each time though, it was harder to get the cap on and off, and it appears my batteries are actually corroding! (Holes forming in the + ends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general this thing was just getting gross. Dried toothpaste and spit in every seam, inside the battery compartment, the rubber that&#x27;s supposed to seal the batteries in is falling off. And the switch kept getting looser. Turning it \\&quot;on\\&quot; did nothing, you had to continue pushing and hold it there to get it to work. Finally after the third time recharging my batteries I just could not get it to turn on. So I tried regular ones. Lasted 3 days, then died. I&#x27;m pretty sure this device is just dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now hooked on that clean feeling I get from an e-toothbrush so I&#x27;ll be looking at a more expensive rechargeable model. But, it will hopefully last a lot longer, and be more reliable! But crest, please stick to toothpaste.</li>
    <li> A couple years ago my wife and I bought Spinbrushes. My wife&#x27;s worked for about a year and a half, mine for a couple months more. During that time the brushes seemed to clean pretty well. We each replaced our brushes with new Spinbrushes. My wife&#x27;s brush has worked fine, but mine worked for less than a week when it began shutting off. Apparently, there is a bad connection either with the batteries or in the switch. It will work for a bit if I hit it with my hand or on the countertop. I guess this is what you can expect from a cheap product. It&#x27;s a lot less frustrating to just use a hand brush that will not break down.</li>
    <li> Works much better than conventional toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Spinbrush for a little more than two years now and I am extremely satisfied.  It was a while ago so I don&#x27;t remember which model it was however from my experience I think all the brush heads are interchangeable.  The brush is gentle enough that my teeth feel a very refreshing feeling after each use and no pain or bleeding in my gums.  I&#x27;ve also never had any problem changing the batteries or with water getting inside the unit.  While undoubtedly not up to par with more expensive toothbrushes available the Spinbrush is still a solid, easy-to-use, versatile budget option.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a week but does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to , on wish I had the option to choose between colors . .</li>
    <li> I started using this toothbrush while it was still called the Crest Spinbrush.  This is simply the best toothbrush that I have used.  Granted that this is also the first electronic brush I&#x27;ve used but this is also the only one I can afford.    Through three of this toothbrush now I am still as satisfied as ever.  My dentist seems to agree with me that this is a really good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Ok so i love these kind of brushes your teeth feel super clean but at a cost iv been using this type of tooth brush for about 2 years now and my gum line is deteriorating they are really receding away.My gums were killing me they hurt really bad i thought i had a cavity but when i went to the dentist she did an x ray and said my teeth were fine then she looked at my gums and freaked she said they were really bad and theres nothing they can do besides put fluoride on them and that will help but its only temporary and i will have to keep doing it  as i get older it will get worse I&#x27;m pissed this sucks i don&#x27;t even brush hard its the tooth brush its so abusive on your tooth but it does clean your teeth good and whitens them so i look at it its ok to use for a short period of time but keep an eye on your gum line</li>
    <li> The batteries that come with the brush, run out of charge quickly. So I decided to put in my own rechargeable batteries. The bottom cover is really difficult to take off. I was able to do it by gripping both ends with rubber grippers. But once the cap was off, to replace the cover with new batteries is an impossible task. Even my hubby tried to shut it closed and he couldn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Excellent Spinbrush Toothbrush for your kids</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has made an enormous improvement in my dental health. I&#x27;ve been using them for a number of years now. A great bargain for what they accomplish!</li>
    <li> I regret deeply of buying this toothbrush. The cover is too hard to remove. And once you do it to replace the batteries it simply won&#x27;t close properly anymore. With the the cover semi-open, it let water in, damaging my replaceable batteries.  My husband had the same problem once he tried to replace the batteries. SO we just decided to get another toothbrush.  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Use this and The Doctor&#x27;s brush picks, and you&#x27;ll never have gum disease. My dentist couldn&#x27;t get over how clean my teeth were and said I would never have gum disease if I kept up my regimen. He was relatively new and didn&#x27;t realize I had already had treatment for the beginning stages of gum disease years ago.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush is great. I&#x27;ve been using for 6 years with no trouble.  bought a years supply when they were on sale. highly recconend.</li>
    <li> I had thought about getting an electric toothbrush but wasn&#x27;t about lay out a lot of money for one and then have to pay an arm and a leg for brush replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygenist while not suggesting a particular brand said that it wasn&#x27;t necessary to pay a lot for one either that good electric toothbrushes that would do a good job could be purchased rather inexpensively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out a lot of  electric toothbrushes on the web and their user reviews. Some were very pricey...definately out of my league.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Consumer Research I noted the Spinbrush had a nice review from a study done by the American Dental Association noting that up to 70% of dental plaque was removed with a Spinbrush.  Whatsmore you could pick one up for as little as 12 bucks.  Well, I said to myself, if the ADA gives it a good report and its not all that expensive and the user reviews were generally favorable to the product I should purchase one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my delight the Spinbrush was on sale at Target for 9.50 last December.  So I got the Spinbrush and  a couple of brush heads that were also marked down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away I noticed how clean my teeth feel.  Compared to my old manual toothbrush the Spinbrush always does a  nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alkaline AA batteries that came with the Spinbrush lasted about 4 weeks and were replaced with rechargeable AA&#x27;s.  (I never buy alkaline batteries).&lt;br /&gt;I notice my rechargable AA&#x27;s are now approaching5 weeks of use and seem to be going strong. That&#x27;s twice a day use of at least 2 mins per brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darned if I can come up with anything negative about the Spinbrush....except when I went to replace the batteries I had a bit of a challenge (as some other reviewers have indicated) in removing the cap at the base of the brush.  But figured it out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how to remove the cap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place the Spinbrush on the edge of a table with the brush facing AWAY from you.  The cap end ofthe Spinbrush should be extended out over the table edge just a half inch or so beyond  where the cap attatches to the handle of the Spinbrush.  Hold the Spinbrush in place with your left and with the heel of the palm of your right hand push down on the cap and it will open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the Spinbrush and have no problem in recommending it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/13/13 I continue to be happy with my Spinbrush but I thought I would add a note regarding a possible problem with the switch that you may experience that can be quickly taken care of..  I noticed on a couple of occasions that the Spinbrush would not turn on or I had a problem keeping it turned on.  I found that this was caused by toothpaste build up that prevented the switch from being fully engaged in the ON position.  This was quickly taken care of with a toothpick.  I used the toothpick to remove the toothpaste while the unit was in the OFF poition.  Then when I turned it ON I did the same at the other end of the switch where you would switch it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/29/14 Solved the toothpaste build up issue.  I started running tap water over the switch area after each use to rinse it as well as the entire Spinbrush and I have not had a problem since.  Don&#x27;t why it took me so long to figure this out.  Guess I thought water would get through the switch mechanism and render it useless. But I was wrong.  The entire Spinbrush seems to be waterproof.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is just wonderful.  I&#x27;ve had the expensive rechargeable electric toothbrushes on and off for years.  When my kids were about 2, and used to regular teeth brushing, I started them on the cheap kids electric toothbrushes with the cartoon characters on the handles, but they were always poor quality, total battery suckers, and hardly worth it at all.  I bought two of these because I wanted to try something different than the cheap ones directed for kids, and these are way way way better quality, and do a much better job at actually cleaning my kids teeth.  I haven&#x27;t tried to change the batteries yet, as I haven&#x27;t needed to, but unless it&#x27;s absolutely impossible, I will soldier on with these because they are great bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> After owning the Crest versions of this product for years, the one that has the rubber coated on/off switch, I purchased the new Arm and Hammer model. After about a week I noticed a vile smell coming out of the plastic switch.  I always rinse well after use, and for many years never had this problem. I am pretty sure the new switch is NOT water tight like the old one and in an effort to cheapen the product for more profit they, in their infinite, corporate ,greedy wisdom decided that that would ruin a very nice product in the name of the almighty stock holder.  As with all Chinese made GARBAGE, off to the trash it goes and will buy a rechargeable one made anywhere but China and by anyone else....</li>
    <li> Although I would give this product a 5 star rating for cleaning, I&#x27;ve found it almost impossible to change the batteries.  Correcting the way this very difficult battery cover opens and closes would certainly make it a more desirable product, especially since this is a chore that needs to be repeated at least monthly.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat order for my husband and son. The first one was a gift to me 3 months ago. Loved the Spinbrush the 1st time I used it. Cleans really well, like i&#x27;ve gone to the dentist. And the batteries are really powerful. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now, everyday, three times a day and the batteries haven&#x27;t dwindled a bit. I really am enjoying brushing now.. So much that both husband and son are getting their own.</li>
    <li> I really have nothing bad to say about this. It is for those who like a stronger cleaning, but I feel that nothing has been missed when brushing with this-- like I&#x27;ve got the toothbrushing down with a little extra polishing as well. I really like it. It&#x27;s not for the extremelly sensitive, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve paid a LOT more for other brushes that can&#x27;t come close to this one.  One from a dentist&#x27;s office was over $200!  This is a basic powered brush and it works fine.  A bit tricky to find how to change the battery, but, overall, it&#x27;s a great product.  One thing--replacement heads are sometimes more expensive than just buying a new Spinbrush--especially on Ebay or Amazon.</li>
    <li> ALERT: As of 11/22/2011 this product is $9.99 for a two pack at Costco in Cypress, Ca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone washes their forks and spoons after using them, but who washes their toothbrush? I was looking for a way do sanitize my electric toothbrush daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I bought the two pack from Costco and then 4 sets of replacement heads from Amazon here. What we do is change the heads after brushing our teeth and throw the dirty ones in the dishwasher. Having about 5 heads per brush handle works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment over time can leak so I use waterproof medical tape to cover the seam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery cover can be difficult to close. Sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t want to get all the way back on. I broke a cover on an old one 2 years ago banging it on a table to get it to seat correctly. This time I&#x27;ll try using a little Vaseline on the battery compartment gasket so that it can slip back on easier. If it breaks again I&#x27;ll just take it back to Costco for an exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t ask me why I&#x27;ve got Vaseline in my bathroom, I&#x27;ll never admit to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through about 4 of these, every time a victim of water getting into the battery compartment and corroding everything. Then I did a little research and found a solution. If you do buy one of these, go to the local hardware store before you even open the package (a larger Ace affiliate would do) and buy a higher-quality rubber O-ring. I found the Lincoln Products #129014 is ideal. Also, get some Gel-lube from a bicycle store and apply it to the O-ring before installing it. The O-ring is a slightly larger cross-section than the stock version so it&#x27;ll be a little more difficult to get the battery compartment seated, but once it&#x27;s on then the water seal at that location is basically perfect.&lt;br /&gt;  What I suspect is happening is that the stock O-ring conforms to the position and stays that way. Then after your next battery replacement it&#x27;s probably got a twist or two and allows water to seep in. A more resilient O-ring will maintain a circular cross-section and maintain a dry compartment.&lt;br /&gt;  This all sounds like a lot of bother, but we&#x27;re talking about a $10+ toothbrush that dies soon after the first battery replacement. We&#x27;re talking years instead of months for the life of the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush. Gets the job done. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great Value toothbrush that gets the job done! Brush battery lasts a considerable time, and the nice feature is the heads are replaceable. Purchased as a nice temporary option because I didn&#x27;t want to take my $200 sonicare with me to Afghanistan.</li>
    <li> These only lasted me for only two weeks&lt;br /&gt;It just stopped working for some reason&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why but I was disappointed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an electric toothbrush &amp; does that job exactly adequately but it isn&#x27;t worth it for what it&#x27;ll do to your blood pressure when you try to replace the battery. What demon in Hell came up with this unnecessarily difficult method? And who in the name of all that is decent is the author of that singularly tormenting diagram to show \\&quot;how it is done\\&quot;? Shame on you. Shame on you! Seriously, if the company doesn&#x27;t think the customers deserve anything better for their money, why bother?</li>
    <li> Works great!  Everybody in the family uses one and I will continue to purchase.  Amazon had a fantastic price on these when I purchased them.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be about 75% effective as a sonic-type electric toothbrush, and is a lot less expensive. However, water collects inside the brush shaft and should be cleaned after each using. This is a real NUISANCE and, therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t buy the item again.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again. The bristles are too soft and you don&#x27;t feel your teeth are that clean after using it  . It&#x27;s ok for kids, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush. Brushing your teeth with this compared to your normal toothbrush is night and day. I would recommend to anyone. Cleans and polishes teeth. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and built to last, this little wonder will make you wonder why you didn&#x27;t get rid of the manual toothbrush years ago.</li>
    <li> Good product, work well, last about 6 months which is good. Had them before, this was a exceptional deal.&lt;br /&gt; Arrived on time, packaging ok, no bumps, both worked.</li>
    <li> Recently bought this and was pleasantly surprised!! A manual brush doesn&#x27;t compare.  My teeth feel extremely clean not just after brushing but through out the whole day.  Actually doesn&#x27;t require a lot of effort; let the power of the brush clean your teeth. I feel my oral health has greatly improved since using this and needless to say I am happy.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t even bother to replace the batteries. Save your sanity and just throw this thing away. The battery cover will not reseat in the handle. We will not buy another one of these.</li>
    <li> good value and decent performance.Would recommend to family and/ or good freinds. Not as good as real expensive but does a decent job.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush I was using died on me and a new one was necessary. I love my new one very much!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, replacement heads are available. We have found that alkaline batteries seem to work better than rechargeable the ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I invested in this. Felt like I was never getting my teeth super clean with a regular toothbrush, I felt like plaque wouldn&#x27;t come off, even with flossing. I bought this, my teeth are super slimey feeling, like when I first got my braces off 7 years ago, lol. I&#x27;ve noticed such a difference in a week, even a day.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> Very loud but works as it should. Teeth feel super clean after use. I wished I could&#x27;ve chosen a different color other than pink.</li>
    <li> I suffer from receeding gums from overbrushing and this brush works really well without damaging the gums and leaves my teeth feeling nicely polished. Recommend it. Need the pro version though.</li>
    <li> It vibrates way to hard and the toothpaste won&#x27;t stay put on it. Also, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to  get the bottom off to change the batteries. Glad it wasn&#x27;t more expensive, because I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> really enjoy the results of this product, never had any problems with it, the last one I wore out lasted 3 years! and at this price I can live with that, replacement heads are inexpensive...............</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for years and my dentist tells me my teeth are always clean.  Changing batteries can be difficult but I found it&#x27;s easy with pliers.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Spinbrush as a stocking stuffer for my husband.  He has used it and likes the effectiveness of the cleaning.  It arrived in good condition and on time.</li>
    <li> This works great cleaning my teeth. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and one of the problems is the water buildups in the battery compartment causing mold and batteries to leak. Water also builds up where it connects to the brush head and there was mold. The battery compartment is easy to open all you do is open it like you&#x27;re breaking a branch. Good brush for the price but it has a few issues. Especially when it comes to water and the battery compartment. I just wet the brush head and water still manages to leak into the rest of the toothbrush handle.</li>
    <li> Impossible to install the batteries of the Crest (Arm &amp; Hammer) Spinbrush battery powered toothbrush. It is pure JUNK. It is also unsafe according to the US FDA.</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people will be purchasing this because of the low price point, but there are a few things you should know before you buy. This toothbrush tends to have problems with water leaking into the little battery cap, which is located at the very bottom end of the toothbrush. While it will still turn on and function properly, it will degrade the performance of the two AA batteries inside. The water leaking in also affects the overall life of the toothbrush. The main reason for this is because the contact points for the batteries become covered in a nasty rust sludge of sorts and eventually break the contact points all together. As others have said, changing the batteries is a hassle. I believe it is because of a small rubber ring on the outer part of the battery cap. This part is supposed to easily slide inside the main shaft of the toothbrush, but more times than not, it ends up blocking the cap from locking into place. Ironically, I think this rubber ring is supposed to keep water from getting to the batteries. I have had to purchase my third,and last, Spinbrush because of the water leaking problem. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it does do a good job of cleaning your teeth when the water isn&#x27;t leaking in.</li>
    <li> I bought as gifts, I have one and if I like it, I assume other people would like it also.</li>
    <li> Very timely delivery and great product.</li>
    <li> My Oral B power toothbrush needed replacing and as the heads often cost more to replace than a whole new toothbrush (if on sale) I decided to give this Spinbrush a try instead. It WAS on sale but it&#x27;s no bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy, uncomfortable feel to it, when using this brush. It has a thick handle to accommodate the 2 batteries required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using brand new batteries, it is IMO, too powerful. Feels like it&#x27;s vibrating inside your mouth. I&#x27;m all for going for super clean teeth but this is just uncomfortable and not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment needs a Sumo wrestler to pry it open!!!&lt;br /&gt; My husband is very strong and even he struggled to open this compartment, when the batteries needed replacing. And they needed replacing very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: none that I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back and staying with Oral B power brushes from now on. You DO get what you pay for and this one is a very bad design and not worth buying, even on sale.</li>
    <li> I considered an electric toothbrush but quickly realized I&#x27;d be paying for bells and whistles I had no use for. And rather than waste precious space in my bathroom with a charger, I decided a battery-powered toothbrush (I use Eneloop rechargeables) made more sense. This is a terrific deal. Before buying this, the dentist would always say that I need to brush better. After getting this, I&#x27;ve not heard that since. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t get one of these sooner.</li>
    <li> Liked the brush at first, but when batteries went down the changing was impossible for me. It is hard to get the bottom off, then replacing them became a challenge--finally managed, but the second time  could not get it to fit back on. OK I thought, I&#x27;ll buy a new one---got same results.  Wasted money time and effort.</li>
    <li> I liked it for the first two weeks.  Then one morning it stopped so I assumed it needed a new battery.  When I pulled out my batteries, a goop followed it out.  It was in the begining stages of deterioration.  I&#x27;m assuming some water leaked into the battery area. Not cool.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to but it&#x27;s very noisy. My child doesn&#x27;t seem to mind but also has to use her previous tooth brush as a timer.</li>
    <li> I too have had problems when replacing the batteries and then trying to get the cap back on. I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Spinbrush for the last 3 years and have 2 of them, one for every day and one for travel. Through trial and error and replacing 2 of them, I found the simplest solution, works every time! Wet the little black rubber band (only the band) and slip it back on.  Then replace the cap.  So easy and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews on this product, I was concerned. But so far I really like everything about it, but it is still the 1st week of use. I will review later if there are any troubles, but it seems well made &amp; in fine working condition.</li>
    <li> Works great, lasts a long time and cleans my teeth thoroughly, preventing tartar build up and tooth decay. I received one of these for Christmas many years ago. Did not expect to like it. My dentist is impressed with how well my teeth and mouth are maintained by continual use of this product. He remarks on it each time I get a check up, which is not too often, since I have no insurance and the cost of dentistry is extremely high.</li>
    <li> use my brush daily and easy to replace when needed</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what item the negative reviewers are using. I&#x27;ve used the same brush for several years. I change the head and batteries every 2 months (it&#x27;s easy to remember odd or even month for changing)and could probably go longer with the battery. Removing the end to get to the batteries is really quite simple. Look at the end of the toothbrush and there is little diagram as to how to get the end off. Putting the cap back on is just as easy. In the years that I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush I&#x27;d have GREAT dental checkups. Virtually no tartar or plaque. I actually GENTLY run the brush over my gums and that seems to be keeping them healthy as well (at least according to my dentist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this to the recharable battery because overtime recharable batteries don&#x27;t fully recharge. So I think using the standard battery version is better as you don&#x27;t have to replace the entire toothbrush. Definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does the trick and does clean better than a typical toothbrush, but it&#x27;s definitely not one of the top electric toothbrushes, more like a bit better than the typical toothbrush as an electric.</li>
