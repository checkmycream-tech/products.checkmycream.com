### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent quality.</li>
      <li>Very nice product!  </li>
      <li>Aloe is great on the skin</li>
      <li>Great for burns, sunburns.</li>
      <li>This was great.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>Good all around skin moisturizer too.</li>
      <li>Good texture and consistency.</li>
      <li>The size is easy to use!  </li>
      <li>It is great, but it does have a funny smell.</li>
      <li>Better than anything for a rash.</li>
      <li>Great Gel purchased this brand, because had  most % of real Aloe Vera.</li>
      <li>There is no residual feel however, which makes for an easy application.</li>
      <li>Have searched for a Jell form of Aloe Vera for skin that was free of additives.</li>
      <li>So excited to get this aloe jelly.</li>
      <li>nice, all natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Super soothing for my scalp/hair treatment.</li>
      <li>It is a nice product but not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>really smooth and soothing on my dry skin, quickly &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; to nothing, leaving an invisible layer of protection on the skin, not like an oily cream that lingers.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for Aloe Vera Gel for lotion making and found that most brands in the market, for whatever reason, have many added ingredients other than the basic ingredients - Aloe Vera Juice, Carrageenan and Citric Acid.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m all about no chemicals and pure products and this fits the bill.  </li>
      <li>This is made from a fine extract of aloe vera leaf juice and is definitely a gel.</li>
      <li>My husband also started using a straight razor, and uses this for an aftershave lotion.</li>
      <li>Very soothing to the skin without being greasy.</li>
      <li>The name should have told me this much.</li>
      <li>He says it helps with his skin a lot, and the nicks he gets heal really fast.</li>
      <li>Really??  </li>
      <li>Absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>Strange smell to it, other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this brand because there are no harmful ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>No odor, and not very messy.</li>
      <li>I use this for minor cuts and burns, it works really well.</li>
      <li>The bottle that we received came with a pump dispenser, handy when walking past the bottle, applying just a little here and there.</li>

<li> Love the product for all those cold rashes you get on your face and hands when you are outdoors.  </li>
<li> only complaint is - the price on Amazon is 20% more expensive than the price that I could find in local stores.</li>
<li> Based on my research so far, this Pharm-Aloe brand has the least number of added ingredients, plus it is organic and has Vitamin E in it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I use it on my skin after I&#x27;ve spent any time outdoors - winter or summer.</li>
<li> I also stopped  applying this product to my face because it made my face  feel tight and dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my leg where I have psoriasis, and it&#x27;s already cleared up within a few days..</li>
<li> My husband loves it-he is bald and uses it everyday on his head</li>
<li> I was not happy to find carrageenan in this.</li>
<li> So sad.</li>
<li> This has come closest and no irritation using it or any scents (My skin reacts bad to all scents)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nice, all natural ingredients.  really smooth and soothing on my dry skin, quickly &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; to nothing, leaving an invisible layer of protection on the skin, not like an oily cream that lingers.  seems like nothing is there, then get some water on your skin and it&#x27;s all gelly again.</li>
    <li> I noticed that  10 minutes after applying this product it starts to flake and peel. I also stopped  applying this product to my face because it made my face  feel tight and dry.</li>
    <li> I use this for minor cuts and burns, it works really well. My husband also started using a straight razor, and uses this for an aftershave lotion. He says it helps with his skin a lot, and the nicks he gets heal really fast.</li>
    <li> Carrageenan??  Really??  Come on, Pharm-Aloe...it&#x27;s 2015!!!!</li>
    <li> Strange smell to it, other than that it&#x27;s good. Absorbs fast.</li>
    <li> This is made from a fine extract of aloe vera leaf juice and is definitely a gel. If you have ever had Bull Frog Gel (the vanishing liquid sunscreen), this gelly is about the same consistency and vanishes on the skin, but remains intact, as evidenced when introducing water to the skin. There is no residual feel however, which makes for an easy application. The bottle that we received came with a pump dispenser, handy when walking past the bottle, applying just a little here and there. No fragrance which is a bonus. I would recommend this product because it is a gel that is no longer noticeable after applying.</li>
    <li> Great for burns, sunburns. Very soothing to the skin without being greasy. No odor, and not very messy. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about no chemicals and pure products and this fits the bill.  Aloe is great on the skin [if it&#x27;s not been altered or diluted etc.]  Definitely see a smoother healthier complexion and will continue to pruchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice product!  Good texture and consistency. I use it on my skin after I&#x27;ve spent any time outdoors - winter or summer.</li>
    <li> So excited to get this aloe jelly. Used it on my hair, and for sunburn. I was telling someone about it when I realized it had carageenan. So sad. Cant use it now.</li>
    <li> Better than anything for a rash.</li>
    <li> I use it for making hand soap</li>
    <li> I was not happy to find carrageenan in this. Fruit of the earth is what I always buy, and will go back to. I have tossed this in the trash. The name should have told me this much.</li>
    <li> This was great.  Love the product for all those cold rashes you get on your face and hands when you are outdoors.  The pump dispenses just enough.  The size is easy to use!  Winner packaging, winner produce</li>
    <li> Have searched for a Jell form of Aloe Vera for skin that was free of additives. This has come closest and no irritation using it or any scents (My skin reacts bad to all scents)</li>
    <li> It is great, but it does have a funny smell.</li>
    <li> Great Gel purchased this brand, because had  most % of real Aloe Vera. Using it on recent neck surgery scar. Good all around skin moisturizer too.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my leg where I have psoriasis, and it&#x27;s already cleared up within a few days.. Nothing else would work.. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it-he is bald and uses it everyday on his head</li>
    <li> It is a nice product but not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
