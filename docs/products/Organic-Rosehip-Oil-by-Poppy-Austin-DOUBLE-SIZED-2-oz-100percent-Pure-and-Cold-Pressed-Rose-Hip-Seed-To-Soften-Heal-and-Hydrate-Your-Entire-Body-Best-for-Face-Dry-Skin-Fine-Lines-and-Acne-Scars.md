<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil is another good one to use in conjunction with the vitamin c serum and rose water toner. Poppy Austin brand is a high-quality product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Since I just received this product, it is too soon to tell its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Love this Rosehip oil - so good for your skin</li>
    <li> Highly reccommend this company.  All of the items that I ordered have been of superior quality.  I particularly appreciate the simple label, it looks clean and professional.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks straight and replaced my toner and night moisturizer with the Poppy Austin Rose Water and this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not fragrant at all, but then again it&#x27;s pure rose hip oil. I personally do not mind the smell. If you are looking for a moisturizer that smells &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;, then this might not be the right product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination normal/dry skin and I use it mostly at night before going to bed, after taking off my make up, cleansing my face, and applying the Poppy Austin Rose Water. I use about 6 drops to cover my whole face and neck. When I wake up (I get about 5-6 hours of sleep every night), my face feels so soft and looks vibrant. My face is not oily at all, and the dry spots are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I simply rinse my face with water, apply the Rose water again, and put on my day moisturizer with SPF. My face feels more balanced now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are still reluctant about getting this, at least try their Rose Water! It&#x27;s also amazing and it&#x27;s the best rose water I&#x27;ve used so far (I&#x27;ve tried 3 different brands).</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my skin very smooth. The smell isn&#x27;t the best smell, but other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Rose Hips is a secrete formula for the face, supporting fine lines an collagen on my delicate aging facial skin. A must to look up and read about, as less exspensive as some othe products. Suggested it can support the fine line repair, I just discovered.  Using Vit C oil first with Clarisonic brush, add Rose Hips oil, top with Fig oil and good night&gt; good morning to lovely skin, not dry or cracking! Taking 2-4 weeks to see changes in scars / cracks. I was thrilled the next morning.</li>
    <li> Since I loved the Poppy Austin Argan Oil so much, I also wanted to try out the Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;The Rosehip oil has a light smell to it, which disappears fast. It has a nice texture, that makes my skin feel soft and gives me those rosy cheeks. I always had problems with breakouts, but since I&#x27;ve been using the Poppy Austin products my skin is as beautiful as can be.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the Rosehip Oil just as much as the Argan Oil and will just switch it up from time to time. I&#x27;m glad I discovered these great and natural products.</li>
    <li> Smells like a cooking oil.. i trusted the good reviews but very disappointed! !</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance, womanly and soft&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs easily without any oiliness.</li>
    <li> Product just as described.  I have been using it after cleansing and using the Rose Water Toner.  It only takes a few drops and absorbs well leaving no residue and makes my oily skin feel soft and smooth.  I have no breakouts with this oil and use it as a moisturizer under makeup or without makeup.</li>
    <li> This was very nice and I liked the smell.  I really liked the way it absorbed into my skin.  I used this on my face as well as on the back of my hands to brighten my skin.</li>
    <li> Love it, I use the rose water and rose hip oil at night.  My skin is so soft and smells wonderful.  I&#x27;ve only used for a week and I notice the acne clearing up and some little bumps I&#x27;ve had forever on my forehead are gone.  Quality product for sure.</li>
    <li> REALLY GREAT! I purchased for my sister and she loved it. Not smelly like some Rosehip oils and not greasy either. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks before writing this review. I&#x27;ve tried so many oils for moisturizers and none of them worked, I read great reviews for this brand and for the price it was definitely worth trying. I am glad I did because it is working out really well for me. I am not sure if it is supposed to help with breakout but so far I haven&#x27;t had anything major, my skin is soft and glowing. I am very happy, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love, love this stuff.  I have had acne prone skin for 15 years and endured countless visits to the derm. I think i was overcomplicating my beauty routine. So,  I cleaned up my diet (went paleo), started the oil cleanse method with organic pumpkin seed oil a few nights a week, and alternate with Soapwalla&#x27;s activated charcoal bar. I apply this oil every evening, and a slightly less amount in the morning, just enough to moisturize. My skin is 99% clear and has transformed.  I no longer have to cake on makeup and any blemish i do get during the day (probably also from makeup, is cleared up by morning).</li>
    <li> Really effective and pure.  Several people have told me my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> To me using this product is like a moment of peace in my busy life. This product glides on so beautifully, it smells so good and my face, neck and decollete feel and look restored. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. My skin is visibly more vibrant and glowing. I feel like it is honestly regenerating my skin. Which, at 42, is exactly what I want. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product. It is clearly made with the finest of ingredients and in such a beautiful bottle.  I am so impressed with this product line, I absolutely want to try more of Poppy Austin&#x27;s products. I spend time researching products before I buy them, especially ones for my face and skin. I picked this line because it something about it stood out and felt quality. I am so glad I did. I was right. This company is the real deal and this product is proof.</li>
    <li> I bought the Poppy Austin Eye Cream, Rose Hips Oil and Rose Water Toner. Wow!! Finally products that deliver what they promise.  The Rose Water Toner and Rose Hips Oil have diminished my acne scars dramatically.  I have spent thousands of dollars over the years on professional treatments that have not worked as well.  I am over 70 years old and wish I had access to these products before now.</li>
    <li> Rosehips are known for their C content and many other attributes for a glowing complexion, but they are difficult to find in a form like this rich oil that is easily utilized and absorbed by the skin.  I use this at night for its rejuvenative properties and argan oil in the morning.  This way the skin does not seem to tire as it does using only one product at a time.  Even though I am still on my first bottle (love the generous 2 oz size) I feel this has all ready helped my skin’s texture.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> Pure rosa rubingosa, not rosa cantina.</li>
    <li> I have a very oily skin. Summer time not do any justice with oily skin type. I purchased the whole set- their vitamin C serum, rose water , and the rosehip oil for me and MY husband. I can not thank enough how amazing these products work. Me and MY husband gets tons of complaints how our skin looks younger, healthy and glowing. I would honestly recommend to use them all together. Works like a magic . My skin feels tight , soft and young .👏👏</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I spritz my face with the rose water tonic, apply the vitamin c, and then the rosehip oil. My face is glowing!</li>
    <li> I have been using rosehip oil for years and have tried many brands finally finding one that I thought was the best - but I was wrong. I actually hesitated buying this product because of the price. I didn&#x27;t think that it could be very good at this low a price point - again, wrong. The Poppy Austin Rosehip Oil is everything that my previous brand was and more. It hydrates, refines, softens lines and wrinkles and so much more and because of the texture and the purity of the oil, it absorbs into the skin quickly and can be used day and night. I also apply it under my eyes and have noticed an improvement in the overall texture and hydration. I still feel a little twinge of disbelief when I see that big bottle knowing what I paid for it but the results are real and I am a total Poppy Austin convert. This time I got it right.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best Oil I&#x27;ve ever used on my face, I started by using poppy Austin&#x27;s rosewater toner, I loved it so much I&#x27;ve decided to give this rosehip oil a try, because the skin is more dry in the winter time and no matter how much cream I use on my face, it&#x27;s still kind of dry, after using this rose hip oil on my face, just in two days I realized how soft my skin has become and the oil itself is not greasy at all, goes on  skin and aborts in seconds.  Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a great moisturizer for their skin.&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Yu&lt;br /&gt;New York</li>
    <li> I use the Rosehip Oil in the morning after washing my face and using the Rose Water.  It is another wonderful product from Poppy Austin.  Even though it feels oily when it comes out of the dropper, you only need a few drops and it penetrates into my face in a minute or two.  Thank goodness they don&#x27;t have dozens of products that they try to seduce me into buying but rather a few simply wonderful and pure organic ones that make life so much easier.  I am 69 years old and have always taken excellent care of my skin, using many of the (expensive) products on the market, and always looking for the purest of them.  It&#x27;s never been this easy or the products as pure as Poppy Austin, PLUS at the most sensible prices I have ever paid. I only wish they would now come out with a wonderful pure sunscreen for daily use.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! makes skin feel so soft</li>
    <li> IT STINKS!! UGH. I will use it because I have no regret buying anything from Poppy Austin. I only hate that it isn&#x27;t as pleasantly aromatic as the rose water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product for several days now and have been noticing that the old pimple scars on my cheeks are not as prominent.  It gives me hope that with more use, my old pimple scars will fade even more.  I appreciate the organic and purity of this particular Rosehip oil.  It smells organic and is very bearable.  This oil melts into my skin and leaves my skin with a healthy glow within and does not appear greasy at all.  The price is very well priced.  Poppy Austin company seems legit as well.  I hope the positive turn out continues even with prolonged use..I guess I&#x27;ll have to see...  Well, for now.. it&#x27;s excellent and I love it!  Thanks Poppy Austin!</li>
    <li> I have been using Poppy Austin products since the start of this year.  I found them all by accident while I was looking for a good Argan oil that wasn&#x27;t outrageously priced.  Upon finding their website, I also noticed that they sold other great products and I for sure wanted to give them a try.  However the problem with this oil just like Argan oil is that it hard to find in its pure form.  Many companies tend to add many extra ingredients in these products that only tamper with the effectiveness of the oil.  Poppy Austin sells this oil in a pure organic form.  There is nothing added or taken away so what you buy is what you get.  Moreover, this comes in a 2oz bottle for an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil has antioxidant properties which are amazing for the skin.  It helps to diminish the looks of fines lines and wrinkles. For those who suffer with hyper-pigmentation it works great as it helps to correct dark spots, uneven skin tone and dryness.  It helps to greatly reduce acne scars, stretch marks, eczema and psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this arrived to my house, I noticed it came in a dark opaque bottle with a droplet.  Remember this is an antioxidant so it is sensitive to light and air.  So the dark bottle design keeps it for degrading.  The oil comes out like a dark burnt orange color which is kinda cool as I have never seen that type of color in a serum before.  The oil is not too runny but not thick either.  I would say its in between which is easy to spread on your face and don&#x27;t glide off your hands when putting some in your palm for application.  You need about 3-4 drops to use on your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, I have been using this oil for about 3 weeks now.  I normally NEVER write a review unless I use a product for a minimum of two weeks because I believe in long term results and not instant results.  In many cases instant results fade over time.  However with longer term results you will see a differences in your skin texture and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied this was at night.  I decided in order to give this a fair chance I stopped using my Poppy Austin Argan oil and Maracuja oil (not by Tarte) and only used my Rosehip oil.  When I woke up the next morning I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything different just nice moisturized skin.  However I was shocked to see my skin results.  My face looked brighter, hydrated and just all around beautiful.  My skin looked plumped and moisturized.  Yet like I said earlier,  I believe in long term results versus instant.  So three weeks later I have to say the results are still there.  This oil is truly amazing.  I use this oil twice a day.  In the morning and in the night and my skin just looks and feels great.  There is no oily feeling left behind or nasty residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, for the fact that I was dying to try Rosehip oil and wasn&#x27;t settling for just anything really made this product worth the weight.  I would really recommend this to someone who is interested in trying oils for their skincare routine and for those looking to tackle skincare issues.</li>
    <li> I had a pretty bad allergic reaction to a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair oil I purchased at a big box store, that was localized to my face. I went to the dermatology clinic and was diagnosed with rosacea. Whether or not I have rosacea is yet to be determined, but I did not want to take the oral medication for treatment, and the medicated gel I was prescribed burned my face pretty harshly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking for natural alternatives to treat my face, I was feeling a bit apprehensive about using &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; oils after what happened with the hair oil incident. A friend of mine told me about using rosehip oil, specifically the Poppy Austin brand. Again, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would help my situation but I took the gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a month now almost every day. I cannot even describe how great this oil is! Not only did my face clear up from the breakout I had, but my skin tone evened out and my skin is the softest it has ever been! Apart from this, as I have aged, I have developed chronic dry spots in some areas of my face that no fair amount of lotion would soothe. I also had tiny mystery bumps on my forehead that only went away when I went to the beach. Now the dry spots and tiny bumps are gone! I had more issues remedied from this rosehip oil than I would have ever imagined!!! I hardly wear makeup now and feel confident about my bare face! Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The best rosehip oil I have used. You only need a small amount so the large bottle lasts for ages! Price is reasonable and shipping very quick!</li>
    <li> This product is a big ol 5.</li>
    <li> To begin with, this oil is BS!! Terribly stinky!! I&#x27;ve been using oils on my face. e.g. John Master&#x27;s argan oil, pomegranate oil, and Weleda&#x27;s rose oil in capsules. Those are really helpful, glow my skin, and make me relax.&lt;br /&gt;But this rosehip oil is NOT!! You&#x27;ll be put off by the stinky smell and feel as if your face is a pan because the oil is just like a cooking oil!!! Next morning, I didn&#x27;t feel moisture and brightness on my face, rather my face was yellowish.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a natural rosehip scent, soothing aroma, and orange color that another reviewers said.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sooth me, but it irritates me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even use this on my hair. I dumped this in a trash can!!&lt;br /&gt;Probably, these reviews are knockoff...</li>
    <li> Very nice hydrating oil. It&#x27;s pretty thick, but a little goes a long way. A lot of people complained about the smell in their reviews. It smells like buttered popcorn to me, which I don&#x27;t find unpleasant, but not a fragrance I&#x27;d normally rub all over myself. Who wants to run around smelling like a movie theater all day? Luckily the smell fades within minutes of applying, so it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed a big improvement in my skin texture or reduction in stretch marks, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks. But I definitely don&#x27;t need a second moisturizer after applying the rose hip oil, so as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, but it&#x27;s super potent and pure.  I have to use very little or I break out, but it was exactly what I wanted and I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Use it for my grandchildren</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! The first day, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference but the third day, I could see that my skin had  been very improved by this magnificent oil. Once you rub it on you, you can feel a soothing aroma taking over you putting you in a calm state of mind. The Best thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like oil at all.I would definitely recommend this to a family member or friend.      This Oil arrived very quickly and it also was delivered with no harm done to it. The oil was very soothing to me when I tried it on my skin. My skin has never felt so smooth before trying this amazing product from Poppy Austin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying all the Poppy Austin products. I am a licensed esthetician always looking for great new products. So far, I love these products. My routine with this product is to cleanse, then apply the Poppy Austin Rose water (Love it) followed with Rose hip oil. While your skin is still damp from the Rose Water ( which by the way just that application and my skin was hydrated and glowing. I put the rose water in a dropper bottle because I don&#x27;t want to waste it on a cotton pad, so I put a drop in my palm and press it between both palms and press on my skin) the pressing action is how I apply my oils. Press oil into your damp skin. You can still apply moisturizer on top of the oil.  Poppy Austin oils are light, and your skin feels supple and looks glowing with out being greasy.  And I love the pricing! High quality product for low price.</li>
    <li> This is the best for overall moisture and healing.  I have psoriasis.  sometimes I get a flare up on my face, I treat it with this oil and it heals up completely.  My hands and cuticles are much better when I use this oil twice a day.  Please try this one you will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> This oil gives my skin the necessary moisture it needs living here in the desert. It&#x27;s light, and odorless...love it!</li>
    <li> I like it .its soft on the skin .observed fast .I realy recommend this product .and the main reason because it is organic and realy work</li>
    <li> The oil works great as a moisturizer, but my husband made me promise to NEVER buy it again. He smells it from feet away (I only use a few drops for my whole face and neck), and he just flat out told me it stinks! And it does.</li>
    <li> This was my first bottle of rosehip oil and i plan on getting more. So far I am pleased with the results. My skin has some freckles and dark spots from childhood sun damage that are beginning to lighten. I have been using vitamin C for a while with some improvement, but the combination of the rosehip oil and vitamin C seems to have made a more noticeable difference. It isn&#x27;t an overnight cure but i do see improvement. While looking at other reviews on this brand and other brands many people mention that rosehip oil smells bad. This is perhaps because they expect it to smell like roses. To that i say a little research goes a long way. ;) It is made from the seeds, not the blossom. Rosehip oil has more of a nutty smell. The oil should also be orange or amber in color. The darker - the better. When first applied it does tint the skin temporarily until absorbed. Some people have mentioned breaking out after using rosehip oil. This may be due to the large number of antioxidants pulling toxins to the surface. Just a guess- but I&#x27;m not a doctor. My skin is extremely dry so this wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. I also reapply the rosehip oil throughout the day. I am pleased with this brand but i may try a few other brands and keep this one in mind as a go-to. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Good product I will buy this product again I am using a more simple combination of oils  products because I have roscea and over the counter products have burnt my skin.</li>
    <li> Fall is in the air and my skin has already begun to dry up as it usually does so I was pretty excited when poppy austin contacted me to try out their famous Rosehip Oil! Every year at the first sign of fall my skin starts getting dry and itchy and it usually lasts through the winter season. As far as I am concerned there is nothing worse than itchy dry flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rosehip oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When poppy austin contacted me I jumped at the chance to try a new product that just may bring an end to my problems. Maybe I&#x27;m getting a little ahead of myself here. Let&#x27;s start out at the beginning right before I received my Rosehip Oil......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fall had just begun and my skin had already started itching and flaking. Am I the only person in the world who has this problem?? It can be very frustrating and uncomfortable. The first signs will show around my lips and then within days it starts moving all over my face. It&#x27;s not very noticeable to my friends and family but my mom always notices and tells me to drink more water. The water does help but it still does not make the problem go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rosehip Oil arrived in the mail and I immediately put it in my bathroom to incorporate it into my morning routine. The next morning I snatched up my Rosehip oil and used the little dropper and filled it up.... dumping the whole dropper full into my hands. Then I applied it to my face...... note to self..... read directions first next time! Needless to say I had wayyyy to much on my hands! LOL If any of you plan on getting some please take note that you only need 2-3 drops. Well I sure wasn&#x27;t going to wipe the stuff off and waste it so I decided to just head on into the kitchen and go ahead and finish the dishes thinking that I may end up looking like a grease face for the day. A little while later I decided to go ahead and apply my makeup. When I walked into the bathroom and looked into the mirror I was really surprised to see that the oil had soaked right into myskin and it felt great. My makeup went on smoothly and my skin was not itchy.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with recurrent adult acne lately, and have been using tons of Rx face creams with lots of redness and peeling as a result.  I bought this product from Poppy Austin (in addition to the Rose Water toner), and have seen amazing results.  My skin is less red and it has been healing more and more each day!  I love it...</li>
    <li> Kind of has the consistency of cooking oil. I had to stop using because it started breaking me out.</li>
    <li> Only four stars because I don&#x27;t like the smell but other than that I think it is a great product.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to report on how it works after months of use but I can see a difference in my skin after just a few week.  I love Poppy Austin products and I love the fact that the ingredients are pure.  I sent them an email and received a really quick reply.  I think the people running this company are terrific and very personable.  I will keep buying their products.  And I love the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle and will definitely get the third one. I waited to review until now so that I can comment on the results of my diligent use of rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 3 months 3 times a week. After shower in the evenings so that it stays on my skin for around 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Before the results, here is my skin condition. I&#x27;m a young overweight female. I had put on weight very very quickly so I got many stretch marks in return. Now I&#x27;m losing weight, around 1 pounds a week. And I was soooo scared of sagging on top of stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 months results:&lt;br /&gt;- NONE sagging (either the strength training or this, or both)&lt;br /&gt;- Unbelievably visible results on my stretch marks on my abdomen (Can they disappear completely? If so, that&#x27;s the next step)&lt;br /&gt;- Good visible results on my breasts/armpits stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;- Bad results on inner upper arms&lt;br /&gt;- Very satisfactory healing on a scar tissue that I have from a surgery about a year ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any scientific information on skin types and so but for me this is how it worked. The bottom line is, this oil is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra notes:&lt;br /&gt;It DOES NOT smell rancid. It is a pure natural oil, what do people expect?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it has a certain color and the color is visible when you first put it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Both the smell and color fade away very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It does not get sticky.</li>
    <li> I am happy to have added the rosehip oil to my daily face care. After using the argan and vitamin c for over 3 months now, I can see the difference in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THESE PRODUCTS !</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Like it very much.  Makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing.  I had a really bad acne scar from one...yes just one pimple!! I had been nursing it for 3 wks already.  It was getting better, but was right on my cheek &amp; still VERY noticeable.  This oil in a weeks time has almost healed it completely.  You can barely even see it.  My face is so soft &amp; this oil just melts right into your skin.  The shipping on this was SUPER FAST and even ARRIVED ON SUNDAY!!! There&#x27;s other oils I want to try from this seller &amp; I will definately be back for more Rosehip oil.</li>
    <li> I found this looking for safe anti-aging products during pregnancy. I&#x27;ve been using this product at night under my moisturizer for two weeks and I do see and feel a difference -- softer, suppler skin and a gradually evening skin tone. I&#x27;ve read comments about the scent of Rosehip Oil being unpleasant, but I don&#x27;t find that to be true. But be aware that it has a slightly nutty odor versus floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, despite having very sensitive skin most especially in pregnancy, I have no issues with irritation or break outs using this. I&#x27;m always so cautious to add anything new to the mix in fear of a bad reaction, but the risk paid off in this instance.</li>
    <li> Love the Poppy Austin Rosehip Oil. Another outstanding product from Poppy Austin. I also use their Rose Water, Barbarry Fig Oil, Argon Oil, Vitamin C with Hyluranic Acid, Eye Cream with Vitamin C and Hyluranic Acid and Jojoba Oil and have been extremely pleased with all their products. I have been very pleased with all their products I have used and the results obtained.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil works great from my skin.  I know it gives some people breakouts, but it&#x27;s made my skin much clearer, with fewer wrinkles and a bright glow.  I put a few drops on all over my face every night.  The Poppy Austin oil is high quality, just like their other products (that I&#x27;ve tried), and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> We use Poppy Austin Rose Water as a toner after cleaning and then apply Rosehip Oil at night.. It is richer than the Vitamin C but still absorbs well.  Pores are diminishing and spots are as well!  Very excited to see the changes in my skin as the months go on.  I&#x27;ve used it for only 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> really good！I will buy it again，it makes my skin smooth ，so nice ！Recommend！</li>
