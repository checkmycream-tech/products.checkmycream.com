### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t use an electric toothbrush, this would be an excellent one to to start with.ld be an excellent one to to start with.</li>
      <li>If Grandma buys you one, say thank you, be happy, and hope that they list replacement brushes soon.</li>
      <li>holds a charge great.  </li>
      <li>As I write this, amazon is charging about $125 for this and for that you can get a very nice Oral-B or Sonicare.</li>
      <li>I even own the latest and greatest  DiamondCare toothbrush now.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that you can find good prices on either Oral-B or Sonicare in the places you&#x27;d expect to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Surprisingly the seemingly weaker Panasonic brush seems to disassemble the toothpaste blob almost immediately whereas the Philips did not.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if it included some spare brushes.</li>
      <li>In all likelihood it is probably just as effective as the Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I own a Philips Flexcare so that will be my point of reference for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Very nice size and light.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While I think this is a very good toothbrush, the drawbacks need to be fixed before I would consider getting another one.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While I think this is a very good toothbrush, the drawbacks need to be fixed before I would consider getting another one.  </li>
      <li>I love EW</li>
      <li>Which one is better?</li>
      <li>Would love to hear if anyone has found replacement heads anywhere in August 2015.</li>
      <li>Now I have used this toothbrush for more than two weeks.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t forget to floss!  :)</li>
      <li>DE92 more than oral b7000</li>
      <li>/&gt;Travel case: Most will come with some sort of case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love electric toothbrushes, and I prefer the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; approach that Sonicare always used to the mechanical one that Oral-B used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for many years, and am very familiar with sonic vibration toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Brushing is very clean, one week can be used once each morning and evening</li>
      <li>This Panasonic Sonic Vibration toothbrush is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good</li>
      <li>Dock is more secure than Philipsʻ&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Using the \\&quot;white\\&quot; mode, they feel nice and fresh and thoroughly cleansed.  </li>
      <li>: It seems to clean your teeth with a bit more vigor.</li>
      <li>It seemed very mild compared to the Sonicare.</li>
      <li>It is easy to hold and</li>
      <li>The unit/handle itself is very very lightweight, uses cheap-feeling plastic, so the grip isn&#x27;t great, and the battery isn&#x27;t very long-lasting either.</li>
      <li>First, and most important, I love the way this brush cleans my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I see a huge difference between them in terms of results.</li>
      <li>I thought it was the best on the market and upgraded my model every few years.</li>
      <li>Feel free to ask questions.</li>
      <li>Even the charger is quite light if you do have to take it along.  </li>
      <li>I originally had a Broxodent electric toothbrush which is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, with the good long battery life, gentle feel, and effective cleaning, I am happy to have the Panasonic, especially for travel.</li>
      <li>, I feel that my teeth are just as clean - although the vibration appears to be weaker.  </li>
      <li>This thing leaves my teeth feeling amazingly clean.</li>
      <li>This isnʻt really a true cons and perhaps a perceived one.</li>
      <li>This indicates you are making the full ionic &amp;#34;loop&amp;#34; conducting ions through to your teeth, thereby removing plaque.&lt;br</li>
      <li>At current prices, this one costs more than twice my Sonicare, and while this one has more bells and whistles, I don&#x27;t believe the price difference is justified.</li>
      <li>As far as cleaning results go, my teeth feel clean and my mouth feels suitably tingly after using it.  </li>
      <li>The Sonicare seems to have a more robust brushing action, but this one seems to get my teeth just as clean, perhaps marginally cleaner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>little Panasonic is great for traveling.  </li>
      <li>It is guaranteed to leave you with a fresh feeling.</li>
      <li>included is the travel case - which holds both the toothbrush handle and 1 of any kind of the above replacement heads.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price</li>
      <li>The gum brush may be useful</li>
      <li>The Panasonic seems like a fine product, and if you want something small for ease of travel, this might be a good choice.</li>
      <li>A decent light weight travel toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I found that the Sonicare sometimes irritated my gums, and I preferred the sound of the Oral B to the high pitched buzz of the Sonicare.</li>
      <li>(Update:  replacement heads are available but not common yet.  </li>
      <li>We now own this toothbrush and several Sonicares (older and newer versions).</li>
      <li>more drawback is the storage of the various heads.  </li>
      <li>more drawback is the storage of the various heads.  </li>
      <li>If you are used to a Philips the first thing you will notice is that the vibration on the Panasonic feels substantially weaker than the Philips.</li>
      <li>Thatʻs suggesting to me that the Panasonic is just vibrating at a much higher frequency which might lead to the perception that the vibration is weaker.</li>
      <li>I know that most people put the brush back in the holder after each use</li>
      <li>The back of the &#x60;brush head has a tounge cleaner, although I prefer to use one of the Dr. Tung&#x27;s tounge cleaners more.</li>
      <li>like that there are various settings on this brush although I use \\&quot;white\\&quot; most often.  </li>
      <li>The battery lasts for a month or more before you need to recharge (based up on 2x daily brushing habits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Both reduce tartar and stain much, much more than standard</li>
      <li>Love the toothbrush, but YOU CANNOT FIND replacement heads ANYWHERE not even on panasonic.com where I actually purchased this toothbrush from.  </li>
      <li>In terms of how this translates to cleaning, I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference!  </li>
      <li>My teeth felt very clean afterwards, especially along the gum line.</li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t think it would clean between the teeth very well, since the bristles are very soft.</li>
      <li>At current prices, this one costs more than twice my Sonicare, and while this one has more bells and whistles, I don&#x27;t believe the price difference is justified.to \\&quot;Contact an authorized service center for repair.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>Small compact with a case is good fro traveling.</li>
      <li>The brushes move at a super high speed, and the ionic light goes to solid, once you put the toothbrush in your mouth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for over 20 years, from the original Interplak through the Braun rotary head models to the most recent Phillips Sonicare, of which I remain a big fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Panasonic heads have a tongue cleaner, which isn&#x27;t something I feel I need; the Panasonic comes with a carrying case, which is actually great if you travel a lot, but probably not worth such a large difference in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; setting is very gentle, more so than either of the other toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>I really like that it is smaller and lighter for travel, and easy to take apart and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Panasonic derives its long battery life / light weight compromise from the fact that the brushhead really doesn&#x27;t move, so the user has to do most of the actual brushing.  </li>
      <li>Much lighter and 2 inches shorter than the Philips.</li>
      <li>However, price and replacement head availability seems to be the real difference.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t use it as routinely as suggested because it just doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing much for me.  </li>
      <li>gave the toothbrush 4 rather than 5 stars because I have yet to figure out how much it costs to replace the brush heads.  </li>
      <li>and these two are very close in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I like the gentle massage that this toothbrush provides.</li>
      <li>The brush also has a tongue brush built into it, which is very convenient.</li>
      <li>The motor is quiet and smooth.</li>
      <li>Both have various settings on it--but honestly, I just use the regular setting each time.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
      <li>While I can tell the difference between soft and other modes, I honestly cannot tell the difference in the whitening mode versus any others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For me personally, the Sonicare looks a bit nicer and was recommended by my dentist, which is the reason that I originally decided on the Sonicare</li>
      <li>Both toothbrushes have similar options and leave your mouth with a clean feeling.</li>
      <li>The charger doesn&#x27;t fit the handle snugly, which seems strange since the handle is very compact and well-made.</li>
      <li>This brush gets your teeth almost as clean as the hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;This unit comes with only one brush, and a travel case that holds the brush handle and just one brush.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this new model.</li>
      <li>The handle is about two-thirds the length and half the weight of most electric toothbrushes on the market.  </li>
      <li>Only these toothbrushes can spare my teeth most of the harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noted the following differences/similarities between the Sonicare and the Panasonic Sonic toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
      <li>Now that is just not practical and probably not cheap, and this toothbrush costs too much to not be able to replace the battery without service</li>
      <li>Sonicare&#x27;s website claims &amp;#34;The batteries will last for many years of regular use.&amp;#34; Whichever one you choose, once the battery conks out, you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>Now that is just not practical and probably not cheap, and this toothbrush costs too much to not be able to replace the battery without service</li>
      <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I highly recommend this product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I originally had a Broxodent electric toothbrush which is no longer available.  The sonic noise this toothbrush makes is just like running your nails down a blackboard.  I do not like it at all and have gone back to manual brushing.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> This thing leaves my teeth feeling amazingly clean. The motor is quiet and smooth. The brushes move at a super high speed, and the ionic light goes to solid, once you put the toothbrush in your mouth. This indicates you are making the full ionic &amp;#34;loop&amp;#34; conducting ions through to your teeth, thereby removing plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a 1 regular brush head, 1 point head, and 1 gum care head. The brush is for regular daily brushing use, and the point head to get between your teeth. It works extremely well, though it doesn&#x27;t replace flossing by any means. The gum care head seems to work well to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included is the travel case - which holds both the toothbrush handle and 1 of any kind of the above replacement heads. It has ventilation holes in the case itself, to prevent moisture build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in the package is a brush storage &amp;#34;garage&amp;#34; which you can place on your counter, this holds 4 brush heads of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional thing I like about the Panasonics is that they have universal 100 - 240 V automatic universal voltage conversion in the chargers, whereas my old Oral B Professional Series 3000 was unusable on a recent trip to Europe since it was only designed for the US voltage (120 V). It seems unfortunately, that new models of Oral B also have this issue.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush.  Holds a charge for two weeks.  Small compact with a case is good fro traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my oral b7000. I have used oral b7000 for 2 months before I buy this toothbrush. Now I have used this toothbrush for more than two weeks. I love EW DE92 more than oral b7000, although the oral b7000 looks cooler, but the NI-MH battery is quite unacceptable.</li>
    <li> I have now been partial to electric toothbrushes since I first got hooked with a Sonicare several years back.  This Panasonic Sonic Vibration toothbrush is pretty good.  It has a 30 second timer that alerts you to move to the next quadrant.  It also has other brushing options (e.g., white, soft, massage), which I rarely use.  This is similar to my Sonicare Flexcare Plus, but the Panasonic is a little cheaper.  However, the Panasonic feels as if it brushes as well as my Sonicare - i.e., I feel that my teeth are just as clean - although the vibration appears to be weaker.  In the box also comes a travel case and a charger.  The back of the &#x60;brush head has a tounge cleaner, although I prefer to use one of the Dr. Tung&#x27;s tounge cleaners more.</li>
    <li> Panasonic exceeds expectations not only with their hi-tech TVs and other peripherals, but with their dental products as well. I like the gentle massage that this toothbrush provides. I personally prefer the Philips brand of toothbrushes, but for a stripped down, more affordable version, this Panasonic product doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It is guaranteed to leave you with a fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> Please Note: This review is for model EW-DL82-W and not the one shown on this page. The model I tested is less expensive, and does not have the ionic technology. It also has only 2 speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a Braun/Oral B toothbrush for the past 15 years or more. I thought it was the best on the market and upgraded my model every few years. The Braun uses a rotating brush whereas the Panasonic uses sonic vibrations. Which one is better? Sorry, my trusty Braun, but the Panasonic wins hands down. I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this new model. It is smaller than the Braun by about half an inch. It has two speeds, although one is sufficient. It also features a 15 second reminder, like the Braun, to signal you to brush another area of your teeth. The toothbrush has a special set of bristles that are supposed to whiten and polish your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Brushing with this sonic brush is quite a bit different than any other method. The quiet hum is all you hear, and you feel very little happening to your teeth. In fact, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything to my teeth. Just the opposite. My teeth felt very clean afterwards, especially along the gum line. I also didn&#x27;t think it would clean between the teeth very well, since the bristles are very soft. Wrong again. This brush gets your teeth almost as clean as the hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;This unit comes with only one brush, and a travel case that holds the brush handle and just one brush. So, this is a personal brush, and not meant to be shared with the family, unless you have a special holder for other brushes. The brush also has a tongue brush built into it, which is very convenient. The unit is made in Japan, while the charger is made in China. The charger doesn&#x27;t fit the handle snugly, which seems strange since the handle is very compact and well-made. It is easy to hold and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I think the unit is a bit expensive. It would be nice if it included some spare brushes. If you don&#x27;t use an electric toothbrush, this would be an excellent one to to start with.ld be an excellent one to to start with.</li>
    <li> Amazon sent me a different brush to review than the one pictured and described here. (The Vine Program automatically places the review on this page) My brush only has 1 button on it. Some of the other reviews I&#x27;ve seen mention settings and additional accessories that were not on the model I tested. I received the Panasonic Sonic Vibration Toothbrush Model #EW-DL82, which seems to be their basic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is for Model #EW-DL82 that I tested for the Vine Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EW-DL82 model has two brushing modes, \\&quot;white\\&quot; and \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; which both have a brush timer. The unit comes with one brush head, a charger, and a plastic travel case. It operates up to 90 minutes after a complete charge, has automatic universal voltage, and a two-year limited warranty. It does not have the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; cleaning feature mentioned in other reviews. I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for many years, and am very familiar with sonic vibration toothbrushes. In comparison to my current Sonicare, the Panasonic is smaller in size, and seems less powerful. Both hold their charge for a long time, eliminating the need to carry the charger if traveling for less than a week. My teeth feel cleaner after using the Sonicare as compared to the Panasonic. I think this is because the brush seems to be moving less vigorously on the Panasonic.  I didn&#x27;t care for the feeling I got during the brushing process with the Panasonic. It seemed very mild compared to the Sonicare. As others mention, I see no need for the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; mode because it seems like a very low setting. The Panasonic seems like a fine product, and if you want something small for ease of travel, this might be a good choice. For daily home use, I prefer the Sonicare to this particular model.</li>
    <li> holds a charge great.  Very nice size and light.  I feel like it could vibrate a little faster but that is probably just me being picky? Well worth the price</li>
    <li> I have used both Sonicare and Oral B electric toothbrushes over the years. I generally have preferred the slow, rolling motion of the Oral B over the rapid motion of the Sonicare. I found that the Sonicare sometimes irritated my gums, and I preferred the sound of the Oral B to the high pitched buzz of the Sonicare. The Panasonic is similar to the Sonicare; however, this Panasonic toothbrush did a really great job cleaning difficult areas without any irritation - in fact, its action on the \\&quot;white\\&quot; setting is very gentle, more so than either of the other toothbrushes. I really like that it is smaller and lighter for travel, and easy to take apart and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for reservations about this product: first, it only comes with one brush head, which means needing to buy others. Second, I find the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; feature to be so slow that it feels a bit unpleasant, and may not be very effective. Also, I am curious to find out over time: (1) whether the Panasonic reduces stains in two weeks, as promised (I&#x27;ll give it a bit longer) and (2) whether it lasts longer than a year or two, unlike some other electric toothbrushes I have known, one of which  stopped working completely after a year and a half (a Sonicare) or slowed way down within a year (an Oral B).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, with the good long battery life, gentle feel, and effective cleaning, I am happy to have the Panasonic, especially for travel.</li>
    <li> I have the Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush as well and these two are very close in my opinion. Both toothbrushes have similar options and leave your mouth with a clean feeling. I don&#x27;t think you could go wrong using either of these two toothbrushes so it comes down to cost, appearance or a recommendation from your dentist. For me personally, the Sonicare looks a bit nicer and was recommended by my dentist, which is the reason that I originally decided on the Sonicare but I would have no problem recommending this toothbrush to others as well.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of sonic type toothbrushes out there, ranging from cheap(er) battery operated ones to the high end, expensive brushes. The two leading competitors in this field are the Panasonic Sonic Vibration and the Phillips Sonicare systems. Both use magnets to create a high-speed vibration. However, the way the magnets are positioned seems to be the key difference between these high-end systems. The other major difference is price, with the Panasonic more expensive up-front to purchase the system and more pricy for replacement heads for the EW-DE92 handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic system reviewed here uses a linear motor drive to create the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; motion in the brush. The Sonicare system uses two magnets and creates a side-to-side motion. In terms of how this translates to cleaning, I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference!  So, how do you decide which system to buy? It comes down to features (which are constantly changing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features that are the same:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft Start:  For people who have never used a sonic style toothbrush before, the first use can be kind-of startling. Your head vibrates, your eardrums vibrate, your hand vibrates and it can feel really weird on your teeth. Because of this, both brands offer a &amp;#34;soft start&amp;#34; function, which starts vibrating at a gentler intensity and slowly builds up to full force. I highly recommend this feature for newbies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life: As the toothbrushes are basically the same size, the battery life seems equivalent. The battery lasts for a month or more before you need to recharge (based up on 2x daily brushing habits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timer: The ADA recommends that people brush their teeth for at least two minutes. Thus, both systems come with a timer, which briefly pauses every 30 seconds to let you know it is time to move to the next quadrant of your mouth. NOTE to new users: Let the toothbrush do the work! I developed sensitive gums from pressing the toothbrush too hard against myteeth and gums. My dentist recommends one-finger pressure only and let the brush do the scrubbing. If you are also physically brushing, you can damage your gums, potentially causing them to recede slightly--ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel case: Most will come with some sort of case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features that are different:  There are small features that make the toothbrushes different. Whether they are significant enough to drive someone to one brand or the other really comes down to personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modes: Depending on the model of toothbrush you buy, it comes with a variety of modes (whitening, sensitive, regular, etc.). This model comes with a white or soft mode. While I can tell the difference between soft and other modes, I honestly cannot tell the difference in the whitening mode versus any others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush with tongue care: This model comes with a brush head that has a rubberized back for tongue cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Here is the one area where Philips Sonicare seems to beat the Panasonic. Example: replacement head for the Sonicare averages $10 on Amazon.com. For the Panasonic reviewed here, average price is $22. It is actually a bit hard to find the correct replacement brush head for the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the function, the Panasonic and Philips Sonicare are equivalent. There are some difference in the features, none of which seem that significant to sway someone from one to the other brand. However, price and replacement head availability seems to be the real difference. Overall, the Panasonic seems more expensive compared the Sonicare in both the initial price, as well as replacing the toothbrush head when it becomes worn.</li>
    <li> We now own this toothbrush and several Sonicares (older and newer versions). I can&#x27;t say that I see a huge difference between them in terms of results. The Panasonic heads have a tongue cleaner, which isn&#x27;t something I feel I need; the Panasonic comes with a carrying case, which is actually great if you travel a lot, but probably not worth such a large difference in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brands have a decent battery life--at least a week--which is useful for me because even though I don&#x27;t travel much, I often take the toothbrush into whatever bathroom in the house isn&#x27;t occupied, and I can leave it in there off the charger without an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But speaking of the battery . . .  whether you get the Pansonic or the Sonicare, the day is going to come when the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge any longer. The Panasonic promises you three years. Sonicare&#x27;s website claims &amp;#34;The batteries will last for many years of regular use.&amp;#34; Whichever one you choose, once the battery conks out, you&#x27;re done. You have to buy an entire new unit. Consequently, especially if you&#x27;re outfitting your whole family, you might want to go with the cheaper (Sonicare) brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Sonicare benefits: It seems to clean your teeth with a bit more vigor. We&#x27;ve also found that we can also get a 3-pack of Sonicare heads for a decent price at our local big-box wholesale store;  I haven&#x27;t seen replacement heads for the Panasonic brush listed anywhere yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If Grandma buys you one, say thank you, be happy, and hope that they list replacement brushes soon. If you&#x27;re trying to save pennies, the Sonicare works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t forget to floss!  :)</li>
    <li> No replacement heads??? This was a $95 waist of money.  Ive been waiting 4 months.  DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I started using the Braun Oral-B electric brushes in the early 90&#x27;s and switched to the Philips Sonicare line about 10 years ago. I love electric toothbrushes, and I prefer the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; approach that Sonicare always used to the mechanical one that Oral-B used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When as a Vine reviewer I got a chance to try out the Panasonic I wanted to do so, though I couldn&#x27;t find replacement brushes and that&#x27;s a big part of the cost (and usefulness). I like the fact that you can find good prices on either Oral-B or Sonicare in the places you&#x27;d expect to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is junk and I&#x27;m shocked that Panasonic would put out something this bad at this price. As I write this, amazon is charging about $125 for this and for that you can get a very nice Oral-B or Sonicare. So what is so bad about this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The unit/handle itself is very very lightweight, uses cheap-feeling plastic, so the grip isn&#x27;t great, and the battery isn&#x27;t very long-lasting either. I know that most people put the brush back in the holder after each use but I like the fact that I can get almost 2 weeks from my sonicare without the charger - at least a solid week without worrying. There&#x27;s no way that this will do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I once got some generic brushes for my Sonicare and they were junk, and these feel exactly the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) While I haven&#x27;t found replacement brushes for this yet, it seems a safe bet that this brush won&#x27;t take off and thus the brushes will be hard to find and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I can&#x27;t criticize it the base: It&#x27;s just like the minimal bases that the other brands use and I see no reason why it won&#x27;t hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Panasonic were charging $60 bucks for this I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but at least I would understand someone considering it. For anything over that, this is junk. I think the only people who might buy this and not return it are those who have never used an electric brush before and buy don&#x27;t have a point of comparison.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for over 20 years, from the original Interplak through the Braun rotary head models to the most recent Phillips Sonicare, of which I remain a big fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the Braun brushes because they just stopped developing the product.  They continue to use Ni-Cad batteries, which limits their time between charges to about 8-10 days or so, which just isn&#x27;t long enough for two people to go on holiday without the charger.  Also, the travel cases were either soft (allowing the on-off button to be pressed accidentally) or hard and bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little Panasonic is great for traveling.  It is a tiny, lightweight brush.  The handle is about two-thirds the length and half the weight of most electric toothbrushes on the market.  It has a lithium ion battery which gives it a claimed 90 minutes between charges.  That&#x27;s 45 two-minute brushes, or THREE WEEKS between charges for one person.  The included travel case is hard but not too bulky and the whole package is lightweight.  Even the charger is quite light if you do have to take it along.  As far as cleaning results go, my teeth feel clean and my mouth feels suitably tingly after using it.  It also doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive teeth in the way that my Sonicare can (even with the highly recommended &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; bristles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet this brush will not be replacing my Sonicare anytime soon.  Although I like many aspects of this, I find I cannot get the bristles all the way behind the back of my rearmost teeth, into the spaces left when my wisdom teeth were removed.  Also, both the Braun and Sonicare move the brushhead so that you don&#x27;t have to do as much actual brushing.  This Panasonic derives its long battery life / light weight compromise from the fact that the brushhead really doesn&#x27;t move, so the user has to do most of the actual brushing.  For those two reasons, I prefer the Sonicare for daily use, but I think I&#x27;ll take this on my next trip.</li>
    <li> I own a Philips Flexcare so that will be my point of reference for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Also Amazon sent me a different brush to review than the one pictured here. My brush only has 1 button on it and  2 modes of operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway hereʻs my review for the unit I received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Much lighter and 2 inches shorter than the Philips. Makes it easier to wield and carry on travel.&lt;br /&gt;- Dock is more secure than Philipsʻ&lt;br /&gt;- It has the same 30 second timer as the Philips but unlike the Philips the unit doesnʻt stop after 2 minutes. It just keeps going. I much prefer this because after my 2 minute cycle I typically go on to do tongue cleaning anyway. The Philips requires me to press the go button again. Anyway, small detail...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- This isnʻt really a true cons and perhaps a perceived one. If you are used to a Philips the first thing you will notice is that the vibration on the Panasonic feels substantially weaker than the Philips. So I decided to try a simple test. I put a dab of tooth paste on each brush and just let it vibrate to see what happens. Surprisingly the seemingly weaker Panasonic brush seems to disassemble the toothpaste blob almost immediately whereas the Philips did not. Thatʻs suggesting to me that the Panasonic is just vibrating at a much higher frequency which might lead to the perception that the vibration is weaker. In all likelihood it is probably just as effective as the Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- From what I can tell on Amazon, the Panasonic brushes are a tad more expensive than the Philips. And like the Philips itʻs also not quite clear which replacement heads Iʻm supposed to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;- A decent light weight travel toothbrush. Although it feels weaker than the Philips it may be due to the higher frequency at which it vibrates.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a much more expensive Sonicare toothbrush that was unfortunately left behind on vacation. It performs as needed but I must admit I miss the timer on my on my Sonicare. It&#x27;s brush head is also larger and I definitely prefer the smaller one.</li>
    <li> First, and most important, I love the way this brush cleans my teeth.  Using the \\&quot;white\\&quot; mode, they feel nice and fresh and thoroughly cleansed.  According to the owner&#x27;s guide, some people can feel that slight electric charge, the ionic feature, when using the brush, and I am one of those people.  However, it is extremely mild and not the least unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are various settings on this brush although I use \\&quot;white\\&quot; most often.  The gum brush may be useful but I don&#x27;t use it as routinely as suggested because it just doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing much for me.  I do like to use the little pointy rubber head but again, not as often as the regular head.  I do like the tongue cleaner on this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to one of the drawbacks.  I cannot seem to find replacement heads for this product.  I looked on Amazon and I went to the Panasonic site with no success.  I went to the same model toothbrush on both sites and there are no links to the replacement heads.  I wanted to order some in advance so I would have then when needed.  Perhaps this is a new model and replacement heads will become widely available, but this toothbrush is expensive to begin with, and much more so if heads cannot be found.  (Update:  replacement heads are available but not common yet.  I&#x27;m hoping this will change.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my basic but rechargeable Philips Sonicare toothbrush, this one is nicer to hold because the handle is much slimmer.  The Sonicare seems to have a more robust brushing action, but this one seems to get my teeth just as clean, perhaps marginally cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger seems to work well.  I took the brush on a 10-day trip and chanced not taking the charger with me, and I had no loss of power during that trip.  It seems to hold its charge quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is a downside to the charger too.  According to the manual again, the lithium battery lasts about 3 years.  When the battery is dead, I am supposed to \\&quot;Contact an authorized service center for repair.\\&quot;  Now that is just not practical and probably not cheap, and this toothbrush costs too much to not be able to replace the battery without service costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more drawback is the storage of the various heads.  This set comes with a little stand to store the heads, but none of the heads have a protective cover and the storage stand does not have a cover, so the heads are sitting out in the bathroom air, something I don&#x27;t like at all.  The travel case holds the handle and one head but not the extra heads.  My cheaper Sonicare has a plastic cap that comes with each head to protect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think this is a very good toothbrush, the drawbacks need to be fixed before I would consider getting another one.  At current prices, this one costs more than twice my Sonicare, and while this one has more bells and whistles, I don&#x27;t believe the price difference is justified.to \\&quot;Contact an authorized service center for repair.\\&quot;  Now that is just not practical and probably not cheap, and this toothbrush costs too much to not be able to replace the battery without service costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more drawback is the storage of the various heads.

    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Sonicare toothbrushes for over ten years.  I even own the latest and greatest  DiamondCare toothbrush now.  I buy these expensive toothbrushes because my teeth stain terribly and I get terrible tartar.  Only these toothbrushes can spare my teeth most of the harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noted the following differences/similarities between the Sonicare and the Panasonic Sonic toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Both have long battery life so the toothbrushes don&#x27;t need to be recharged for days at a time.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Both reduce tartar and stain much, much more than standard toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Both have various settings on it--but honestly, I just use the regular setting each time.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The Panasonic Sonic toothbrush feels lighter than the Sonicare but I haven&#x27;t weighed both separately to confirm this fact.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The Panasonic Sonic costs approximately $60 less than the Sonicare DiamondCare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the toothbrush 4 rather than 5 stars because I have yet to figure out how much it costs to replace the brush heads.  I contacted Panasonic by phone and by email to find out details for the replacement brush heads.  The Panasonic representative I spoke to didn&#x27;t have an answer and the email response I received was similarly unhelpful.  Clearly, I&#x27;m hoping that the brush heads will cost less to replace than those of the Sonicare.  I replace my brush heads at least monthly, so their expense figures in considerable to the cost of the toothbrush.  I&#x27;ll update this post with information about the replacement brush heads once finally find information about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I highly recommend this product.  Feel free to ask questions.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but the brush is a little small</li>
    <li> Brushing is very clean, one week can be used once each morning and evening</li>
    <li> Love the toothbrush, but YOU CANNOT FIND replacement heads ANYWHERE not even on panasonic.com where I actually purchased this toothbrush from.  Would love to hear if anyone has found replacement heads anywhere in August 2015.</li>
