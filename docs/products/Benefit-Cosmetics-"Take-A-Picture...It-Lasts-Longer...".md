### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is perfect!</li>
      <li>It has a beautiful finish when you brush on your skin.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t find it to be all that great.</li>
      <li>what this product is, what it is made of, or what it is used for - but the wife unit likes it and was very pleased to get this as a gift....</li>
      <li>And the price is very cheap!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Enjoy!!</li>
      <li>Much better!</li>
      <li>however its nice and oroginal product from Benefit ..</li>
      <li>No combo of products I own can recreate the magic in this lovely tin.</li>
      <li>It makes my feet look healthy and shinning.</li>
      <li>Your better of with a body BB cream for a smoother skin look.</li>
      <li>The applicators ok</li>
      <li>It makes your skin look AMAZING for pictures if you have a special event coming up.</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely, but incredibly light and therefore does not clash with my perfume.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, goes on nice and your skin is soft.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell.</li>
      <li>you wear a skirt or dress, this will make your legs look smooth and</li>
      <li>it let my body smooth and fragrance..</li>
      <li>But during the time I used this product, I never had a reaction - so when I stumbled upon it here on Amazon, I was excited to see my &amp;#34;old friend&amp;#34; and added it to my shopping cart immediately!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I splurged on it as a pre-summer treat to myself and I am so excited to wear shorts,</li>
      <li>I use this when going out for special occasions.</li>
      <li>This also leaves your skin feeling silky-soft, though it more of a I-just-applied-mineral-oil to my skin sort of way (it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, like I said before).</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>I am an avid sunless tanner</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t even sure what it was short of decadent</li>
      <li>I am guessing that my mom bought this for me when it first came out.  </li>
      <li>The only reason in not giving it a 5 star, is that the scent could be better.</li>
      <li>Very light natural look, classy not trashy at all.</li>
      <li>And while I miss the very large original tin, I find that this smaller one is easier to travel with.  </li>
      <li>This indeed is the real deal</li>
      <li>now get less product than you Did before, and I&#x27;m pretty sure they changed</li>
      <li>now if only she&#x27;d get as excited about the gas-fired portable nail gun i got her for working on the roof...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d advise you to shop around, plenty of companies sell 100% pure Shea butter, unscented that will give you the exact same results as this, with an added bonus of major hydration.&lt;br</li>
      <li>than they would have had I applied L&#x27;Occitane 100% pure Shea butter (more expensive, but all natural and a full sized tin will last all winter with daily, full-body application).&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s subtle and perfectly appropriate for daytime wear at the office.  </li>
      <li>and I love how a swipe of this down the center of my shins acts like a highlighter on cheekbones.  </li>
      <li>What it does do is create an amazing dewy glow on your skin, that doesn&#x27;t look like glitter or fake.</li>
      <li>Now, nearly 10 years later, I am still smitten with everything about it.  </li>
      <li>Like grandma&#x27;s closet.&lt;br /&gt;The tiny applicator makes it take forever to apply to your legs (think major production)</li>

    <li> I love this product! I splurged on it as a pre-summer treat to myself and I am so excited to wear shorts, even thought it&#x27;s 60 degrees out! My legs look so shiny and glisten with little pink and gold sparklies in the sun! I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> being a clueless, retarded husband, i still have no idea what this product is, what it is made of, or what it is used for - but the wife unit likes it and was very pleased to get this as a gift.... now if only she&#x27;d get as excited about the gas-fired portable nail gun i got her for working on the roof...</li>
    <li> Very light natural look, classy not trashy at all. If you are looking for something that stands out obvious then this is not for you. Although I gave five star, this can be 4 and a half bc it is little sticky</li>
    <li> I like it very much. It makes my feet look healthy and shinning.</li>
    <li> I use this when going out for special occasions. It makes your skin look dewy and silky. For those Sex In The City fans...this was used on the women. I put it on any skin that would be showing in my outfit, ie:  back, shoulders, arms, chest, and ESP legs. The only reason in not giving it a 5 star, is that the scent could be better. I have a friend who loves the scent but I don&#x27;t find it to be all that great. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I thinke the product is same as its decription. And the price is very cheap! I love it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am guessing that my mom bought this for me when it first came out.  I wasn&#x27;t even sure what it was short of decadent and I was afraid to use it daily because it seemed so precious.  Now, nearly 10 years later, I am still smitten with everything about it.  The glimmery sheen is the opposite of trashy and it feels so posh.  It&#x27;s subtle and perfectly appropriate for daytime wear at the office.  The scent is lovely, but incredibly light and therefore does not clash with my perfume. I am an avid sunless tanner and I love how a swipe of this down the center of my shins acts like a highlighter on cheekbones.  And while I miss the very large original tin, I find that this smaller one is easier to travel with.  I hope they never discontinue this item.  No combo of products I own can recreate the magic in this lovely tin.</li>
    <li> This is not a moisturizer. If that&#x27;s what you are looking for, than don&#x27;t buy this product. What it does do is create an amazing dewy glow on your skin, that doesn&#x27;t look like glitter or fake. It makes your skin look AMAZING for pictures if you have a special event coming up. I used to use this all the time in college when we would go out on the town and I was showing some skin. I just ordered this to use on my wedding day to get that dewy glow for pictures. This also leaves your skin feeling silky-soft, though it more of a I-just-applied-mineral-oil to my skin sort of way (it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, like I said before).</li>
    <li> I purchased a benefit to get GWP, very disappointed. It smells nice, goes on nice and your skin is soft. But it does not give you that pinky peach glow. Your better of with a body BB cream for a smoother skin look.</li>
    <li> Bought one as a gift and one for myself.  It has a beautiful finish when you brush on your skin. UMMM</li>
    <li> I used to use this product religiously in my 20&#x27;s and for whatever reason, stopped and switched to other products. I have severe chemical allergies and usually only use organic/natural body products. But during the time I used this product, I never had a reaction - so when I stumbled upon it here on Amazon, I was excited to see my &amp;#34;old friend&amp;#34; and added it to my shopping cart immediately!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my tastes have changed - after all it&#x27;s been 10 years (heck, maybe even 20) since I last used this stuff. But this is not the product I remember at all! The scent, which used to be a very soft, powdery floral just smells odd now. Like grandma&#x27;s closet.&lt;br /&gt;The tiny applicator makes it take forever to apply to your legs (think major production) and after applying, aside from the funky smell my legs looked no different than they would have had I applied L&#x27;Occitane 100% pure Shea butter (more expensive, but all natural and a full sized tin will last all winter with daily, full-body application).&lt;br /&gt;You now get less product than you Did before, and I&#x27;m pretty sure they changed the formula!&lt;br /&gt;Before you blame the seller, I did go to Ulta and Sephora and tried their testers to see if I had simply gotten a bad batch. but nope! This indeed is the real deal product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d advise you to shop around, plenty of companies sell 100% pure Shea butter, unscented that will give you the exact same results as this, with an added bonus of major hydration.&lt;br /&gt;Benefit: I&#x27;m not sure what you did to this product, but please un-do it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell. The applicators ok but so miss the cream in the jar from Benefit! Much better! Bring back the body cream Benefit!</li>
    <li> IF you&#x27;re a girl......or a guy.&lt;br /&gt;When you wear a skirt or dress, this will make your legs look smooth and gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST WEAR THIS when you go out girls!</li>
    <li> not enough makeup to cover it all up</li>
    <li> I like it&lt;br /&gt; I thought it is with color like a foundation&lt;br /&gt;but it just a shiny color&lt;br /&gt;the smell for it wounderful</li>
    <li> I use it on my neck and or arms and legs, it just smooths and perfects&lt;br /&gt;your skin in a cinch!</li>
    <li> it let my body smooth and fragrance..it doesn&#x27;t change its color to be brighter as i thought lol :D..however its nice and oroginal product from Benefit ..</li>
    <li> The scent, the texture, the box! It is perfect!</li>
