### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best for fair type skin.</li>
      <li>Thank you for this great product</li>
      <li>Men want to look great, too.  </li>
      <li>which is great if you&#x27;re a guy like me who doesn&#x27;t want others to know you&#x27;re wearing</li>
      <li>If you are fair, this is a great product</li>
      <li>It does oxidize for up to an hour after application which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>It is a good product.</li>
      <li>I got this knowing it was going to be too fair for my skin type</li>
      <li>I chose this one over the Good Guy BB cream because my face is often oily throughout the day, and I wanted a one-stop BB cream to put on in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m somewhat more tan than I thought!</li>
      <li>and I even got a sample product for service from my vendor which was a nice touch.</li>
      <li>it is not makeup, per se, but a nice skin evener.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Somehow, I did find a suitable use for</li>
      <li>, my skin is caucasian white and this product seems to be best for people with that kind of skin tone.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re VERY light skinned, this can work for you.</li>
      <li>This bb cream is pretty good, however I would not suggest it if you aren&#x27;t already fair-skinned as it has a very light tint to it.</li>
      <li>First tried the Tarte brand BB cream and paid a good $70 for it.</li>
      <li>One of the best bb creams, blends with my skin tone nicely which I&#x27;m a little tan, easy to apply, one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Application was really easy and the results are night and day.</li>
      <li>product does apply easily and evenly, but it was just a bit too light.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>This is a great product for a guy who wants a fresh finish.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a moisturizer to use because my face cleansing products are really strong.  </li>
      <li>This claims to have strong amounts of sunblock protection in addition to skin restoring properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely a great product for white light skin.</li>
      <li>substance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Even a light tan will make this cream too light for you.</li>
      <li>It arrived on time got two free product samples...</li>
      <li>too light and looks like make up on my skin</li>
      <li>coverage is great, and a lot better than some of the other creams available in US stores.</li>
      <li>great for minor imperfections and blemishes.</li>
      <li>specially when im tan.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t, it feels like nothing even though i use a full pump.</li>
      <li>in all, I would only recommend this BB cream for those who are fair.</li>
      <li>Applies pretty easily but unless you have an almost ghostly complexion, avoid this product.  </li>
      <li>I am sure it is an ok product but definitely not for me.</li>
      <li>Offers good coverage, but it&#x27;s super super light.&lt;br /&gt;This would be only suitable for caucasian light complexion or very very light asian complexion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Decent coverage, just not the right hue for my skin.</li>
      <li>Who cares if a guy wants to have a fresh face, too?  </li>
      <li>first I was worried about the \\&quot;tint\\&quot;, because I&#x27;ve never work something with a tint before</li>
      <li>After that ran out earlier this year, I opted to try Benefit Better than BB.</li>
      <li>Only buy it if you use 01 fair american BB creams / makeup.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and easy application but very pale.</li>
      <li>Very light in color and dry</li>
      <li>however after I figured how much I should use it</li>
      <li>You really and truly must have the palest skin with zero hint of color at all for this to work.</li>
      <li>and it brought some light back to my face.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, but the color is a lot lighter than it looks.  </li>
      <li>It successfully covers my redness and my dark circles and it lasted for the entire day.</li>
      <li>tint is a little bit of a gray-ish color and is quite light in color, so if you are anything other than fair, this may be a BB cream you want to skip over.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really control the oils on your face, but its still a decent product.</li>
      <li>And it is really white on my face, i need a stippling brush and a good minute and a half to blend this cream to an airbrush effect.</li>
      <li>Coverage remained even and smooth all day long without any touchups.&lt;br</li>
      <li>was pretty good very subtle</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re skin tone is naturally tanned or darker you would most likely find this to be too much white for you.</li>
      <li>The bottle tends to squirt out a lot of BB cream at once (and you only need a little amount!), but that can be fixed by lightly pressing down on the top.</li>
      <li>short, if you&#x27;re caucasian or are very lightskinned, this will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>with a thin layer applied it was just a tad too light (I&#x27;m asian and my skin is fairly light</li>
      <li>I did the left side of my face in the american BB cream, right side in this Korean cream.</li>
      <li>Both creams &#x27;worked&#x27; but they wore off relatively quickly, and they didn&#x27;t really cover up the redness, rather just turned it into a darker, less noticeable shade of red.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After hearing a few different people say Korean BB Creams were WAY better than the american versions, I opted to give it a go.</li>
      <li>Color matches my pale, cool skin</li>
      <li>This $16 cream completely got rid of my redness with one extremely tiny drop.</li>
      <li>For me a pea sized amount covers my face (it says a full pump should be ebough, but i&#x27;ve found that to be excessive).</li>
      <li>One side looked orange and discolored with dark red splotches, the other side completely smooth, radiant, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read all of the other reviews and knew to expect this product to be for very light skin and that I would only need to use a very small amount.</li>
      <li>I initially got it to cover my freckles and dark circles since I don&#x27;t get much sleep</li>

    <li> Very smooth and easy application but very pale. I wish it came in multiple shades because now I&#x27;ve come to find out I&#x27;m somewhat more tan than I thought!</li>
    <li> This bb cream is pretty good, however I would not suggest it if you aren&#x27;t already fair-skinned as it has a very light tint to it.

    <li> Great product love it</li>
    <li> great for minor imperfections and blemishes. It is not too heavy which is great.&lt;br /&gt;Once applied, wait a few mins for it to settle in. Blends well!</li>
    <li> Started using BB creams last year to cover up my slightly splotchy red cheeks upon the recommendation of a Sephora salesperson. First tried the Tarte brand BB cream and paid a good $70 for it. After that ran out earlier this year, I opted to try Benefit Better than BB. Both creams &#x27;worked&#x27; but they wore off relatively quickly, and they didn&#x27;t really cover up the redness, rather just turned it into a darker, less noticeable shade of red. The rest of my skin usually ended up looking a weird shade of orange in some parts (particularly on my nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hearing a few different people say Korean BB Creams were WAY better than the american versions, I opted to give it a go. I was skeptical that it wouldn&#x27;t work well at first since my skin isn&#x27;t really yellow at all, and I assumed a Korean BB Cream would be made solely for Koreans. I found this one, and people seemed to think it would work for pale caucasian skin. Since I have the redness, I was still a bit worried. Got it in the mail today and found it is indeed worlds better than any expensive $70 BB cream. This $16 cream completely got rid of my redness with one extremely tiny drop. Application was really easy and the results are night and day. I did the left side of my face in the american BB cream, right side in this Korean cream. One side looked orange and discolored with dark red splotches, the other side completely smooth, radiant, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add in the SPF 35 and I&#x27;m sold 500x over. Hopefully they never stop making this miracle substance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Even a light tan will make this cream too light for you. Only buy it if you use 01 fair american BB creams / makeup.</li>
    <li> Well ladies for those who think bb cream is for girls I geuss its for guys as well.. I ordered it thinking it was for women.. bad mistake it to white for my face</li>
    <li> I have tried american bb creams and they sucked so bad, my biggest pet peeve being it melting off my face with sweat. I got this knowing it was going to be too fair for my skin type specially when im tan. And it is really white on my face, i need a stippling brush and a good minute and a half to blend this cream to an airbrush effect. But that was about the last bad thing about it. I topped it off with some bronzer and it brought some light back to my face. It feels like its gonna be really heavy but it isn&#x27;t, it feels like nothing even though i use a full pump. It successfully covers my redness and my dark circles and it lasted for the entire day. It does oxidize for up to an hour after application which is a good thing. I guess this happens because the sunscreen wears off and you stop getting that flashback of white spf gives you. Finnally it doesnt melt off and it keeps your skin shine at a minimum. Shipping for me in PR was a bit longer but it still was faster than what i expected and I even got a sample product for service from my vendor which was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a guy who wants a fresh finish.  it is not makeup, per se, but a nice skin evener.  Who cares if a guy wants to have a fresh face, too?  Men want to look great, too.  The color was a bit lighter, so I just did a lighter application.  It is a good product.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this great product</li>
    <li> I read all of the other reviews and knew to expect this product to be for very light skin and that I would only need to use a very small amount. Even knowing that information ahead of time did not prepare me for how incredibly pale this made me look.

I think there is really only a small population of people that have the correct skin tone. I am sure it is an ok product but definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> I chose this one over the Good Guy BB cream because my face is often oily throughout the day, and I wanted a one-stop BB cream to put on in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tint is a little bit of a gray-ish color and is quite light in color, so if you are anything other than fair, this may be a BB cream you want to skip over. Being a redhead myself, this covered up my pink undertones and made my face one uniform color. Nobody even noticed I was wearing anything on my face - which is great if you&#x27;re a guy like me who doesn&#x27;t want others to know you&#x27;re wearing makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is great, and a lot better than some of the other creams available in US stores. The bottle tends to squirt out a lot of BB cream at once (and you only need a little amount!), but that can be fixed by lightly pressing down on the top. Coverage remained even and smooth all day long without any touchups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would only recommend this BB cream for those who are fair. If you like to tan, or you are a little darker, I would go with a different cream. If you are fair, this is a great product and I would not pass this one up.</li>
    <li> too light and looks like make up on my skin , i have a tan asian skin tone.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer to use because my face cleansing products are really strong.  This claims to have strong amounts of sunblock protection in addition to skin restoring properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was worried about the \\&quot;tint\\&quot;, because I&#x27;ve never work something with a tint before and I didn&#x27;t people to assume that I was using makeup or anything.  You just apply a very little amount and rub it into your skin.  Rub it into your skin for about a minute or so and it should appear invisible.  I guess the thing about BB creams it that they&#x27;re not supposed to seem like anything&#x27;s there.  My face looks smoother and cleaner after applying it on, but nobody can guess I&#x27;ve got anything with tint on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin is caucasian white and this product seems to be best for people with that kind of skin tone.  If you&#x27;re skin tone is naturally tanned or darker you would most likely find this to be too much white for you.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time got two free product samples... only thing was that the product is rather pale which is odd as I&#x27;m very pale but it was rather ghost like however after I figured how much I should use it was pretty good very subtle and yes it does keep you from getting an oily face... I initially got it to cover my freckles and dark circles since I don&#x27;t get much sleep</li>
    <li> Best for fair type skin. Very light in color and dry</li>
    <li> helps but after a while it looks a lot like makeup. I combined it with a regular facial moisturizer to dilute the pigment.</li>
    <li> Offers good coverage, but it&#x27;s super super light.&lt;br /&gt;This would be only suitable for caucasian light complexion or very very light asian complexion.&lt;br /&gt;The product does apply easily and evenly, but it was just a bit too light.&lt;br /&gt;Even with a thin layer applied it was just a tad too light (I&#x27;m asian and my skin is fairly light but still it&#x27;s too light)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, I did find a suitable use for it.&lt;br /&gt;If I have blemishes on my nose, I can use a little to conceal without it being noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;(I have no idea how that makes sense, but it does)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re caucasian or are very lightskinned, this will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re asian and you&#x27;re VERY light skinned, this can work for you.</li>
    <li> One of the best bb creams, blends with my skin tone nicely which I&#x27;m a little tan, easy to apply, one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, but the color is a lot lighter than it looks.  It made me look like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent coverage, just not the right hue for my skin.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great product for white light skin. Not really recommended for darker tones.</li>
    <li> Applies pretty easily but unless you have an almost ghostly complexion, avoid this product.  But if you want to look like the undead, then this color (on darker than snow white skin tones) should do the trick.</li>
    <li> Color matches my pale, cool skin</li>
</ol>
