      <li>I liked the product.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>my favorite blush color of all time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have the powder Orgasm blush, and let me say, I like this much better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my favorite blush, along with NARS super-orgasm.</li>
      <li>I read somewhere that women over 50 should no longer use powder blush because it ages us, so I switched to this creamy stick version of my favorite NARS color :-)</li>
      <li>It is what most lead you to when you enter Sephora and ask for a recommended blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have Rivera which I love</li>
      <li>You would need to put a powder blush over for a prominent blush.</li>
      <li>This is the most natural-looking blush I have owned.  </li>
      <li>so I ordered this color, which is more peachy.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is such a wonderful color.</li>
      <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t melt when you perspire</li>
      <li>Love that it stays on for hours.  </li>
      <li>this product is okay,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tad more sparkly than I anticipated, but I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love the feel.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a lovely  product.</li>
      <li>Using a brush works much better.  </li>
      <li>I really love this color.  </li>
      <li>I am usually mostly a drugstore makeup gal.  </li>
      <li>I love NARS and have used both &amp;#34;the multiple&amp;#34; and the compact powder version on this blush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s youthful and gives me a healthy glow.  </li>
      <li>eyes is pretty nice for a kind of sheer summer look, and cheeks its the best</li>
      <li>Great, classic color.</li>
      <li>I had read many blogs and reviews that said NARS Multiple Orgasm was a brilliant makeup staple.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend loved it, she uses it only for formal meetings, good quality, well made.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super-creamy or oily, but more powdery and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It gives a beautiful healthy glow, especially for those of us over 50.  </li>
      <li>I love the ease with which &amp;#34;the multiple&amp;#34; applies, but I found it too light (and somewhat cakey) when used on the lips.</li>
      <li>I can see how this would be great for nearly any skin complexion.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>This product blends really easy and seems like</li>
      <li>Applies very quickly also.</li>
      <li>No one of my acquaintance has said anything, but I like how easy this goes on and blends, so I&#x27;m staying with it for now.</li>
      <li>The blush goes on easily, and the tube packaging makes it easy to carry with you.</li>
      <li>I had read a lot of good reviews about this brand and, in particular, this color of blush.  </li>
      <li>I love the color - it adds just the right amount of healthy color to my checks.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it, she uses it only for formal meetings, good quality, well made. Highly recommended, particularly the orgasm color.</li>
    <li> I have never spent more than $14 on a beauty product but I have heard so much about this product that I had to give it a try. It is fantastic. I don&#x27;t wear much in the way of make-up but this is very easy to apply and blend. It looks natural and not at all \\&quot;glittery\\&quot; as some reviews said. I think it looks shimmery in a dewy way. I am blonde, blue eyed and pretty pale and this looks very natural on me. Love it!</li>
    <li> Orgasm is the perfect shade for the fair and aging imo. Just enough color without overdoing it. Easy to apply. Applies very quickly also. To make it last, I cover it with a cheaper blush powder from Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I read somewhere that women over 50 should no longer use powder blush because it ages us, so I switched to this creamy stick version of my favorite NARS color :-) No one of my acquaintance has said anything, but I like how easy this goes on and blends, so I&#x27;m staying with it for now.</li>
    <li> I finally received my much anticipated NARS Multiple Orgasm Blusher. It is one of the most natural blushers I&#x27;ve ever worn. Thank you Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This color is so great! It was recommended by a friend and it really seems like it would work on a wide range of skin tones. I am really low maintenance with makeup, so I really only need this for eyes/lips/cheeks, powder and mascara and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> nice color, subtle, easy to apply</li>
    <li> This cream stick is perfect. The color is natural and goes on smoothly. I use it for my cheeks, my eyelids and my lips. Very natural and lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> A little soft. But good color.</li>
    <li> The good thing about this stick is that you can use it on your eyes, on your checks, and on your lips....&lt;br /&gt;You can do almost anything you want with it just use your imagination...</li>
    <li> I am 51 and was looking for a cream blush to switch to that would make my skin look less dry.  I had read a lot of good reviews about this brand and, in particular, this color of blush.  So I took a chance!  It&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous.  I am fair skinned and have dark hair and this blush looks very natural.  I apply it with my fingers and can control how much color I put on very easily - lighter for day, a little more for evening.  It doesn&#x27;t add enough color to my lips to treat it as a lipstick, but I&#x27;m fine with that since I was looking for a blush anyway.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Orgasm, multiple blush stick from Amazon.  I know it is expensive, but I have seen it rated so highly for a long time.  My daughter had purchased the powder blush in Orgasm.  I didnt know that she had purchased it, and I saw her at a birthday party, and asked her what kind of blush she had.  It looked so gorgeous!  So, I bought the cream one, as I am older and have started using cream everything, rather than powders.  I love the blush!!!  Spendy, but worth it.  I think it will last a long time, the stick is quite large.  It is awesome, for sure the best in every way that I have ever tried.  It would be difficult to use anything else now.</li>
    <li> Everyone said this is the BEST blush ever.  I am in my late 40s and was afraid to try a pinkish color blush but this cream formula allows me to build the color.  I can keep it as light as I want and it is still great!  I have only used it as a blush and love it!</li>
    <li> I love NARS and have used both &amp;#34;the multiple&amp;#34; and the compact powder version on this blush. I love the ease with which &amp;#34;the multiple&amp;#34; applies, but I found it too light (and somewhat cakey) when used on the lips. I used it strictly as a blush, and for that, it works great. I prefer the color density that you get when using the compact (I find it&#x27;s easier to control the amount of coverage that you&#x27;re going for), but &amp;#34;the multiple&amp;#34; gets bonus points for not cracking apart as can happen with any compact.</li>
    <li> I was not aware that the product contained an iridescent look. The iridescence is difficult to constrain in one area (cheeks) and I found it spread to my lower face leaving an unwanted sparkle. I alsonfoundmit can not be used alone on the lips as it is extraordinarily dry.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use it instead of lipstick.  It goes on creamy and it has a little sparkle.  I ordered a second one just so I could put it in my purse.  It was a little expensive but I think it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great blush or highlight.  I&#x27;m not liking it for my lips just because it&#x27;s a strange consistency to have on your lips.  But it&#x27;s a lovely  product.</li>
    <li> It is unlikely that I will ever use another blush.  This product goes on and looks beautiful.  Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t smear.  Very light sparkle too.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this blush on a daily basis.  Its fresh peachy-pink color smoothes onto my fair skin easily, and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab.&amp;#34;  Can be toned up or down, but if you have darker skin, order the same color in the powder.  Both are great &amp; the name is a kick!</li>
    <li> I love the multi-purpose stick, the creamy formula, pink champagne with shimmer color which is easy to apply and my complexion glows.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I would buy all of them if they weren&#x27;t so costly!</li>
    <li> I have Rivera which I love and it has a pink tone.  I was afraid it was discontinued so I ordered this color, which is more peachy.  It will be a nice color for summer skin tones.  I prefer this product over a powder blush and will order again.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great, classic color. Blush glides on easily and looks natural. Creams are especially good for my age-challenged skin! Would have given it 5 stars, but since I apply straight from the tube, it would work better for me if the opening was a bit wider. Otherwise, I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I have this blush stick in Orgasm, Maui and Malibu.  They are very creamy and easily blendable and last all day when set with loose powder. I apply with a brush, one with a very compact tapered head (the Ecotools blush brush) and sweep the brush across the stick a few times with circular motions. I then apply the blush to the apples of the cheeks and sweep up towards the hairline.  Although these sticks do have some light shimmer, they look very natural and blend seamlessly when a brush is used.  I tried using fingertips but the application was streaky and it took far too much product.  Using a brush works much better.  Malibu is a very rosy shade with a little brown in it and with a very subtle pinkish shimmer that would work for all but the palest complexions. It looks darker in the tube than it does on the cheek. Maui is a rosy pink shade with no shimmer and it would work for any but the darkest complexions. Orgasm is a peachy pink with a light gold shimmer and is good for any skin tone except those who are really dark because it likely wouldn&#x27;t show up.  I am light, but not fair, with neutral undertones, hazel eyes and dark blond hair. All three of these colors work well for me. In the hot summer I use Bare Minerals blush in Beauty over the Malibu stick, Bare Minerals blush in Rose Diamond over Maui, and Nars powder blush in Orgasm over the Orgasm stick.  I use the powder blush in the summer just to ensure the color lasts through the humidity.  In the cooler months, I use just the stick.  I have had each stick for several years and I use the Malibu every day and I still have about 1/3 left.  I have never used them as lip color, although this is one of the features. These are the nicest blushes I own and truly mimic a natural flush.  Now that I&#x27;m in my 50s, I need a pop of color on my face.  It&#x27;s youthful and gives me a healthy glow.  I&#x27;ve never found any product quite like The Multiple and I&#x27;m a huge fan.  I highly recommend this product and the colors I use.</li>
    <li> Pricey but lasts a very long time...you need only a touch for a hint of natural color...make sure you smooth it out evenly on your cheek bones...uses fingers to smooth</li>
    <li> I tried NARS Orgasm powder blush from a co-worker and loved it.  However, being over 40 and near 50, Sephora reps recommended I go with this cream.  I hated it.  It barely showed on my pale Irish skin.  It feels wonderful but doesn&#x27;t even compare to much cheaper NYX Pinched blush.</li>
    <li> Wow..So great.  I&#x27;m 40, have about the fairest and most sensitive skin you can imagine. This product color (Orgasm) looks fantastic on me, it&#x27;s super easy to apply and it hasn&#x27;t affected my sensitive skin in any way. I was questioning if this product was worth the price. It is.  The tube has a lot of product in it that will last a long time and the product is really wonderful in every way.</li>
    <li> I liked the product. It works like a blush too. Gostei do produto. Nesta cor, também pode ser usada como blush. Estava com receio, pois nao gostei do batom da Nars, aquele em forma de lápis. Felizmente, o iluminador nao decepcionou. Também gostei do vendedor. Recomendo a ambos.</li>
    <li> Use as lipstick or blush. Its great!! You will love it especially if your fair.....not too much. Looks very  natural</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, fast delivery. It&#x27;s kind of a peachy gold color and blends very nicely. Don&#x27;t have to use much and the bottle is huge, will probably last forever. I love it.</li>
    <li> this product is okay, don&#x27;t get me wrong i do still use it but not as much as i was hoping i would. I thought it was going to be an excellent blush as well as highlighter. it definently does not look good on lips so lets just get that clear right now. eyes is pretty nice for a kind of sheer summer look, and cheeks its the best but it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of pigment, again like for a summer look. You would need to put a powder blush over for a prominent blush. I think my biggest problem was the Orgasm color i ordered and that was my bad i wanted some shimmer, highlight that i could put under everything. But This product is still very good and i think if i got a different color i would be using it way more. Orgasm is good for light peachy blush glow. Hope this helped!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this particular NARS product for a number of years.  It is easy to apply and the color is great for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Love the feel.  Love the color - so very natural.  Love that it stays on for hours.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t melt when you perspire</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a brunette with hazel eyes and pale skin with pink undertones and this is the perfect color. It gives a beautiful healthy glow, especially for those of us over 50.  For first time buyers there are a number of instructional videos on the Internet that will help you achieve the look for you. Definately worth the price and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Buy this.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  You can use it as a lipstick, eye shadow, and blush. It&#x27;s a nice complementary color that looks good all over.  I bought my current stick two years ago and I&#x27;m just getting to the bottom of the tube.</li>
    <li> This is the most natural-looking blush I have owned.  It is what most lead you to when you enter Sephora and ask for a recommended blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite blush, along with NARS super-orgasm. To me, the stick application looks more natural than powder blush.</li>
    <li> The best place to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> EASY to apply, GREAT blush effect in the right places, not too thick, glides on and stays on as well as any other cream blush.  I will reorder.  It has also lasted a good amount of time. THAT I really appreciate!</li>
    <li> This is no secret, but Nars Orgasm blushers are the best!!  And who would think by looking at the shade?  It looks way too bright and peachy/pinky/orangey!  But, nope, it actually ends up looking quite natural.  I use it on my cheeks, then dab a bit on my lips.  And on little makeup days I use it as eyeshadow as well.</li>
    <li> I have the powder Orgasm blush, and let me say, I like this much better. The first thing I did with it, was recycle one of Bobbi Brown&#x27;s beautiful compacts, and melted down a coin of this, to pour into the container, (alone with a little grapefruit Chapstick) and that&#x27;s the best decision I&#x27;ve made with it so far. It&#x27;s such a pretty, shimmery color. PERFECT for summer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a fan of cream or cream to powder products to begin with, so to have this, and rouge a little on my cheeks after some nice, sheer foundation is the perfect pop of color and shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;WONDERFUL product!</li>
    <li> Very pretty shade, goes on easily (I use a brush) and stays. It&#x27;s a very flattering shade, with nice luminosity. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> very pretty color. works great on cheeks, but a little too chalky for lips. blends really well and gives me a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;My husband saw the packaging slip on the counter that said \\&quot;Multiple Orgasm\\&quot; and he got all excited thinking I&#x27;d bought us some sex toy. LOL sorry honey!</li>
    <li> The name says it all.. Nars Multiple Orgasm..It give my skin that \\&quot;after glow\\&quot;. Nice little blush with a hint of dewy glow. If you can&#x27;t make this is the best way to fake it. :)</li>
    <li> I really love this color.  It&#x27;s something special.  We buy it because my daughter has very sensitive skin and the NARS does not irritate it.  It is gentle and has a little glimmer.  Seriously, a beautiful color of blush!</li>
    <li> Has a weird glittery finish but no blush that I can see. Big waste of money if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Am I right?&lt;br /&gt;Great color, perfect for , oh let me see, everything - cheeks, eyes, lips!&lt;br /&gt;I have tanish golden skin - and yes, I love sparkly - so it is for me...&lt;br /&gt;Latina Bambinas ~ Es perfecto!</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product but found it to be just another waste of money.  The ads indicated it would given a glow and this is exactly what I was looking for in the product - it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  Would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> Nars&#x27; Orgasm has achieved cult status among the makeup crowd. I usually use the powder, but decided to try the cream blush this time instead. What&#x27;s great about this is that you can just stick it in your purse and do easy touch ups. Spreads on evenly, and lasts. You can use it as a lipstick too if you like (I don&#x27;t.)</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful color. I have very fair skin and can look too red or pink with blushes. This leaves a very subtle shimmer and very light pink. It really gives that flush look that seems natural. I am also using it on my lips for a very natural look. This product blends really easy and seems like one tube will last a very long time. I highly recommend it and already love it.</li>
    <li> The blush goes on easily, and the tube packaging makes it easy to carry with you. I keep it in my golf bag for quick touch-ups on the course.</li>
    <li> NARS Orgasm has long been my favorite powder blush and I thought the moist stick would be a good companion, mostly for its multi-use function.  It glides on cheeks easily and cleanly with no smearing and the color - that lovely, goldy-pink - is true.  It also makes a quick and easy eye shadow and a lip gloss with just a few quick swipes.  The beautiful shade looks unmade-up, clean, and natural, yet somehow better than bare.  Admittedly it&#x27;s a bit pricey but I console myself with its quality, color, and versatility.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Nars Matte Multiple in Aliti. Its a amazing bronzer or contour shade. These go on so smoothly and beautifully it looks like a second skin with a little color (if that makes sence). I now want every color! The matte multiple looks so nice on the skin, and blend like a dream.  The color range is also really nice. I can&#x27;t wait to try the Matte Multiple in Orgasm,  my favorite blush color of all time!&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention this amazon store, Bluemercury inc. I was originally sent the wrong color and I needed it for a job that Saturday (it was sold out everywhere in the color I needed). They immediately sent the right color, Altai. I revieved it a day before it was expected.  There customer service was above and beyond.  If they have a product your looking for, pirchase it from blurmercury inc!</li>
    <li> The product arrived as described and was packaged beautifully.  They even included a thank you note and samples of other products!  I&#x27;m super impressed with Cos Bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is beautiful.  It&#x27;s a tad more sparkly than I anticipated, but I don&#x27;t mind.  I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be using this quite a bit!</li>
    <li> I love the color - it adds just the right amount of healthy color to my checks.  I put it on with my finger as I learned to do from a make-up artist - thus controlling the color intensity and placement.  As I have oily skin, I sometimes put a touch of powered blusher over - but don&#x27;t think this is necessary for those with normal skin.</li>
    <li> I am usually mostly a drugstore makeup gal.  I had read many blogs and reviews that said NARS Multiple Orgasm was a brilliant makeup staple. I&#x27;m a fair-skinned brunette in my mid-30s and was a little skeptical that this color would be too orangey and peachy for me.  But I&#x27;ve been very pleased using it for my cheeks and lips. It has a bit of shimmer that gives you a nice glow. It&#x27;s not super-creamy or oily, but more powdery and smooth.  It&#x27;s probably best for cheeks but I also like it on my lips for quick color.  I can see how this would be great for nearly any skin complexion.  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and tends to be oily in the summertime.  I feel it made my skin break out which it never rarely does anymore.  The consistency is greasy and it is high priced.</li>
    <li> Great all in one..big fan</li>
    <li> This is a great product to give cheeks a healthy glow.  I also love the size of the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34;, as well as it&#x27;s compactness, making this great for travelling!</li>
    <li> Good product and service.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;m getting closer to 30, my skin is changing and so are my skin&#x27;s wants/needs. Aside from the occasional breakout, my skin is clear and all I use is tinted moisturizer to even it out. I have several powder blushes that I like the color of, but they all streak when applied to a dewey tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d been on the hunt for years (literally) for a liquid tint, cream blush or blush stick that could look completely natural. Benetint was too bright pink and hard to apply.... Tarte&#x27;s cheek stain didn&#x27;t last longer than if I&#x27;d instead applied cherry Chapstick to my cheeks. But then one day, I found myself wandering around to every counter checking for a product I had almost given up looking for when, finally, I came across the Nars part of Sephora and saw blush sticks. It was peachy/rosy with a hint of gold sparkle... and dewey versus oily (which means it could cause breakouts and slide off your face at the end of the day)--- it was \\&quot;Maui\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is VERY fair, and maui seemed like it might be too dark until I tested it on the back of my hand... it&#x27;s actually really sheer at first! You&#x27;ll have to add extra applications/layers for dramatic effect. Otherwise it&#x27;s very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was blendable, highly pigmented and it lasted all day in 80 degree Florida heat/humidity. It also didn&#x27;t make me break out with was a HUGE plus! There are not enough good things I can say about this product, so buy it and enjoy! This product is wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> I tried it because a friend had some.  I love this product and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to powder blush again!</li>
