      <li>This one didn&#x27;t come with a spare spring which I was expecting, but still I&#x27;m sure it will give her many years of use.</li>

      <li>This is a great product - it gets hot really fast and curls even faster.  </li>

      <li>so you have to hold it with your hand and this can risk one burning themselves (which is why it comes with a special glove).</li>
      <li>I love the waves and it adds so much volume to my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My order sipped super fast! I got it like in 3 or 4 days:) So I was very pleased(because I was really anxious to try it out) the wand heats up suppperr fast! Another thing I love:) also I like a lot the  temperature settings you can use and the flexibility of the cord. Although I was planning on returning it.. Because I really did not like how my curls came out:/ and my hair gets kinda fluffy(dose not do that with normal curlers) but I just stayed with it because I think I just need to get the hang of it?? But hot tools is a great brand! Would definitely recommend their products:)</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my sister - I own one too, and it&#x27;s the only curling iron I&#x27;ll use!</li>
    <li> Overall the curling iron works well but very disappointed that the glove that was to be included was never received.Sent msg to company,but no reply.The product heats up quickly but have been burned badly on my hand and fingers with just a brief touch of the curling iron.Make sure you get the glove!</li>
    <li> Great product, came on time</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that had never held a curl, until I tried this curling iron! My stylist used it and I was expecting it to be over $100 when I researched it. I am very surprised at the value of this tool for the price of it! Curls/waves stay all day without hairspray! Definately recommend :)</li>
    <li> Perfect curling iron! I purchased the small first and my hair looked more messy than anything else. This size is perfect for a wavy or natural looking curl, depending on how I curl it. Super fast to heat up and easy to hold/maneuver. I don&#x27;t even need the glove. Less than 10 minutes for a quick hair style that looks like I spent 3x the effort!</li>
    <li> I have a really long hair thick and curly hair.  I get my curls really nice at the ends but because of the weight almost nothing at the beginning.  I tried the curling iron but in two hours all the curls were down and the design of the curl was not my favorite either.  Alter long time I decided to buy one of this wands, I was looking for one Helen of Troy, but when I ordered this I realized was not the brand I wanted, but because of the ratings I decided to give a chance.  The Thanksgiving day I washed my hair and waited until it was dried and started making my curls with the wand in the two first outside layer and the curls turned gorgeous, love them very natural.  I put little hair spray and I went to the meeting with my family and I got compliments from everyone.  I could hear the woman talking about how pretty was my hair.  They stayed until the end of the night and even to the next and next day. Amazing I never thought there was something able to deal with my hair.  I do not regret giving this wand a chance. Praise God!</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly!!!! I have really long think hair and it really works!!! I would buy it again in a heartbeat!!! My friends love it too!!!! It heats up very quickly and gets really hot. The curls last for days!!! And it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have long long hair almost to my waist it is of medium thickness and i have a lot of trouble curling it with the curl type I want. I was very impressed with the heat of this and how tight the curls were. they where springy and bouncy but if combed through wavy and long. I love the product so much I went and purchassed a different size and style of the same brand (hot tools) because i FInally feel i have found an iron that actually works as described</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good curler for a very long time. I did my research online and saw great reviews for hot tools professional curling iron from many different websites. Also some of my friends recommended it. I tried it myself and omg u dont even need hairspray! The curls come out perfect. I love this curling iron!</li>
    <li> This worked extremely well on my sometimes hard to curl hair. I can style it in the morning and still have very wavy hair by the end of the day. It also heats up very quickly which is a plus. I would definitely recommend this curling iron!</li>
    <li> Held curls like a pro! Have to be cautious about the heat settings because a little heat goes a long way. Way hotter than my old curling iron which was from Sally&#x27;s. Curls were way better as well:) never going back</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through my share of irons - and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Plus, the price is so reasonable! I could not be more ecstatic about this product.  The heat settings go from 1-10 (low to high). I have semi-thick, semi-wavy hair that usually cannot hold a curl to save its life. Even on the second to lowest setting, this iron gives me amazingggggg curls. It takes only a short amount of time (I&#x27;m talking 5 to 8 seconds, for my hair type at least) to curl each section of hair perfectly, and it lasts all day (and more). I actually tested out the durability of the curls and found that they stayed intact for three very long days -- that&#x27;s two nights of sleeping on my hair and thrashing about. Quite simply, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better iron. Even ladies with very thick or coarse hair will find a friend in this device, as the heat setting goes up extremely high (I can only imagine what level 10 feels like!).   It takes a little while to get used to using (as there&#x27;s no clamp), and I find the glove to be useless once you&#x27;ve gotten a hang of the iron (the glove is bulky and itchy and makes your hand dexterity pretty clumsy). I will never go back to a clamp iron - the waves and curls achieved with the Hot Tools iron are so natural and beautiful and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out your hair like other irons (I imagine because it takes less time to curl the hair).   If I haven&#x27;t convinced you already, please...buy this product immediately!</li>
    <li> My hot tools curling iron works great!! I am so pleased with it! My hair came out amazing the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - it gets hot really fast and curls even faster.  Thanks for offering a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Works amazing. Gets hotter than anything we have here and the curls are amazing. Myself and my 16 year old think this is a great product and would buy from this seller anytime.</li>
    <li> So easy to use. Makes my hair look amazing and curls stay in all day long. Wavy if I don&#x27;t use hairspray to set, curly if I do. I like how there are multiple barrel sizes as well. Would highly recommend! Product came in on time from seller and in perfect condition! :)</li>
    <li> HOLD CURLS FOR DAYS!!!!!!!!!! awesome! i wish i had gotten the barrel with the same size all the way down BUT it holds curls forever and my hair is hard to curl</li>
    <li> Im more than pleased with my purchase, now Im on the search of a flat iron and I&#x27;ll go with hot tools again just because my wand is giving me great results.  P.D: I think the 1\\&quot; is better for people with shorter hair, I have a medium- short lenght and it works wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! It&#x27;s is really easy to use/handle. You can get many different hair styles in just 20 min or less (it will depend on how long is your hair). No more ends hair burned or damaged compared with clip iron curlers.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t curl very well. I&#x27;ve tried hot rollers, and all my hair does is get sort of wavy. With this curling wand, though, I can easily curl my hair in 20 minutes and have it stay all day long. I would be very VERY cautious with it; it gets extremely hot, up to about 450 degrees, and leaves nasty burns if it touches your skin/scalp. The diameter of this particular wand is perfect. It gives plenty of volume and bounce without making it look like you have those crazy Shirley Temple ringlets. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a great curling wand. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the first curling wand I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I&#x27;ve always used curling irons (with the clip) but when my last one died I started looking at new options.  After watching several videos on YouTube I decided to go with this one.  Initially I planned on getting the ceramic version, but after seeing the reviews about the color coming off of the ceramic I decided to go w/ the gold version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand worked as expected.  I have long fine hair (but lots of it) so I have to use a higher setting since my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl as well when using a wand versus a standard curling iron.  (The method of curling your hair with a wand is different than curling it with an iron, so keep that in mind.)  So I do like the range of heat settings.  Some reviewers said it was too hot for them, so I did experiment with different temperature settings to make sure I didn&#x27;t burn my hair.  ***Make sure you do the same.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord swivel on this wand is a small but genius idea.  Since you&#x27;re already using two hands with this curling method (one to hold the wand, the other to wrap your hair around the barrel), you obviously don&#x27;t have a third hand to untangle the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind the barrel size and desired curl size when selecting your curling wand.  I was looking for a 1&amp;#34; curl so I should have gone up a size since the widest part of the barrel is 1&amp;#34; but it tapers down t about 1/2&amp;#34; inch.  You end up w/ wider curls at the scalp and tighter curls at the ends. Not a bad thing, but since I was looking for 1&amp;#34; curls at the end I need to go with the next size larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wand comes with a heat glove but after a few times I found I didn&#x27;t need it.  Just depends on how good you are at keeping your fingers away from the barrel.  This thing gets VERY VERY hot, so I definitely recommend using the glove the first several times you use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good product.  I&#x27;ve read mixed reviews on the Hot Tools products but I haven&#x27;thad any issues.  After buying this wand I decided to buy a new curling iron I&#x27;m very happy with that product as well.  From my experience with Hot Tools, I would definitely recommend the brand and I receive no compensation whatsoever for saying so.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly like the one that I had at my house. I took it with me to school and ordered a second one for my house so that my mom has one to use and she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> Works great. They are crimpy, wavy curls. I don&#x27;t use a glove.</li>
    <li> The curling iron gets really hot which is great for my hair. It holds a curl nicely. My only problem with this particular iron is the tapering causes for my hair to slip off BEFORE the curl is finished and the barrel is too little short for my hair (my hair falls right below my shoulder blades). Honestly, this is my own fault since I should have researched it more but I am still rating it three stars because this could be a consistent problem for those who have longer hair.</li>
    <li> love it! sells for over 100 in Sallys and works just as good</li>
    <li> We love it !!!! My daughter is very happy with it and i love the price of it more!!!! :) thank you so much ::: The MILLS FAMILY :::</li>
    <li> My wife and the girls enjoy using it. The price is good on Amazon. The heat resistant glove can&#x27;t tolerate the heat of the iron. It meted a hole on the index finger. I guess the iron does produce lots of heat. It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product is true to the description.  I have a hot tools hair dryer and already like the brand.  This curling iron heats up quickly and has a range of heat settings that you can put it on.  It&#x27;s light and easy to use and I get faster at it every time I use it. If you&#x27;re looking for a tapered curling iron, buy this one... it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> Omg! Most amazing thing ever. Ive had this for two years now. And it hasn&#x27;t broke on me yet. But i do have some scars from it. All well. I still love it. It gives the most amazing curls ever. If you know how to curl hair. 😀😊</li>
    <li> AWFUL  Bought this and after 2nd use stopped working- DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!    VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!</li>
    <li> This curling iron curls my hair so well!  Curls normally fall out of my hair but when I curl my hair with this one the curls stay all day and even the next couple of days.  I think it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister&#x27;s birthday, and not only does she love it, i love it too! It heats up very quickly, (like 2 min) and once you get the hang of it you can get beautiful curls in around 30 min! Good buy!</li>
    <li> Delivery was faster than expected, good packaging. This curler leaves your hair with soft waves quite simple to use (if you watch a youtube video) great size!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my curling iron because I had wanted one for so long. When I came around to using it I fell in love. It heated up quickly and curled my hair super fast. I definitely recommend this curling iron to anyone who is iffy about it.</li>
    <li> My wife broke her Conair. She has other curling irons from Hot tools that she has owned for over 10 years. One of these had come with a spare spring which broke at about 9 years. I replaced it and it seems like it will probably work for another 9 years which is why we bought the Hot Tools brand this time. This one didn&#x27;t come with a spare spring which I was expecting, but still I&#x27;m sure it will give her many years of use. The quality is terrific.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron, it gets super hot and gives your hair a great look.  You can do small sections to create a lot of curl or do larger sections for a quick wavy look.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is the greatest curling with heat product I have ever used! I have very long (down to my hip) thick blonde hair and this does the trick! It takes only about 15 seconds on each section to curl and they lasted for 2 whole days! (with sleeping on them overnight!) I could hardly wait 10 minutes to get it out of the box! I absolutely love this curler!</li>
    <li> Super, fast shipping!  The glove that comes with the tapered curling iron comes in handy.  This product does take some practicing but it is so worth it in the end.  I am grateful to the seller for properly, securing the product for shipping.  This product exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and works on hair that doesn&#x27;t keep a curl well. It&#x27;s fast, taking 4-8 seconds to create each curl. The only down side is that there is no bar that clips your hair so you have to hold it with your hand and this can risk one burning themselves (which is why it comes with a special glove).</li>
    <li> I may never have straight hair again. Heats very quickly and the curls last over night; something never previously accomplished.</li>
    <li> These arrived to be literally like 2 days after I placed the order!!! Very impressed and exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter loves the look she gets when she uses this to style her hair. It produces great style and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> A++ Seller! Fast shipping and product just as pictured! Perfect wand curls! Only have to leave it on each section of hair like 5secs.</li>
    <li> Oh My where do I begin? This product was EXACTLY what it says it is! Hot Tools curling wand is my very best friend! The mnore I use it the easier it becomes. I got the item in about 3 days which is GREAT. Some sellers take forever to ship out! Thank you for a wonderful and easy purchase!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this curling iron a few months now and have put it to good use. The tapered end is the best feature of the iron because it produces curls that are larger at the base and tighter/smaller towards the end. Positioning the hair correctly will produce nice spiraled curls, and eliminate scraggly, uncurled ends. You really need a quality heat glove, the one included is horrible, and snags/pulls out your hair as if it were Velcro. I use another glove instead. The iron gets extremely hot which allows curls to last for days, HOWEVER heat junkies beware, this baby will fry some hair. I do NOT reccomend this for daily or periodic use.</li>
    <li> I have straight, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold much of a curl without me putting a ton of product in it. I have always wanted to get those natural like curls to stay in my hair. My hairdresser recommended I buy this curling iron, so I did. And it wasn&#x27;t the right one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not use to a curling iron without and spring clamp, so that was difficult to work, which caused me to burn myself 3 times. Plus since there is no tip at the end I burned my fingers too. My hairdresser told me to wrap my hair around the iron and NOT to close it, which I did. So the clasp just kept getting in the way and didn&#x27;t seem to serve a purpose. After all the burning the curling iron did curl my hair and the curls did stay with very little product. Because I really didn&#x27;t need the clamp on the curling iron it seemed silly to have it. So for my purposes, I returned this curling iron and bought a tapered curling iron from Hot Tools. This is much better for me. It still gives me beautiful curls that actually stay, but because it doesn&#x27;t have the clamp and it has a tip I do not get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do keep this curling iron and you are not use to it, I would HIGHLY recommend practice with it while the curling iron is not plugged in. Half way through curling my iron and after receiving my 2nd burn, I remembered that another reviewer made this suggestion- I wish I would have listened.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my hair. I love the waves and it adds so much volume to my hair. I&#x27;m very pleased with my wand!</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight hair and this curling iron was difficult to use with my hair type.  The middle would curl but the ends would stay straight because I could not wrap the ends around the curling iron.  Not pleased.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved it!  Quick shipping. 100% satisfied!</li>
    <li> Delivered in reasonable time and no damage.</li>
    <li> Head&#x27;s up... no pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t figure out how this was going to work without a clamp to hold the hair to the iron.... and for good reason.  I have medium length hair, cut in layers.  I used the iron for the first time, and I got curls and a huge kink at the end, since you cannot wrap the last inch or so around the iron (you have to hold it straight down to hold everything else in place.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a mess, and looked ridiculous.  Nothing blended, and it was impossible to style.  I rewet my hair to get the kinks out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also... you can get easily burned with this unit.  They send you a glove: DO NOT use it without it, and even with it, be careful.  I think this whole design is not well thought through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have long hair, it might be OK, but for shorter hair, this is not the solution.  I&#x27;m returning the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Great for creating wavy/curly hair :) I&#x27;m glad that a glove came with it, but it isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
    <li> It does a nice job curling and achieves the look I wanted, but we have had to glue the tip back on repeatedly.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful curler. I bought it for my 18 year old daughter and she uses it everyday. I would recommend this to other mothers.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas present, and I love this clampless curling iron!  It doesn&#x27;t leave ridges in your hair. You actually have to wash your  hair to get the curls out! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Maybe I am just inept, but I find using this impossible.</li>
    <li> Loved it works great!!!</li>
    <li> This curler does a very nice job at curing my hair (which is kind of thin and fine, so it doesn&#x27;t normally like to curl very well). I love that it&#x27;s a wand because all of my curls end up coming out pretty uniform, which is nice. That its a wand takes a little bit of getting used to in order to not burn yourself, but its no too hard (I don&#x27;t use the glove it came with because I found it a little too cumbersome and hard to use). The only regret I have regarding this product is that I wish the barrel were bigger because my hair is longer and I would like fuller curls sometimes rather than smaller ones, but its not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> They sent me the wrong item and when trying to return it there is no option to return in the return center. Both options are grayed out and I selectable. I paid for overnight shipping so that I could get this before my wife&#x27;s birthday. What a sham.</li>
    <li> This iron is easy to use. It heats up quickly. Comes with glove to prevent burns but pretty easy to use without the gloves. What  I like is I can set the temp I want for my hair. But the thing I love is that the curls last. I curled my hair one week ago and some of the curliness still remains!!</li>
    <li> This curling rod is the best I have ever used! Perfect size, not to big, not to small curls. Curls look so natural with this and curl so quickly! I even curl my 5 and 6 year olds hair and they get so many compliments! This rod works great with short or long hair. I am VERY happy with this product! The glove it comes with however is pretty useless. I barely touched the tip of the rod once with the glove and it melted and came off on the rod in one second! I dont even use them anymore, they are not necessary at all.</li>
    <li> Love them works really good</li>
