<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> JUST LIKE OEM, AND HOW NICE IT IS TO HAVE AFTER I GOOFED UP AND RUINED MY FIRST PACK WITH BEING TO CHEAP TO CLEAN THEM CORRECTLY. DON&#x27;T DO THAT. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, AND USE THE RIGHT CLEARNER, THEY STAY NEW FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> So i was a few years overdue for this replacement, to say the least. But it&#x27;s like a new shaver, smooth and quiet, just like it was 8 or 9 years ago...</li>
    <li> replacing the foil and blade on my braun shaver, made it feels as good as new; definitely the right move if you&#x60;re nott getting the smooth shaver this razor is known for,</li>
    <li> I think this cutter might be a new design because it made my 8585 much more quiet in addition to giving a better shave than the old worn cutter.  It&#x27;s definitely worth getting a new one every 18 months or so like Braun recommends.</li>
    <li> Amazon.com has been a reliable and convenient choice for online purchases.  I have not had a bad experience, including this recent purchase.  Very easy!</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; foil with Gillette technology is too fragile.  They rarely last two months before they develop a hole.</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement for my braun (Cutterblock and Foil) . The replacement was just as expected , now my shaver is like new!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t review the 8100 foil &amp; cutter since, although that is what I ordered, I received the inferior 51S replacement  And at full price, not the one advertised for the 51S. Not much point in returning it if I have to pay more to  Ship it back &amp; possibly getting a restock charge. I dislike false advertising and bait &amp; switch. And the email shown  On the packing list was totally bogus, too.</li>
    <li> What else can I tell you?  Remember how great a shave you got when you bought it?  Get a new foil+cutterblock and you can get it back!  The manufacturer says to replace them after 18 months but I found 12-14 months to be more accurate - and I don&#x27;t shave weekends either!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the 8585 model for about 4 or 5 years now. I have replaced the cutter and foil several times. Each time the result was the same as a newly purchased razor. However, the last replacement foil and cutter, which came from Goodman&#x27;s, provided a shave which felt mostly like using a serrated edged rusty knife. It appears, by visual inspection, the cutter has been redesigned. The cutter now appears as if the individual cutting elements are wider and not thin blades as in the past. Consequently, the experience is pure torture. The order through Amazom expressly identifies the Braun Activator 8585 series. I was sent the 8000 Series product, which indicates it is for the \\&quot;Series 5.\\&quot; When I questioned Goodman&#x27;s about the difference, they simply stated that it was the same product had been \\&quot;modified.\\&quot; This is no longer the product I have used and respected. It is a piece of junk not worthy of Amazon&#x27;s endorsement, as neither is Goodman&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The foil/cutterblock really makes a difference. I was getting some skin irritation and burns about a month before Braun&#x27;s recommended 18-month replacement period. After replacing, it worked just like new.</li>
    <li> My foil lasted approximatly 6 weeks before developing a hole. Thereafter, I cut my face whenever I tried to use the razor. After a few attempts, I understood the price of a new foil was less than the expected doctor&#x27;s bills if I kept slicing my face. I called Braun Customer Service and reported the problem. They were friendly and offered to send a new cutter block. Within 1 week they had done as promised and even followed up with a letter. Great service, but I hope the new one lasts a bit longer as I very much like the razor. By the way, if you have this problem the number for Customer Service is: (800)272-8611</li>
    <li> My wife bought me the razor two years ago. I change the head about every 9-12 months. It&#x27;s the closest I can get to a regular razor (which usually cause me severe razor burn and pseudofolliculitis).</li>
    <li> After using my original Foil and Cutterblock since February 2005 until the foil worn to the point of a gap appearing, I finally ordered the replacement Combi-Pack. I have to admit that I was being too cheap and now my razor feels like new again.</li>
    <li> As mentioned, this replacement blade does not appear to have a lot of substance to it, but it does make a big difference after 24 months, and I probably should have got it after 18 months, as suggested.    I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This replacement cutter head and foil pack installs with absolutely no fuss in only a few seconds and the result is you&#x27;ll be shaving like your razor was brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get a good year out of my razor on the first set of foil/cutter head, and this is now my third replacement. I have a rather stiff, heavy beard and often shave twice a day, depending on whether or not I have something going on in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last fall I shaved my head bald and have used the Braun Actovator to keep my head shaved daily. This has caused quicker wear on the cutter head and foil and the last foil actually developed a small tear between a couple of the holes in about the 7th or 8th month of use. Once that happened it was impossible to use the razor without getting scratched and looking like I had been in a fight with a small housecat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, once the foil and cutter were replaced again, this is the closest shave I have ever had using a power shaver or razor. Only thing that comes closer is a real blade... and I&#x27;ve used several other reciprocating type razors and rotary shavers, too. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and dread the day that Braun discontinues this replacement set... if they ever do.</li>
    <li> I wanted the exact item pictured, instead I was sent Braun&#x27;s replacement for this item.  The description matches but the part number and UPC&#x27;s are different from the item listed.  The new and improved pack does not work as good on my razor.  I know this because I have already bought two of them this makes the third.  It is not worth the hassle to send it back unless Buy It Now sends me a preaddressed package to send it back in.     Picture, all product ID information needs to be updated.</li>
    <li> I ordered Braun 8000 series Shaver and Cutter Block and I recieved 3 (two too many Braun) and two Remington Cutter Blocks, i.e. 4 too many     I need to return the excess received. They are in their original sealed package    Also, my Clean&amp;Renew(tm)8000 Series has gone bad and needs to be replaced. Can we work an exchange?    Can you take care of this?    George Reppas  gsreppas@pacbell.net</li>
    <li> Product took over 2 weeks from date of purchase to be delivered.  Product was as described and pictured and it works okay.</li>
    <li> My son has been using the Braun 8595 for several years, which afforded him a comfortable shave, and we used the replacement foil and cutter \\&quot;8000 Series\\&quot; Activator during the past years, which was a perfect fit and replacement, like the original. Braun apparently discontinued this foil cutter block, and the new one caused my son great pain and discomfort during his shave!  I had to go out and buy him an entire new system, and am going to try to return the unused, and hopefully the slightly used foil and cutter.  The REPLACEMENT foil and cutter says:  Braun 51S Series 5 / 8000 Series, 360(degrees)Complete, Activator.  If you are at all sensitive, you might not like this replacement!</li>
    <li> It was ok while I had the shaver. Started going through the foils too fast.</li>
    <li> The cutting block is no longer a thick piece of metal.  It is another foil against the outer foil.  When I opened the package 10 months ago and noticed this, I was already concerned.  I&#x27;ve had 10 months now to review it, and the change is not for the better.  The cutter is already worn, and it gets \\&quot;caught\\&quot; sometimes, and sounds like it&#x27;s about to give me razor burn.  It&#x27;s also hard for me to get a close shave compared to the original.  I&#x27;m looking to change my daily shaver because of this bait and switch!  This one will be relegated to travel duty.  Shame on Braun.  I&#x27;ll be looking for a different company&#x27;s shaver.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to receive the item on the 2nd day.....HOWEVER the incorrect item was received.      My order specified Model 8595...NOT 7000 series.  The response time to correct this      was many many many days...my e-mails were not answered...but finally a customer service       associate corrected the mistake and sent the correct item and for me to         to retain the 7000 item (I have no use for this, I would expect a           addressd envelop as waste shuld be the correct...to waste is not                good customer service...as a retired retail exec I would expect                  the item to be returned via your expense...</li>
    <li> The item was fine and as advertised....    Shipping in my option was very high. I could have paid more for the item elsewhere and less for the shipping and saved money.</li>
    <li> I ordered the foil and cutterblock replacement kit because after three or four years of use my foil developed a tear and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in any stores near me.  I didn&#x27;t really want the cutterblock but I was pleasently surprised at the difference it made.  With the new cutterblock and new foil it&#x27;s like having a new razor again.  True the kit is more expensive than I expected but not nearly as much as a new razor.</li>
    <li> my husband dropped the razor cutter block out a car window while cleaning it out while driving....and they thought talking on cell phones was dangerous...I&#x27;m glad they make replacements for this razor.  It still works great.</li>
    <li> For those of you (like me) who have noticed a significant decline in the Braun Activator replacement blades, I decided to take one for the team and try and see if the Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo would work in my Activator. The fit is perfect, and the blade style is of the thinner variety formerly used in the Activator. I had an immediate improvement in shave closeness--with none of the hair pulling of my old replacement blade. If you own an Activator and you&#x27;re about to toss it out because of the terrible quality of these replacement blades, you might want to search for \\&quot;Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo\\&quot; and try my route first. Hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> I would give this foil/cutter zero stars if possible. I took another reviewers advice and bought the Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro/Syncro Replacement Combo and it delivered a very nice shave. This replacement pulled whiskers and was a very bad shave. Braun should be ashamed of themselves for selling such junk.</li>
    <li> Works as expected ... Will replace in a year as is recommended in the book.</li>
    <li> Ordered the replacement part for my husband&#x27;s Braun shaver - package arrived intact,  the parts fit and all is good!</li>
    <li> Worked just like the Originals</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t realize how bad my other blades where, so nice</li>
    <li> My order was placed with Amazon    I received my   Model 8595 foil and cutter block yesterday. The original ones that came with the razor had an imprint of Activator. Not so, this one !!!    If you have a tender skin, then best switch to another brand of razor. My intentions are just that. Two shaves and my face feels burned and the shaves were not close at all.    Up to now, I have enjoyed this razor.Six years of great shaves. It has been pricey but worth it. All finished for me now.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the service I received.  i had the item in less than a week, and it worked extremely well.</li>
    <li> When I emailed Shaver Outlet about this, they replied:    I am sorry for the confusion.  We are a repair centrer and order many parts in bulk.  The parts you received are the exact same parts as the packaged items but without the wasteful retail packaging.    I would have preferred the \\&quot;wasteful retail packaging\\&quot; since it was shown in the picture.  For all I know, they could have sent out refurbed crap.  DON&#x27;T SHOW ONE THING AND SHIP ANOTHER!</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d say anything bad about my Braun 8585 shaver, but the replacement foils and cutterblock have ruined a wonderful product.     Here&#x27;s what happened....I used my original blades and foil for 2 to 3 years.  The shaver gave me a GREAT shave.  Then I replaced those blades with replacement foil and cutterblock.  What a mistake!  Apparently Braun was bought out by Gillette in 2005.  Gillette changed the design of the blades and moved the manufacture of them to China.  Well, now blades that are supposed to last 18 months only last 2-3 months. They are HORRIBLE.    I am so frustrated because it now takes me 3 times as long to shave and the results are just terrible.  The shaver is cutting my face and not my hair.  Yesterday, I ordered a Panasonic shaver because I can&#x27;t afford to replace the blades every 2-3 months and get a crappy shave.      I used to love this shaver.  What a shame.</li>
    <li> Works like an original electric blade/grill. Litte more to say. Opening the blister might be the hard part of changing your shaver&#x27;s blade and . or grill. No tools required for opening and removing your existing blad/grill set. Replace and your shaver shaves as it was the first day. Bye,</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for several years and it is simply the best shaver I have ever owned. The blade and foil need to be replaced about ever year and a half to keep it cutting like new. I always buy this from Amazon and am VERY happy with the price and very reasonable shipping charges. I hope they continue to be available for years to come!</li>
    <li> THIS REPLACEMENT CUTTERBLOCK WORKS LIKE A NEW SHAVER. IT IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE ORDERED IT AND WILL AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband a couple of Christmasses ago.  So far I&#x27;ve bought two foil refills for it.  He loves the shaver, especially the setup where it cleans itself.</li>
    <li> This product is not what it used to be.  I find I am getting less than 6 months use from it, where prior to a year or two ago, I got over 9 months use.  I&#x27;m considering switching to a different product or a different method of shaving.</li>
    <li> As the subject said.  I was hoping to get the product pictured as it is superior in every way to the inferior replacement 51S.  The description also says \\&quot;Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock\\&quot; which is also incorrect.  Everything about this listing is wrong, and you should not buy this.    For what it&#x27;s worth, you can probably get it cheaper from someone else if you want the 51S, by the way.    I always ignore reviews when people shout \\&quot;DO NOT BUY\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m now writing one.  BUYER BEWARE.  DO NOT BUY.  I can&#x27;t believe Amazon lets this go on.</li>
    <li> Replacement parts went together easy just like original. Wore hole in foil upon first cleaning. Product was complete disappointment.</li>
    <li> Has anyone tried using the 8000 series foil on one of the older 7526 series shavers ? Will it fit ?</li>
    <li> I had my 8585 razor for about 2 years and needed to replace the foil and block.  I saw they were selling them here for $30.  I also saw they have refurbished 8585&#x27;s for $59.  I think for an extra $29 I&#x27;d like to have the security of having an extra razor (eg. use for travel) or if the battery or motor dies on one, I can use the other.  Anyway, that&#x27;s my $.02</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected for the replacement for my Braun shaver.  It has worked well and I will need to order another soon because it&#x27;s about that time.</li>
    <li> I purchased a replacement for my Braun three months ago after the original mesh broke and started cutting my face. Guess what, the replacement head is now broken as well. I guess I will buy the third one and start treating this as a more fragile item, but this is definitely not what I expected when paying for a high-end shaver.</li>
    <li> This was my first replacement for this razor that I was so impressed with when I first tried it almost 2 years ago.  It was probably long overdue, but I finally ordered this replacement blades.  It was like I just pulled it out of the box new again. Next time I won&#x27;t wait so long to keep this thing tuned up.  FYI - I don&#x27;t buy the cleaning solution for this. I bought a gallon of denatured alcohol for my local hardware store.  When I need new solution, I clean out of reservoir real good and refill with the denatured alcohol.  I then add a few drops of my favorite cologne.  I change up the fragrance with every refill.  Much cheaper and I get a nice variety of scents.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> My activator is at least 5 years old.  First time I had to replace the foil.  This product matched perfectly and was easy to install.  Now it&#x27;s like having a new razor all over again.  My product arrived on time with no hassles.</li>
    <li> Recieved the unit in a few days. Switched out the heads and foil cover in about 30 seconds and was back in business. Great shave!  I would recommend this product for any one using Models 8595 and 8585. And at half the cost from other sellers.</li>
    <li> I am glad that Amazon offers convenient access to replacement parts for the Braun 8000-series electric razors.  This razor is truly amazing and really does give an amazingly close shave, but once in awhile it is necessary to replace the cutterblock and cleaning solution, and it is great to know that I can order them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this replacement head for my Braun 8585 electric razor. I had used a rotary razor in the past but it irritated my skin pretty bad not to mention razor burn from time to time. This replacement head and foil makes the 8585 work like it was new giving me a close shave in a short period of time and it&#x27;s very easy to change the heads and foil. The company recomends changing them about evry 18 months and that seems to be about the time that the quality of my shave starts down-hill. Being disabled with little use of my hands this razor combination fits my needs better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll keep using them until the razor dies but even then I&#x27;ll replace it with another foil razor.</li>
    <li> The Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock is the replacement needed when your shaver starts to dull.  They say you should replace the foil &amp; cutterblock every 18 months, but I find the need to replace it about once a year.  I think it is well worth it to get a brand new shaver.</li>
    <li> I already reviewed this seller but I&#x27;ll do it again.  Wrong item was sent but the seller went way beyond correcting the transaction.  Excellent seller to deal with... If you have a problem with the item I feel he will certainly make sure of your satisfaction.  I would not hesitate in purchasing from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving system. Replacement blades make the unit perform like new.</li>
    <li> When you need this replacement, it works just fine.</li>
    <li> I found the installation really easy and the shaver is easy to use due to it&#x27;s self cleaning process.  The cartridge&#x27;s utilized is functionally easy to change.  The vendor that I purchased this from was great and the delivery system good.  I will buy this again in the next 6 months or so.</li>
    <li> Definitely replace these parts at least every 12 months. Feels like a new shaver after replacement.</li>
    <li> I shave once in 2 days on average and I have a medium amount of surface area to cover. I emptied and cleaned the razor on a regular basis. I replaced the blade after 18 months exactly and it made a little bit of a difference...cuts a bit faster and quicker. I could&#x27;ve easily used the razor for 6 months more without replacement, but it does cut a tad bit better now.</li>
    <li> This being in effect a \\&quot;spare part\\&quot; replacement, there are no surprises.  The only gripe is about the price, which is exorbitant (cutter &amp; foil over 10% of the whole assembly?).</li>
    <li> It is always a pleasure to do business with Amazon.   Thank You.  R. B. Tilyou</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun 8585 for years...got this to replace the cutter and foil.  I found the shave quality decreased and the blades started pulling whiskers.  Also I was nicked more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally replaced the cutter and foil on my 8585 with this: [[ASIN:B001VH6F9G Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000)]].  It fits perfectly and gives me an excellent shave.  No more pulling, no nicks, and a closer shave.  Definitely the way to renew an 8000-series razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this foil and cutterblock!</li>
    <li> To be fair, I have not tried this replacement product, but I would recommend carefully checking out all the reviews here on Amazon.  One or two negative reviews can be expected with any high volume product, but this replacement foil seems to be a poor substitute. Given the high volume demand for the original, Braun should have had no reason to discontinue the original.  In fact, when I contacted them regarding their reasoning, they referred me to a vendor who supposedly still carried the original but in fact does not.</li>
    <li> All was fine with products I purchased. I just don&#x27;t understand why I was charged for shipping fees.</li>
    <li> Over the last 30 years I&#x27;ve tried 4 or 5 electric shavers. I always had to trash it as it either irritated my skin or pulled the hairs out instead of cutting them out. The Braun 8595 is great! It took several days to get used to, but it has performed like no other. I have used the ole blade once or twice simply because I was on the road and failed to pack my new shaver. I don&#x27;t forget it anymore. I especially like the cleaning each time I use it. Makes me feel that it maintains that sanitary condition.</li>
    <li> I used these replacements for my Braun 8595 and they work fine.  There a number of negative reviews posted here saying that these replacements are not as good as the previous ones but I can&#x27;t tell the difference; they appear to be as good as they ever were.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Braun electric shaver part for 8585 series and it shaves very smooth and the part fit right in place perfectly.Received the part in less than a week.</li>
    <li> This foil and cutterblock is nowhere near as good as it used to be.  Apparently Braun is farming it out to a cheaper manufacturer and it shows....badly.</li>
    <li> Great item, very happy</li>
    <li> I have ordered this item several times. All I recieve is that the item is being delayed for shipment. After several times of this I cancel the shipment. Had to do this several times.</li>
    <li> Product is identical to the original part. &lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this cutter and foil. I&#x27;ve used 5 different electric shavers and this is the only one that cuts really close. Of course it is not the same as a straight razor but this Braun combination is the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I think I was slighly shy of the 18-month replacement cycle that Braun recommended, but my shaves were taking longer and by the time I was done, the shaver was uncomfortably warm to my skin.  I suppose the dull blades were creating too much friction on the foil.  Replaced the cutter and foil and I&#x27;m back to new.  I think I will replace this annually from here on out.  For $30 or so per year, it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the replacement head for the Braun 8000 series. It is the real thing and costs less at Amazon than anywhere else I could find. Free shipping, too.</li>
    <li> The new heads make a big difference with the shaver.  Amazon had the best prices on the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> For an electric razor, this Braun product is pretty good.  It cuts consistently, and can mow down longer whiskers with ease.  Always replace the blade when the razor tells you to, because it does get dull.  The new replacement blades always feel great compared to the old blade.</li>
    <li> The cutter is no where as sharp as the one that came with my razor but I believe it may be the best on the current market.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product fits well with 8000 series shaver. Rates are cheaper then other market place.</li>
    <li> This is not a bad product.  The only concern I have with it is the cost.  I wish it had been in the ten dollar range.  I have no idea how long this new foil and cutter block will last.  My original foil and cutter block lasted for over four years with an average use of three times a week.  Too, Amazon has comparable online prices and ease of shipping and internet securty.  To me, company reputation is extremely important.</li>
    <li> Want to keep you electric shaver investment functioning like new?  These replacements are necessary and do work well.  You don&#x27;t have to change the blades often (18 months) unless you have very heavy facial hair and then I would recommend every 12 months.  You&#x27;ll know when it takes longer to shave than usual; having to over and over areas that used to come clean in one or two passes.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun 8585 shaver since April 2005 and it works well although I have noticed that the shaver heads do not last as long as purported by the company. The head that came with the shaver last 18 months easy, the heads since then that have come on the market are not as good in quality and do not last as long. My most recent shaver head was purchased in June 2009 and already it is worn out and this month is January 2010. This shaver head pulls my hair out without cutting it and it takes sometimes up to 10 minutes to shave. With the pricing and that Braun and retail outlets charge me, I am displease with having to purchase a new one. As of this week, I will need to replace the shaver head because it is worn out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have good things to say about this item I purchased as what I ordered and what I was given by the seller are two different things.  When I challenged the seller on this matter, they told me that the item is no longer manufactured.  Yet, they adverised it on Amazon!  If they don&#x27;t have the item to sell, then you shouldn&#x27;t be listing it on Amazon...</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been reading any of the reviews here lately you will know the 8000 series foil/cutterblock combo has been replaced with a new combo now called the series 5 Combi 51S.  You will receive this replacement even if the picture on the product page shows \\&quot;8000 series\\&quot; as it has been discontinued for over a year.  Braun merged the replacement for the 8000 series (Activator) with the 360 Complete.  This new foil/cutterblock is garbage!  The cutterblock has wide blades, as opposed to the thinner blades of the original 8000 series, which pull your stubble and take MANY passes over your face to shave.  They are prone to premature failure and I have gone through 3(THREE) of these in 6 months!  (I bought one and two were free through Braun after complaining).  All the free replacements in the world weren&#x27;t making the shaving experience any better.  I longed for the days when my Activator 8595 cut smooth, close, and comfortably.  After all, this shaver had been my favorite for 6 years so far!  I was very close to dumping the whole shaver and moving on when I happened across a reviewer on Amazon who suggested using the 7000 series replacement foil/cutterblock in his review.  It worked PERFECTLY!  The 7000 series replacement looks just like the much coveted original on my 8595 Activator - down to the thinner cutting blades!  It didn&#x27;t pull my stubble, it cut smooth as butter, and was comfortable: JUST LIKE NEW!  I&#x27;d like to thank the original reviewer (James L. Walls \\&quot;sixtoe\\&quot;) for the very good advice.</li>
    <li> The new design for this replacement blades is a bit different than the original but just as good in my opinion.  I have not had any adverse effects since replacement.  Actually, the last original blade replacement I was able to obtain broke after 6 months.  I will continue ordering this each year.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer recommends replacing the foil screen and cutter block every 18 months for maximum performance. I wholeheartedly agree. This cutting system seems to last a little longer than older models but it certainly doesn&#x27;t last forever. While it might not be exactly at 18 months, you can readily tell that the blades are getting dull when it takes longer to shave and/or you begin experiencing skin irritation. The set is pretty expensive but Amazon.com seems to have a very competitive price (a lot cheaper than I&#x27;ve seen in any brick &amp; mortar store). Having said that, it really is like getting a brand new razor each time you make the change so it&#x27;s very worthwhile doing it. Not sure if you can even buy them separately, but changing both parts at the same time ensures a closer shave with less skin irritation because they work together as an integrated system.</li>
    <li> Not matter how often you replace them (within reason), it&#x27;s still cheaper than disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Pretty simple. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I ordered parts for my razor.  They came, I installed them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WHy didn&#x27;t you ask for a review when I bought a book, through you,from an associated seller and never received it?  I asked about it and you emailed me telling me it wasn&#x27;t your problem, because someone else was selling the book.  Never got the book or my money back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bob Bisaillon</li>
    <li> My husband says the shaver is great and he has had no probelms as of this time.</li>
    <li> This the best razor i have ever used, i received it as a gift from my daughter purchased from amazon about a year ago. I would recommend this razor to any man who want a close shave. Andthe replacement paart about once makes it like a new razor.Thanks amazon for good service on getting parts R.E.Wilcox</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had the Braun 8595 for about 18 months now, so thought it was time to change the cutterblock and foil. Didn&#x27;t think it was going to make a difference, but boy, it certainly did. Recommend it - even if you clean the thing every day, it makes a lot of difference to the cut.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer is correct! DiscountJungle wants to charge $10.11 to ship this item! Ridiculous! I can walk a couple blocks to Walgreens and buy it for the same price as the total + shipping from these folks. Forget it! But I do like the razor system!!</li>
    <li> I think the replacement of the cutting blades is good, but a little pricey considering you already spent close to $200 on the shaver.  Also you need to replace about every 4 months with normal use, I think they should last a little longer than that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The foil is good as well but I have dropped my shaver a few times and it has punctionered every time.  This is frustrating at this price... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, this is the best facial shaver on the market right now so I guess I am locked in.  The power of planned obselesence.......oh well!</li>
    <li> Am I the only one having this problem?  These foils aren&#x27;t lasting me more than a few months.  And, no, I don&#x27;t push the razor hard against my face, I use it at a 90 degree angle, and I don&#x27;t have an abnormally thick beard.  I&#x27;ve used Braun razors my whole life and for some reason my 8595 goes through foils like nothing else.  I&#x27;ve even had the entire cutter unit (motor) replaced under warrenty just in case that was the problem.  Personally I think the problem is in the design of the foil as the thinner mesh just isn&#x27;t as strong as the previous design.  Is anyone else having this same experience?  Is the newer 360 model any better?</li>
    <li> I buy nothing else, never fails to deliver.  I strongly recommend it without hesitation.Just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it, you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Anthony</li>
    <li> made a big difference.</li>
    <li> 18 months per set is impossible.  These need to be replaced every 6-8 months to maintain the quality of shave.  My screen wore through in 8 months. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is probably the most expensive shaving system on the market. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> My Braun electric shaver uses this cutter and foil.  Its instructions suggest that they should be changed every 18 months.  If you want to keep getting a reasonably quick, close shave, I&#x27;d recommend doing it once a year.  I&#x27;m getting a MUCH better, MUCH faster shave with the new cutter and foil.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not really much to say about this product.  It&#x27;s the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and so the replacement parts can be no worse.  The best part about purchasing it here was that the price was $10 below any local stores and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> The Braun Shaver with this foil and cutter gives a close and comfortable shave.  The one shortcoming is that the shaver signals for a replacement foil and cutter well before the 18 month lifespan of the cutter.  Since my Braun continues to function well, I am leaving the current foil and cutter on the shaver until I have reason to replace them.</li>
    <li> I like it because it works just like new and one get a close shave without the irritation that comes with it; however, i do have a problem when cleaning it manually since the cutterblock does not separate from the foil and so i have to try over and over again until they separate. but overall it is a great replacement.</li>
    <li> Purchased a new Braun shaver cutter and foil for my shaver   and received it in about 6 days. The package arrived as it  was ordered and fit perfectly. No problem any where and I  was pleased completely with Amazon.Com.  Thanks a lot.    R.S.Sweeney  Houston,Texas  March 31,2009</li>
    <li> I had the same experience as the fellow who wrote the July &#x27;06 review.  I ordered the part in the first week of May &#x27;06 to only have it delayed 3 times for shipment.  I just got another delay notice from Amazon today, July 10.  At this rate they&#x27;ll never ship the item.    If they can&#x27;t ship, why in the world do they list this item???      UPDATE: Amazon finally shipped the product after the 3rd delay.  Replacing the screen/cutter restores the shaver to like-new performance.  Overall I find the Activator to give a decent shave with minor irritation.  Using a William&#x27;s Lectric Shave helps even more by reducing irritation to nearly zero, lightly lubes the screen/cutter and keeps the screen reasonably cool to the touch.  My previous screen did last about 19 months so the longevity (in my case) is excellent.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent replacement item. The seller also did a great job of getting it to me.</li>
    <li> The replacement of your old (18 months plus) foil and cutterblock is like getting a new shaver.  I had let mine go longer than the 18 months, but can assure you next time I won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Yes it is worth to change that cutterblock, maybe not a quickly as the shaver tells you but once you feel its just not the same as it was when new.</li>
    <li> This did not change my shave much at all. I should not have spent the money. I thought it would make the shaver like it was when it was brand new. Sadly this was not the case.</li>
    <li> Has made a 4 year old Braun 8585 Electric Razor perform as if I had just taken it out of the box- at 1/6th the price of a new one-</li>
    <li> The electric razor works like new, now that we have the replacement package for the correct model.  We are very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> The Combi-pack foil and cutter block are replacement parts for Braun&#x27;s Activator Razor.  The product is excellent.</li>
    <li> OEM products at great prices.  This helps defer the ongoing costs of keeping the shaver system up to date.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun Activatio 8595 for approximately 3 years and have replaced the foil and cutterblock twice now.  Each time it is like having a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery.  This is the second of these replacements I have purchased, and I&#x27;m back to being clean shaven again.  It seems to be about an every 18 month or so ritual, but so pleasing once replaced.</li>
    <li> I buy one of these every two years to keep my razor feeling brand new.  It really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Great Blades.  They fit my Braun Activator 8595 perfectly.  It cuts like new again.  Bought from Essex Technology Group, shipped extremely quickly.  Got them in about 2 days.  Free shipping too!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few places I can find replacement parts for shavers and is also the cheapest place.</li>
    <li> It is always nice to get what you need at your front door!</li>
    <li> The factory replacement parts make this razor like new again.  Pleased with what I got for the money spent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...turned a very dull razor into one that&#x27;s like new. Great service from Amazon, too!!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor believing it was one of the best for my husband who has had a massive stroke.  The blade had to be replaced after a very short time and the replacement purchased here was worse than the original one.</li>
    <li> I really like my Braun Activator razor but was thinking about replacing it with a new one when the foil cracked after a year or so of daily use. While researching I decided to try replacing the foil and cutter block as a cheaper alternative. Other than the long delay from the time of my order to actual shipment the order process went smoothly. The replacement parts snapped right in and the razor is back to like-new performance. A bit expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I replace my blades and foil every 13 months.  In this case, Amazon.com had the best price.  I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
    <li> This product was as dull as my 1 year old cutter block! Vendor was fantastic but I think he needs to review his supplier (from China).</li>
    <li> Bought this because my shaver was telling me I needed a new one, and the shaver was running slow even after a full charge.  Changed it out, shaver is still slow but this improved the shave (no grabbing of whiskers as it cuts).  I think the batteries are dying on the Braun 8585, and between shipping and repair costs for replacing batteries at Braun, I might as well just get a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Combi-Pack itself was great, I had no problems with it at all.  Just be aware that Braun changed their numbering system on their replacement products so don&#x27;t panic if it doesn&#x27;t say 8000.</li>
    <li> Was a loyal Braun user for over 3 decades but their decision to re-design the cutter on the replacement units has forced me to ditch my still functioning shaver (and remaining Clean and Renew cartridges) for a rotary Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased two replacement foil/cutters for my Braun synchro in the last 8 months since they don&#x27;t seem to last more than 3-4 months before getting dull and before the cutter was changed, I was able to go 12 months before replacing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the negative buzz about this product is about - related to these replacement parts not working very well - they work great for me! I ignored the negative reviews and went ahead and ordered this product.  After replacing the foil and blades this weekend and shaving, my shave was MUCH MUCH closer and smoother than with my 2 year old blades and foil.  Yes - this replacement foil is different from the original foil that comes with the Activator 8595 (or 8500 series, I guess), but it still works great for me.  I kept my old foil, just in case- I don&#x27;t think the foil needs replacing half as much as the blades do.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the Braun 8000FC as indicated by the picture and on the invoice (if you buy).  This is Braun&#x27;s replacement #51S and it SUCKS!  The cutter blade design has changed and it does not shave anywhere near as clean as the older design.  I&#x27;d purchased these hoping to get the original design but was shipped the 51S.  Just know and understand what you&#x27;ll be receiving if you choose to buy!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had an issues and this product does what I need it to do.  I stil get a nice, safe shave and that is really all that is needed.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original foil and cutterblock, but then I&#x27;m echoing a 1000 or more others who share this experience.  SHAME ON BRAUN for NOT DELIVERING the SAME HIGH QUALITY EXPERIENCE to those who (after investing over $200) have the audacity to expect a close, comfortable shave when they dutifully replace cutterblocks and foils and spend a lot of cash for cleaner (which amounts to scented denatured alcohol and mineral oil at 60X the price of the components!!!)</li>
    <li> This is an expensive foil and should last more than three months. With out notice you feel cuts and see that the foil has a small hole and jagged edge that cuts.</li>
    <li> This is the worst replacement I&#x27;ve ever purchased for a product I own. I have been a happy 8585 owner for years, with the razor and its replaceable parts provider the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. This new horrible replacement block has torn up my face and made shaving a nightmare. I&#x27;m trying the 7000 replacement as advised here. Braun made a terrible mistake. I don&#x27;t know how I could trust them again.</li>
    <li> These worked just fine for YEARS. i bought them repeatedly until they were removed from the market. ALL the replacement parts currently on the market appear to be GREATLY INFERIOR. This is Braun trying to raise profits by lowering their manufacturing costs (while keeping the sales prices the same). Several other reviewers have stated that Braun was bought out by some other company, so i guess that&#x27;s the explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What changed: The cutter and screen both changed, but it seems to me and to other reviewers that the cutters are the real source of the problem in the new version. This older GOOD version had two rows of circular metal rings and cut wonderfully for well over a year. The new one that replaced this part being reviewed here is one sheet of stamped metal and has fewer cutting surfaces. Cheaper to make, but sells for the same price or more than this superior discontinued product.</li>
    <li> OEM part operates as expected.</li>
    <li> The product was a genuine Braun replacement cutter blade, the quality is excellent, and I get my moneys worth out of it. Delivery was fast and easy to order, extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what type of werewolf hairy faces that some of these reviewers have but I have used this replacement block and foil for a week now and have no complaints at all!  No, it is not the same replacement parts that I have recieved previously from Amazon for my Braun razor but these work much better than the ones I am replacing.  Not to mention the alternative of buying a new Braun razor!!  I dont have a very hairy face, but I don&#x27;t see where there would be a problem for those with more facial hair than I.  Buy this with confidence... and the satisfaction that you just saved an awful lot of money not having to replace your very expensive Braun!</li>
    <li> My razor is as good as new. I didn&#x27;t realize how overdue I was for a new blade.[[ASIN:B0002MQ9GK Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock Replacement Parts for Braun&#x27;s Activator Razor Models 8595 and 8585]]</li>
    <li> As other folks have already mentioned, you will not get the Braun 8000 Activator foil package but the Braun 51S, which the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I failed to read the reviews and ordered because I thought I&#x27;ll get the original 8000 foil, as the add and image showed.  To my disapointment, I was sent 51S.  The seller refunded my $$$ so all I lost was time dealing with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you really want the 8000, don&#x27;t bother as you will not get it.</li>
    <li> The current seller, Discount Jungle, is trying to charge $10.11 to ship this tiny item that weighs a pound or less! This is a TOTAL RIP-OFF in my opinion; one that boggles my mind! They must hope their customers are too stupid to notice the artificially inflated S&amp;H since they&#x27;re saving so much on the item&#x27;s retail price. Amazon needs to look into this matter and ditch them as a seller if they don&#x27;t correct this blatant, money-grubbing nonsense!!!    EDIT (06/02/06): I see my review last month has done what needed to be done. Amazon has replaced Discount Jungle with a new seller, Ace Digital Club, who are charging approximately $6 more than the previous seller&#x27;s price of $28.95 for the same item. Whereas Discount Jungle wanted to rip me off with $10 S&amp;H for an item weighing less than a pound, Ace Digital is only charging $5.09 to ship it to me. However, the higher price point means they are NOT a better deal than Discount Jungle, LOL. Can&#x27;t win for losing!    There is absolutely NO POINT BUYING THIS ITEM THROUGH AMAZON if these two sellers are the \\&quot;best\\&quot; they have to offer. I can get it cheaper (after Ace&#x27;s S&amp;H charge) by walking into any Walgreen&#x27;s (or if buying online, they offer free shipping for orders over $50). What the hell? I thought buying things online from Amazon was supposed to be cheaper than retail? In the case of this item, it clearly is not.    EDIT (6/16/06): Wow! I&#x27;ve done it again. Now Ace Digital is now gone as a seller. I hope Amazon finds a vendor who can actually sell this item at a reasonable discount even after S&amp;H. It&#x27;ll save me a trip to Walgreen&#x27;s, LOL.    As to the product itself, I&#x27;ve had to replace the stupid foil twice on my Braun 8585 since I bought it fourteen months ago. The first foil broke within two months! The second foil has lasted almost a year. I thought these things were good for 18 months? Never had this problem with any other razor, but I do have a tough beard. Other than this, the 8585 has worked well, but the cost to maintain it with cleaning fluid and new foils is a bit exorbitant.</li>
    <li> I waited and waited for this to come back into stock at amazon but could wait no longer so I was forced to purchase it at a retail location at full price.  I will buy it next year from amazon. &lt;br /&gt;I bought the 8595 last May from amazon and love it, with this replacement it is like having a whole new razor, I love it!</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever purchased. Have been using Braun electric razors for several years. Prices are very competative on Amazon.com. Less that what I would have paid locally if I could have found the Foil and Cutterblock for the Activator.</li>
    <li> Replacement blades don&#x27;t really seem to help that much on other electric razors I have used.  But, the Braun instructions say to replace the foil and cutter every 18 months.  When I finally replaced mine (22 months) it was amazing how much better the razor worked.  It was really like getting a new razor.  It runs much smoother and slip along my aging skin like silk again.  If you have one of these Braun razors and find it is not a smooth and comfortable as it once was, the Foil and Cutter refill may do the trick for you.</li>
    <li> It works just like the original parts... ha ha ha!  Just fine.</li>
    <li> The replacement parts worked very well. The only thing I wish that was included was a new plastic cutter protector. The razor is now working just like new.</li>
    <li> Obviously it is always good to get original manuafacturers parts. But having had the shaver for two years, I had always been scared away by the $30 price tag I was seeing in stores for this item. Since Amazon was considerably less, I splurged. I was amazed how easy it was to swap out the parts. I changed the head and foil in literally less than 10 seconds. I have always been impressed with the Braun system, and I am now equally impressed with the replacement package.</li>
    <li> I had delayed getting a replacement for my cutter and foil for nearly a year after the recommended every twelve months.  I had forgotten how much better the razor cut with the new edges.  Definitely should have gotten them sooner.  They are certainly worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I had to replace the original foil and cutterblock on the Braun shaver I purchased 2 years ago. The shaver is now back up to performing as it did when it was new. So far, nothing but praise for the Braun products I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Shaver Blade Kit  Probably as good as or better than when new.  Really fine.</li>
    <li> I believe Braun has changed the way they make the new replacement cutters and foil heads for the 8000 series razors.  The older ones had grey plastic clips on the ends and the new ones have black.  I have purchased three new sets in four months and all three have lost a clip off of the end.  This causes the foils to vibrate.  It is a very noticable change in the sound when turned on and the quality of shave is greatly reduced.  I have used this razor for three years and never had this problem.  I used the last replacement head two times before it broke.</li>
    <li> Seems whenever I need a replacement foil, it&#x27;s because the one I have has failed so I need a replacement fast. This purchase was no disappointment.</li>
    <li> Great service. Great product!</li>
    <li> Was not the item pictured on this page. Fits but does not shave as well as the correct model. Avoid!</li>
    <li> This the second time I have replaced the &#x27;wear&#x27; parts in my Braun Razor after many years of service and I expect it will last and perform well as I continue to maintain it. You notice a big difference when you install these new parts.</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun razor for years and show how much I like the razor by choosing to continue using it by purchasing the Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock Replacement Parts.</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement after so many years of wear.  At first seemed a bit pricey, but if it lasts as long as the razor it should be great!</li>
    <li> Does not performance as well as original parts in the shaver.  Must be a knock off pieces and not OEM replacement.</li>
    <li> price is 17.00 too high.(free shipping!?, uh, its not really free)</li>
    <li> the item was great, just as advertised&lt;br /&gt;just what I needed to replace the old one I had&lt;br /&gt;worked better than new</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve had this wonderful razor for about a year and a half it it was time to switch out the foil and cutterblock.  When I first switched out to the replacement parts, I could immediately tell the difference, both good and bad.  I could tell that the cutter block was really sharp and cut through my thick beard.  The bad part was the fact that the foil kept grabbing my longer hairs and pulling them.  Tip for everyone! If you have this same problem, try turning the foil around.  The part fits both frontways and backways.  Ever since doing this, no problems!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with Braun electric models since early 1980&#x27;s.  They were great products then, but their foil/cutter durability has degraded badly under Gillette, now P&amp;G (they should give away the shavers, since they are really selling high-margin disposables.)  The thin foil and cutter are now designed to wear out rapidly: I shave carefully, have moderate beard growth, but still only get 4 to 5 months from a foil before it breaks and nicks.  Forget their 18 month change suggestion--it won&#x27;t last that long.  If you don&#x27;t mind the high expense of consumables, the 8000 series does provide a very clean comfortable shave while the foil is new.  I find shaving quite fast in the first month, considerably slower by 3rd month, then watchout for foil failure and nicks.  If you want durable performance, get a Norelco rotary.  When a Braun foil breaks, I use a 1960&#x27;s vintage Norelco triple-head.  It still works just fine, and only costs electricity since the cutters last several years in daily use on my beard.  Its downside is manual cleaning, and a shave (old cutters/thicker foils) not quite as close as a new Braun foil/cutter.  It also takes a little longer than a new Braun foil/cutter to get a good shave, but it&#x27;s faster than a 3-4 month old Braun f/c.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like getting a new shaver again. Really worth buying. Tip: you can buy denatured alcohol at the hardware store for the cleaning cartridges..just refill it yourself after washing it out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Store the alcohol safely!</li>
    <li> These are Braun&#x27;s own replacement parts for these shaver models and work very well, making the shaver feel like new when you use it, and lasting as long as the original parts.</li>
    <li> the shaver is a great shaver but the blades dull very fast. the replacement parts make it work like new.</li>
    <li> The item was received in new condition, as advertised, and well within stated timeframes. I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> After almost 2 years of not changing the blades (I know, especially since I need to shave everyday), I can&#x27;t believe how great the shaver is after replacing the blades.</li>
    <li> It lasted almost 24 months on my shaver. Maybe those who say this foil is fragile are a bit rough on their shavers? This is a precision instrument and it has to be handled appropriately.   I am very satisfied with mine and believe this is the best shaving system in the world.</li>
    <li> These are just the same as what came with your razor.  You shouldn&#x27;t have any issues whatsoever.  Much cheaper to buy this once every 12-18 months than to keep buying POS-on-a-stick &amp; cutting yourself.  Either way shaves just as well...that is to say, not quite as good as high quality shaving equipment which most ppl don&#x27;t even know exists :)</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed that the foil part of the shaver got a hole in it less than two weeks after he replaced it. The last foil he put on lasted around a year.</li>
    <li> This is my third replacement cutter/foil combo since I started using the Braun Shaver in Jan. of 2006.  I replaced the first set on schedule after 18 months of use but the second set only lasted 12 months when the foil wore through and began nicking my neck.  I really can&#x27;t blame the quality of the product as I shave every day and have a thick growth.  A year of service is very good when you consider the amount of work it does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 8595 for over two years now.  It&#x27;s worked very well without anything falling apart on me.  I previously had gone through two Remingtons in less than one year.  Braun recommends replacing the cutterblock every 18 months but I let it slide to 24.  I definitely have noticed a little improvement over shave time.  Don&#x27;t feel that you need to replace the cutterblock in exactly 18 months... if you&#x27;re not having any shaving irritation or note any significant delay in shaving time, delay your purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun shaver for more than 10 years.  This current model is my 3rd and I love it.  The replacement foil and cutterblock keeps me looking good with a close shave for months into the future!  And the automatic cleaning keeps it sharp and lubricated for flawless operation!  The best part is there is no shaving cream or endless disposable razors and blades to put into the enviroment!</li>
    <li> It came on the day it was estimated. The product holds its quality. Good buy and will come back for more when needed.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day for shaving.  Braun is a very special product in my house hold. The products were delivered on time.  Thank You</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price. What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> I have owned a Braun 8585 series electric shaver since 2007.  It is the BEST shaver I have ever owned.  I have been using replacement Blades from Braun and from Amazon every year since I purchased this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased replacement blades this year, as I always do, once a year.  I was sent 5 series blades.  At first I thought it was a mistake, but they fit my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using these blades for less than 4 months and they are DULL, DULL, DULL.  They do NOT shave like blades I&#x27;ve received in the past and it is becoming a TORTURE DEVICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have to spend 20+ minutes every morning shaving to get the desired results and my skin is left red and tender every day.  The blades pull my beard and it is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the quality of the blades has been compromised, but I have to tell you, I have to replace these blades in less than 6 months of use and THAT is NOT right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be hesitant to order these blades.  They do not last long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun shaver for about 3 years now. Each year I always buy the replacement foil/cutter parts.  Recently I purchased the foil/cutter parts. I&#x27;m actually shocked that after only a few weeks and not shaving everyday, that the foil part is already broken. In other words, a piece of the metal on the foil is sticking up making it impossible to shave with.</li>
    <li> I purchased this replacement kit instead of purchasing a new razor.  This will add several more years to the razor.</li>
    <li> exact replacement part, excelent price</li>
    <li> Braun replacement part package arrived quickly;  The parts reconditioned the razor making it &#x27;brand new&#x27; again. Braun 8000 series razors are a great product.</li>
    <li> Made my old Brawn razor work like new. This is a little pricey, still worth the purchase. But it is cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> Ah - smooth shaves again. Cutter blocks and foils last a long time on Braun shavers, and this replacement helps my shaver continue it&#x27;s great job.</li>
    <li> I buy this replacement head for my old Braun 8500 every year, they are less expensive then the recommended one and last longer.Recommended</li>
    <li> My husband had been using the same shaver for 7 years without replacing blades and foil.  He really needed the part replace as the foil was broken in one spot and it would catch in his skin.  He looks so much better now that he has a new shaver component.  He says it&#x27;s like having a new shaver. He&#x27;s been a Braun man for 35 years!</li>
    <li> This is an exact replacement for this shaver.It needs to be replaced at about a one year interval. Every shave is about the same.</li>
    <li> Does not shave as well as prior versions.</li>
    <li> Great to give new life to an old electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and is a better price on Amazon than in town.  Win-win!  The Braun shaving system is matchless for perfect, nick-free shaving.  I love that my man uses it!  New foils and cutters make the shaver perform like brand new and last about a year.</li>
    <li> This ad is deceiving. You think you are buying the original high quality Braun 8000 series replacement when you are actually buying the more recent lower quality Braun Series 5 Combi 51s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They show you a picture of the original. Tell you there are only 9 left. At the bottom they let you know there is a replacement blade but it&#x27;s deceivingly unclear that you are actually buying the replacement and not the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cancelled an order with another vendor for the replacement because I wanted the original.  I actually paid $5 more.  Bad seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case the replacement works in my razor. It&#x27;s just not the product I thought I was buying.</li>
