      <li>I am pleased</li>
      <li>Also I received free shipping which was another bonus!  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>it makes it a much better experience and will help you get through the time.  </li>
      <li>So from then on, I put either the top or bottom in seperately--which helped, but did take up a lot of time.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Plus free shipping, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
      <li>I have used DayWhite by Discus Dental with absolutely no problem and very happy with whitening effect.  </li>
      <li>It is the perfect product for periodic touchups, and it costs less than if I purchased from my dentist.</li>
      <li>This is a huge plus for me.</li>
      <li>So cheap compared to buying it from the dentist.</li>
      <li>Same great results.</li>
      <li>Brush your teeth with water only and you will see great results.</li>
      <li>I chose the rating of 3stars because this product is very powerful.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product and love that it didn&#x27;t bother my overly sensitive teeth!!</li>
      <li>I bought this product from my dentist originally.  </li>
      <li>You should also do daily treatments for 2-3 consecutive days for it to be most effective.</li>
      <li>I use this every 2 weeks and it brightens clean teeth.  </li>
      <li>I used this product once a day, and it took me a couple weeks to use it up (since I didn&#x27;t use it every single day) and got great results.  </li>
      <li>I wore them for two weeks, and my teeth are bright and white.  </li>
      <li>I was not too happy that my gums were bleached and extremely irritated by this product.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>Maybe more people have gotten sensitive to the \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula and that is why they give out the \\&quot;Bonus Sensitivity Gel\\&quot; with the 14% product???</li>
      <li>whenever I smile.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been use Discus Dental for years with no problem, no burning or sensitivity, and incredible fast and comfortable whitening, i.e. wear (either 38% twice a day for 2 days is usually all I need unless I want super white teeth).</li>
      <li>Although it took longer than some of the other reviews, my smile is amazing.  </li>
      <li>First of all DayWhite and NiteWhite are registered trademarks of Discus Dental and the image shown here (blue and white) looks remarkably like the NiteWhite sold by Discus Dental.</li>
      <li>This product, Day White, always cost me much more at my Dentist</li>
      <li>I received this item thinking it would be exactly like the one I received at my dentists office.</li>
      <li>It seems to be exactly the same thing for a much better price.  </li>
      <li>I first got this at the dentist after i got and completed the invisalign.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Zoom Night White formula, but I like the day&lt;br /&gt;White formula better.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, I thought it was odd when I saw the name Phillips, but was in a rush and ordered anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It certainly does whiten your teeth as stated.  </li>
      <li>to squirt out without shooting a large amount out at once&lt;</li>
      <li>I started to search information regarding Hydrogen Peroxide vs the Carbamide Peroxide in the other teeth whitening gels - which are also a higher percentage; I thought it was better.  </li>
      <li>Whitens very well.</li>
      <li>Product was very watery.</li>
      <li>and of course, my gums are still very tender and very sore.</li>
      <li>It works really well after a pro dental cleaning too</li>
      <li>Service was fast and efficient.  </li>
      <li>it foams up to much for my liking.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Very noticeable difference after every whitening session, and MUCH cheaper than what</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t as much tooth sensitivity as with the NiteWhite.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Awsome product, I really like how fast it works.</li>
      <li>The trays are quick and easy at your dentists, and regular use of this product will make you look younger.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased the same product from my dentist for $100!</li>
      <li>The Carbamide Peroxide gels have to break down into Hydrogen Peroxide before it works and this take about 15-20 minutes and is only 1/3 the strength of good ol&#x27; H2O2.  </li>
      <li>Doctor&#x27;S Nightguard Classic, 1 Box]].  </li>
      <li>Great bleach as long as you keep in for about a half hour each day !!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I used this products for two weeks and did not really notice a huge difference in the &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; pictures I took.  </li>
      <li>I only smile at people with sunglasses on</li>
      <li>My teeth didn&#x27;t really get sensitive from using this like they have in the past with the strips, it was my gums that hurt the most.  </li>
      <li>but we have since started carrying a new brand.  </li>
      <li>also it was free shipping and came 3 days early than expected.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had the gel foam in my mouth, however it only lasted about a minute.  </li>
      <li>no zingers and pretty white teeth</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product.  Works just like the same product I bought directly from my dentists office.  I have tried 2-3 different types of teeth whitening treatment and this is by far the best one yet.  I highly recommend this product.  Great results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from my dentist originally.  It seems to be exactly the same thing for a much better price.  I am satisfied.  I have had problems with sensitivity, but this kit contained a product to reduce this.  I have not used it but if it works as well as the Zoom,  I will be very happy with the brightener.</li>
    <li> Just like what the dentist sells but for cheaper. Same great results. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Definitely removes the morning coffee stains</li>
    <li> I received this item thinking it would be exactly like the one I received at my dentists office. A note was even included with my order stating they provide top quality products to their consumers. Well the syringes that came in my package work VERY poorly, they get jammed and the product solution oozes out so much its wasteful. One syringe is supposed to last up to 9 uses and mine has lasted maybe 3. Because the syringes work so poorly my teeth are not getting whitened properly. I believe the good products are being sold at the dental offices and the crappy ones are being sold online. What a TOTAL disappointment.</li>
    <li> I used this products for two weeks and did not really notice a huge difference in the &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; pictures I took.  To use, I put this gel in the  [[ASIN:B0036WTV2W Doctor&#x27;S Nightguard Classic, 1 Box]].  The first time I tried it, I put both the upper and bottom guards in at the same time--BAD idea....I was drooling all over the place because the guards were too big in my mouth and  a lot of the get just got wasted.  So from then on, I put either the top or bottom in seperately--which helped, but did take up a lot of time.  I didn&#x27;t even use the Sensitivity relief gel, so I cannot comment on weather or not that even works.  I did use Sensodyne toothpaste while using this product though, so that may have help to curb some of the pain that I would have had.  My teeth didn&#x27;t really get sensitive from using this like they have in the past with the strips, it was my gums that hurt the most.  My gums also got bleached and seemed to receed from my tooth a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So like I said, I did take before and after pics and didn&#x27;t notice that big of a difference.  I had higher hopes, but the pro&#x27;s don&#x27;t outweigh the con&#x27;s enough for me to use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Difficult to squirt out without shooting a large amount out at once&lt;br /&gt;-Cap likes to pop-off randomly&lt;br /&gt;-Bleaches the gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Did whiten teeth a little</li>
    <li> Not as good as we though</li>
    <li> Would not order again....the quantity they tell you to put in the trays does not come close to what you actually need.</li>
    <li> works but I didn&#x27;t realize this formula was a daily touch up - next time will order differnt %</li>
    <li> Just used for second time and see noticable difference.  Too bad I got ripped off at dentist at $44 for ONE syringe.</li>
    <li> This product, Day White, always cost me much more at my Dentist and I was so pleased to discover that I could buy this through Amazon at quite a saving!  Also I received free shipping which was another bonus!  Service was fast and efficient.  Will purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> If you like black licorice flavoring and foamy whitening gel, this product is for you! It tastes bad, I have to spit foam out of my mouth every few seconds. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;15 minute application times are close to impossible.</li>
    <li> Great product. Family friend uses this and her teeth look amazing, I want mine to look like hers and I know they will because I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I can see a difference already. Love it, YEA! Should add that it did make my teeth a little sensitive but that only lasted about two days. I will purchase more of this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed with NO sensitivity.  After 4 uses, my teeth were as white as when I had them done by a dentist for $500.00. I absolutely love this product and love that it didn&#x27;t bother my overly sensitive teeth!! I am very happy with it :-)</li>
    <li> Great bleach as long as you keep in for about a half hour each day !!</li>
    <li> Use them every couple of days and can tell a difference in my teeth. I will buy more of these when I run out</li>
    <li> The stuff is not fun to have in your mouth. With the foaming and bad taste you may not do what is recommened and fail. Like others posted don&#x27;t use toothpaist when brushing before hand. One trick I&#x27;ve used is using the product as tooth paste. Again the taste isn&#x27;t good and the foaming will accure. Well for that I bought spray mint. Spray it on your tounge prior and after. Most (Scope&amp;#34;outlast&amp;#34;/ binaca) will over power the bad taste. after Brushing w/product use the tray method for the aloted time. Again spray breath mint into your mouth. it makes it a much better experience and will help you get through the time.  Works fast and you can see a noticable difference in a few days !!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I was looking for at a great price. Plus free shipping, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> So happy that i found this online. So cheap compared to buying it from the dentist. I&#x27;ve used this product before from my dentist and it really does make your teeth white! also it was free shipping and came 3 days early than expected.</li>
    <li> I got this same product from my dentist @ a $10 increase. I am pleased but I did purchased the wrong percentage. I should&#x27;ve got 22%.</li>
    <li> My dentist charged me $150 for the same product, I incorrectly assumed this was a prescription product.  I&#x27;m very glad I found this product on line.  I used this product once a day, and it took me a couple weeks to use it up (since I didn&#x27;t use it every single day) and got great results.  I do get a little tooth and gum sensitivity, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  Get custom trays from your dentist which you can use for serveral years, and each year buy this product to keep up your great results.</li>
    <li> This works and you only need to use it for 30-45 minutes per treatment.  You should also do daily treatments for 2-3 consecutive days for it to be most effective.</li>
    <li> This Zoom Day White gel works great to whiten my teeth! I&#x27;ve tried the Zoom Night White formula, but I like the day&lt;br /&gt;White formula better.  The bleaching trays go in your mouth twice a day for 15-30 minutes.  I wore them for two weeks, and my teeth are bright and white.  They look fantastic!</li>
    <li> I paid the dentist a fortune for his whitener but it was ineffective. This day white product was supposed to be stronger-use 2x a day for 15 MINUTES. I used it over an hour and it too was ineffective. I am 74 and it did NOT work for me</li>
    <li> BEST AS BEST CAN BE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PURCHASED MORE THAN FOUR TIMES AND ALWAYS HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN</li>
    <li> recommended to my friends</li>
    <li> Same as what you get from the dentist office for 1/2 the price. I have a little sensitivity but nothing stopping me from using it. One 3 pack will give you noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I read the review of the purchaser who was burned by the daywhite product and went out to the discusdental.com web site and I saw that it converted to phillips.com.  So, I did some research and found that Phillips bought out Discus Dental.  So, not sure if they changed the product or why you had sensitivity but that&#x27;s what happened and why Phillips&#x27; name is on the product. Maybe more people have gotten sensitive to the \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula and that is why they give out the \\&quot;Bonus Sensitivity Gel\\&quot; with the 14% product???[...]</li>
    <li> Just what my dentist gives me and a lower price! Works great! No problems!</li>
    <li> Great product, I use them all the time.  They whiten my teeth without irritation to my gums, if you follow the directions properly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have used it previously and was in need of a touch up.  I did not have a problem with sensitivity, and I do have sensitive teeth.  I do wish they would find a better way to cap the applicator tip, as it seems as though the gel continues to slowly seep out even with the cap on, and often there is a bit of wasted product.</li>
    <li> Perfect leaves teeth beautifully white</li>
    <li> Works great. This is the best whitening I&#x27;ve ever had. I first got this at the dentist after i got and completed the invisalign. You will not find this any where else for this price!</li>
    <li> The best piece of advice for using this product is to ignore the instructions that state to brush your teeth! At least with toothpaste that is. I did three sessions of whitening after I brushed my teeth with toothpaste (25 mins, once a day, back to back days) and barely noticed a difference. I then cleaned my teeth by flossing and rinsing my mouth out with water and then bleached. I immediatly started to see the results by using this method. My teeth were scary white by the third whitening method of not brushing me teeth before bleaching my teeth. My teeth were just stained by drinking coffee but this bleach blasted those stains away. So my advice is to not to brush your teeth with toothpaste before you bleach. This leaves your teeth with a layer of fluoride and the bleach cannot penetrate your teeth fully. Brush your teeth with water only and you will see great results.</li>
    <li> I only smile at people with sunglasses on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several whitening products and found this one to be above average. As with any tooth whitener you must be careful not to put too much gel in the tray or you will burn your gums. I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> This is basically the same product that I got from my dentist for post-care after my teeth were whitened. It is the perfect product for periodic touchups, and it costs less than if I purchased from my dentist.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!  Very noticeable difference after every whitening session, and MUCH cheaper than what my dentist office charges for the same product.  Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> This product will reverse months of coffee and tea stains on your teeth pretty effortlessly as long as you have had a set of trays made. The trays are quick and easy at your dentists, and regular use of this product will make you look younger.</li>
    <li> Saw no results:/ very disappointed</li>
    <li> Only have to leave it on for 15 minutes. This is a huge plus for me.</li>
    <li> Phillips Zoom really works good, however, the only problem I have is sensativity in one area which gets exteremly painful hours later. I use the additional sensativity activator but it doesn&#x27;t seem to mask the pain for me. I absolutely love the results and suffer through the pain!!!</li>
    <li> I used this along with sensodyne. no zingers and pretty white teeth whenever I smile. everyone notices my teeth in pictures.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 10 different brands&lt;br /&gt;This one works great and doesn&#x27;t taste bad&lt;br /&gt;Seems to sink in and dissolve as it works</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth especially with teeth whitening products.  After using this one time I noticed results and after 3-4 times using it I have zero sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Whitens very well. Recommended by my dentist at 2/3 of the price.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Phillips Zoom Daywhite. I was not too happy that my gums were bleached and extremely irritated by this product. Did not notice any difference in whiteness either. I will not buy this product anymore. I have used DayWhite by Discus Dental with absolutely no problem and very happy with whitening effect.  I will remain a faithful customer of Discus Dental.</li>
    <li> I whitens the teeth. I will be ordering again. There isn&#x27;t as much tooth sensitivity as with the NiteWhite. Overall, I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This even works on &#x27;old teeth&#x27; (65).  Although it took longer than some of the other reviews, my smile is amazing.  Looks like I spend hundreds at the dentist to get them white.  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and did not use toothpaste before whitening.  Highly recommend this product.  The anti-sensitivity additive works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using Day White for years but this product was a water downed version. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Great product! I originally purchased the same product from my dentist for $100! I use it with custom fit trays and the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the product I received from the dentist.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t go as far as before and seems very strong irritating my mouth. It also was much more expensive  than the last time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt that I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My first package of Day white only lasted me three months, not 9 months as stated on line.  It certainly does whiten your teeth as stated.  My teeth are as white as a sheet and I&#x27;m a smoker and coffee drinker of at least 6  cups of coffee a day.  So if its only the whitening that your interested in do buy this product.  If you want this product to last you nine months, don&#x27;t buy.  It does become quite expensive after a while.  Now I only whiten when I have an event to go to. Not an everyday procedure.  All in all I feel that the product is quite costly but it&#x27;s a good trade off because of the great job it does whitening my teeth.  Zoom  Nighttime does not work as well as the Daytime type. I had to leave it on longer and it didnt work half as well as the Daytime zoom.</li>
    <li> I chose the rating of 3stars because this product is very powerful. You cannot use it for more than a couple of days as your gums will get irritated. However they did include something to put on your gums to help ease the discomfort.</li>
    <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t totally yellow but they were starting to look pretty worn down and have a tinge to them.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product after having a dentist do a teeth molding and this stuff is off the chain!!!&lt;br /&gt;Today is Monday. I&#x27;ve done 3 treatments a couple days apart since last week and my teeth are frikin white!&lt;br /&gt;Awsome product, I really like how fast it works.</li>
    <li> I use this every 2 weeks and it brightens clean teeth.  It works really well after a pro dental cleaning too</li>
    <li> First of all DayWhite and NiteWhite are registered trademarks of Discus Dental and the image shown here (blue and white) looks remarkably like the NiteWhite sold by Discus Dental. The product I bought doesn&#x27;t look like the image, which to me is incredible insulting! To be honest, I thought it was odd when I saw the name Phillips, but was in a rush and ordered anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 60 seconds, my tongue started to burn like crazy! I kept wiping it with a wet cloth. It made me wonder what it was doing to my gums for the 15 min. I was wearing this product so I kept wiping my gums also with a wet cloth to absorb any overspill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprise, surprise, here I am the next AM and of course, my gums are still very tender and very sore. I have an interview coming up and did want to whiten my teeth, but I&#x27;ll be interviewing with less than white teeth, I can&#x27;t endure the burning and irritation of my tongue and gums which I&#x27;m still dealing with the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been use Discus Dental for years with no problem, no burning or sensitivity, and incredible fast and comfortable whitening, i.e. wear (either 38% twice a day for 2 days is usually all I need unless I want super white teeth). Needless to say, after completing this review, I&#x27;m going to throw the rest of this product in the garbage and order Discus Dental DayWhite. I&#x27;m hoping they have their lawyers on the case for these company infringing on their trademark!</li>
    <li> Good price. Reliable delivery. Cost Saving</li>
    <li> Product was very watery. It tended to run out of custom tray and down my throat. Gel totally gone from trays after about 2 minutes or less.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by a dentist time ago. I started to use this product 2 years ago. I have recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been whitening my teeth for at lease 13 years.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve had the gel foam in my mouth, however it only lasted about a minute.  I received this identical product from my dentist for $60 for a tray of 3 syringes.  I started to search information regarding Hydrogen Peroxide vs the Carbamide Peroxide in the other teeth whitening gels - which are also a higher percentage; I thought it was better.  The Carbamide Peroxide gels have to break down into Hydrogen Peroxide before it works and this take about 15-20 minutes and is only 1/3 the strength of good ol&#x27; H2O2.  After a lot of educating myself and speaking with my dentist, I always opt for this product.</li>
    <li> Bought for hubby. He says it&#x27;s works well. Sensitivity not too bad. Will buy again</li>
    <li> love this product!  I&#x27;ve used it before - I work at a dental office and we used to sell this product but we have since started carrying a new brand.  I prefer the Philips zoom and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Its ok for the price.  it foams up to much for my liking.  I will try another brand when this on is used up.</li>
