### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>Great ingredients I have research the ingredients and all are great for the dht stop and the minoxidil for regrowth.</li>
      <li>It worked great for two days and now it will not foam.  </li>
      <li>I am really happy that I did.</li>
      <li>When I went to my hairstylist about a month ago he mentioned that he was seeing a great deal of scalp.  </li>
      <li>Foam Fusion minoxidil is a great product that I have been using over the course of nine months.</li>
      <li>This is great product that I have been using for my hair loss regimen.</li>
      <li>Product has an impressive list of ingrediants that are proven effective in tresting hairloss.</li>
      <li>The product is great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m amazed at all the good ingredients that was included in this minoxidil foam, I see they&#x27;ve done their research.</li>
      <li>Seems to work good.</li>
      <li>Good scent though</li>
      <li>The product and ingredients are great but the foam pulp doesn&#x27;t work and mostly liquid comes out.</li>
      <li>The combination of Minoxidil and DHT blockers make this the best product out right now for growing hair.</li>
      <li>She pointed out this really inexpensive product and said that it had wonderful results.</li>
      <li>My wife told me that it didn&#x27;t bother her easier, but she didn&#x27;t miss my nice hair.</li>
      <li>Heard so many good things about it can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
      <li>Much more effective at stimulating hairgrowth than minoxidil by itself.  </li>
      <li>It is very comfortable to use because it is in form of foam.</li>
      <li>For all helpful ingredients that are included, the price is pretty fair, as opposed to purchasing all the products separately to make your own minoxdil mixture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m convinced that with all the great ingredients, it&#x27;s at a minimum stopping my hair loss, and I&#x27;d have to use it more regulary and consistently to witness any notable hair regrowth.</li>
      <li>I lost even more hair than before.</li>
      <li>Not so sure yet on growing more hair....</li>
      <li>That probably explains why I lost more hair when I switched from Rogaine to Vida Cora.    </li>
      <li>I was told this will be safe.</li>
      <li>I would give it more than five star </li>
      <li>it was more scalp skin.</li>
      <li>Can tell a difference, stopped hair loss for sure.  </li>
      <li>Ordered Vida Cora foam to replace Rogaine foam and it stimulates the scalp better than minoxidil alone.</li>
      <li>This is more like a foam hand soap.</li>
      <li>Most reviews are paid by seller.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and feels refreshing, excellent replacement for standard Minoxidil foam.</li>
      <li>Very professional company with a great pedigree of health and beauty.</li>
      <li>Dries up easily.</li>
      <li>Also this product is so easy to use as it is in foam form.</li>
      <li>Foam is easy to apply and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply too.</li>
      <li>btw, the smell is okay and goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>Great product only 3 months in</li>
      <li>I decided to give this one a shot on a whim because it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>Although I just starting using the Vida Cora it gives me a great feel this product will work.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aside from being more effective, the other nice thing about it is that it doesn’t take a combined half-hour to put on all of the products I used to use.</li>
      <li>I normally go a bit over board, but the instruction for this said more will not do better.</li>
      <li>I will say that I did notice &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; beginning to appear after about 1 month, and within the 3-4th month I started to get excited of the possibilities.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see this product.</li>
      <li>This is my third bottle I am using and is pleasant smelling.</li>
      <li>Having all the drugs in a single product is great.</li>
      <li>Stay with Rogaine, it is clean and super easy to use and works far better.</li>
      <li>This was ok for me because I don&#x27;t mind spraying it into the cap then using a dropper to apply the liquid directly to the scalp.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t know how effective it will be.</li>
      <li>But I surprisingly haven&#x27;t had the itching and redness that I had with the Rogain, it may be simply due to the foam formula.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it more effective than the minoxidil I have used in the past, but the ingredients have a proven track record</li>
      <li>I mean come on, every 5 star reviewer uses damn near perfect spelling, grammer and punctuation including capitalizing Minoxidil and the product name everytime.</li>
      <li>I also had very intense unbearable scalp itch.</li>
      <li>I been using this product for 7 week now, and I am super happy with the result, have plenty small new hair all over.</li>
      <li>(Approx 3 months) with pretty irregular use, (1x a day, 4-5 times a week before bed).</li>
      <li>I will follow up after several more months of use.  </li>
      <li>I used many different minoxidil products before.</li>
      <li>I would say it has done about the same or better than Rogain.</li>
      <li>Funny to see that most of the positive reviews have female names...</li>
      <li>Also it is more effective than other similar product.</li>
      <li>First I would like to state the shipping is unreal, fast, secure and packed professional.  </li>
      <li>I gave a couple of other popular products a try, but none of them really worked.</li>
      <li>Probably a good product though I did not see results that were out of the ordinary.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quick (prime member) as far as growth, I&#x27;ve been using it off and on</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would recommend sticking with this product for longer then a few days or weeks to get similar results, like I&#x27;m sure many do because they lose their patience.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing what will be there in another month.</li>
      <li>but I can tell you that I am not losing much hair since I started using it...</li>
      <li>Foam is much easier to distribute evenly and cover areas needing treatment,,,I</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I was seeing lots of new growth about 1/2 way through my first bottle.  </li>
      <li>Product is easy to apply and dried fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m being realistic, of course, but I plan on using this AS DIRECTED (twice per day) for as long as I can notice significant regrowth.</li>
      <li>Had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a high quality minoxidil foam that does not seem to leave my hair sticky after use.  </li>
      <li>It is simple as well as an effective addition to my other hair loss products that I use.</li>
      <li>I am surprised to see how much residue sitting at the bottom of the bottle, which makes me think most of the ingredients didn&#x27;t go into solution and were wasted.</li>
      <li>Pain in the ass trying to apply twice a day if you normally style your hair.</li>
      <li>My significant other told me that she wouldnít love me any less if I was bald, but it was still a mark on my pride.</li>
      <li>It came back right away when I tried it again.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth yet.</li>
      <li>At first, I was only using Vida Cora once a day, which stopped the thinning; however, when I began using it twice a day, I benefitted from new hair growth.</li>
      <li>The product is extremely customer friendly explaining ingredients and how to apply.</li>
      <li>My barber even noticed that some of the thinner spots were filling in more than in the past.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see its full effects, but the initial process is far easier than most other products on the market.</li>
      <li>First of all, the foam starts to liquefy on your palm once it is out of the bottle, so a significant amount of product goes back to liquid and wasted on the palm.</li>
      <li>The product goes on clean and a slight tingling feeling.</li>
      <li>So clearly my chest pain was caused by this product.  </li>
      <li>My face looks 10 years old than before.</li>
      <li>and I prefer my products all natural and unscented anyways.</li>
      <li>Hair loss has stopped but too early to tell about regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
      <li>Now I am back to Rogaine, thanks god, without any sides.</li>
      <li>Before using Vida Cora, I noticed excess hair loss while shampooing (in my hands), which has completely stopped while using this product.</li>
      <li>Although it takes a little longer to dry than most solutions, it is easy to apply and caused little irritation.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell you the regrowth success yet</li>
      <li>main concern with the product, and the only ingredient I disagree with and would like Vida Cora to discontinue use of is &amp;#34;fragrance.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are true not only for Vida Cora’s minoxidil, but also for Vida Cora other products like Carcinia Cambogia and phytoceramide.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product, contains Minoxdil and other ingredients that help to slow down hair loss.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was excited to see this product. But it turns out to be garbage. First of all, the foam starts to liquefy on your palm once it is out of the bottle, so a significant amount of product goes back to liquid and wasted on the palm. Secondly, when the foam is applied to the scalp, it stays as foam forever so my scalp is covered with foam for a long time.  It looks like someone does not rinse the hair properly after washing the hair with shampoo. Last but not least, it leaves a lot of white residue on my scalp after it is dry.    Rogaine has none of these issue. In addition, I just finished one bottle. I am surprised to see how much residue sitting at the bottom of the bottle, which makes me think most of the ingredients didn&#x27;t go into solution and were wasted. That probably explains why I lost more hair when I switched from Rogaine to Vida Cora.    Stay with Rogaine, it is clean and super easy to use and works far better.</li>
    <li> I used this product for one week, switching from Rogaine foam.  Now I wish I had never made such a stupid decision.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is really dangerous. I had chest pain on the third day of using it. The chest pain was cleared after I stopped it for 2 days. It came back right away when I tried it again. So clearly my chest pain was caused by this product.  Now I am back to Rogaine, thanks god, without any sides.</li>
    <li> At first, I was only using Vida Cora once a day, which stopped the thinning; however, when I began using it twice a day, I benefitted from new hair growth. Before using Vida Cora, I noticed excess hair loss while shampooing (in my hands), which has completely stopped while using this product. Furthermore, unlike Lipogaine, Rogaine, and Kirkland Minoxidil, Vida Cora does not have that foul odor that emanates from your scalp throughout the day.</li>
    <li> When i first received the bottle I was skeptical.  I had tried other solutions without any effectiveness, and figured I&#x27;d give this product a shot.  Although it takes a little longer to dry than most solutions, it is easy to apply and caused little irritation.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see its full effects, but the initial process is far easier than most other products on the market.</li>
    <li> Not really a review of the product itself but the pump itself... It worked great for two days and now it will not foam.  I took the pump part apart and cleaned it and it still doesn&#x27;t work.  Too bad... Had high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at all the good ingredients that was included in this minoxidil foam, I see they&#x27;ve done their research. For all helpful ingredients that are included, the price is pretty fair, as opposed to purchasing all the products separately to make your own minoxdil mixture. It was strange that the product didn&#x27;t come out as a foam any longer after about a month, but as a liquid. This was ok for me because I don&#x27;t mind spraying it into the cap then using a dropper to apply the liquid directly to the scalp. As for results, it&#x27;s always hard to tell. I&#x27;m convinced that with all the great ingredients, it&#x27;s at a minimum stopping my hair loss, and I&#x27;d have to use it more regulary and consistently to witness any notable hair regrowth. With that being said, the bottle has lasted me a long time (Approx 3 months) with pretty irregular use, (1x a day, 4-5 times a week before bed). Maybe it&#x27;s wishful thinking but I read somewhere that the retinol included in the product may make using the stuff once per day viable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern with the product, and the only ingredient I disagree with and would like Vida Cora to discontinue use of is &amp;#34;fragrance.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve read that this stuff is no good and I prefer my products all natural and unscented anyways. Thank you for the product and I hope Vida Cora continues to do their research and continually improve the product. (E.g. adding caffeine, panthenol or other efficacy improving ingredients)</li>
    <li> First I would like to state the shipping is unreal, fast, secure and packed professional.  The product is extremely customer friendly explaining ingredients and how to apply. The product goes on clean and a slight tingling feeling. Although I just starting using the Vida Cora it gives me a great feel this product will work. Great ingredients I have research the ingredients and all are great for the dht stop and the minoxidil for regrowth. Very professional company with a great pedigree of health and beauty.</li>
    <li> I used to use a host of hair loss products to combat my hair loss. I had mixed results with the mixture of products. That is the reason I tried Monoxidil foam fusion. After just a few weeks I had already starting noticing a difference. After the second supply I used I went ahead and threw out my other hair loss products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being more effective, the other nice thing about it is that it doesn’t take a combined half-hour to put on all of the products I used to use. I can use this product in just a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I was depressed when my hair started falling out. My significant other told me that she wouldnít love me any less if I was bald, but it was still a mark on my pride. I gave a couple of other popular products a try, but none of them really worked. I decided to give this one a shot on a whim because it was so cheap. I am really happy that I did. My hair is growing back and I am not as depressed about it as I was before.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for 7 week now, and I am super happy with the result, have plenty small new hair all over.</li>
    <li> Very good product. The combination of Minoxidil and DHT blockers make this the best product out right now for growing hair.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I went in with little expectations, and 3+ months later I am noticing quite noticeable regrowth from entirely bald areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend sticking with this product for longer then a few days or weeks to get similar results, like I&#x27;m sure many do because they lose their patience. I will say that I did notice &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; beginning to appear after about 1 month, and within the 3-4th month I started to get excited of the possibilities. I&#x27;m being realistic, of course, but I plan on using this AS DIRECTED (twice per day) for as long as I can notice significant regrowth.</li>
    <li> Great product only 3 months in and I&#x27;m already seeing results. Gives me confidence I lost when my hair started going away. I will definitely be ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all.  Its like using water in your hair.  I don&#x27;t know whats up with these other ratings but I fell for it.</li>
    <li> The product is great. I am new at using the product, so I haven&#x27;t really notice results that usually take up to 3-6 months. The thing that isn&#x27;t going well is the bottle that it is placed in. The product will leak out of it if on the side and the pump jams up.</li>
    <li> Funny to see that most of the positive reviews have female names... All ingridients are proven to fight hairloss, however the consistence of the liquid is too thin to have so many ingredients.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a try despite the warning by the other one star review. I have used Vida Cora Minoxidil Foam for 3 months.  I lost even more hair than before. My face looks 10 years old than before. Not sure what is in this crap.</li>
    <li> I like how it smells. I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth yet. Pain in the ass trying to apply twice a day if you normally style your hair.</li>
    <li> Used Rogaine foam before. I thought this is the same thing with additional ingredients. Wrong! This is more like a foam hand soap. It is extremely messy to use. It is 100 times worse than Rogaine. Most reviews are paid by seller.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and feels refreshing, excellent replacement for standard Minoxidil foam.</li>
    <li> Ordered Vida Cora foam to replace Rogaine foam and it stimulates the scalp better than minoxidil alone. I will continue to use this product !</li>
    <li> Arrived quick (prime member) as far as growth, I&#x27;ve been using it off and on but I have seen a difference in the volume in my hair. From now on I shall use as directed and update with results. Would purchase again though! btw, the smell is okay and goes away quickly. Good scent though</li>
    <li> The product and ingredients are great but the foam pulp doesn&#x27;t work and mostly liquid comes out.</li>
    <li> HAIR HAIR HAIR !&lt;br /&gt;Okay! Pause and listen up. I stumbled upon this and decided to give it a shot based on other rave reviews-and I don&#x27;t always do this. But after trying a lot of different hair restoring products and hair regrowth program and do it yourself at home treatments-I decided to give this a shot. I normally go a bit over board, but the instruction for this said more will not do better. So, I followed the instructions and I noticed &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; hair sprouts not that faint peach fuzz stuff you get with other products if you are lucky-within a month. My barber even noticed that some of the thinner spots were filling in more than in the past. I can feel some hair growth wear it was more scalp skin. I have even noticed my hair line and temple areas filling in with growth. I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing what will be there in another month. If I could afford it, I would order this stuff by the cases. TRY IT!---YOU MAY LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months now.  I would say it has done about the same or better than Rogain. But I surprisingly haven&#x27;t had the itching and redness that I had with the Rogain, it may be simply due to the foam formula. My thinning hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse and it may have thickened up some. My only complaint is that after about a week the foam bottle quit working so I just used a one that we had laying around for soap.</li>
    <li> Foam is much easier to distribute evenly and cover areas needing treatment,,,I mean the bald spot...I mean thin areas. I just started with the product so I don&#x27;t know if it more effective than the minoxidil I have used in the past, but the ingredients have a proven track record...time will tell. I will do a follow up in a couple months to see how the product works over time.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s less irritating then Rogaine has been. This is the only product I have found that uses several different approaches (DHT blockers combined with Minoxidil). Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I got so dizzy after using this for one well. I once fell on the ground and almost killed myself.</li>
    <li> Can tell a difference, stopped hair loss for sure.  Not so sure yet on growing more hair....</li>
    <li> Great product, contains Minoxdil and other ingredients that help to slow down hair loss.</li>
    <li> Probably a good product though I did not see results that were out of the ordinary.  Unfortunately the pump top malfunctioned and would not foam the product anymore- making it useless for me as I bought it for the convenience of a foam, and did not have a dropper bottle on hand...</li>
    <li> This is great product that I have been using for my hair loss regimen. This is my third bottle I am using and is pleasant smelling. Actually has like mousse effect and hair appears thicker. I use this together with Viviscal and have seen improvement in my hair regrowth. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bald spots on my scalp for a long time. I got used to it, and it never really bothered me. My wife told me that it didn&#x27;t bother her easier, but she didn&#x27;t miss my nice hair. She pointed out this really inexpensive product and said that it had wonderful results. I was intrigued after reading some of the reviews, and decided to try it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little while, and I&#x27;m starting to see hair grow where there was none before. I am no longer used to seeing my bald spot. Instead, I am getting used to the sight of hair where there was none before!</li>
    <li> I have had problem of loosing hair and I was getting bald. At the age of 28. My girlfriend is was not liking it. I started using variety of products from last 2 years. Finally one of my friend recommended me about this products. And here are the results. No more loosing hair also can notice new growing hair on my scalp. Finally I can grow my hair long. Also this product is so easy to use as it is in foam form. No more mess. Dries up easily. I use it every night before bed. As directed on the product. I would give it more than five star </li>
    <li> I had recently bought a product at Walmart for this purpose.  It  was a liquid and was miserable to use.  I saw this product for sale on Amazon and decided to try it.  What a difference!!  I have had hair loss after each of the surgeries I have had. My doctor says this happens to some people and I am one of the &amp;#34;lucky&amp;#34; ones!  This product goes on so well and cases me no aggravation.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell you the regrowth success yet but I can tell you that I am not losing much hair since I started using it...Yeah!  I will let you know in a few months how things are.  Do not be afraid to use this.  It says it is just for men but instead of using it twice a day, I use it once.  I was told this will be safe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 month. Hair loss has stopped but too early to tell about regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;Like the 6oz bottle except for traveling. Foam is easy to apply and non-greasy. No scalp problems.</li>
    <li> Foam Fusion minoxidil is a great product that I have been using over the course of nine months. It is simple as well as an effective addition to my other hair loss products that I use. The only complaint I have, is after about a couple of weeks of use, sometimes the product is no longer foamy and I therefore have to use a dropper to extract the product from the bottle.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does seem annoying to have to use this twice a day for basically forever. However, in the end, after seeing the results of 4+ months of continued use, it does pay off. Hair regrowth is noticeable and hair in thin areas is visibly thickened (for the most part). Even if hair growth is tediously slow, stick with it and remember twice a day everyday!</li>
    <li> Foam works product into hair much easier than other non-foam Minoxidil products. The product contains all the ingredients proven to stop and replace hair loss so only time will tell.  I will do a follow up review in 90 days to see how well it performs.</li>
    <li> Seems to work good. It doesn&#x27;t leave any build up or film in my hair. It&#x27;s easy to apply too.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s a high quality minoxidil foam that does not seem to leave my hair sticky after use.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product contains every over the counter medication that has evidence based research to back up the hair loss prevention claims. Having all the drugs in a single product is great. The only problem I have had with the product is the bottle it self, the pump mechanism failed and I have had to purchase a separate foam dispenser.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the other 1 star reviews before I bought  this crap. I used many different minoxidil products before. Rogaine liquid and foam, Costco minoxdil, Walmart and Walgreen minoxidil. You name it.  I never had any side effect. I was fooled by the fake reviews of this product.  After using this scam Vida Cora minoxidil for 2 months, I lost at least 2 years of hair gained by other minoxidil products. I also had very intense unbearable scalp itch. I am not sure what this seller put in this product. But I know it is not a safe product.&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t write any review. But I am so pissed off this time</li>
    <li> I was interested in buying until I started reading all the fake 5-star reviews. I mean come on, every 5 star reviewer uses damn near perfect spelling, grammer and punctuation including capitalizing Minoxidil and the product name everytime. Little sketchy!!</li>
    <li> I just received my second bottle of Vida Cora&#x27;s Foam Fusion Minoxidil.  I was seeing lots of new growth about 1/2 way through my first bottle.  Unfortunately, I became lazy and did not continue with the product. When I went to my hairstylist about a month ago he mentioned that he was seeing a great deal of scalp.  Whoops!  That evening I started using the product twice a day.  The baby hair is returning-thank goodness!  I will not be skipping using it as directed!</li>
    <li> Product is easy to apply and dried fairly quickly.  Much more effective at stimulating hairgrowth than minoxidil by itself.  Product has an impressive list of ingrediants that are proven effective in tresting hairloss. After one month of usage existing hair appears healthier.  I will follow up after several more months of use.  Maureen E</li>
    <li> All of the reviewers have similar review pattern. One can see that they either reviewed this product alone; or together with one of Pura D’or products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the reviews have similar writing and content, all being about two or three sentences long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the timing of when the reviews were posted is noticeably odd. There were 10 reviews in August of 2014. There was not a single review posted for the following three months. Then suddenly there were close to thirty Five-Star reviews posted in the middle November 2014!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are true not only for Vida Cora’s minoxidil, but also for Vida Cora other products like Carcinia Cambogia and phytoceramide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For myself, I used the product on and off for two months, I had severe allergy with big hives on my skin that I never had with Rogaine foam. I also suffered headaches that I believe derived from using this product. Granted, I did not believe the headaches came from this product initially. But it went away whenever I stopped using this product, and returned when I restarted the product. I am not sure how someone can sell such a toxic product on Amazon without prescription.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one moth and half. It is very comfortable to use because it is in form of foam. Also it is more effective than other similar product. You can see the changes after one month if you use it based on instructions.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it works yet it&#x27;s only been a week.  It does take a bit of time to dry so put it on first thing when you wake so it can dry before you leave the house. It has a faint scent not good not bad. I know this says it&#x27;s only for men but my dermatologist was the one who said to use the men&#x27;s strength because it&#x27;s stronger.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t know how effective it will be.</li>
    <li> Just got this product.  Heard so many good things about it can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
