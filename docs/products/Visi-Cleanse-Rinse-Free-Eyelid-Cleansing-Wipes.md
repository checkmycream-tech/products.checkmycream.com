      <li>I tried the other wipes and these by far are the most effective.</li>
      <li>After first using a Visi-Cleanse wipe, I use a couple of drops of Bion Tears</li>
      <li>Love these and use them daily!</li>

      <li>Anyway,I have EXTREMELY sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>I was getting eye inflammation frequently and these wipes have solved the problem.</li>
      <li>The second feature is they are very MOIST, we never have to rinse afterwards.  </li>
      <li>During the fall, my eyelids were very itchy and became swollen and dry.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that when my eyes are irritated, dry, or my vision is slightly blurred, that what is AROUND my eyes is most likely the cause and not what may be IN my eyes.  </li>
      <li>mild and thick so one patch will do the job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They work OK but like the Flents Rinse Free Eyelid wipes better</li>
    <li> These cleansing wipes are gentle and effective. I was getting eye inflammation frequently and these wipes have solved the problem.</li>
    <li> These wipes are thick , feel good and don&#x27;t sting. They are a bit pricey if you need to use them every day of the year.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning dirty eyes of your pets.</li>
    <li> Love these and use them daily!</li>
    <li> If I could rate these higher than five stars, I would.  I suffer from Blepharitis, Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, dry eye, have gone through lipiflow, and have had Pterygiums removed from both eyes so I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different eye wipes.  These are the best by far!  The pads are thick and soft.  They have just the right amount of moist without being sloppy soapy like some wipes or too dry like others.  They are gentle on my eyes.  I had no trouble cleaning around my eyes after surgery with these.  When I do wear eye make-up, these are great for removing the make-up at the end of the day.  This is now my go to eyelid cleaner and I have no interest in using any other.</li>
    <li> During the fall, my eyelids were very itchy and became swollen and dry.  I tried these wipes to cleanse them.  They were very gentle and soft.  I used them for about  a month and my issues cleared up nicely.  I would recommend them for anyone who has issues with flaking or sensitive skin on the eyelids.</li>
    <li> These wipes are thick and I can use 1 wipe for both eyes.  I don&#x27;t have to rinse; very convenient.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and if any product does not work, my eyes will know. This is a really good product. It does take eye make up off but if you use gel eyeliner, it may be a little stubborn to wipe off. I just use a tissue afterwards to wipe of the residue.</li>
    <li> I use these wipes on my eyelids and around my eyes during long hours at the computer and after makeup removal.  I&#x27;ve found that when my eyes are irritated, dry, or my vision is slightly blurred, that what is AROUND my eyes is most likely the cause and not what may be IN my eyes.  These wipes are very soothing and refreshing and, unlike another product I tried due to a lower price, they&#x27;ve never burned my eyes.

    <li> This is the easiest, most gentle product I have used on my eyes. The wipe comes in an easy to open package, and is particularly great when traveling. I am always concerned about rubbing my eyes with any type of harsh substance or material and these visi-cleanse have been the perfect answer to my concerns. I really have nothing but good things to say about this product. In addition, we live in Canada and the shipping was fast and convenient. We will definitely order again when our supply runs out!</li>
    <li> After years of irritated, itchy, teary, burning eyes due to Blepharitis, I have finally found a lid wipe that aids in cleansing away the offending debris that causes it.  I LOVE these wipes and would recommend them to anyone with the same problem.  I used to use a cleansing routine that called for baby shampoo, which was recommended by my Ophthalmologist; however, since starting on Visi-Cleanse, I can never go back to that less-than-satisfactory method.  I also use an eye drop called Bion Tears by Alcon.  After first using a Visi-Cleanse wipe, I use a couple of drops of Bion Tears and I&#x27;m then good-to-go for the rest of the day.  My eyes feel great!</li>
    <li> I cannot articulate how happy I am with this product.  What an excellent, effective product.  Great price too!  I tend to have crusty eyelids due to blepharitis on a daily basis and this wipe (which is thick, moist, and gentle on my skin) is a godsend.  This product is very simple and easy to use.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Recommended by our Opthalmologist for blepheritis. easy to use and no stinging for us.</li>
    <li> I will continue to use the rest of the box, I will see if they produce results, time will tell. Finished the box... not as effective as other brands, too mild for my use.</li>
    <li> These are positively wonderful. For years I&#x27;ve clung to Visine&#x27;s Eye Wipes. Finally $60.00 per container was where I drew the line. I couldn&#x27;t afford that! Anyway,I have EXTREMELY sensitive eyes. For my blephritis I can not even use dilute baby shampoo. I know,crazy. So I stumbled upon these,checked the ingredients and price and went for it! So glad I did. They are at least as good as the Visine product and incredibly less expensive. Also,they are individually wrapped so my guess is they will stay moist even longer than Visine&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> There are two qualities about this product that stand out.  The first is the SIZE.  When I received them I immediately tore one open and discovered that it is much larger than wipes I had used before.  This is important to me because I use them for an eye condition, but my wife also loves them because it makes it easy to remove makeup.  The second feature is they are very MOIST, we never have to rinse afterwards.  We even tried it on our dog for his eye boogies and now he looks forward to a good scrubbing!!  I would recommend them for anyone.</li>
    <li> I use them every day.&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended by my eye specialist.</li>
    <li> Overpriced for the value to me</li>
    <li> good wipe but there are better wipes listed on Amazon, if I say the name? try Doctor Fields you will be pleased</li>
