      <li>I strongly recommend this</li>
      <li>This particular seller (Best Price Beauty Supply) was kind enough to include a free jar with my order.</li>
      <li>[ASIN:B000EGMBW0 Soft Sheen-Carson Optimum Oil Therapy Dry Hair Healer, 4 oz.]I have used this product before and had very good results.</li>
      <li>I tried this in 2005 when it was initially available.</li>
      <li>I thought this hair product  was going to be a light cream .</li>
      <li>I have very tight coily hair, and this is the best for sealing moisture into my hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything--from Bumble &amp; Bumble to Biolage to Mixed Chicks--and this by far works the BEST.</li>
      <li>I really wish the fragrance were more of a coconut fragrance.</li>
      <li>I try to not use too much, and I also try to put good-smelling products on top to mask the smell.</li>
      <li>This product contains mineral oil listed in the first line along with cheap cost water.  </li>
      <li>Sheen-Carson Optimum Oil Therapy Dry Hair Healer is #1 in my book.  </li>
      <li>makes my hair soo soft, love it.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m going to look for this product in my local beauty supply store so as of right now I don&#x27;t recommend this for any one...</li>
      <li>I love this cause it doesn&#x27;t necessarily weigh my hair down all that much.</li>
      <li>this is the only product that works for me when blow drying my hair straight.  </li>
      <li>I tried this product and two other products of the same line 3 times, even on freshly washed hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>Just use the oils that are listed toward the bottom of this product list and enjoy the benefits of using natural, pure oils with artificial ingredients.  </li>
      <li>so if you have straight hair it might weigh it down and this is not for you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite hair product. Received in a timely matter</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mixture of oils for my hair. I have very tight coily hair, and this is the best for sealing moisture into my hair. The only downside is that it smells bad. I try to not use too much, and I also try to put good-smelling products on top to mask the smell. My father is tall, and he notices whenever I use this product and says that it smells HORRIBLE, like gasoline, from a distance; up close the smell is not as bad, a little floral but still has a strong greasy smell. I really wish the fragrance were more of a coconut fragrance. For me, that would make this the best product ever!</li>
    <li> I have thick, extremely curly North African hair (think: frizzy, dry, unmanageable)--and this is the only product that works for me when blow drying my hair straight.  I have tried everything--from Bumble &amp; Bumble to Biolage to Mixed Chicks--and this by far works the BEST. This product has convinced me that the problem with curly hair is that not enough oil gets to the hair shaft--and so any gel, leave-in conditioner, etc. is just covering up the dry hair underneath. This product actually penetrates my hair and makes it softer.  When I blow dry my hair, if I use this product it actually feels healthier than if I don&#x27;t--that&#x27;s how good it is.  I love, love, LOVE this product and hope Carson-Sheen (or whomever owns the company) keeps making it until I am an old lady!!!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND SHARE IT WITH ME !</li>
    <li> makes my hair soo soft, love it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a moisturizer and at the same time shine to your hair, look no further as this is the product. I used to have my hair dry and breaking due to the weather but not anymore. I love and love this product and will surely re-order. I strongly recommend this</li>
    <li> It works to bring moisture back to dry almost lifeless hair, but it does leave the hair feeling greasy. I have used it for several months now, but I will be moving on to another product because this one leaves my clothes oily.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and keeps my hair hydrated and shiny.. Will buy again.....</li>
    <li> Buyers, beware! I tried this in 2005 when it was initially available. I tried this product and two other products of the same line 3 times, even on freshly washed hair and scalp.  The results were oiliness on the hair and flakes on my scalp.  This product contains mineral oil listed in the first line along with cheap cost water.  How can this \\&quot;dry hair healer\\&quot; heal your hair if it coats it with mineral oil and other chemicals with a bit of natural oils which are promoted to heal your hair but these oils are little in amount compared to the other unnatural chemicals.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by commercials or the people who like using mineral oil as a moisturizer.  Mineral oil is not a moisturizer but coats whatever it is applied to.  Just use the oils that are listed toward the bottom of this product list and enjoy the benefits of using natural, pure oils with artificial ingredients.  I do believe the results would be better than using this item or anything made by softsheen-carson.  You can always buy real natural products that will moisturize and nourish your hair like products from companies like littlepenguinsonline.com or brownbutterbeauty.com.  I have used their products before without adverse effects, whether I like them or not, and no, I&#x27;m not affiliated with these companies. It&#x27;s just advice, my review.</li>
    <li> The transaction was perfect but I was disappointed in the product. I much prefer Optimum Oil Therapy 3-in-1 Creme Oil Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This particular seller (Best Price Beauty Supply) was kind enough to include a free jar with my order. Not only that, but the product has proven itself (in combo with Dax Supergro) to be great so far at improving the edges of my hair that suffer much from swimming and other trauma.</li>
    <li> I was previously using Optimum Anti-Breakage Moisture Cream Hairdress. But they stopped making it? This is an excellent substitute. It is non-greasy and lightweight. It also works as well as the anti-breakage.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my scalp. It is soothing. I have used this product before some time ago.</li>
    <li> I love this cause it doesn&#x27;t necessarily weigh my hair down all that much. It adds a little bit of oil to my hair. I have a mixture of Spanish/African American hair texture so if you have straight hair it might weigh it down and this is not for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and it is wonderful. It  keeps my hair from frizzing and drying out and there is  no greasy build-up. My hair is very manageable and it has grown a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Soft Sheen-Carson Optimum Oil Therapy Dry Hair Healer is #1 in my book.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores where I live anymore, but happy to purchase it online.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair. It just made my hair a heavy thick mess. I looked up the ingredients in this product; the highlighted oils are only a small part of this entire product.</li>
    <li> I thought this hair product  was going to be a light cream . It came messy and separated it was an oil and creams in the jar as If it was on the warehouse shelf for years I mixed it thinking maybe I could make it a solid and it never worked put in the ref. and everything. I&#x27;m going to look for this product in my local beauty supply store so as of right now I don&#x27;t recommend this for any one...</li>
    <li> One of the best products for dry hair and dry scalp.  No greasy residue and leaves a beautiful, healthy shine.  Love it.</li>
    <li> As Described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> excellent service and product</li>
    <li> [ASIN:B000EGMBW0 Soft Sheen-Carson Optimum Oil Therapy Dry Hair Healer, 4 oz.]I have used this product before and had very good results. The product is odorless which is an absolute must for me, it leaves you hair soft and manageable.  When my hair is very dry, I use it everyday. Excellent for women of color.</li>
