      <li>I&#x27;m not the most consistent pill taker.</li>
      <li>I have not finished the whole bottle and just purchased two more just to continue the growth process of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I took these pills for a whole year and for the most part these pills did what they said they would</li>
      <li>It really did take 45 days to start working and works better if you take 1 morning, afternoon and night.</li>

      <li>Fast grow along with Profectiv products is the perfect duo for black hair care!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not willing to take any chances if they fixed that it would be perfect</li>
      <li>There was absolutely nothing special about the supplement.  </li>
      <li>True to its claim, I have been enjoying more new growth and less breakage.  </li>
      <li>In the past I&#x27;ve tried so many topical treatments to make my hair look and feel healthy, nothing makes my hair look and feel as healthy as these.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s looking to grow their hair out FAST!</li>
      <li>I recommend Fast Grow 110 percent!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I do not recall the day I started taking this product</li>
      <li>I did a google search and sure enough it can</li>
      <li>My afro hair has a very fine texture and my skin tends to be on the dry side.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to Exotic Allure, I can now whip my hair back</li>
      <li>She said that her hair has been growing pretty fast</li>
      <li>I have been using th Fast Grow-ethnic hair growth vitamins for over a year and my hair is all around healthier, shnier and longer.  </li>
      <li>When I read fast grow</li>
      <li>so nothing much but a really itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>Taking these capsules causes my body to not only generate natural lubrication for my hair, but my skin feels a lot better, too.    </li>
      <li>I purchased the fast grow pills three weeks ago, looking at my new growth in my hair today, I would not have believed this is my hair growing this fast!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Your money would be better spent on regular hair vits which would not only be cheaper, but if you compare the ingredients, you&#x27;ll find that fast grow contains nothing more than any other hair vitamin on the shelf.</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re into more natural vits, taking plain old vit e (1 x wk), a horsetail &amp; a biotin</li>
      <li>Like many, it seems to make my hair itchy and face break out, not sure if its related</li>
      <li>I started taking Fast Grow because I do desire to have long</li>
      <li>I first notice the new growth in my hair at one and half weeks of using it, it is now three weeks</li>
      <li>and I saw a major length increase</li>
      <li>Not only did a single flake fall but my hair had so much natural oil!</li>
      <li>So bad that weave wasn&#x27;t ever a good option for me</li>

<li> So bad that weave wasn&#x27;t ever a good option for me</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to continue using them to see how  long my hair gets.</li>
<li> you would have to choose between liver damage and long hair</li>
<li> so I cannot say how long it took my to hair grow.</li>
<li> People at my job have told me that my hair grew really fast and how thick it&#x27;s gotten.  </li>
<li> but as I started reading other reviews to see if anyone else had the same results and someone mentioned that one of the ingredients could cause liver damage</li>
<li> investment I&#x27;ve made in a hair product bar none and will use as long as I can afford it!</li>
<li> I want to give it at least a three month period to determine whether it does indeed live up to all the hype.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the Fast Grow supplements for approximately 2 months now...</li>
<li> I would say however that they are fairly expensive with me being a broke college student, however they are worth every penny.</li>
<li> No result after 2 bottels empty</li>
<li> I brought this product because I am hard on my hair with dyes and perms but I must have not used it long enough because I didn&#x27;t see a difference. .</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive for me, but I&#x27;m willing to cut some things out of my spending to buy these vitamins.</li>
<li> will do the same for you if not more.</li>
<li> She&#x27;s been taking these pills for about a month and a half.  </li>
<li> i think that means its working its a process and will take a little patience and time.</li>
<li> I thought I was see results a little faster that the ones that i was already using.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
<li> It was a waste of money and effort.  </li>
<li> Have been using this for 6 months and my hair has grown from chin length to a little past my shoulders.</li>
<li> She usually runs her hands through my hair and brushes out all the flakes before washing.</li>
<li> ill keep you updated with my current progress.</li>
<li> neither was working out, unless I planned to have it washed sooner than every two weeks with some expensive dry and itchy shampoo or treatment.</li>
<li> It only takes two weeks of doing nothing to my hair and I have scabs, flakes and itch like crazy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using these hair vitamins for approximately 1month now</li>
<li> In the past, I have had the worst scalp.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work ,, sooo bad</li>
<li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Fast Grow supplements for approximately 2 months now...I did have a 2-week interval where I didn&#x27;t take any supplements during my vacation.  I have resumed the suggested daily intake and although I have not seen any noticeable difference in the growth of my hair, my hair does appear to be fulller.    I have another bottle to go.  I want to give it at least a three month period to determine whether it does indeed live up to all the hype.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these hair vitamins for approximately 1month now and my hair has grown substantially! I can&#x27;t wait to continue using them to see how  long my hair gets. They make my hair grow thicker and my skin even looks better. In the past I&#x27;ve tried so many topical treatments to make my hair look and feel healthy, nothing makes my hair look and feel as healthy as these. I also purchased the shampoo and have been using for about a month as well. I don&#x27;t think that the shampoo is working as well as the vitamins. I would say however that they are fairly expensive with me being a broke college student, however they are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three months and my hair has grown and it&#x27;s more healthy.  People at my job have told me that my hair grew really fast and how thick it&#x27;s gotten.  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to a friend at work. She had a lot of damaged hair.  She&#x27;s been taking these pills for about a month and a half.  She absolutely love these vitamins.  She said that her hair has been growing pretty fast and she wants me to order her some more.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive for me, but I&#x27;m willing to cut some things out of my spending to buy these vitamins.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any benefits in them. When I read fast grow I thought I was see results a little faster that the ones that i was already using. Not so. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I took these pills for a whole year and for the most part these pills did what they said they would and I saw a major length increase but as I started reading other reviews to see if anyone else had the same results and someone mentioned that one of the ingredients could cause liver damage I did a google search and sure enough it can that&#x27;s why I stopped taking them you would have to choose between liver damage and long hair I&#x27;m not willing to take any chances if they fixed that it would be perfect an that&#x27;s the reason it got three stars</li>
    <li> just started the 3 a day cycle about a week or so ago so nothing much but a really itchy scalp. i think that means its working its a process and will take a little patience and time. ill keep you updated with my current progress.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Exotic Allure, I can now whip my hair back n forth! I&#x27;m totally pleased with the results of this product. This is the absolute best hair growth product I&#x27;ve ever used. Unfortunately, I do not recall the day I started taking this product so I cannot say how long it took my to hair grow. I can say I&#x27;m still on bottle # 1 and my hair has grown almost 2 inches. I recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s looking to grow their hair out FAST! Thank You Exotic Allure!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for 6 months and my hair has grown from chin length to a little past my shoulders. Finally a product that does what it claims. It really did take 45 days to start working and works better if you take 1 morning, afternoon and night. Fast grow along with Profectiv products is the perfect duo for black hair care!</li>
    <li> I purchased the fast grow pills three weeks ago, looking at my new growth in my hair today, I would not have believed this is my hair growing this fast! I first notice the new growth in my hair at one and half weeks of using it, it is now three weeks and my hair continues to grows.  I have not finished the whole bottle and just purchased two more just to continue the growth process of my hair.  This product does work.  I love it.</li>
    <li> No result after 2 bottels empty</li>
    <li> Because of this wonderful product, I no longer need to apply pomades to lubricate my hair and scalp on a daily basis.  My afro hair has a very fine texture and my skin tends to be on the dry side.  Taking these capsules causes my body to not only generate natural lubrication for my hair, but my skin feels a lot better, too.    True to its claim, I have been enjoying more new growth and less breakage.  I recommend Fast Grow 110 percent!</li>
    <li> I Just started taking this product for 2 weeks and I am looking for amazing results! Will keep posting with my results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work ,, sooo bad</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. Your money would be better spent on regular hair vits which would not only be cheaper, but if you compare the ingredients, you&#x27;ll find that fast grow contains nothing more than any other hair vitamin on the shelf. if you&#x27;re into more natural vits, taking plain old vit e (1 x wk), a horsetail &amp; a biotin will do the same for you if not more.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best hair vitamins you will find it works as promised. At this point I have lost count of how many bottles in been thru in two yrs. Highly recommend it. Faithful Jersey customer.</li>
    <li> It dose just what I hoped it would do, I am so happy and glad I don&#x27;t have to look other sites to find what I need Fast Grow has it, what I need for thickness, and growth Wonderful product💕</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a afrian american with relaxed hair. I bought this 3 weeks ago and am waiting to give it a months time before I come back and review. Like many, it seems to make my hair itchy and face break out, not sure if its related but it&#x27;s the only pill/vitamin I put in my body at the moment. Will keep you posted, since i HAVE TO rate this product to leave a comment, I will only give it 3 stars for now.</li>
    <li> I brought this product because I am hard on my hair with dyes and perms but I must have not used it long enough because I didn&#x27;t see a difference. .</li>
    <li> I have been using th Fast Grow-ethnic hair growth vitamins for over a year and my hair is all around healthier, shnier and longer.  I recommend this product to anyone looking for results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it before, so I was familiar with it, so I knew the product is good, works very well, and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Its works!! Can&#x27;t wait to order more. My hair def grew a an inch or two. Very exciting to see the results</li>
    <li> My hair DID NOT grow any faster than it did prior to my starting these supplement.  It was a waste of money and effort.  I took the supplement for 60 days before giving  up since some of the reviews said it takes 45 days to see results.  There was absolutely nothing special about the supplement.  I took them daily as directed and my hair only grew marginally.  No faster than it has been growing.  VERY DISAPPOINTED. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Great!My Hair is Thicker,Fuller,&amp; Growing Nicely!</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning , and this product help thicken my hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have had the worst scalp. It only takes two weeks of doing nothing to my hair and I have scabs, flakes and itch like crazy. So bad that weave wasn&#x27;t ever a good option for me neither was working out, unless I planned to have it washed sooner than every two weeks with some expensive dry and itchy shampoo or treatment. I started taking Fast Grow because I do desire to have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been 3 weeks and my stylist was in shock. She usually runs her hands through my hair and brushes out all the flakes before washing. Not only did a single flake fall but my hair had so much natural oil! Not to mention the length after 3 weeks was a noticeable difference! I&#x27;m healed!&lt;br /&gt;And just to let you know I&#x27;m not the most consistent pill taker. Some days I bet I only took 2 even though I try to get 3 in. And most of the time I didn&#x27;t even take it with water.&lt;br /&gt;Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a hair product bar none and will use as long as I can afford it!</li>
