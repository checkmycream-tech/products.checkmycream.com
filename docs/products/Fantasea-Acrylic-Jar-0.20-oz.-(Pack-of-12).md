      <li>The caps weren&#x27;t super smooth to screw on/off</li>
      <li>They are great for storing makeup or single uses of products like eye cream or moisturizer.</li>
      <li>When I run out, I will absolutely be buying more of these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found these for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>These are great to put moisturizer and other products in a couple of days suppl.</li>
      <li>On the Q&amp;A section of the item it stated the item size as &amp;#34;The top of the pot itself, not the lid, is 2.5 inches across, and the pot is 2 inches deep, hope that helps :)&amp;#34;  </li>

      <li>Came quickly and was exactly as expected/described.</li>
      <li>I bought some great glitter makeup but the containers they came in had too small of a neck to get my brushes into the glitter.  </li>
      <li>Great container, I just didn&#x27;t expect it to be so small for what I wanted to use it for.</li>
      <li>The lids fit tight &amp; they held a nice amount of lip balm.</li>
      <li>The tops screw in fine, but I have to carefully screw the top on.</li>
      <li>Great little jars, not exactly the size I was looking for, but that is my own fault.</li>
      <li>These little lip balm jars are a good value and useful.  </li>
      <li>These are overall great however some of my lids did not screw on properly.</li>

      <li>The photo here looks like a higher quality lid, maybe.</li>
      <li>I have several left over, I&#x27;m sure I can find some creative uses for them.</li>
      <li>I know this is exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>However, most people can simply reuse them over and over again by washing them out.</li>
      <li>I make my own natural beauty products because I don&#x27;t trust the chemicals in commercial products.</li>
      <li>They work well, are easy to open and close and hold a lot of product.</li>
      <li>Probably too small for much else (makeup wise).</li>
      <li>Makes it easier if your looking for a certain color.</li>
      <li>Certainly nothing corrosive in these things.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>The tops are nice and tight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yes these jars are small, but they were just what I was looking for. They work very well for my different creams for carry-on airplane travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of the size, nine stacked quarters fit perfectly in one of these jars.</li>
    <li> My daughters wanted to make homemade lip gloss and this is just what we were looking for. We struggled to find anything locally at the big box craft stores and our local natural foods store so were happy to have success on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The size is perfect for lip gloss/balm. The caps weren&#x27;t super smooth to screw on/off but overall we were happy with this find.</li>
    <li> These are okay, not leak proof, lids don&#x27;t fit snuggly to jar</li>
    <li> These have no liquid seal.</li>
    <li> Just right for my NYX loose eye shadows! They are small enough to travel with and don&#x27;t take up too much space in my makeup drawer.</li>
    <li> Bought these to keep paint in while I travel (I&#x27;m an artist who is fortune enough to travel a bit, so I like to be able to paint wherever I am). They have worked great for me so far, they keep my paint wet for as long as I&#x27;ve had them and have yet to let me down. I would assume they&#x27;d be great for cosmetics too, as I thought about making a bit of my own eye shadow to keep in these containers as well.</li>
    <li> Be cautious, these jars are the size of 5 stacked quarters, and would hold 3 pennies.  Lids are not strong, price is cheap because, items is cheap.  Don&#x27;t buy these, you&#x27;ll be sorry.  Now I have to return a $7 item.  Advertising should emphasize its a,  0.2 oz  very small,  I saw it as 2 oz. since there was no zero in front of a decimal point.</li>
    <li> The oil I put in this leaks out. Not a tight seal.</li>
    <li> For my purposes, these jars work fine. But for those that may wonder about them--as I did prior to ordering, here are a few things you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Size: Tiny. .20 oz as listed. 6ml on the package. Probably can (barely) fit a quarter inside.&lt;br /&gt;2. Quality: A bit flimsy. When I put the jar between my thumb and forefinger, without applying much pressure, I can feel the plastic give (as in &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.)&lt;br /&gt;3. The tops screw in fine, but I have to carefully screw the top on. So I am not sure these are leak proof. For short-term storage uses with dry stuff, no problem. But I&#x27;d be careful storing liquid for travel. Certainly nothing corrosive in these things.&lt;br /&gt;4. Individually packaged. (All 12 in their own packages are put in a large clear plastic bag.)</li>
    <li> The product arrived six days after I ordered it, in enough time for me to make the lip balm and give as gifts.  It was exactly what I was expecting.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see this product--It is perfect size for carrying a little makeup with me (e.g, face cream, foundation, for a couple of days amount.). It takes no space and is very light. The cap can cover the jar tightly so nothing will spill! I am glad I ordered them, they are exactly what I hoped for!</li>
    <li> These have worked well so far as little jars for holding lip ointment (I didn&#x27;t want to tote around larger tubes in each bag). They&#x27;re quite small, so don&#x27;t purchase if you&#x27;re wanting even a medium sized jar. Again, these are perfect for dipping a single finger into.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter to put some homemade lipgloss in. They worked great for their purpose. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with them and would recommend.</li>
    <li> These are a little smaller than I thought but they still work nice to put home made lip gloss in. With the clear bottom, I can see what color I have. The tops are nice and tight. They are a pretty good deal for the price. I have several left over, I&#x27;m sure I can find some creative uses for them.</li>
    <li> These are good for carrying cosmetics/creams during a travel. Not very heavy duty plastic but not totally flimsy either. The lids close well but not sure if it would remain leak proof.</li>
    <li> Nice little plastic jars with tight lids. Can be used for lots of things, I use them when hiking to cut down on the weight of  certain items.</li>
    <li> I like these jars. They&#x27;re perfect for lip glosses or to hold homemade lip scrub. Probably too small for much else (makeup wise). Also I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the lids and I like that they&#x27;re clear and you can see what&#x27;s inside. Makes it easier if your looking for a certain color.</li>
    <li> I liked the size of the jar. it was the perfect size for what I needed it for. Am using it as a sample for my product. Am going to be ordering more of this. Wish it came in a larger pack of 24 or more.</li>
    <li> Used these to make my own lip balm and they definitely worked for it. The hard part (which has nothing to do with this product) is getting the liquid in the jars. They are sturdy and have lasted a while already. Will probably order a few more.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality, but it is worth it for the price. I bought these to put lip balms I made for gifts. Some of the lids are a little difficult to twist on and off.</li>
    <li> When my daughter said she wanted to make lip gloss at her bday party, I ran to Amazon to find these little jars. They are perfect! The girls kept oohing and ahhing at the cute little containers. The lids screw on very securely. These are not cheap or poor quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased these containers to hold homemade lip balm. And they definitely do the job. But they are NOT has pictured. There is no divot in the cap, it is a flat/smooth top with rounded edges. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with their seal but I just started using them.</li>
    <li> I use these jars for my moisturized, foundation, eye cream and make up.  They work well, are easy to open and close and hold a lot of product.</li>
    <li> These are really tiny..didn&#x27;t realize how small they&#x27;d be.  also the lid is sometimes a little difficult to get on/off.  Typical cheapo &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; product, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be making some beauty products and these are the perfect size for what I need. They are small but that&#x27;s exactly what I am looking for. I&#x27;m glad I found these for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love these little jars!  They are great for storing makeup or single uses of products like eye cream or moisturizer. As long as you aren&#x27;t looking to cram a ton of product in one jar - they are SMALL - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I like to make lip balms and these are the ideal way to store them.  The lids screw on for extra-secure storage. When I run out, I will absolutely be buying more of these. However, most people can simply reuse them over and over again by washing them out.</li>
    <li> I bought some great glitter makeup but the containers they came in had too small of a neck to get my brushes into the glitter.  I bought these to but the makeup in so that I could have easy application with the brush without getting the stuff everywhere trying to get it on the brush. I&#x27;m sure I could fine 100 other uses for them too. :)</li>
    <li> These seem very cheap to me.  A lot of the tops don&#x27;t screw on correctly.  Not worth the money.  If I&#x27;d paid $0.15/ jar I&#x27;d have been more satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are individually packaged and the perfect size for lip balm or small batches of lotion or solid perfume. For the price I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I wanted something to store my homemade beauty products in. I&#x27;ve ordered those for lip balm. They are the perfect size for putting your purse.</li>
    <li> These are great to put moisturizer and other products in a couple of days suppl. I use them for short weekend trips and just throw them in my purse. I even put toothpaste in them to have in my purse for everyday use when I am out.</li>
    <li> great product and timely service</li>
    <li> Very nice containers at a great price! Packaged nicely and PERFECT for you home-made lip balm or eyeshadows. I can&#x27;t wait to fill mine up to give away as gifts.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> These are overall great however some of my lids did not screw on properly.</li>
    <li> I like the clear jars, and size just what I needed.</li>
    <li> These jars are the perfect size for making homemade chapstick/ lipgloss in. the lids are tight. The only problem is they smell a little plastic like.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and was exactly as expected/described. I used the jars to hold home made lip balm that I made for Christmas gifts. It worked very well.</li>
    <li> I like the jars themselves, I am using them for homemade lip balm, but most of the lids don&#x27;t screw on properly which is really frustrating.  I will not be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> Great little jars, not exactly the size I was looking for, but that is my own fault. I use them for home made tooth paste. They hold just enough toothpaste to last about 3 weeks with two people using it. Wash and repeat use.</li>
    <li> Smaller tham I anticipated, about the diameter of a quarter. However, perfect size for the lip balm I made, and made nice looking gifts.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what we were looking to use for the lipgloss the girls wanted to make. Good quality for the price you pay for the quantity you get. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great container, I just didn&#x27;t expect it to be so small for what I wanted to use it for. I decided to use it as a sample jar, so it worked out well.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re boarding a plane with carry-on luggage, you know you&#x27;re only allowed enough liquids, creams, &amp; gels to fit in one quart-size Zip-Loc bag.  This can be a real problem when you&#x27;ve got numerous jars of face cream, makeup remover, sunscreen, hair smoothing cream, etc.  These cute little jars are the PERFECT solution!  I bought them several months ago and have not been disappointed.  Lids fit tight, and none have cracked.  100% satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> These worked for it&#x27;s intented purchase. It holds well enough. It does feel somewhat cheapy and I hope that it keeps holding well. I would have liked better grip when turning the lid.</li>
    <li> I used these to make my own lip gloss to give in a goody bag. Perfect size and prefect portion!</li>
    <li> These 0.2oz jars have a rounded, smooth lid, not the lid with the indentation at the top as shown in the product picture. Why is this a big deal? Well because the rounded-lid jars are poorer quality, and they don&#x27;t twist on/off as smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these jars in the 3/8oz size and liked them so much that I wanted to buy the smaller .2oz size as well. Both products look exactly the same on their respective product pages, so I thought I would be getting pretty much the same product, but just in a smaller size. However, the .2 oz size rounded-lid jars are poor quality and cheap in comparison, and the lid is difficult to twist. I doubt that it seals very tightly, and I&#x27;m pretty sure my creams/gels would dry out in them. I&#x27;m not sure if the picture for the .2oz size is wrong, or if there are two different types of .2oz jars being sold under the same listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added a picture showing the .2oz size jar (left) and the 3/8oz size jar (right). The .2 oz with the rounded lid is an inferior product.</li>
    <li> They were perfect size for making lip gloss and keeping in your purse.  True to the description and worth the money</li>
    <li> These little lip balm jars are a good value and useful.  I will reorder when I need more of them.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my DIY christmas lipgloss, and they were the perfect size. good quality, and recieved very fast. thanks!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this item in stores to mix my own gloss. Perfect size and very easy to open and close.</li>
    <li> The size of the jars were perfect. I used them for homemade lip balm... they were perfect size. Will definitalu order again.</li>
    <li> On the Q&amp;A section of the item it stated the item size as &amp;#34;The top of the pot itself, not the lid, is 2.5 inches across, and the pot is 2 inches deep, hope that helps :)&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s really not, barely holds 3 pennies.  Can&#x27;t return it either</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. I make my own natural beauty products because I don&#x27;t trust the chemicals in commercial products. These jars help me with that. They are durable and perfect for exactly what I need from them.</li>
    <li> These little jars will be perfect for traveling! I am also very happy that I have so many!</li>
    <li> fantastic jars! Service was great!</li>
    <li> Perfect little jars. I work in a salon where we use them to give samples. Well made.</li>
    <li> These are nice little jars, they worked great for what I wanted them for, which was loose makeup powders, however you can feel they are thin plastic</li>
    <li> Jars look great for samples. Quite a bit smaller than I imagined, but arrived quickly and individually erapped</li>
    <li> took about a week or more but super cute caps stay on. perfect for whet I need them for. came individually wrapped!</li>
    <li> Not airtight.  I tried to use these for a micro toiletry kit.  My shaving cream leaked with flights and altitude changes.  My pomade dried out.</li>
    <li> These were a lot smaller than I had originally anticipated (about the same diameter as a nickel) but turns out I could use them for samples of lip gloss &amp; lotion. I&#x27;ll use more for that purpose, but there&#x27;s no way you could put a label on them unless it was the size of a dime.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m writing this review via a link from my Amazon past orders area, so I know this is exactly what I ordered. However, my jars have a convex top, not flat with indented middle...not sure if I rec&#x27;d the correct item? My jars look like the photo of the other option from this brand. The photo here looks like a higher quality lid, maybe. Also, I only rec&#x27;d 10 rather than 12.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m a flight attendant and wanted jars to travel with small amounts of all my various face serems, lotions, primers, etc. These didn&#x27;t leak while at home, but they DID LEAK in a carryon. (And carry ons experience less pressure change than checked bags, so in a checked bag they would REALLY leak!) :( I&#x27;m disappointed. The only tiny containers that have consistently not leaked are screw-top contact lens cases. But I want something a little larger and separate. The plastic on these jars seems a little thin and brittle.  With just a small amount of pressure I can slightly bend the lid.</li>
    <li> Got them to make lip gloss and I love the size is perfect!</li>
    <li> I use these for everything. They are awesome and so useful. I put my nail cream in them to take with me. I put coconut oil in it to not contaminate the whole jar for certain things. Love them. They do get tough to open if there are things caught in the threads but they always have opened for me eventually.</li>
    <li> I made homemade lip balm for Christmas gifts &amp; these were perfect containers. The lids fit tight &amp; they held a nice amount of lip balm.</li>
