      <li>I really liked it.  </li>
      <li>an invention—no gimmicks, no gadgets—just a highly effective implement doing it&#x27;s job.</li>

      <li>Soft and appropriate for teeth, wears great, cleans brilliantly.</li>
      <li>They also feel good and make your teeth feel really clean.</li>
      <li>I loved how clean my teeth felt after using it.</li>
      <li>I have been using Curvex for two years now and these toothbrushes are so much better than anything I used before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had not been able to find them for a while when someone said they had them on Amazon.  </li>

      <li>Fantastic toothbrush!</li>
      <li>Simply the BEST toothbrush out there!!</li>
      <li>If is now the favorite of my daughter and myself.  </li>
      <li>I was using Oral-B for many years until getting a sample of the Curvex from my dental office two years ago, and found that there’s no comparison between the two.  </li>
      <li>My my father-in-law is a dentist and he has told me over and over again that the soft bristles are better, and these bristles feel great.</li>
      <li>I am glad that Curvex and Curvex II are available at amazon.com, so that I can introduce them to my family and friends.</li>
      <li>Most important, my mouth feels cleaner.  </li>
      <li>the inside of my mouth is more clean.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best out there.</li>
      <li>A great product that I look forward to using daily for years to come..</li>
      <li>The soft bristles are gentle yet work very effectively to keep our smiles healthy.</li>
      <li>I like the density of the bristles which make my teeth feel clean, and the soft bristles feel great as a gentle massage for the gums, which my dentist recommends to help prevent gum disease.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are much gentler on my gum and clean better.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a medium to soft toothbrush that was effective cleaning my teeth close to the gums without hurting them.</li>
      <li>, this old dog has learned a new trick; this brush is amazing!  </li>
      <li>The soft bristles and unique shape of the Curvex allows you to clean your teeth well without damaging your gums.  </li>
      <li>It fits in my mouth perfectly, has no “sharp” edges, gets to all the places I feel like I usually miss . . .</li>
      <li>The funny shape of the brushes may be playing a role in the effectiveness as I had never tried a toothbrush like this.</li>
      <li>Will order more in future.</li>
      <li>I tried a Curvex toothbrush a few months ago and loved it.  </li>
      <li>As a man with more than 60 years experience brushing my teeth with medium, firm, or extra-firm brushes (most with straight handles), I was not-so-sure when my dentist handed me a sample Curvex soft brush.  </li>
      <li>Not only does the Curvex brush work better - it gets my teeth cleaner, more thoroughly and efficiently, than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever tried - it lasts longer too.  </li>
      <li>Curvex&#x27;s unique design allows the toothbrush to not only easily brush my front teeth but also fit perfectly into the small crevice in the back of my mouth which my dentist has warned me I have had plaque build-up in the past.</li>
      <li>I buy a whole bunch at a time.  </li>
      <li>The toothbrush is gentle on my gums, yet thoroughly brushes all surfaces of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>(the dentist doesn&#x27;t need to do much time-consuming scraping to deep-clean our teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(please reduce the price or make it available to local pharmacy stores)</li>
      <li>and this is the only toothbrush that feels comfortable to me ....</li>
      <li>The unique shape of the bristles helps getting to the harder-to-reach spots, especially on the inward facing sides.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The bristles last a long time, and are very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>They really get to the back teeth better than any other toothbrush I have ever use.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>During my Dental appointment last week, the dental assistant asked if I&#x27;ve been flossing more regularly; I said no, but I have been using a different toothbrush.</li>
      <li>This brush goes to the corners, deep inside and also has much softer bristles.</li>
      <li>Then when I needed to \\&quot;retire\\&quot; an old brush, I used the Curvex.  </li>
      <li>is soft, which I didn&#x27;t want to try.</li>
      <li>I was pretty certain I&#x27;d head back to my regular stiffer brushes within a couple of days—just to get the slime off my teeth that I knew would be left there by a soft tooth</li>
      <li>Their design is different from ordinary toothbrushes and the fit is more contoured to the mouth then ordinary toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend Curvex for its daily convenience and long-term dental health advantages.</li>
      <li>the shape makes it easy to get to those hard to reach places.</li>
      <li>Curvex is a really ergonomic, efficient toothbrush that brings a unique quality to the field of teeth-brushing, with its ability to effortlessly reach and clean into the back area of my mouth --  something I have not experienced with any other toothbrush, including electric toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m never going back to my old Oral B&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>Once the brush gets there, those soft bristles remove all the dectable plaque, and all my teeth pass my tongue&#x27;s stringent touch test; every tooth (front, back, outside surface, inside surface) all feel completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She will be looking into getting some Curvex toothbrushes in the near future.</li>
      <li>It also reaches far back in my mouth without a problem.  </li>

    <li> Love these! the shape makes it easy to get to those hard to reach places. The size and curve does help to keep the gag reflex down (or not at all) when brushing in the way way back. Bristles are soft and non irritating. Thanks for a GREAT toothbrush! (side note, still using these  3 years later very happy with them and cannot find anything in the store that is this good, great price too!)</li>
    <li> I love them.  This was my second order.  I have some in MI also.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used.  The unique shape of the bristles helps getting to the harder-to-reach spots, especially on the inward facing sides.</li>
    <li> Soft and appropriate for teeth, wears great, cleans brilliantly.</li>
    <li> Simply the BEST toothbrush out there!! Our teeth our cleaned after evey use.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and this is the only toothbrush that feels comfortable to me .... gets to all those hard-to-reach places without hurting my gums.</li>

    <li> I was looking for a medium to soft toothbrush that was effective cleaning my teeth close to the gums without hurting them. A friend recommended this toothbrush so I tried it. It really did the job without having bloody gums or, on the other side, unsatisfactory brushing at the root of my teeth. The funny shape of the brushes may be playing a role in the effectiveness as I had never tried a toothbrush like this. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using Curvex for two years now and these toothbrushes are so much better than anything I used before.&lt;br /&gt;They are much gentler on my gum and clean better.</li>
    <li> A friend had told me about how great this toothbrush is.  I bought some and loved them.  If is now the favorite of my daughter and myself.  I had not been able to find them for a while when someone said they had them on Amazon.  I will continue to use these.  Big plus these where designed by dentists.  They also feel good and make your teeth feel really clean.</li>

I was pretty certain I&#x27;d head back to my regular stiffer brushes within a couple of days—just to get the slime off my teeth that I knew would be left there by a soft tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this old dog has learned a new trick; this brush is amazing!  My teeth have never felt cleaner (including the inside surface of my back, lower molars), and my gums never been less abraided. The curved handle and overall slender design allow me to access all parts of my mouth.  Once the brush gets there, those soft bristles remove all the dectable plaque, and all my teeth pass my tongue&#x27;s stringent touch test; every tooth (front, back, outside surface, inside surface) all feel completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an invention—no gimmicks, no gadgets—just a highly effective implement doing it&#x27;s job. FIve stars!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 3 weeks now and it has been a wonderful experience. This brush goes to the corners, deep inside and also has much softer bristles. Will order more in future. (please reduce the price or make it available to local pharmacy stores)</li>
    <li> This beautifully-designed toothbrush is my family&#x27;s all-time favorite – we will buy no others because of the superior cleaning this excellent toothbrush delivers. The soft bristles are gentle yet work very effectively to keep our smiles healthy. Since using our Curvex toothbrushes, our semiannual dental checkups are even shorter (the dentist doesn&#x27;t need to do much time-consuming scraping to deep-clean our teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family and I recommend this superb product because the Curvex toothbrush is so pleasant to use – and is making a visible, tangible difference in the health of our gums and teeth!</li>
    <li> I tried a Curvex toothbrush a few months ago and loved it.  It fits in my mouth perfectly, has no “sharp” edges, gets to all the places I feel like I usually miss . . . it’s the best.  Most important, my mouth feels cleaner.  My dentist and dental hygienist have noticed and commented on improved dental hygiene.  I have gotten family members to use the Curvex and their responses have been the same as mine.  So I recently bought a couple of dozen of them on Amazon since I can’t find this toothbrush is stores (I like getting a supply of something once I find a product I like).  I can’t imagine ever using a toothbrush other than this one.</li>
    <li> Purchased based upon a recommendation from a friend and my teeth have never felt cleaner.  A great product that I look forward to using daily for years to come..</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are hidden gems! They really get to the back teeth better than any other toothbrush I have ever use. I will continue to order these for me and my family. This is a purchase you won&#x27;t regret especially when you visit your dentist!</li>
    <li> My my father-in-law is a dentist and he has told me over and over again that the soft bristles are better, and these bristles feel great. Plus, the curve on this toothbrush is very effective. I feel like the inside of my mouth is more clean.</li>
    <li> Curvex is the best toothbrush and it is very easy on my teeth and gum.  I was using Oral-B for many years until getting a sample of the Curvex from my dental office two years ago, and found that there’s no comparison between the two.  The design of Curvex is very effective and you will notice the difference once you tried it.  I am glad that Curvex and Curvex II are available at amazon.com, so that I can introduce them to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> My dentist introduced Curvex to me over 2 years ago. I am a hard brusher,&lt;br /&gt;curvex is soft, which I didn&#x27;t want to try. It is the best toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;on the market and my teeth feel cleaner than before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Boomer and want to keep my teeth! A friend suggested I try the Curvex. The design of the head really does allow you to reach the hard to brush surfaces in the back molars and on the inside of the front teeth. I like the density of the bristles which make my teeth feel clean, and the soft bristles feel great as a gentle massage for the gums, which my dentist recommends to help prevent gum disease.</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush! My son  came home with one from his dentist office and it was blind luck that I opened it for myself when I needed a new toothbrush. I loved how clean my teeth felt after using it. On a whim I happened to search for it here on Amazon and was so happy I found it. I&#x27;m never going back to my old Oral B&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothbrush, and I have been brushing my teeth for about 50 years now.  I&#x27;m not sure what it is--I think that the handle and the brush head both must be ergonomic.  I have a small mouth (size-wise) and all of my teeth, including four wisdom teeth.  Things are a little tight in there.  Using this brush, I actually think I&#x27;ve reached some places where only my dentist has been.  I also have my share of fillings and crowns and this brush cleans everywhere just great.  Even with soft bristles, my gums used to occasionally bleed while brushing (I guess I was brushing too hard), but this has not happened with the Curvex. Yay!  I look forward to brushing my teeth now. I have never written a review for any product, anywhere, and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing one for a toothbrush.  Next, I&#x27;ll try the Curvex II.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best out there. I&#x27;ll never use any other brand of toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Elegant design and wonderful results.  I bought the product after reading some of the summaries from the clinical trials and could not be more impressed.  Designed by Bay Area dentists, so the fact the product is local is yet another plus in my mind.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist gave me a sample of the Curvex Toothbrush and I am &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; on them.  Their design is different from ordinary toothbrushes and the fit is more contoured to the mouth then ordinary toothbrushes.  The bristles last a long time, and are very comfortable.  I switched from OralB to Curvex which was designed by a dentist I was told.  I would definitely recommend these.  I buy a whole bunch at a time.  They are &amp;#34;the best.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist gave me a sample Curvex toothbrush.  It looked so simple and so strange that I didn&#x27;t use it for several weeks.  Then when I needed to \\&quot;retire\\&quot; an old brush, I used the Curvex.  What a surprise!  I really liked it.  The toothbrush is gentle on my gums, yet thoroughly brushes all surfaces of my teeth.  It also reaches far back in my mouth without a problem.  I just ordered a 6 brush supply for my 2 1/2 bathrooms.  The brush is a strange shape, but it works.  Whoever designed the Curvex is a genius.&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B009L4NGT8 Curvex Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> Been using the Curvex Toothbrush for a few months now. During my Dental appointment last week, the dental assistant asked if I&#x27;ve been flossing more regularly; I said no, but I have been using a different toothbrush.Told her about the Curvex and how my teeth and gums felt after brushing. She will be looking into getting some Curvex toothbrushes in the near future.</li>
    <li> Curvex is a really ergonomic, efficient toothbrush that brings a unique quality to the field of teeth-brushing, with its ability to effortlessly reach and clean into the back area of my mouth --  something I have not experienced with any other toothbrush, including electric toothbrushes. Curvex&#x27;s unique design allows the toothbrush to not only easily brush my front teeth but also fit perfectly into the small crevice in the back of my mouth which my dentist has warned me I have had plaque build-up in the past. With Curvex, I no longer have to worry, leading to much better health and savings. I highly recommend Curvex for its daily convenience and long-term dental health advantages.</li>
