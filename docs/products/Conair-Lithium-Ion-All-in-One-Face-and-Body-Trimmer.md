<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No doubt the best feature is the lithium-ion battery source.  Many other units are NiCad batteries and their power tapers off as they discharge and they can develop a &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; which severely shortens their duty cycle.  The lithium-ion batteries hold their power almost up to the very point that they die, charge quickly, and do not develop a memory.  I also agree with other reviewers that the body of the unit could use some non-slip gripping areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the attachments, many of them are tiny, almost toy-like.  It seems a shame to have all that power available and then have cutters which are too small to be effective.  This is a man&#x27;s groomer, and men have coarser hair, usually thicker, and a lot of acreage to mow.  There are definitely some advantages of small cutters and areas where they might be needed, however I think these could have been made a bit larger and beefier, and still be effective.  The body groomer pulls more than it cuts, especially on longer hair that has not been trimmed down first.  The foil shaver is less than an inch wide, so sometimes it is like mowing the lawn with scissors.</li>
    <li> While the Conair trimmer cuts well out of the box and contains a lithium ion battery for long life, too many of the other components of this shaver do not seem like they will survive long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, to remove any of the attachments, you need to squeeze the plastic attachment head and pull.  This bends the back of the head so that a plastic tab in the back of the shaver moves away from the body and disconnects the attachment from the motor.  Much like an inexpensive kids toy.  The first few times we tried to remove the attachments, we had to squeeze quite hard.  Something someone with arthritis might have problems with.  As soon as the plastic tab wears enough, the attachments will likely just fall off and not be usable.  Some sort of button or lever would have made this trimmer much more durable.  Most of the attachments, such as the beard length adjustment are flimsy plastic parts that seem too delicate for long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem with this trimmer is that there is no bag for travel.  Because of this, pieces are likely to be lost or you will have to purchase a bag to hold the parts of the product together in your luggage. Instead of the much needed carry bag, Conair chose to create a plastic stand that is approximately 3&amp;#34; x 8&amp;#34; and takes up considerable amount of counter space - much more than I wish to give to hold the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer would be considerably better if there was a bag instead of the large stand and the if the attachments were made of a more durable material. There are better made alternatives in the same price point.</li>
    <li> I regularly use clippers and trimmers to maintain my facial hair at a short length and occasionally manscape.  Keeping my body hair at a medium length allows my muscular definition to show while maintaining a natural manly appearance.  Manscaping this way also creates a basic and uncomplicated body grooming routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lightweight Conair GMT1 all-in-one face and body trimmer, made in China, can be used with or without the cord.  The package includes the trimmer power base, beard and mustache trimmer, body groomer, nose and ear trimmer, detailing trimmer, foil shaver, precision comb attachments, power cord, and storage tray.  Fully charging the power base for 2 hours results in sustained power performance for 80 minutes use or a 30 minute quick charge lasts for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard and mustache trimmer has 7 positions from 2-14mm evenly spread apart.  I normally trim my beard with a #3 comb on my Wahl clippers, which cuts to a 3/8\\&quot; or 9mm length.  On the Conair trimmer I am required to select either an 8 or 10 mm setting to get a similar length.  These settings are typical of consumer level trimmers; although I would prefer the settings were consistent with professional device lengths.  The detailing trimmer is a similar attachment with a quarter inch long edge and no comb attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a nose and ear trimmer until now.  I&#x27;ve always expected to stick this weird thing up my nose and it starts ripping hairs out. Fortunately, my expectation couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.  Using the nose and ear trimmer is easy and mostly sensation free.  Just turn the trimmer on, insert the trimmer head into the nose or ear without pushing, and then move in a circular motion.  As hairs get into the trimmer head, they are cut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body groomer works as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried, and is a tool which could benefit from wet use.  Trim body hair down to a low length using the comb attachment.  Once trimmed, remove the comb attachment and cut the remaining hair down to roughly 0.5mm.  This later action tends to work well in the shower on other devices I&#x27;ve used.  Although using this body groomer results in sharp edged stubble, similar to other devices, for a day or two.  The foil shaver could also benefit from wet uses. However I haven&#x27;t needed to use it since the body groomer includes a larger foil shaving surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage tray is a handy way to organize and keep track of all the accessory pieces.  However the instructions fail to mention that the power cord can be installed into the storage tray.  Doing so allows regular charging for the power base when not in use.  Turning the storage tray upside down to reveal a latch, which when opened allows the power connector to slip through a little hole.  Once inserted, close the latch to secure the power connector and thread the wire through the grove leading the cord out the other side.  Unfortunately there is no place to store excess wire, so I keep it twist tied to keep the cord short and neat looking.  Turn the storage tray upright, and place the trimmer power base in its circular well to store and charge the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair GMT1 all-in-one face and body trimmer has an outdated appearance which reminiscent of the 80&#x27;s.  The trimmer power base has a basic uninteresting rectangular appearance without ergonomic considerations.  Plus, many trimmers currently available have wet/dry capacity where this trimmer cannot be used in the shower.  While neither point is detrimental to this face and body trimmer&#x27;s effectiveness, it may invoke less interest with younger generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some ways, Conair doesn&#x27;t appear to have kept up with the times and their competition.  Whether they have or not, the Conair GMT1 all-in-one face and body trimmer is an effective men&#x27;s grooming tool.  The power base provides plenty of consistent power performance, even at low charge levels, and the storage tray keeps attachments organized and handy for quick touch ups.  Plus, the assorted attachments work well making the Conair GMT1 all-in-one face and body trimmer definitely worth considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Limited 2 year warranty&lt;br /&gt;Storage tray provides recharging and organization&lt;br /&gt;Includes five useful trimming heads&lt;br /&gt;Use cordless with consistent power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Outdated appearance&lt;br /&gt;Cannot be used in the showerized and handy for quick touch ups.

    <li> Comparing the Conair to another trimmer I have, the Conair&#x27;s motor is much better - works quietly and sounds well-made. This DOES translate in to smooth trimming. The main trim attachment that you use for your sideburns or body work really well and the adjustments actually make a difference (unlike other trimmers like this). I don&#x27;t find the mini-trimmer all that useful since I think the regular trimmer does just a fine job. I did try it on my nose and I didn&#x27;t like that at all - I prefer the round type nose trimmer. The regular shaver part is fine - not exceptional. I have to go over my beard a few times to get every whisker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like how the Conair feels in my hand and it has a nice balanced weight to it, without being heavy. If the price is right, then get it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a nice weight and appears to be high quality.  It has so many attachments, that we put them in a ziploc and threw out the base.  The foil shavers seem kind of useless, but we liked the nose trimmer piece and the plain blade with no attachment (for back of the neck).  My husband keeps his hair very very short and you can even use one of the attachments for cutting his hair, though it is probably meant for beards. The only thing I thought was lacking was an eyebrow trimmer, though it is possible one of the small facial hair tools could do the job.  My husband says if you could only have one grooming tool on a desert island, this would be the one.</li>
    <li> A well-though-out trimmer for the neck up, but not the best body groomer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a cordless trimmer, this one packs a lot of power, and its battery lasts a long, long time. It excels at beard and sideburn trimming and noise hair trimming. The mini trimmer is not that useful unless you are some sort of manscaping artist.  The body trimmer and foil trimmer pulls on hairs and is best avoided. I do not think this makes a really good body hair trimmer unless you don&#x27;t mind intermittent pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing the heads is rather difficult. They are hard to pull off once they are on. Also, none none of the attachments can be used wet or cleaned while attached to the body of the trimmer. This is unlike some of the other shavers and body trimmers on the market, and is definitely missed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combs and heads fit into slots in the included base. The power cord can be channeled into the base of the stand, to allow you to charge the shaver in it. Everything is very lightweight, though, so everything is easily toppled over. My last trimmer came with a mesh bag for the accessories, which I think is even handier than a base.</li>
    <li> This is a great little multi-use shaver.  It&#x27;s very light, looks good, good battery, has a lot of attachments to choose from, can be corded or cordless.  It comes with:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Beard and Mustache Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;2.  Body Groomer&lt;br /&gt;3.  Nose and Ear Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;4.  Detailing Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;5.  Foil Shaver&lt;br /&gt;6.  Precision Comb Attachments for different lengths of cut&lt;br /&gt;7.  Storage Base&lt;br /&gt;8.  Little brush tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Storage Base is very simple plastic.  You need to run the power cable down along the underside where the power cord sticks up through a hole in the base.  There is a little screw that tightens the little plastic keeper that will hold the power cord in place.  Then you can set the Trimmer in the base and charge it.  You can keep all the attachments on the base as well.  It does keep everything well organized and handy - but then you lose the option to quickly use the power cable for anything else such as corded use.  This option does take up a little bit of counter space too.  A more space-saving option would be to buy a little case to put the Trimmer, Power Cable, and all accessories in and toss the cheap plastic base.  You can plug the power cable directly into the Trimmer for corded use or to charge the battery.  This is the way to go if you want to save counter space or want to travel with the unit.  It would have been nice if it came with such a case - I actually would have preferred a case to the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit came with plenty of charge straight out of the box and the battery life is very quick charging and impressive.  It&#x27;s a very versatile and light unit.  It may feel a little cheap because of how light it is, but that makes it great for travel.  I like how easy it is to change out all the attachments.  It is plastic - so I do feel like you must be careful when switching out the attachments and I don&#x27;t think it would survive a serious drop.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like a solid, quality unit, but it actually works really well.  It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do and it cuts hair quickly and efficiently.  Blades are very sharp and there is no pulling of hair as it clips.  That and the great price makes this a great value.  I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you could spend more money for a more solid, dedicated unit.  But for the price and versatility, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  It would make for a great gift and travel unit.It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do and it cuts hair quickly and efficiently.

    <li> This trimmer has worked well for the men in my house, who inform me that it is powerful and the  different attachments all perform well.  I have doubts about how long all those attachments will hang around, and don&#x27;t care for the flimsy plastic stand that is included for storage.  A bag would have been much better.  Still, the men are happy and well trimmed, so who&#x27;s to argue?</li>
    <li> While they might not be the most stylish pair of clippers you&#x27;ve laid eyes on, they are very effective and do exactly what they are supposed to do. The attachments are a nice touch, but one that most people will never fully utilize. Personally, the nose trimmer is the only one I&#x27;ve tried and it seemed to work very well. This is a quality item from Conair, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that the pricepoint is a bit high, so I&#x27;ve docked it one star. I know I&#x27;ve purchased Remington trimmers in the past that have done just as good of a job for a fraction of the cost, so if you&#x27;re budget conscious, you may want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, give this trimmer a chance and you will be very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaving kit for a couple of weeks now and my overall impressions are mixed.&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomically, it is in my opinion easy to use. No obtrusive button placements like some other shavers have. It also feels sturdy, is lightweight and small; despite looking cheap. It is average to above average in terms of loudness. The shaving performance is decent; dont expect a close shave. The attachments are easy to slide out or install. I didnt like the comb attachments; they are a hard plastic and irritate me during use. Overall its an ok shaving kit but im not sure i would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> The main trimmer is pretty good. The blades are sharp and cut cleanly and effectively. The guides also work well and have a decent range of lengths.The mini trimmer and nose trimmer also work very well, and I put it to them to a lot of use. I&#x27;m not very happy with the foil trimmer - I feel like it just doesn&#x27;t remove as much hair as it should. The body trimmer is horrible. I feel like it pulls and breaks my hair. It hurts and is ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, this trimmer doesn&#x27;t really excel at any one task, and falls very short on some. The battery life is good at over an hour, and I like the option to use it corded as well. but I do find it a bit under-powered for cutting through coarse hair.</li>
    <li> This little Face and Body Trimmer works quite well.  There are several small attachments available for various aspects of trimming the face and body.  The nice thing is that it works without or without a cord.  I like the length of the cord, as you can work on someone else while in the bathroom.  However, this is not meant for the shower if you do body trimming.  Not waterproof, but that is not a critical element.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This includes several types of trimmers, thus indicating you will have to attach and remove pieces, which could be challenging, small pieces getting lost.  But, there is a nice plastic base to store all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments include:  Foil Shaver; Beard &amp; Mustache Trimmer; Body Groomer; Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer; Detailing Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The All in One Face and Body Trimmer is lightweight, and the motor is powerful.  If you took this on a trip, you may need to rethink how it will be packed, as it is not easily packed for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good motor, nice base for storage, works well!  Rizzo</li>
    <li> Unlike most clippers that are designed to be used for a single purpose (such as trimming facial hair) this tries to cover all the bases by providing attachments for pretty much every possible trimmer use. For the most part it succeeds, but there&#x27;s one attachment that falls WAY short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is pretty good. It is lightweight but feels sufficiently solid that I get the impression it will last a decent amount of time. The various attachments click on/off the handle solidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is comfortable to hold, but would benefit from some non-slip grip points for a more secure feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power is excellent - the lithium battery really makes a difference. It comes with a nicely designed stand that holds all the attachments plus the trimmer. It can be charged while it&#x27;s in the holder or by plugging it in outside of the holder. There&#x27;s a clear battery indicator that shows charging in action/full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer - the star of the show and the best performer. The blades are sharp and cut cleanly. The hair guide adapters are well-designed with index marks that are clearly visible so you can set it to a specific hair length and be assured it&#x27;s at the correct position before you start trimming. The position guides are a little loose (e.g., the guides can move somewhat easily) but provided you take care when using it, they maintain their position during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mini trimmer - also very sharp. Great for edging around a mustache or for getting errant hairs here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foil trimmer - as with every mini foil trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used it provides nowhere near the performance of even a low-end electric shaver, but it&#x27;s workable for small touch-ups and detail edging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nose trimmer - surprisingly good! I usually avoid the rotating trimmers since they tend to pull more hair than cut, but this works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body trimmer - throw it out. Don&#x27;t even think about manscaping with this tool. The hair guide edges are sharp, pointy and painful. The foil pulls more hair than it cuts, and the ergonomics are all wrong for easy use. Trimming the shrubbery under the great oak requires a device that is much better built (I&#x27;d strongly suggest the Norelco line of body groomers -- they are designed specifically for body grooming, and do it very well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poor body trimmer knocks it down a star, but it does everything else well. It&#x27;s worth considering if you&#x27;re looking for a versatile trimmer with decent build quality. I&#x27;d also suggest cross-shopping this against models from Norelco and Wahl since prices fluctuate a lot.k about manscaping with this tool. The hair guide edges are sharp, pointy and painful.

    <li> This is a neat little trimmer.  It&#x27;s been about three weeks and the battery is still going on the initial charge. I&#x27;ve used it to trim my mustache, beard, sideburns, and a little lazy man&#x27;s haircut around the ears.  Now it has multiple attachments, and I haven&#x27;t use them all, and I probably won&#x27;t use the nose hair trimmer...there is something about shoving a shiny thing up my nose that creeks me out.... probably too much syfy.  Overall, the trimmer has a sleek design, easy to grip, eyeball appearance and works well.  The attachment for body trim does ok on arms... my wife is still a little miffed ... but the hair is growing back on the small area that I demo&#x27;ed on her arm.</li>
    <li> despite the promises, this doesn&#x27;t measure up.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work powerfully, and at times feels uneven and the cutting mechanism actually pinches at times.  Also, as I set it it seemed as if it wasn&#x27;t giving a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;m unsure how to clean this in terms of disinfecting it...I can clean the hair out but is it safe for alcohol to rinse it?  Not liking this one.</li>
    <li> This is a really high quality shaver.  It feels very well made and has a lot of power.  The unit includes different heads for just about everything you can imaging doing (beard, nose/ear, shaving, body).  It also includes comb attachments for trimming and body grooming.  The unit includes a stand to hold all of the attachments and to hold the unit while it is charging.  This stand is really nice and keeps everything organized and in a place.  The attachments go on easily and can be easily washed under the sink.  I think the stand for this is the best part!  It does perform all tasks nicely (trimmer works great and basic comb allows for basic trimming for specific hair length, precision trimmer works great, foil is great for shaving [unit has a lot of power so the foil works pretty good, but I still use a razor for shaving], body works well [foil/trimmer], and nose and ear trimmer are a nice bonus for a unit like this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this unit is that it cannot be used in the Shower.  This (in my opinion) makes the body groomer part of this useless, since I do not want hair all over the floor. I usually use a body groomer in the shower so the shower can wash the hair away as I shave (I actually do all of my shaving/trimming/grooming in the shower).  You can use this in the shower with no water and than wash off, but that is odd.  This would be a perfect item if it could be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end this is a great all in one device.  It has a nice feel in your hands using any of the attachments and has a lot of power for a nice close shave/trim.  The stand makes this great for keeping everything in one place and keeping it charged and you can use the unit while it is plugged in (charging) - great when you need to trim and the battery is dead.  If you do not mind having to shave/trim/groom outside of the shower this is a great item and the stand makes this a well organized easy to use unit!</li>
    <li> Short recommendation: unless you need the full range of attachments, and are willing to be swapping them regularly, you&#x27;re probably better off with something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is like a lot of similar &amp;#34;grooming kits&amp;#34;: A wide collection of attachments, most of which are completely expendable.  But it comes with a cute little stand to hold all of them and also &amp;#34;dock&amp;#34; the trimmer for charging.  But the cuteness and all the attachments don&#x27;t really mean much unless the attachments you use work well.  What I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Nose/ear hair trimmer: this works very well.  Unlike similar trimmers I&#x27;ve tried, there is no pain when using this.  It trims the hair rather than ripping it out.  There is an odd smell, almost like something is burning/overheating.  Not sure what to think about that.  But of the attachments, this is the one that I will keep attached most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The &amp;#34;foil&amp;#34; attachment: this is the one that ought to give you the smoothest grooming.  I tried it on my neck and found that it does a poor job.  I&#x27;ll stick with a manual razor and shaving cream for that task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The adjustable length trimmer is decent enough for trimming my beard and mustache, but it doesn&#x27;t offer as much range or precision as I can get from the Panasonic Milano Series ER-GB40-S I&#x27;ve been using for the past year.  It, too, features a rechargeable battery, and has held up very well so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I haven&#x27;t used the rest of the attachments, nor do I expect to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that changing attachments is a real pain.  Some of the attachments are very hard to remove: you have to push pretty hard to get one to &amp;#34;pop off&amp;#34; before putting on the next attachment.  For a product that is boastful of its wide range of attachments, it really needs to make swapping a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other similar grooming kits out there that do a better job than this.  I can&#x27;t see a strong reason to recommend this one.ee a strong reason to recommend this one.</li>
    <li> This is a very versatile face and body trimmer that has quite a lot of attachments.  If there is any body hair you are wanting to trim chances are this guy can handle it.  It also does so in a way that doesn&#x27;t seem to create unnecessary skin irritation.  My only nit is that it doesn&#x27;t feel very ergonomic to hold, which can be a bit problematic if your hands are slippery.  Overall a nice trimmer though.</li>
    <li> Compared to similar products (e.g., Norelco), this is not bad. It&#x27;s got a wider variety of attachments and each of them seems to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two problems I had with this product are:&lt;br /&gt;- Some of the attachments get hot *very* quickly. Move swiftly, or it will become quite uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;- As other reviewers have mentioned, switching the attachments is annoying. It&#x27;s not hard and there&#x27;s no risk of breaking them, but compared to other products, this one is a little annoying.</li>
    <li> I have used only 2 attachments from this&lt;br /&gt;  (1) Nasal hair trimmer&lt;br /&gt;  (2) Side burns trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And both these do an excellent job as much as what I get in my Panasonic trimmer.  Which one is better Panasonic or Conair ?  It is hard to say, I have been using Panasonic for over 10 years now and they literally last for ever  - except the batteries which I hate to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about Conair is the lithium ion batteries which is rechargeable, I have to see how long it lasts - so far, I am liking it !</li>
    <li> I wanted an shaver/trimmer that does it all and the Conair Lithium Ion Face &amp; Body All-in-One Trimmer delivered.  I like the convenience of this cordless, compact trimmer, and the rechargeable lithium battery keeps it trimming as long as I need it.  I use it primarily for shaving and trimming the moustache that I enjoy growing on occasion.  It is pretty good for initial bulk shaving of my legs (that&#x27;s right!) for cycling and swimming but only down to 0.5mm, so I still have to use a regular shaver to remove any remaining stubble.  It also keeps my hairline, and sideburns nice and clean cut.  Additional functions include Nose and Ear Trimmer which I use on occasion for an unexpected nose hair.  All this in a neat and organized storage base.  No travel pouch or case included.</li>
    <li> Things I like&lt;br /&gt;- holds a charge for a long time&lt;br /&gt;- Attachment go on and come off easily&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- ear and nose hair attachment works well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thing i am not crazy about.&lt;br /&gt;- does not cut head hair well&lt;br /&gt;- uneven results with the beard&lt;br /&gt;- does not seem powerful enough&lt;br /&gt;- hard to get it to charge correctly when propped up in the stand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shopped for awhile to find the perfect all around trimmer for the price. This seemed to have everything i was looking for and none of the reviews really hated it. It is an ok trimmer that has lots of attachments. It does everything but it is mediocre. I have to work extra long to get it to trim my beard properly. I have used it to cut my own hair and that job is long and tedious. What works best is the ear and nose trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It is an ok trimmer for the price. I do not have any others to compare it to at this time. Perhaps next year</li>
