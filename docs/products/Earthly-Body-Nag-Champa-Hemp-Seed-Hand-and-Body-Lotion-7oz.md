      <li>Great cream, it leaves your hands feeling soft without the greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;i receved it very quickly.</li>
      <li>It comes in different color the purple one is nice and smell good.</li>
      <li>is a good brand but not this particular one.</li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t have to spray strong perfume.</li>
      <li>Overly strong scent, once it fades</li>
      <li>needs more nag smell, but overall not greasy, good absorption, lasts until next shower and goes great with glow oil and body spary</li>

      <li>When I first smelled it.</li>
      <li>Softens your hands very well and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>It is too much to use alone</li>
      <li>Has too much of a baby powder odor to it for me.</li>
      <li>Worth re-ordering, because I layer it with a nag champa perfume oil and get constant positive feedback!</li>
      <li>This particular smell was a little strong but not bad.</li>
      <li>There are other things you need to beware of that I am not allowed to post and is why I decided to give this a 3 star :)</li>
      <li>i highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>It lingers fairly long and isn&#x27;t overpowering, but strong enough that I have received compliments when wearing it.</li>
      <li>It seems to lose that &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; feeling not long after applying, and I wish that lotioned feeling hung around longer like the scent does.</li>
      <li>; It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, too, even in the cold, dry weather we&#x27;ve been having.</li>

<li> a subtle and soothing nag champa smell, much like actual nag champa incense.</li>

<li> Reminds me of a little Hippie Girl I know at the beach...</li>
<li> even after few times washing ,your hands smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> I use it everyday; no need for perfume.</li>

    <li> I love this lotion, makes skin so soft and of course has the best Nag Champa scent, not overpowering and soaks in quickly. One of my kitties, Ava, loves it too, rubs all over my arms when I put it on. Love that it is made with hemp and all the benefits that comes with that!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best ever!! I absolutely love it.  The smell stays with you all day!  It&#x27;s the greatest.</li>
    <li> Overly strong scent, once it fades it&#x27;s tolerable. Has too much of a baby powder odor to it for me. I wear Nag Champa fragrance oil all the time. This smells nothing like it. The lotion itself is okay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this lotion!  It smells so good, I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>

    <li> The aroma was too overpowering. I could not use it. The aroma, which is probably from the patchouli or other essential oils in it, would be distracting in a work setting.</li>
    <li> I love nag champa.  This lotion does not skimp on scent.  It is too much to use alone so I cut it with an unscented lotion.  Will definitely buy again.</li>

    <li> Uh, Yeah . . . Nag champa everything for MOI. Every time someone hugs me or get close, they always ask &amp;#34;What are you wearing?&amp;#34; Yeah . . .</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so yummy. When I first smelled it. I asked if there was incense burning somewhere, but it was my friends lotion. I had to buy it right away. I use it when i go out on my arms. So I don&#x27;t have to spray strong perfume. It smells like a yoga class. Very calm, peaceful and INTERESTING.</li>
    <li> This smells FABULOUS! All day, people comment on the fragrance...&amp;#34;Someone is burning incense..&amp;#34; It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, too, even in the cold, dry weather we&#x27;ve been having. I love it!</li>
