      <li>It applies easily and evenly.</li>
      <li>They are so creamy that they spread easily on your lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find &amp;#34;Not Just Nudes&amp;#34; in any of the stores near me and was delighted when I found out I could buy it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Good neutral colors too and the two with shine act similar to eye brightener that I own.</li>
      <li>These are great natural colors and are quick and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Very good coverage and only need to use your finger to apply....great for quick makeup in the am.</li>
      <li>Overall great product.</li>
      <li>There is a light color that can be used as a primer and also matte tones</li>
      <li>I ordered the free shipping and handling, the one that takes 5 to 8 days, and it came 2 or 3 days afterwards.</li>
      <li>These are great but they don&#x27;t last all</li>
      <li>Great, smooth cream eye shadow that lasts long and goes on easily and evenly with your fingertips.</li>
      <li>The color lasts all day and still looks rich with color at days end.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pale, translucent even and have blue/green eyes and its absolutely wonderful.  </li>
      <li>because I don&#x27;t put too much on or I&#x27;m just made of magic, lol, but this is really worth it, especially for beginners like myself.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use very much either, the shadow is very smooth and goes right on.  </li>
      <li>Love the colors soooo much.</li>
      <li>good for short time wear because it starts to crease.</li>
      <li>I love natural looking makeup for my everyday look and this eyeshadow is the best.</li>
      <li>my my fair irish skin</li>
      <li>It was reasonably priced, but still a better deal than it was sold for.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the best things are not the most expensive.</li>
      <li>With this shadow the color lasts all day-even when I was outdoors when it was very hot and humid.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
      <li>The great little case can be conveniently tossed in your purse.  </li>
      <li>The colors are great, application super easy, and they are really long lasting.</li>
      <li>The price was right for this set.  </li>
      <li>These are really beautiful Nude Brown shades: a light beige (good for highlighting below the brow), a slightly shimmery beige, a medium brown and a darker brown (a little goes a very long way with the darker brown).</li>
      <li>This is definitely one of my favorite eyeshadow palettes.</li>
      <li>I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>Pretty colors.  </li>
      <li>The Not Just Nudes set is my favorite so far, you can use any of the four colors and achive a very natural look.</li>
      <li>the lack of staying power makes it only good for times when I only need my makeup to stay for an hour or two.</li>
      <li>I really like the cream shadows better than any regular powdery shadows I have ever gotten.</li>
      <li>Shades are matte to slightly pearl, good for mature eyelids!</li>
      <li>Washes off easily with facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>This is a combination of soft natural colors that blend easily.  </li>
      <li>lot of it does stay on the eyelid, but by lunchtime you need to reapply because so much of it is in the crease (I have heard that using primer helps).  </li>
      <li>It stays on really well.</li>
      <li>If you take the skin colored shadow and smooth a regular powder eyeshadow over it, the eyeshadow stays on longer!</li>
      <li>I always try to keep my makeup fresh and natural looking...</li>
      <li>I can not garuntee any thing, but it worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>but when she has to put make-up on for a wedding or something she knows to come borrow this stuff because it always looks natural, not artificial.</li>
      <li>would highly reccomend this eyeshadow set!</li>
      <li>you are ready.</li>
      <li>Wears very well.</li>
      <li>Have used this for a little while and really love it.  </li>
      <li>This would be my perfect eye color palatte (the brown really makes my blue eyes pop), but unfortunately, halfway through the day half of the eyeshadow has migrated to the crease of my eye, and while trying to rub it back into my lid I end up with more on my finger than on my eyelids.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They apply nice and smoothly and if you have issues with it creasing, just dust your lids with powder base first.</li>
      <li>You can apply it with your fingertip, but I prefer to use an eye shadow brush (not those little sponges that come with most shadows, but an actual brush).</li>
      <li>The lightest color really brightens up my eyes and then the next shade over makes the color pop.  </li>
      <li>This just looks so natural and earthy.</li>
      <li>Boy was I completely blown away</li>
      <li>Its different from many other standard powdered eye shadows because its a creme.</li>
      <li>It really brightens up my eyeshadow &amp; makes it last twice as long !</li>
      <li>As a new mom, I&#x27;m determined to still get out of the house with at least a little makeup to make me feel a bit more put together.</li>
      <li>Whatever color you put on with any other color in this set will always go with your natural color and make your eyes glow in such a natural shinning way.  </li>

    <li> Love this eyeshadow, goes on and stays on with no smudging</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its different from many other standard powdered eye shadows because its a creme. It applies easily and evenly. You can apply it with your fingertip, but I prefer to use an eye shadow brush (not those little sponges that come with most shadows, but an actual brush). Using the brush seems to help the color last longer and prevents creasing.     The Not Just Nudes set is my favorite so far, you can use any of the four colors and achive a very natural look. I always try to keep my makeup fresh and natural looking... nothing too heavy... and this shadow is perfect for that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the best with makeup and the more colors there are to a palate the more indecisive I become.  For some reason I started thinking about buying Coastal Scents warm palate because I&#x27;ve used one of my friends shadows and they were great.  However, erring to the side of cost I found this revlon shadow for about 5 bucks at target and figured, why not?    Well, The colors all blend nicely with one another and makes for a great daytime or even evening shadow.  I&#x27;m very pale, translucent even and have blue/green eyes and its absolutely wonderful.  The lightest color really brightens up my eyes and then the next shade over makes the color pop.  I don&#x27;t need to use very much either, the shadow is very smooth and goes right on.  I&#x27;ve used powder eye-shadows and the colors always come out dull and never stays-I find myself reapplying often.  With this shadow the color lasts all day-even when I was outdoors when it was very hot and humid.  I don&#x27;t know if its because I don&#x27;t put too much on or I&#x27;m just made of magic, lol, but this is really worth it, especially for beginners like myself.</li>
    <li> I must have a dozen sets of these eyeshadows, I love the texture and colors of them. They apply nice and smoothly and if you have issues with it creasing, just dust your lids with powder base first.</li>
    <li> I have used this eye shadow since Revlon put it on the market.  The texture is great. It&#x27;s just creamy enough to glide on but then stays on all day and into the restaurant hour.  There is a light color that can be used as a primer and also matte tones but I love the shimmery ones.  They are just shimmery enough for the over 50 gals and they stay put. I have not been able to find &amp;#34;Not Just Nudes&amp;#34; in any of the stores near me and was delighted when I found out I could buy it from Amazon. As usual it was on my door step in two days.</li>
    <li> Sometimes the best things are not the most expensive.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  Goes on perfect and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> These are really beautiful Nude Brown shades: a light beige (good for highlighting below the brow), a slightly shimmery beige, a medium brown and a darker brown (a little goes a very long way with the darker brown).

    <li> I like the cream eye shadow.  Doesn&#x27;t leave creases.</li>
    <li> Shiny stuff irritates my eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the easiest eye-shadow to put on, and it makes your eyes look the brightest.  Whatever color you put on with any other color in this set will always go with your natural color and make your eyes glow in such a natural shinning way.  My friend hates make-up but when she has to put make-up on for a wedding or something she knows to come borrow this stuff because it always looks natural, not artificial.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that these are really beautiful colors! It was difficult to choose just one case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of it does stay on the eyelid, but by lunchtime you need to reapply because so much of it is in the crease (I have heard that using primer helps).  In a pinch, you can reapply this with a finger which is a plus.  The great little case can be conveniently tossed in your purse.  They are so creamy that they spread easily on your lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a great bargain for $4.99!</li>
    <li> Wanted to try cream shadow. The price was right for this set.  This is not crease proof shadow. The color faded a bit by the end of the day.  May not work on oily skin.  Colors are very nice and can be used when not wanting to wear too much make-up.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t crease but does seem to fade a little by the end of the work day, but I do not wear any primer. Shades are matte to slightly pearl, good for mature eyelids!</li>
    <li> This just looks so natural and earthy. Wears very well. Sometimes I do a touch up if going out. Will for sure buy product  again.</li>
    <li> These are great but they don&#x27;t last all day/:</li>
    <li> Have used this for a little while and really love it.  It stays on all day and blends nicely.</li>
    <li> It does not look even for a long time. Has to reapply</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is somewhat expensive, glides on well but not my fav color.</li>
    <li> * I use the Revlon Cream Shadows to use as a base  * They provide a sufficient pigmentation for a base  * I always use my Revlon, L&#x27;Oreal or MAC eyeshadows over it.  * A good find for the price.</li>
    <li> My wife loved the makeup.  It is high quality and it is the perfect match for her skin color.</li>
    <li> Love this eye shadow.  Easy to put on.  Can&#x27;t always find it at my local stores.</li>
    <li> Love the colors soooo much. It works perfectly on darker skin tones !</li>
    <li> PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product and wanted to try it out. I instantly fell in love with it. I really like the cream shadows better than any regular powdery shadows I have ever gotten. It stays on really well. TIP: If you take the skin colored shadow and smooth a regular powder eyeshadow over it, the eyeshadow stays on longer! It works like a primer! The colors are also very nude, so the possibilities are endless without looking like you are trying to hard. Overall great product. The only con to this product is that you have to put it on with your finger, otherwise it will not pick up on a brush,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICING&lt;br /&gt;I thought the price was a very good deal, and that is all I can say. It was reasonably priced, but still a better deal than it was sold for. Absoloutly wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHIPPING AND HANDLING.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, Revlon. I ordered the free shipping and handling, the one that takes 5 to 8 days, and it came 2 or 3 days afterwards. I can not garuntee any thing, but it worked very well for me. It also came without a single scratch. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the tiny package it comes in!</li>
    <li> This is a combination of soft natural colors that blend easily.  The colors can be worn with a sheer translucent look or applied a little heavier for a darker creamier depth.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and didn&#x27;t crease. The color lasts all day and still looks rich with color at days end. Washes off easily with facial cleanser. One of my staple favorites.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of my favorite eyeshadow palettes. I love natural looking makeup for my everyday look and this eyeshadow is the best. The colors are great, application super easy, and they are really long lasting. I sometimes use them as a base for other shadows, but they can definitely stand on their own.</li>
    <li> good for short time wear because it starts to crease. texture is good but not as pigmented.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and shades.</li>
    <li> Great quality product. color is great my my fair irish skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of cream shadows but this one is really great. It lasts long and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> Okay so I got this pallete because I thought it would be perfect to do nude everyday looks ! Boy was I completely blown away these colors are gorgeous .  I even sometimes use the darkest shade as a eyeshadow primer . It really brightens up my eyeshadow &amp; makes it last twice as long ! I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again .</li>
    <li> I heart these. As a new mom, I&#x27;m determined to still get out of the house with at least a little makeup to make me feel a bit more put together. These are great natural colors and are quick and easy to use. Just swipe on a bit, add some mascara and gloss, boom you are ready.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and I have used this brand for years and will continue to do so, well worth buying it</li>
    <li> Pretty colors, a great buy.  No irritation unlike other products that I have used.  Wish it lasted a little longer.  Have bought in the plum shade as well.</li>
    <li> These came in really nice colors that go well together! I&#x27;m Asian, and these look great with my skin tone :) My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not fit for oilier skin, as after a while, you cannot see the color at all.</li>
    <li> I love cream makeup and needed these colors.  I wear this almost daily.</li>
    <li> Good eyeshadow.  I like that it goes on easy and stays put.  Pretty colors.  My go-to eye shadow when I&#x27;m in a hurry because of ease of use.</li>
    <li> These cream shadows are great! They go on, stay in place, don&#x27;t smear, wear all day, don&#x27;t leave a weird residue on your cheek and wash off easily.</li>
