      <li>and this was the best price</li>
      <li>99 44/100% of the items I buy from amazon are perfect!!!!</li>
      <li>good buy for the money!</li>
      <li>Great costumer service.</li>
      <li>I started using it on my toes and it looks great.  </li>
      <li>I thought it had to be a lol moist</li>
      <li>and they make your nails look great.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this pencil!!</li>
      <li>Good price, good product.  </li>
      <li>Pencils are of good length and as others have stated, they hold the color well.</li>
      <li>Apparently good, wifey says.</li>
      <li>I thought this was a great idea, but I ended up with more of the whiteness on my finger tips than under my nails.  </li>
      <li>Great pencil to give your nails a more polished look.</li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>This nail pencil is amazing</li>
      <li>Kind of defeats the purpose of using it.</li>
      <li>I love these pencils.  </li>
      <li>I intend to order a couple more of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We both love them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m dissapointed, after reading the reviews I was hoping for a better product.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for when the nail brush is just not enough.</li>
      <li>and I love using this pencil.</li>
      <li>They may want to include an appropriate sharpener with the product.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Make sure to dampen the underside of your nail b/c wetting the pencil alone won&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>A sewer, crafter, gardener, my nails are not my best feature, I only use polish to try to keep them from breaking.  </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;d be better off if I could find something in a liquid.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say I love it.</li>
      <li>This is great for a night out if you just want to touch up your nails to make the ends look a little more polished and bright.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t break easily in using.  </li>
      <li>I guess it is better than nothing, but it is nothing special.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use and cheap.  </li>
      <li>Been searching for a replacement for the Revlon product...and this one fit the bill.</li>
      <li>My apprehension was justified.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to use this product, hoping to save some money by skipping the nail salon.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad so many other people liked it...</li>
      <li>This pencil was greasy so when you put it under your nail it would bleed so it required me to wipe and clean it up.  </li>
      <li>I helps me during the day to keep my nails looking clean after washing my hands.</li>
      <li>It makes a beautiful white tip and lasts pretty well.</li>
      <li>I wetted the tip and glided under my nails, but really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference from the top side.  </li>
      <li>It makes my manicure so easy and fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making this available.</li>
      <li>It keeps nails looking fresh and French-like clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great when especially now that natural nails are in.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t make me laugh.</li>
      <li>Gives a nice french manicure look without the polish.</li>
      <li>Washed right off.</li>
      <li>I love to use these for a quick truly natural-looking French manicure.</li>
      <li>I have a small herd of previously-orphaned kitty-kats, and I wash my hands a great deal after picking the cats up or holding them.</li>
      <li>Replaceing one that I have had for some 35 yrsor better, made by Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;Works just the same, and whitens nails.</li>
      <li>Once it&#x27;s wet it kind of goes everywhere.</li>
      <li>really wanted to use it and HAVE IT WORK!</li>
      <li>If you want it to last through an event or dinner or something, I suggest applying and then using hand santizer instead of washing :)</li>
      <li>Mine doesn&#x27;t last through more than a couple hand washings, however.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this nail white pencil.</li>
      <li>I just trim cuticles,  file, buff, apply a quick coat of clear polish, and then run this pencil under my nail tips for a lovely, natural-looking French manicure.</li>
      <li>works pretty good, just wet the tip and go back and forth under nails.</li>
      <li>These nail whitener pencils still work very well.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like this pencil.</li>
      <li>I think it works better wet.  </li>
      <li>TOO much work.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>I am a very obsessive gardener who often on impulse pulls weeds and sticks my hands in dirt...without gloves.</li>
      <li>This is a very inferior product and I would not recommend it.</li>
      <li>These ones don&#x27;t do much to whiten the nail.</li>
      <li>I really like how this pencil works.</li>
      <li>Nice white tips almost like a French manicure.</li>
      <li>it gives you that clean french manicure look and it stays on for hours</li>
      <li>Does a great job of whitening and is a hard enough consistency that it forms a point without crumbling during the sharpening process.  </li>
      <li>The pencilI ordered BARELY whitened my nails and rinsed right off when I washed my hands.</li>
      <li>The one from Ruby Crystal has better coverage but is much more expensive than this one, so I&#x27;ll probably stick with this.</li>
      <li>Other than the expected price increases over the years the pencil has never changed.. always good and reliable.</li>
      <li>It wears down pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>This new packaging also contains a new pencil.</li>
      <li>But I have sharpened both and the new one is horrid.</li>
      <li>The new one has a rounded finished bottom and who knows what it is made of.</li>
      <li>Some people have a problem with the white pencil becoming paste when they wet it to use under fingernails.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it will last two washes at most, as the white comes off too easily with water.</li>
      <li>I recieved my package fast, the only reason why I gave this 2 stars.</li>
      <li>But that white wipes right off leaving the white under the nail.  </li>
      <li>but so far I can&#x27;t find a decent white pencil</li>
      <li>I have used these nail pencils in the past and it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used nail whitening pencils in the past and can tell a huge difference</li>
      <li>I prefer this as the color quite is natural; It is not so bright white, that it looks too fake.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t say long at all no matter how much you attempt to put on.  </li>
      <li>Pencil lasts long and is very durable.</li>
      <li>searched then found this the price cost less than most other places.  </li>
      <li>Anyone who would use a sharp piece of plastic on their cuticles doesn&#x27;t know the first thing about manicures.</li>
      <li>The old pencil has an opened end on it so you can see the white.</li>
      <li>The nail white pencil is exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
      <li>Flowery pencil coverage is okay but not bright white.  </li>
      <li>This simple product does not require fiddling around wasting time literally watching the paint dry, but does  add a little more class to my very basic, utilitarian style.</li>
      <li>I used a pencil like this long ago that would really put a whiteness under the nail and even take care of any of those &amp;#34;clear spots&amp;#34; you can get on your nail when they are long after doing the dishes or anything else that got your nails oily.  </li>
      <li>I want the old Flowery nail white pencil back.</li>
      <li>So I tried it on my nails and was surprised at how long it stayed on.  </li>
      <li>Maybe because my nails are not long, but this thing did nothing for me.  </li>
      <li>However when I recently went to buy a new pencil (April 2015) and saw that they had changed the packaging by including a new cuticle pusher cap I became a little suspicious.</li>
      <li>I took away one star due to the high price.</li>
      <li>I was left with a large rounded tip that would never fit under my nails.</li>
      <li>Good but a little expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not what I&#x27;d hoped for but so far I can&#x27;t find a decent white pencil and I&#x27;ve tried plenty of them.</li>
    <li> Good but a little expensive. When I ordered it I thought it was a pack of three. My fault, i believe in the picture (three) but in the description it says it&#x27;s just one pencil.</li>
    <li> This pencil does not work! Waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  I think I&#x27;d be better off if I could find something in a liquid.  This pencil is like a crayon and doesn&#x27;t adhere well to the nail even when moistened.</li>
    <li> The nail white pencil is exactly what I wanted and expected. I took away one star due to the high price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used nail whitening pencils in the past and can tell a huge difference but this pencil didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I wanted. This  purchase for me was a wash.</li>
    <li> It took a couple tries to figure out how to use it. I thought it had to be a lol moist and I had to wash my hands without drying then use it. It&#x27;s amazing. Posted before and after pics.</li>
    <li> Good price, good product.  Doesn&#x27;t split when you sharpen it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I love it. It doesn&#x27;t make that big an impact on me. I do like it a lot! With the length of the pencil, I think it will last me a fairly long time. It does the job for which it was purchased.</li>
    <li> This pencil was greasy so when you put it under your nail it would bleed so it required me to wipe and clean it up.  TOO much work.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, never again.</li>
    <li> I love these pencils.  Some people have a problem with the white pencil becoming paste when they wet it to use under fingernails. My trick is to wash my hands and then use the dry pencil under my fingernails.  There is just enough water under the nails to moisten the pencil.  I wear these pencils down to a one inch stub.  Love them!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t break easily in using.  I know it is a small line between the pencil being too soft and breaking and this one which is firm and doesn&#x27;t dispense as much &amp;#34;white pencil&amp;#34; under the nails as I would like.</li>
    <li> The pencil did not work at all.  It just left a smeary chalky mess on my fingers without actually whitening the nail.</li>
    <li> I guess it is better than nothing, but it is nothing special.  I tried wet and dry, same, I tried to pile it under the nail, nothing different.</li>
    <li> I am a very obsessive gardener who often on impulse pulls weeds and sticks my hands in dirt...without gloves. So my green thumbs often have discolored nails. This is perfect for when the nail brush is just not enough. Gives a nice french manicure look without the polish.</li>
    <li> Flowery pencil coverage is okay but not bright white.  It wears down pretty quickly.  Make sure to dampen the underside of your nail b/c wetting the pencil alone won&#x27;t work.  The one from Ruby Crystal has better coverage but is much more expensive than this one, so I&#x27;ll probably stick with this.</li>
    <li> I think it works better wet.  It whitens the nail tip and looks like a real french manicure.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Not happy with this pencil.  Every time I sharpen it the tip breaks.</li>
    <li> the color doesn&#x27;t stick to my nails like my other brand</li>
    <li> terrible; doesn&#x27;t whiten nail at all; waste of money</li>
    <li> This nail pencil is amazing it gives you that clean french manicure look and it stays on for hours even if you shower and wash your hands it still stays on !</li>
    <li> This works great.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you have to wet it to use it and yes, it leaves white all over the tips of your fingers (and toes)-- But that white wipes right off leaving the white under the nail.  I started using it on my toes and it looks great.  So I tried it on my nails and was surprised at how long it stayed on.  It was easy to use and cheap.  Will definately buy it again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Washed right off.</li>
    <li> works pretty good, just wet the tip and go back and forth under nails.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this pencil!! I&#x27;ve looked for years!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like how this pencil works. It makes my manicure so easy and fast. It&#x27;s great when especially now that natural nails are in. I just trim cuticles,  file, buff, apply a quick coat of clear polish, and then run this pencil under my nail tips for a lovely, natural-looking French manicure. My only complaint is that it will last two washes at most, as the white comes off too easily with water.</li>
    <li> Great pencil to give your nails a more polished look. Lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Maybe because my nails are not long, but this thing did nothing for me.  Moist or dry the only white it left was on my fingertips, not under my nails.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Great costumer service. I like the pencil.</li>
    <li> I recieved my package fast, the only reason why I gave this 2 stars. This product doesn&#x27;t work. I keep on applying it under my nail, but you can&#x27;t even tell. I&#x27;m dissapointed, after reading the reviews I was hoping for a better product.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a long time for one of these. I bought two. One for me and one for my sister. We both love them.</li>
    <li> I prefer this as the color quite is natural; It is not so bright white, that it looks too fake.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Doesn&#x27;t even glide on the nail. Useless. This is a joke. Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> This is great for a night out if you just want to touch up your nails to make the ends look a little more polished and bright. Mine doesn&#x27;t last through more than a couple hand washings, however. But it&#x27;s still convenient for the price. Just touched up my nails for dinner tonight. If you want it to last through an event or dinner or something, I suggest applying and then using hand santizer instead of washing :)</li>
    <li> Apparently good, wifey says. Would recommend to someone. I&#x27;m just trying to get a deal on multiple color set or something in the future.</li>
    <li> My fingernails were always dingy from smoking and handling newspapers. Now I read newspapers on a tablet and leave Lady Nicotine alone, but I still treasure these whitening pencils. Moisten one and run it under your nails, and you will have that finished look.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this product, hoping to save some money by skipping the nail salon.  I wetted the tip and glided under my nails, but really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference from the top side.  It&#x27;s not like I have thick nails either.  If you&#x27;re expecting your nail tips to be a shade whiter with this product, you will be disappointed.  Also, you will end up with white all over the tips of your fingers if you wet the pencil before use.  Once it&#x27;s wet it kind of goes everywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pencil for years. I helps me during the day to keep my nails looking clean after washing my hands.</li>
    <li> Could not find in a store and tried on line.  Just like we use to use back in the 60s</li>
    <li> I used these when I was a teenager in the 50&#x27;s!!! I used them and the white stayed under the nail. It only stayed on for a few minutes. I didnt wet my hands or anything but it did not stay under the nail. Kind of defeats the purpose of using it. I got it with my points from my amazon card, but somehow i feel deflated. really wanted to use it and HAVE IT WORK! thats okay 99 44/100% of the items I buy from amazon are perfect!!!!</li>
    <li> These pencils have been around forever and they make your nails look great. Nice white tips almost like a French manicure.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this pencil. It doesn&#x27;t say long at all no matter how much you attempt to put on.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great idea, but I ended up with more of the whiteness on my finger tips than under my nails.  And it didn&#x27;t last long on my nails.  I&#x27;m glad so many other people liked it...it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I used a pencil like this long ago that would really put a whiteness under the nail and even take care of any of those &amp;#34;clear spots&amp;#34; you can get on your nail when they are long after doing the dishes or anything else that got your nails oily.  These ones don&#x27;t do much to whiten the nail.</li>
    <li> I love to use these for a quick truly natural-looking French manicure. I dip the pencil in water and use it under each nail. It makes a beautiful white tip and lasts pretty well.</li>
    <li> I have used Flowery nail pencil for the past 20+ years, probably longer than that. Other than the expected price increases over the years the pencil has never changed.. always good and reliable. However when I recently went to buy a new pencil (April 2015) and saw that they had changed the packaging by including a new cuticle pusher cap I became a little suspicious. My apprehension was justified. This new packaging also contains a new pencil. A real lousy one at that. When I went to sharpen it the white just crumbled. I was left with a large rounded tip that would never fit under my nails. I kept sharpening it and it went from a 7&amp;#34; pencil down to 3&amp;#34; without even being used. The old pencil has an opened end on it so you can see the white. The new one has a rounded finished bottom and who knows what it is made of. But I have sharpened both and the new one is horrid. And the cuticle pusher they give you !!! don&#x27;t make me laugh. Anyone who would use a sharp piece of plastic on their cuticles doesn&#x27;t know the first thing about manicures.Their idea of new and improved is to offer a horrible cheap product for the same money. Please tell your retailer or Amazon if your findings are like mine. I want the old Flowery nail white pencil back.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this nail white pencil. The white stays under my nails through numerous hand washing throughout the day, and works just as well as the Revlon brand did in days gone by. After each use, I leave the cap OFF until the white of the pencil is completely dry so as not to break the point of the pencil. I intend to order a couple more of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated: March 13, 2013. These nail whitener pencils still work very well. I have a small herd of previously-orphaned kitty-kats, and I wash my hands a great deal after picking the cats up or holding them. This morning, as usual, I washed my hands and applied the nail whitener, and after having already washed my hands several times today, the nail whitener still coats the under part of my nails. Now that flu season is here, i wash my hands thoroughly for about 20 seconds each time, and the tips of my nails still look white. I cannot understand why anyone would have problems using this product.</li>
    <li> Looked all over and couldn&#x27;t find this product, which I had previously used.  A sewer, crafter, gardener, my nails are not my best feature, I only use polish to try to keep them from breaking.  This simple product does not require fiddling around wasting time literally watching the paint dry, but does  add a little more class to my very basic, utilitarian style. Thanks for making this available.</li>
    <li> Pencil lasts long and is very durable. It keeps nails looking fresh and French-like clean.&lt;br /&gt;a good buy for the money!</li>
    <li> Not very good. White does  not appear&lt;br /&gt;Went back to Sally Hansen  do not suggest</li>
    <li> Ever since Revlon discontinued their whitening pencil, I&#x27;ve searched for a replacement.  This pencil is it.  Does a great job of whitening and is a hard enough consistency that it forms a point without crumbling during the sharpening process.  They may want to include an appropriate sharpener with the product.</li>
    <li> I have used these nail pencils in the past and it worked just fine. (Revlon)  The pencilI ordered BARELY whitened my nails and rinsed right off when I washed my hands. Revlon pencil did not do tat. This is a very inferior product and I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> searched then found this the price cost less than most other places.  I am unable to shop in stores so I shop on web and this was the best price and I love using this pencil.</li>
    <li> like but doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
    <li> Replaceing one that I have had for some 35 yrsor better, made by Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;Works just the same, and whitens nails.</li>
    <li> Been searching for a replacement for the Revlon product...and this one fit the bill. Pencils are of good length and as others have stated, they hold the color well. There aren&#x27;t directions, but I have discovered that if you wash or dampen your fingers before applying, the color just glides on.</li>
