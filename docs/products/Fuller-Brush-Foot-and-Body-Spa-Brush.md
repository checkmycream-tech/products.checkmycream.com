      <li>It is of good quality of construction as well.</li>
      <li>If this wonderfully designed bath and body brush lasts, well then the price will have been worth it.  </li>

      <li>So nice to know we can get QUALITY brushes today as in FULLER BRAND..............years of dependability.</li>
      <li>It is a nice brush…however, you need a lot of space to use it.</li>
      <li>It WAS a nice brush.  </li>
      <li>We liked the medium stiffness on our backs and the longer reach handles.  </li>
      <li>so I can scrub my toes, instep, ball of my foot, heels, and that really feels good!  </li>
      <li>But it still does a good job of getting me clean in all the places I can&#x27;t reach.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that Amazon carries it.  </li>
      <li>We won&#x27;t be buying Fuller any more.</li>
      <li>must say I would gladly recommend this bath brush.  </li>
      <li>Love this item.</li>
      <li>I love the brush.</li>
      <li>Has better manuverability.</li>
      <li>NEED TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE</li>
      <li>and I already bent the wire inserts into more of an angle to provide more resistance to pull out  </li>
      <li>Otherwise it seemed to be okay.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this brush.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Glad to see Fuller still exists.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Got it as a result of hip surgery and the many restrictions that prohibit bending.  </li>
      <li>I would still recommend it though, just don&#x27;t man handle it. :)</li>
      <li>It is perfect but takes some getting use to because it is so long.</li>
      <li>So now that I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m an old wise guy, I&#x27;m very happy to have this brush -- from the company whose salesmen used to knock at my parents&#x27; front door, no less.  </li>
      <li>Seemed a good idea ,but really does  not work for me, at all .Wasted 25.00 $</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine after you learn how to use it;</li>
      <li>I received the item quickly!</li>
      <li>Love this brush, It gets to all of the hard to get spots, and is a wonderful massager!</li>
      <li>It makes your back feel great  and tingly all over.</li>
      <li>LOL  Still say same thing as before---</li>
      <li>The bristles are a perfect blend of firm (closer to the handle) and stiffer (towards the end of the brush).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The bristles are graduated and have two comfortable stiffnesses.  </li>
      <li>Great foot scrubber, I don&#x27;t care for it for the back..</li>
      <li>The bristles feel great on your back.</li>
      <li>My feet fit through the loop between the brushes</li>
      <li>Not enough superlatives to describe my joy and satisfaction with this product.  </li>
      <li>Fuller makes great simple products.</li>
      <li>However, if you want that nice long handle to scrub your back, legs, and feet, then this brush is perfect.</li>
      <li>I guess if you have a larger then normal shower, it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>WELL worth the HUNTING to find it!</li>
      <li>it leaves my body feeling refreshed and clean after use.</li>
      <li>Also, I can clean my ankles and toes.  </li>
      <li>But it works, and makes your skin feel clean.</li>
      <li>The price was right also!</li>
      <li>Well, I received the right one &amp; I encourage those in need of this item to go ahead &amp; get it!</li>
      <li>Get this for doing your back and it feels soooo good, when you use, we are 76 &amp; 74 and no-one does our backs anymore</li>
      <li>Uuum sounds good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>This brush works really good for my sister during her showers, for her back and feet since she has problems reaching the feet.</li>
      <li>I have arthritis and diabetes and this really helps me to keep healthy.</li>
      <li>I am keeping it around to see if it&#x27;s useful to clean bathtub or shower tile.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Point is, the brush is good -- not too soft or too hard -- great for my drying skin that gets flaky in the winter.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, except the handle could be a little shorter.</li>
      <li>Great for the feet if you have arthritis and trouble washing your feet</li>
      <li>loving this brush have been through others and finally I remembered to check for Fuller Brush...</li>
      <li>The handle length is good, with the extra length appreciated.</li>
      <li>So this brush is a re-building of my stock of useful stuff.  </li>
      <li>Product description was right on.</li>
      <li>I started to feel like Goldilocks and the 3 bears when the porridge didn&#x27;t quite satisfy her palet until she tasted the right one.</li>
      <li>A perfect brush for reaching was down your back for a nice long scrub.</li>
      <li>Use liquid soap on the brush and you can happily scrub away all those hard-to-reach itchy dead skin cells to your heart&#x27;s content!</li>
      <li>The bristles are not painful, but very soothing.</li>
      <li>This brush is nice and long so that it reaches all the nether regions in the shower.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who has trouble bending or reaching, I&#x27;ve had hip replacement surgery and this brush is excellent for reaching my back and lower legs..</li>
      <li>The total length of this great brush handle allows me to reach every inch of my back and even between the toe-sies.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was fast, price was decent and the product was as described, I&#x27;m singing in the shower again !!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m retired, and I only bathe about 3 times a week, but I love this brush.  </li>
      <li>Quality, price, satisfaction are exactly what I have come to value in Amazon purchases.  </li>
      <li>i just  returned a wood brush that cracked upon first use</li>
      <li>Dont know what happened to it over the many years so would expect the same quality from this one.</li>
      <li>After a lifetime of complaining that backbrushes are always too short, I have to say that this one is probably more suited to a six-foot user than a 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the brush. I can reach from feet to back and all around.</li>
    <li> If this wonderfully designed bath and body brush lasts, well then the price will have been worth it.  I have put a couple of those stick-on hooks inside the tub to hang it on, as well as a recently acquired lotion applicator.  I love the size of the brush and have used it for dry brushing first and then in the shower.  WOW!  I was surprised that the handle is plastic (but sturdy), I think because my mother-in-law has a Fuller Brush Denture Brush with the same shape as this brush only considerably smaller.  It seems to be much sturdier and with a wooden handle and a heavier metal holding the plastic bristles.  (I recently purchased her two more directly from Fuller Brush because the one she has had for nearly 30 years has begun to rust).  Holding the brush down to the floor of the tub you can run your feet through it one at a time and your feet are clean.  Boy, it reaches from here to there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I would gladly recommend this bath brush.  The company who sent it to me also included a little freebie treat of a little box of Quaker  Oatmeal Squares with just a hint of brown sugar.  Uuum sounds good enough to eat.</li>
    <li> I have just had back surgery and can not bend or twist&#x27;.  This brush is great for it allows be to wash my legs below the knee and my feet. Still have a little trouble with the back  but it beats anything else I have tried to wash my back with. Just have to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this spa brush and am so happy with this product.  it leaves my body feeling refreshed and clean after use. it bends and lathers by hand very well.  I&#x27;m planning on purchasing another and one for a friend.</li>
    <li> Handle too long. too big for shower. No what I was trying to duplacate from the 60&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is the sort of implement that helps a person to be single when he didn&#x27;t expect to be, but doesn&#x27;t especially want to marry to get a back washer.  So now that I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m an old wise guy, I&#x27;m very happy to have this brush -- from the company whose salesmen used to knock at my parents&#x27; front door, no less.  Or I guess it is the same company.  Same name, anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point is, the brush is good -- not too soft or too hard -- great for my drying skin that gets flaky in the winter.  That sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually the last time I moved my first edition of this brush disappeared.  Stuff does that during moves.  So this brush is a re-building of my stock of useful stuff.  Thanks Fuller!</li>
    <li> I received the item quickly! The box was crushed but the Brush was fine(UNDAMAGED). Wish I had ordered 2 of them instead of one... but I wanted to see how stiff it was. SURE works nice! WELL worth the HUNTING to find it! HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Seller!</li>
    <li> Been searching,looking &amp; hoping to find a back brush with a long handle(due to an accident that compromises my extension at times) and one with bristles that stand firm enough to clean when wet, yet not so firm to cause scratches or harm to your body! After trying another brand from a well respected company and feeling the bristles upon opening the box, there was no need to utilize the product because the bristles were just too soft! I started to feel like Goldilocks and the 3 bears when the porridge didn&#x27;t quite satisfy her palet until she tasted the right one. Well, I received the right one &amp; I encourage those in need of this item to go ahead &amp; get it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed and there&#x27;s even bristles designed to exfoliate your feet if you so desire! The shipping was fast, price was decent and the product was as described, I&#x27;m singing in the shower again !!!</li>
    <li> Sturdy. Also, works just like a brush. After this sentence Amazon still required 13 words for this review . . . It&#x27;s a brush. If you order this it will work for you like a decent brush. That&#x27;s what brushes do.</li>
    <li> These hard plastic bristles are unsuitable for scrubbing one&#x27;s back. The brush is too big and awkward and is shaped wrong to reach most places on my  back. It does not take soap well and it is not fitted with any sort of device to hang it in the shower. It keeps falling down from wherever I put it in the bath, and makes a loud racket when it falls.</li>
    <li> Product description was right on. Great product, works as advertsed. God bless you. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my spouse and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Works well for me. Just had surgery can reach places otherwise I might miss. Stops all the itches, and feels great.</li>
    <li> This works rather well if you&#x27;re tall and find regular back scrubbers too short. My DH is short though and he just chokes up on the handle and it still works well for him too.</li>
    <li> Not enough superlatives to describe my joy and satisfaction with this product.  I have arthritis so reaching some areas with a normal or &amp;#34;extra long&amp;#34; handle brush has been a big problem.  With my new brush there is not an inch of skin I cannot wash or even scratch with minimal pain or discomfort.  Especially handy is the ability to &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; the brush head to any angle, (see bottom of feet and that one place on either shoulder blade).  Quality, price, satisfaction are exactly what I have come to value in Amazon purchases.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Chose this rating because it was lowest one offered. Would have rated it lower if I could have. Not as long as pictured.  Brush too flimsy.  Have to hold actual brush to scrub body. Limits how far you can reach with brush.</li>
    <li> it is nice just a little long for me.  I am only 5ft tall so is a little awkward.  No fault of the brush.  Husband is 6ft 2 and says he likes it.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to, but I still can&#x27;t get those hard to reach places, without it feeling like it&#x27;s about to snap. I would still recommend it though, just don&#x27;t man handle it. :)</li>
    <li> Being that I have had two shoulder operations, it was very difficult to wash my back as it should have been done.  This brush can be bent so as to reach all areas of my back without my shoulders hurting.  It is a great brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is long enough that I can reach to wash my back and can almost touch the floor with it. I am only 5pm foot 3 inches tall. The brush itself is slightly rough and I do have a hard time keeping it soaped. But it still does a good job of getting me clean in all the places I can&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> This brush is nice and long so that it reaches all the nether regions in the shower. The bristles are not painful, but very soothing. This is one of the best buys I&#x27;ve made, a really useful product for people with reaching problems. Highly recommended, I&#x27;m buying another one.</li>
    <li> We have looked for the perfect brush for a while. This has the perfect reach and texture to get the job done. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m retired, and I only bathe about 3 times a week, but I love this brush.  I can soap it up good by rubbing a soap bar into the bristles and they hold onto the soap and give me a good scrub.  The shape of the brush can go into the hollow of the middle of my back easily, and across my shoulder blades, and with the long handle I don&#x27;t have to be a contortionist to reach everywhere.  My feet fit through the loop between the brushes so I can scrub my toes, instep, ball of my foot, heels, and that really feels good!  This was a good buy for me.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, It gets to all of the hard to get spots, and is a wonderful massager! The price was right also!</li>
    <li> Fuller Brush spa brush. Not in my world. The bristles would take the skin off of a rhino and when I picked it up the bristles fell out of the handle. Yippee skippy.</li>
    <li> Better have at least 16&amp;#34; between the top of your head and the shower ceiling because this thing is long! But it works great!</li>
    <li> Bent wrong for my dad&#x27;s back</li>
    <li> We purchased Stanley brushes for years until our Stanley home salesperson disappeared.  I looked for the longest time and finally  found Stanley, now Fuller Brush, on Amazon.  Purchased several brushes and the quality is still there.</li>
    <li> This is the best Body Brush I have used.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the one legged guy with 13 fractured vertebra.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t one thing about this turkey that works. It&#x27;s too long, the handle is slippery, the shape hits nothing on your back, when you soap the bristles it catapults soap into your eyes. It didn&#x27;t come with a string to hang it up when your done. It has a HOLE for a string but nope, nadda, zippy doo da day no string. It has two kinds of bristles, a soft and a hard, the soft ones are too soft and the hard ones abrade the skin, AND they are placed backwards on the brush. I HATE IT!! Going to try and return it and get something else.</li>
    <li> Got it as a result of hip surgery and the many restrictions that prohibit bending.  This product reaches everywhere but doesn&#x27;t hold soap very well.  A critical product though if you want to wash your feet!</li>
    <li> Love it. I am tall with a big shower but unfortunately have a frozen shoulder and cant reach with that arm. This allows me to reach with just the one arm.  Fuller has a shorter brush which might be better if your shower is small. Glad to see Fuller still exists.  When I grew up we had a Fuller bath brush.  Dont know what happened to it over the many years so would expect the same quality from this one.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I can reach the center of my back and really get it good and clean.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush.  I am able to reach my entire back, and my feet very effortlessly.  This brush was a great investment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, except the handle could be a little shorter. It&#x27;s a little clumsy in the shower. I guess if you have a larger then normal shower, it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has trouble bending or reaching, I&#x27;ve had hip replacement surgery and this brush is excellent for reaching my back and lower legs..</li>
    <li> Great long handled brush, but not a real scrubber.</li>
    <li> It WAS a nice brush.  Was cause it lasted 2 days before the wire of the brush broke inside the plastic handle. No way to fix it so now it resides in a landfill. Save your local landfill and save your $$. This brush is literally garbage</li>
    <li> NEED TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE</li>
    <li> Not strong enough or angled properly to give your back a good scrub. Returned it.</li>
    <li> This brush works really good for my sister during her showers, for her back and feet since she has problems reaching the feet. And yes I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Well designed, an all around quality product.  The bristles feel great on your back.</li>
    <li> like the length, brush works well without being overly stiff or soft, handle should be a bit more sturdy</li>
    <li> Wrong shape  for hugging your back . Also,  if your using a shower, it will bang into your walls . Seemed a good idea ,but really does  not work for me, at all .Wasted 25.00 $</li>
    <li> Easier to use than the one I got from Mayfair.  Has better manuverability.</li>
    <li> again I am using LLLLLLLLLLLLLong handles  to help me bathe,  and etc.  So nice to know we can get QUALITY brushes today as in FULLER BRAND..............years of dependability.</li>
    <li> Best brush out there and the only one long enough</li>
    <li> We bought a couple long body brushes about 12 years ago based on my use of these 40-50 years ago.  We liked the medium stiffness on our backs and the longer reach handles.  What we didn&#x27;t like is, recently we discovered the tiny white bristles were breaking off in mass.  This happened to both our brushes (one used occasionally and the other used rarely).  This never happened to my mom&#x27;s brushes and my first brushes.  We won&#x27;t be buying Fuller any more.</li>
    <li> It is a nice brush…however, you need a lot of space to use it. Hard to manipulate in tight space.</li>
    <li> long enough to get all the spots you need scrubbed.  Only thing I wish is for it to feel sturdier.  I dont apply that much pressure for fear of breaking the handle.  But it works, and makes your skin feel clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush more than a year ago, and I use it almost daily.  Because the length is unwieldy, I plan on purchasing a second brush to leave at a vacation house, rather than trying to transport this one.  The brush curvature and long handle ensure that I can really get a satisfying back-scratch when I need it.  I usually use it \\&quot;dry\\&quot; that is not in the shower, so I don&#x27;t know how it would behave when the bristles get wet.  If I could ask for any improvement, it would be to have the bristles a little stiffer.  The handle length is good, with the extra length appreciated.</li>
    <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is just what I was looking for and now I am only sorry it cost as much as it did and that I don&#x27;t have enough room in my little tub and shower enclosure to wield it the way it deserves. I may need to move out to the yard in order to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The chagrin of my neighbors and swarming police cars is all stopping me...&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, I do like it. Not too soft, nor hard. Large enough in the brush portion to get good coverage and long enough of handle to go where needed without a bunch of body contortions.  It seems sturdy enough to last with only a bit of due caution, in spite of what those older ones of Yesteryear are reported to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give it a begrudging five stars even though I would pick it apart if I had a cause to do so. It would be better at half the price and if it were free I would take two.&lt;br /&gt;With this one you will find you don&#x27;t need so many of those other ones.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband &amp; he loves it.  Just what he needed to wash his back &amp; reach his feet.  I am going to purchase one for myself.</li>
    <li> loving this brush have been through others and finally I remembered to check for Fuller Brush...grew up looking for visit from the FB guy...brushes, shoe horns. moth balls....FB rocks.</li>
    <li> I did not like the handle on this brush. It was too small in diameter,it tended slip with soapy hands. Otherwise it seemed to be okay.</li>
    <li> THis product is great!  for one, it is long enough to wash my back.  It also defoliates and makes your skin feel wonderful.  Also, I can clean my ankles and toes.  I have arthritis and diabetes and this really helps me to keep healthy.</li>
    <li> This is THE most amazing bath brush EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine after you learn how to use it;</li>
    <li> I had a Fuller Back Brush for some 30 years, and it finally gave up the ghost, when the bristle section split apart. It had a solid plastic handle and brush (bristles incorporated into the plastic like a hair brush. It did great service all of these years. As other reviewers have said, this one is TOO LONG! Maneuvering in a glass-enclosed bathtub with it is difficult, &amp; it bangs against the enclosure or the door. My solution is to cut the handle down to a manageable length and either drill a new hole in the &amp;#34;stump&amp;#34; or to just hang it by the loop end of the brush, while I search for a better product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  It&#x27;s the best brush we&#x27;ve ever had and we love the long handle.</li>
    <li> The bristles are a bit harsh for the skin but it&#x27;s well made and does the job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I did without it!  I&#x27;m 70 with stiff joints.  The total length of this great brush handle allows me to reach every inch of my back and even between the toe-sies.  The bristles are graduated and have two comfortable stiffnesses.  This is a loooooong brush and takes some getting used to handling in a small shower.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a place you can&#x27;t reach on your body with this brush.  It is of good quality of construction as well.</li>
    <li> The bristles were too stiff and the whole thing too big and unwieldy to use as a shower brush for either back or feet. I am keeping it around to see if it&#x27;s useful to clean bathtub or shower tile.</li>
    <li> I like it it works perfect. I bought it because it had a long handle but to tell you the truth I don&#x27;t hold it all the way at the end and sometimes it does hit the walls but because it has soft bristles and tougher bristles at the end it works very well. Seems to be quality looks like it will last for a while.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush!  Just what you would expect in quality for the Fuller Brush Company.</li>
    <li> If you have been like me and having a hard time finding a good back brush.  Buy this now it is great!!!</li>
    <li> It may look like a toilet bowel brush but it does the job. It reaches your back and feet and any other hand to reach area. You will need to put more soap than expected and if you wash let&#x27;s say your shoulder you&#x27;ll need to be careful not to bang the wall or glass door cause it is long. Oh yeah need to store it between uses upside down otherwise the bristles will get distorted. I&#x27;d buy it as gain.</li>
    <li> Well made, generous brush with just enough stiffness in the bristles to exfoliate without scratching. The end is flexible so you can bend it as you please. Best bath brush I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Get this for doing your back and it feels soooo good, when you use, we are 76 &amp; 74 and no-one does our backs anymore but this does the job.</li>
    <li> It is perfect but takes some getting use to because it is so long. I keep knocking into shower door and wall. But it gets all the places!</li>
    <li> This brush works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;- Not too harsh&lt;br /&gt;- Long handle - allows ease reach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- Long handle - can easily bang walls of shower if not careful&lt;br /&gt;- Tricky to load bristles with soap/suds</li>
    <li> ... yet it&#x27;s 4&#x27;x4.&amp;#34;  The handle is just to long and there&#x27;s now way to maneuver.  The bristles as rough and skimpy.  Wasted $25</li>
    <li> A perfect brush for reaching was down your back for a nice long scrub. It makes your back feel great  and tingly all over. Love this item.</li>
    <li> now i can reach everwhere</li>
    <li> Great for the feet if you have arthritis and trouble washing your feet</li>
    <li> Being an older person, it&#x27;s harder to get to the harder areas, like your back and legs. This brush fits the Bill Thanks fuller.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully pleased! I got it mainly for legs and toes that am unable to wash well due to age related injuries. I will be ordering other products by Fuller Brush as they have not failed me yet in 40 yrs. The brush stands to quality.</li>
    <li> Not as stiff as I wanted, but ok. Long handle takes some getting used to .</li>
    <li> There are hard bristles and soft bristles.  It is hard to brush delicate areas because the hard bristles are on the outside or far end area.</li>
    <li> Great foot scrubber, I don&#x27;t care for it for the back.. Feet and calves get nice exfoliation and a tingly scrubbing and Fuller makes great simple products.</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of complaining that backbrushes are always too short, I have to say that this one is probably more suited to a six-foot user than a 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; one. Brush itself seems very well-made and the two sets of bristles are a nice feature, but it does require more than the usual amount of reaching and squirming to get to the whole back.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! It&#x27;s soft, but not too soft, and has this nice long handle. You do have to watch what you are doing, though, so that you don&#x27;t bang the wall of the shower with that extra long handle while scrubbing away. Someone in a different review said the handle snapped off their brush when it collided with the wall, so you have to be careful with it. However, if you want that nice long handle to scrub your back, legs, and feet, then this brush is perfect. Use liquid soap on the brush and you can happily scrub away all those hard-to-reach itchy dead skin cells to your heart&#x27;s content!</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with the item , the handle was to long, very awkward when handling.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush just over two years ago through Publisher&#x27;s Clearing house of all places.  I was tired of the weak handled soft bristled brushes that you can find at any department store.  I was always breaking the handle of those brushes because I was pressing so hard because the bristles were too soft (broke about 1 per month).  I use this brush in the shower to scrub my back, lower legs and feet (I have a narrow shower stall and a bad back) and I can tell the difference in my skin when I don&#x27;t use the brush.  The bristles are a perfect blend of firm (closer to the handle) and stiffer (towards the end of the brush).&lt;br /&gt;I just broke the handle of this brush recently and went into a panic to find a replacement.  I am so glad that Amazon carries it.  I was beginning to make plans to \\&quot;Frankenstein\\&quot; this one back together using pvc pipe...hmmm, still might do that to have it as a backup.</li>
    <li> overpriced toilet brush , Why can&#x27;t i find a decent back brush  ? i just  returned a wood brush that cracked upon first use&lt;br /&gt;this one has the brush falling out constantly , did it no occur to these brush engineers to secure the brush to the handle with other than a friction fit ?  my plans are to use this with brush some modifications like bending it into the proper ergonomic curvature  to actually work and I already bent the wire inserts into more of an angle to provide more resistance to pull out  but when this fails I will not buy another&lt;br /&gt; I am going to run with the idea of a toilet brush  and will pay 5 bucks for one at the grocery store  ( whens the last time you had an actual toilet brush fall apart on first use ??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fuller  pull it together  then maybe use an adhesive or mechanical fastener  lol</li>
    <li> This is second brush I have bought--- cause my hubby stole my other one.  LOL  Still say same thing as before---Love the long handle, able to reach entire back w/out being a contortionist.  Bristles are just right--- not super rough or soft.</li>
