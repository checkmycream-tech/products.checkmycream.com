### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best electric razor I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Very happy with the purchase.  </li>
      <li>This is his 4th Norelco and he thinks it is the best one yet.</li>
      <li>It was very good.   </li>
      <li>It has been working beautifully.</li>
      <li>I have owned this for over a year, replaced blades once as recommended, and it still works great.</li>
      <li>I will be happy to review it once my husband uses it.</li>
      <li>He is happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>After shaving it feels like I&#x27;ve done a good job</li>
      <li>so I thought it would be good to get one out there</li>
      <li>Gets the job done for a good price.</li>
      <li>all around good looking shaver and close shave&lt;</li>
      <li>Nearly as good as a blade.</li>
      <li>this is a gift and has not been used as yet----the package arrived promptly and was in good condition.</li>
      <li>Norelco shavers give me a consistently good shave.  </li>
      <li>What I did want was a razor that could be used cordless or corded, has a good sized hair chamber that can be opened and cleaned, and has a battery indicator</li>
      <li>All in all, I am very satisfied with this model.</li>
      <li>Husband very pleased with this razor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Chrome\Black finish is nice as well&lt;br /&gt;Close</li>
      <li>Speaking of shaves, NICE, NICE, NICE.</li>
      <li>I guess this was because it was the \\&quot;deluxe edition?\\</li>
      <li>and that is a nice idea.  </li>
      <li>This model (8270) received good reviews in most cases.  </li>
      <li>think if it had a LCD it would just really make this shaver the best looking one I would have seen&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is handy when I have to shave on the go, but again,</li>
      <li>The sides of this razor have a rubber textured area that makes this very easy to hang onto.</li>
      <li>I will keep this now and make the best of it, but I almost feel I owe my old shaver an apology.</li>
      <li>The trimmer design is kind of clunky and not the greatest, but for a simple trim it does the job.  </li>
      <li>Be sure you close the head and put a finger over it to prevent it from flying off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors all of my life and the HQ9 blade system is  better than the RQ10 ,11 or 12 system, IMHO.</li>
      <li>HE&#x27;S HAD A BETTER SHAVE, BUT NOT SPENDING MORE ON A RAZOR.</li>
      <li>One of the things I LOVE about this shaver is the ability to just rinse it with water.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t help thinking maybe a Braun foil shaver type might be better for me, but I don&#x27;t knowbecause I never tried one out.</li>
      <li>I am sure, that you can find.</li>
      <li>I guess for the money I was expecting the shaver to magically produce an effortlessly &#x27;smooth-as-a-baby-butt&#x27; shave, and</li>
      <li>I should have realised that companies have been making electric shavers for years now, and have never been able to match the closeness of a blade, no matter what the &#x27;latest innovations&#x27; try to tell us.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m quite pleased with this razor.</li>
      <li>It looks good and the first week was ok with it.  </li>
      <li>It is quiet, sleek, feels good in the hand, and gives me a superior shave in no time.   </li>
      <li>The head assembly opens easily and has a metal hinge that keeps it connected to the razor body.</li>
      <li>That is a great feature and apparently it doesn&#x27;t matter if you get water inside the shaver while washing; although they do not recommend submersing the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is by far one of the best Norelco razors I have ever used compared to much older and newer models.</li>
      <li>It is light and the rubber grip is comfortable.  </li>
      <li>8270XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The features important to me are:</li>
      <li>/&gt;Obviously it&#x27;s really nice looking, lights are really neat</li>
      <li>The automatic washing station works well and makes keeping it clean easy.</li>
      <li>the pivoting head, \\&quot;cool blue\\&quot; LEDs, &amp; easy rinse head keeps the norelco shaver @</li>
      <li>First, fast free shipping as always and way over packed and wrapped, but that&#x27;s always a good thing.</li>
      <li>rinsable feature is really nice, it&#x27;s like using a brand new shaver every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can even clean it with running water.</li>
      <li>With this guy, he can clean it up in seconds.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my husband for Christmas; He loves how it shaves so closely; Likes the way you can clean it.</li>
      <li>but it looks good enough to pass for a blade shave.</li>
      <li>The 8270XL is a good solid shaver.</li>
      <li>This model seems to have about twice the battery life of my old unit which is nice.</li>
      <li>The razor I&#x27;m retiring would give me 27 to 29 days on a full battery.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Small issues:&lt;br /&gt;- I have notice some pulling of hairs but realized I was moving the shaver too quickly when that</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried the wash yet, but love the flip open top to rinse after a couple shaves.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers my whole life and this shaver is a great improvement over the earlier Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>while the younger crowd may like the \\&quot;Star Wars style\\&quot; of the latest models, this 8270 works for me!</li>
      <li>showing me how much the industry have advanced over the years.</li>
      <li>this razor has exceeded all my expectations, and is considerably better than my old Norelco.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The razor can be washed by running warm water on it with the blade assembly in the open position.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does take about one more pass than my old one, but it also shaves finer so that may be</li>
      <li>Plus water runs right out by the recharging connection.  </li>
      <li>floating heads that fit face contours, rinseable shaving head/whisker compartment and a stand that is light to pack when traveling and allows the razor to sit out with the head open to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>You can remove the head completely for a more thorough cleaning if you want, which is much easier than leaving it on the body.</li>
      <li>shaver is comfortable to hold, light, and quiet.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Motor isn&#x27;t as strong as my old one, when my beard is grown out about 2 days</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well built, very quiet, charges quickly, and being able to wash it under the tap afterwards certainly makes maintenance a lot easier.</li>
      <li>special feature of this new shaver is that water runs right through the razor when you rinse the whisker compartment.  </li>
      <li>Finally I decided to step up to a more pricey model, figuring that bigger money &#x3D; better quality.  </li>
      <li>So this razor can be used for many years if you have the technical knowledge</li>
      <li>Before you order, look around locally for a better price.</li>
      <li>... How many only one have got?   </li>
      <li>(Kind of a pain when you live in a rural area and nobody is home during the day.)</li>
      <li>/&gt;The new razor is supposed to provide 17 days of shaving on a full battery.  </li>
      <li>It did a reasonable job, even for the first shave.</li>
      <li>I had convinced myself that the Reflex 6853XL wasn&#x27;t doing a good enough or fast enough job, and it was on the way out.</li>
      <li>The battery can be replaced easily ( AA size Li-on with solder tabs, found online at several places).</li>
      <li>The shaving head gets warm to almost hot after a few minutes of use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It cuts MUCH faster requiring fewer passes to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>This 8270XL shaves very close and fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
      <li>Norelco recommends replacing the blades every year and at $17 on Amazon that seems reasonable.</li>
      <li>I really stepped up in the world.  </li>
      <li>It shaves very close, especially for an electric, and is fast and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Still, I don&#x27;t dislike it that much.</li>
      <li>It is much quieter than his older razor.  </li>
      <li>It is so quiet I can carry on a conversation with my wife while using it.&lt;br /&gt;- Clean by washing under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He has fine, blonde hair and not very thick, just around his goatee and some along the edges of his chin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how close it shaves but a wet shave is still better.</li>
      <li>I think it is a bargain - the competing Braun is $100 more expensive, and I don&#x27;t see where it would be any better.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>All in all, aesthetics aside, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>There are 3 screws on the top of the inner case, remove these 3 screws and use a thin plastic scraper and lift  the top of the inner case, it will come right up.</li>
      <li>So for this review I&#x27;ve now had just one electric shave with this new Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I purchaesd a new one.</li>
      <li>So, he received a new shaver for Christmas.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this to replace my trusty Norelco Quadra 6886XL which, after nine years, couldn&#x27;t retain a charge.    This 8270XL shaves very close and fast. The blue LEDs are pretty. It is light and the rubber grip is comfortable.  There are two things I don&#x27;t like about it though.     The charging base is laughably light. I need two hands to lift the razor off it. Also, the charging cord isn&#x27;t coiled. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll keep it. I have 45 days to decide. My satisfaction is in the details.</li>
    <li> Reviews in general tend to be either overly effusive or harshly critical, depending on one&#x27;s experience of whatever was purchased. I am wary of both.  With electric shavers, I guess performance is partially based on the contours of one&#x27;s face and the nature of one&#x27;s beard.  For years I had been making do with an inexpensive electric (rotary) shaver - Philips Norelco Reflex 6853XL.  Finally I decided to step up to a more pricey model, figuring that bigger money &#x3D; better quality.  I did my due diligence on the review circuit and decided to stay with my previous brand, Philips Norelco. This model (8270) received good reviews in most cases.  So what&#x27;s the lowdown?  I had convinced myself that the Reflex 6853XL wasn&#x27;t doing a good enough or fast enough job, and it was on the way out. This new model arrived looking very futuristic in comparison to the old one, complete with blue LED lights.  In the main category, performance, it is not a huge improvement over my previous shaver. I should have realised that companies have been making electric shavers for years now, and have never been able to match the closeness of a blade, no matter what the &#x27;latest innovations&#x27; try to tell us. I guess for the money I was expecting the shaver to magically produce an effortlessly &#x27;smooth-as-a-baby-butt&#x27; shave, and showing me how much the industry have advanced over the years. In reality, I have to work this shaver hard, going over my face several times to get a satisfactory smooth shave. Neck and sideburn areas prove too difficult for this shaver to get right first time.    Still, I don&#x27;t dislike it that much. It&#x27;s well built, very quiet, charges quickly, and being able to wash it under the tap afterwards certainly makes maintenance a lot easier. I will keep this now and make the best of it, but I almost feel I owe my old shaver an apology. To think I could have spent even more on other models!    I can&#x27;t help thinking maybe a Braun foil shaver type might be better for me, but I don&#x27;t knowbecause I never tried one out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers my whole life and this shaver is a great improvement over the earlier Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts MUCH faster requiring fewer passes to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;The rinsable feature is really nice, it&#x27;s like using a brand new shaver every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This lasted less than 3 years before the battery lost the ability to hold a charge long enough for even one shave.&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up and the internal case is solvent welded together, making it impossible to replace the battery or service it in any other way.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cost of this I expected it to last a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years and specifically, a Norelco Model 9160XL for the past 4 years.  The on/off switch has become balky so I started the search for a replacement and ended up with the SmartTouch Contour System Shaver, Model 8270XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The features important to me are: floating heads that fit face contours, rinseable shaving head/whisker compartment and a stand that is light to pack when traveling and allows the razor to sit out with the head open to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also necessary is a travel/storage pouch with plastic protector for the shaving heads and the ability to hold a charge for at least two weeks.  The razor I&#x27;m retiring would give me 27 to 29 days on a full battery.  It was touted as providing 90 minutes of shaving power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new razor is supposed to provide 17 days of shaving on a full battery.  If I think of it, I&#x27;ll update this later with some results of how long the battery lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is how well the razor shaves.  Norelco shavers give me a consistently good shave.  I could get an ultra close shave with a blade, but the electric razor can&#x27;t be beat for convenience and speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One special feature of this new shaver is that water runs right through the razor when you rinse the whisker compartment.  There are two small outlets, one each side, near the bottom of the shaver.  Plus water runs right out by the recharging connection.  In effect, you flush the whiskers right through it and down the sink and that is a nice idea.  The stand has a small hole so any residual water can drain through and won&#x27;t collect in the recharging well of the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always give a vigorous shake to the shaver after rinsing to get out excess water.  Be sure you close the head and put a finger over it to prevent it from flying off.  If it should happen, you can easily insert it back, but you could seriously damage it if it hits something hard - like a tile floor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this razor lasts as long asthe old one, I&#x27;ll feel like I&#x27;ve got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco finally wore out where it would not even work on the cord. I was looking for a replacement that had the stuff I wanted without the stuff I didn&#x27;t need. The 8270XL fits that need. It has a nice little charge base that you can stand the razor up in. (The models with the \\&quot;CC\\&quot; at the end have that charging/cleaning base. ie:8270XLCC.)I didn&#x27;t want that for the extra bucks. What I did want was a razor that could be used cordless or corded, has a good sized hair chamber that can be opened and cleaned, and has a battery indicator so you know it&#x27;s getting low.    The shipper/seller sent this out with the wrong weight and I had to cough up an extra $5.75 for shipping, not to mention having to sign for it in front of a USPS person. (Kind of a pain when you live in a rural area and nobody is home during the day.) All the local stores carry the bargain basement and  fanciest models  with nothing in between. What&#x27;s up with that? :-((    Anyway, to the meat of things. this razor has exceeded all my expectations, and is considerably better than my old Norelco. It is very quiet, and cuts very close. Probably a result of the speed XL heads. Nearly as good as a blade. My old one was never that quiet, and I can&#x27;t recall it ever cutting as close as this new one. This model has 5 LED&#x27;s that indicate state of charge, as well as a another low battery LED. The sides of this razor have a rubber textured area that makes this very easy to hang onto. Besides the floating heads that Norelco had had for many years, there is a pivot that allows the entire head assembly to \\&quot;rock\\&quot; a little, keeping it close to your skin as you move around. The head assembly opens easily and has a metal hinge that keeps it connected to the razor body. That hinge uses a spring clip to attach to the razor. You can remove the head completely for a more thorough cleaning if you want, which is much easier than leaving it on the body. Getting that clip back in place is a little bit of a pain but not terrible. All in all, I am very satisfied with this model. It has everything I wanted without things I didn&#x27;t want. I would recomend this model to anybody!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas; He loves how it shaves so closely; Likes the way you can clean it. It is much quieter than his older razor.  This is his 4th Norelco and he thinks it is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> this is a gift and has not been used as yet----the package arrived promptly and was in good condition. I will be happy to review it once my husband uses it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my husband. The Norelco I replace lasted over 10 yrs. He was always happ with his Norelco and upgrading to a newer model was necessary since the battery did not recharge. So, he received a new shaver for Christmas. He is happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This razor is everything I have been looking for. It is quiet, sleek, feels good in the hand, and gives me a superior shave in no time.   I strongly recommend it over some of the less expensive models.</li>
    <li> The 8270XL is a good solid shaver. It is well built and has just enough features. The shaver shaves about the same as my now defunct earlier model but then the Norelco shaving head assembly is mature technology. The one improvement with the head that seems to help is the mechanism that allows the whole head to tilt making it easier to get the head flat on my skin. This model seems to have about twice the battery life of my old unit which is nice. The charge level indicator is a must for me. There&#x27;s nothing like being out in the toolies and have the batteries die. The charging stand takes up little room and the plug/pwr supply is small enough that it doesn&#x27;t cover up both wall sockets. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he LOVES it! He has fine, blonde hair and not very thick, just around his goatee and some along the edges of his chin. With this guy, he can clean it up in seconds. He raves about the close shave and the lack of irritation on his skin.  He used to hate shaving and go as long as he could between shaves, but now he&#x27;s just excited to use this! The automatic washing station works well and makes keeping it clean easy. After 1 week, no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/17/2012&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of shaving, my boyfriend noticed that this razor does not shave his neck but does irritate it by tugging on the hair. Thus the downgraded rating from 5 to 4. He still likes it for \\&quot;in between\\&quot; shaves but has to get his neck with a regular razor.</li>
    <li> I bought my Norelco Razor from Amazon.  I have owned and operated it for about three months.  It has been working beautifully.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using norelco shaving products all of my life. the pivoting head, \\&quot;cool blue\\&quot; LEDs, &amp; easy rinse head keeps the norelco shaver @ the head of the pack! while the younger crowd may like the \\&quot;Star Wars style\\&quot; of the latest models, this 8270 works for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always like Philips Norelco razors. I bought the 8270XL to replace my 5825XL that must be 15 years old at least! Of course, the batteries never last, but it still performed.  First, fast free shipping as always and way over packed and wrapped, but that&#x27;s always a good thing. The factory does that.  When I opened it all up and laid it all out, I was pleasantly surprised to see a wash station and bottle of solution included.   I guess this was because it was the \\&quot;deluxe edition?\\&quot;  I really feel I got a terrific deal here. Way beats the factory site with their 30% deal last month.  Haven&#x27;t tried the wash yet, but love the flip open top to rinse after a couple shaves. Speaking of shaves, NICE, NICE, NICE. So quiet, ergonomic, and fancy LED&#x27;s. Makes me fell as tho I really stepped up in the world.  Only charged once so far, and 3 LED&#x27;s still lit.   Gets the job done for a good price. Nothing over fancy, and that&#x27;s the way I like it. No cons on this as of yet. Oh wait, one thing. The pop up trimmer has gone chinsy since they made my 5825XL. I&#x27;ll just keep the old one around, I guess. Thanks for reading. JK.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for his birthday and we live in a small town. It was guaranteed to arrive within two days and I never thought it would be possible but it arrived in time.  It only took an hour to charge and did not have to be recharged for about 3 weeks.  Husband very pleased with this razor. I would recommend this one anytime.</li>
    <li> The razor arrived even before predicted, and has performed well since I got it.  It shaves very close, especially for an electric, and is fast and comfortable.  I think it is a bargain - the competing Braun is $100 more expensive, and I don&#x27;t see where it would be any better.  The rotary head does make it difficult to do straight sideburns, so the clipper bar on the back side of the razor is necessary.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in 30 years. As I am recently retired I&#x27;m making the switch to make my life easier. So for this review I&#x27;ve now had just one electric shave with this new Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this model so it would have a base for charging. It arrived uncharged but took less than an hour to fully charge. There are blue LEDs flashing as it charges and they stay solid one at a time as the charge completes. The shaver stands solid in the base and it is possible to connect the charging cord directly to the shaver and bypass the base if desired. This might be an option for traveling so the base could be left at home. The base is neither large nor heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased some electric pre-shave lotion because I was concerned about irritation. After it fully charged I attacked a two day growth. My beard isn&#x27;t heavy but does grow in multiple directions under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is much quieter than the Norelco I used way back when. It did a reasonable job, even for the first shave. It took less time than shaving with shaving cream and a razor. There is no way this will shave close enough to feel like a blade shave but it looks good enough to pass for a blade shave. I feel some unshaven hairs under my chin but no matter how much time I spent with saving cream and a blade I would have unshaven hairs then as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased not to have any noticeable irritation after this first shave, however I didn&#x27;t push it knowing that I could make it worse if I continued agressivly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the pop out trimmer on my side-burns which worked as well as one could expect given that it isn&#x27;t a blade. The pop out trimmer is solidly in place and didn&#x27;t fold when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is comfortable to hold, light, and quiet. Norelco recommends replacing the blades every year and at $17 on Amazon that seems reasonable. The package included a travel case which fits only the razor but not the charge cord or base. The case is well designed with a hard shell to protect the razor on one side and a soft zippered back. A small cleaning brush is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor can be washed by running warm water on it with the blade assembly in the open position. That is a great feature and apparently it doesn&#x27;t matter if you get water inside the shaver while washing; although they do not recommend submersing the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll check back in after a few weeks with an update. I noticed there were no reviews on this item so I thought it would be good to get one out there even if it was a brief use review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 3, 2009 update&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite pleased with this razor. I&#x27;ve now used it exclusively since I received it. I&#x27;m surprised at how close it shaves but a wet shave is still better. I notice stubble within about 5-6 hours where with a wet shave it may take 10-12 hours. Still the convenience of shaving away from the sink, water, and with my shirt on is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard grows in several directions under my chin so I have to pass over the same area multiple times. After shaving it feels like I&#x27;ve done a good job but an hour later I notice areas I&#x27;ve missed. I think this is because there are hairs that lay down and are too flat to be picked up by the shaving heads. With a wet shave this doesn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Charges in an hour or so and lasts for several days between charges.&lt;br /&gt;- Shave closer than I expected from an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;- It is so quiet I can carry on a conversation with my wife while using it.&lt;br /&gt;- Clean by washing under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small issues:&lt;br /&gt;- I have notice some pulling of hairs but realized I was moving the shaver too quickly when that happened.&lt;br /&gt;- The shaving head gets warm to almost hot after a few minutes of use. This may be my biggest complaint. Not a deal breaker. I&#x27;m surprised this happens as I&#x27;m using the pre-shave lotion with every shave and expected that would lubricate and cut friction. I&#x27;ll try another brand of pre-shave next time to see if it makes a difference. If I could I would change to 4 stars because of this issue.because of this issue.</li>
    <li> I used to use the last 18 years Norelco el.shaver. It was very good.   I purchaesd a new one. It looks good and the first week was ok with it.  [.......]  The \\&quot;only one item, order soon\\&quot; is only marketing slogan. When I ordered the store has got \\&quot;only one\\&quot;... How many only one have got?   Before you order, look around locally for a better price. I am sure, that you can find.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Obviously it&#x27;s really nice looking, lights are really neat&lt;br /&gt;Chrome\Black finish is nice as well&lt;br /&gt;Close Shave, I felt my face after I shaved I would say about 20% closer shave than my old one&lt;br /&gt;Quiet Motor&lt;br /&gt;Just all around good looking shaver and close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Motor isn&#x27;t as strong as my old one, when my beard is grown out about 2 days I used the side burn trimmer to bring it down then I shave with the rotaries&lt;br /&gt;I think if it had a LCD it would just really make this shaver the best looking one I would have seen&lt;br /&gt;The plug on the stand isn&#x27;t centered in the back so it&#x27;s hard to hide the cord (nitpick)&lt;br /&gt;It does take about one more pass than my old one, but it also shaves finer so that may be why but I did notice that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I give it a 4 out of 5 and I do recommend it, and this travel edition especially</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S FOR MY HUSBAND. HE&#x27;S HAD A BETTER SHAVE, BUT NOT SPENDING MORE ON A RAZOR. GUESS THEY DON&#x27;T CUT AS CLOSE AS THEY USED TO.</li>
    <li> This replaced my aging Braun shaver.  Very happy with the purchase.  Shaves well and fast, very quiet and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which tends to be very sensitive.  The trimmer design is kind of clunky and not the greatest, but for a simple trim it does the job.  I also like the display which is informative.  One of the things I LOVE about this shaver is the ability to just rinse it with water.  I always hated that part of electric razor shaving - trying to clean it with the little brush.  Back in a day I used to be very fond of Braun design and cool look and never much cared for the Philips shavers in this regard, but just like the cars these days, they all look equally lame, so that was no longer a consideration.  All in all, aesthetics aside, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get as close a shave as I would like.  It is handy when I have to shave on the go, but again, because it doesn&#x27;t provide that close a shave, I have to shave sooner that I would otherwise.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have ever used. Cuts well for an electric and holds charge for over 2 weeks. You can even clean it with running water. I have owned this for over a year, replaced blades once as recommended, and it still works great.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this shaver.  holds a charge for a long time</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best Norelco razors I have ever used compared to much older and newer models. I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors all of my life and the HQ9 blade system is  better than the RQ10 ,11 or 12 system, IMHO. I wanted to make a  comment about the case being solvent welded together as stated in an earlier post. There are 3 screws on the top of the inner case, remove these 3 screws and use a thin plastic scraper and lift  the top of the inner case, it will come right up. The battery can be replaced easily ( AA size Li-on with solder tabs, found online at several places). So this razor can be used for many years if you have the technical knowledge</li>
