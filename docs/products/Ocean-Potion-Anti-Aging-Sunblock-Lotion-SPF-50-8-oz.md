<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff and it really works well too because we \\&quot;missed\\&quot; a few small areas and got REALLY burnt (user error here) but where we had the sunscreen not burned at all. I love the fact it has vitamin D in it and it smells great. We went through 2 tubes of this on vacation.  Great stuff I wont buy anything else anymore but this since I know it works so well. If it aint broke dont fix it Im sticking this stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an alternative to more \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; sunscreens since I wear sunscreen daily in the summer months.  I must mention that I did this with heavy skepticism.  I live in Colorado where the sun is very intense.  I wear a daily sunscreen for this reason alone.  With this product, I did not burn, per se, but rather just turned after only two hours.  It helps preventing sunburn, but in my opinion, does not do a sufficient enough job if you&#x27;re in direct sunlight for many hours while hiking or even light sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use as a daily sunscreen, but if I know I&#x27;m going to be out in direct sunlight for many hours, I will use a sweat proof/Water proof Coppertone 50+.  That stuff works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I spend and have spent a lot of time in the sun and used many sunscreens, but have never had one preform as oddly poorly as this.      I&#x27;m a burner even if it does not hurt I get a little red no matter what, I also shave my head so having a good sunscreen is important to me.  I had spend the entire previous day in the sun, using a less power full different brand of sunscreen an spf 15 in the morning then a 45 in the afternoon and had little or no burning, at least no pain.  I left that in someone&#x27;s car so I bought some ocean potion spf 50 thinking it would be fine.     I was so wrong.  It went on nicely and dried quickly so I confidently went into the ocean.  I spent three hours in the water. I reapplied the sunscreen once after about an hour and a half, more frequently then with other brands Copper tone, Hawaiian tropic, but I had not used this before and wanted to make sure I would not burn.      Damn did I burn.  The funny thing is places like my forearms that had not seen any sunscreen the previous day burned and they never burn, ever.      Bottom line the other reviews are good but it sounds like those people don&#x27;t spend prolonged time out in direct sunlight.      Don&#x27;t buy this stuff, for the same price there are better brands.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen because my doctor said everyone should wear a good sunblock everyday.  It helps retard the aging process and it guards against skin cancer.  This one had the best reviews that I could find. It does have a pleasant smell and is very light, but I gave it 4 stars since it does leave a bit of a shine on my face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use here in Iraq...Over the last couple of weeks, the temperature has risen up to 140 degrees...This product not only allows my team and I to be able to work in this heat, it also has a pleasant smell to it as well...</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen. Scent is a little strong for me. I was expecting something light and sweet. It reminded me of that fruity numbing gel they give you at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen.  It smells great, feels good on the skin, is non-irritating, and works well.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon is carrying it!</li>
    <li> It has a distinctive creamsicle smell that will either bring back fond memories or drive you crazy.</li>
    <li> This oceans potions sunscreen is great, lightweight, great scent! I would definitely recommend; feels like not wearing scunscreen at all!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cruetly-free vegan sunscreen last year that has uva and uvb protection and came across this brand. Living in Florida and near the beach, I just happen to get more sun and hang out in a pool almost every weekend. It is recommended that you put sunscreen on BEFORE you are in the water or sun. On my face I use a more gentle Jason&#x27;s natural or Nature&#x27;s Gate product and wear a hat. I&#x27;m sensitive to chemicals and fragrances but this has been fine and I&#x27;m ordering more even if I have to pay shipping. I also use Nature&#x27;s Gate aqua block spf 50 which is very water resistant and fragrance free if you have skin allergies.</li>
    <li> I was actually sent sunscreen not sunblock. I prefer the sunblock because sunscreen is harsher on my skin and my dermatologist recommends that I use sunblock. Its not worth sending back because I have several friends that will put the sunscreen to use but I was disappointed when I opened the box.</li>
    <li> I already wrote a e-mail wondering why my purchase was charged over US40,00 to sent it to MARIOTT MARQUISE - Times Square!  My first purchase of Ocean Suncare was at a store hotel when I was in Orlando and as I was happy with the produt I ordered it by AMAZON to my hotel in N.Y.  Waiting for answer   Rywka jalalonetsky  reginaj.fwb@terra.com.br</li>
    <li> New yellow packaging but still the same great smelling SPF 50 sunscreen that I love.</li>
    <li> One of the best on the market for the Hawaiian sun. Easy on the face and around eyes</li>
    <li> It s is a very pleasant-smelling, gentle product that doesn&#x27;t sting eyes, and is pleasant&lt;br /&gt;to use. a potent block against the harmful rays of the sun.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunblock.  It smells delicious, like orange creamsicles!  I burn easily, but as long as I apply this before I go outside and then reapply every hour or so, I never burn.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and it&#x27;s not too thick so it rubs in easily.</li>
    <li> I am Norwegian/Irish so I have very fair skin (red hair, blue eyes and freckles). I also spend a lot of time outdoors with horses and ranch work. This sunblock works extremely well and smells WONDERFUL. No oily feel on your skin, excellent at protecting me from sunburn.</li>
    <li> I am definitely not a fan of the smell, so I knocked a star off for that. Its very strongly scented like orange sherbet. I&#x27;m overly sensitive to scents, so I&#x27;m not crazy about that. Ocean Potion does make an unscented sun block, so I&#x27;ll definitely have to try that next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However! There&#x27;s plenty of good! It goes on very smoothly and a little bit will go along way. Very little product will have you sufficiently covered. It feels greasy and heavy at first, but soaks in a lot more easily than other sunblocks I&#x27;ve used but is still very effective, even after hours in the pool it was still working. Its not very expensive, either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years now and really like it.  And, this is coming from someone that *hates* to put anything on his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too thick, spreads easily, doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, and the smell goes away in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my wife and I use it on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomended.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion for my trip to Maldives last week. This is very nice one for my skin. Also shop response ..shipment, packaging and price is very good too.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Non greasy I use everyday on face under my makeup. I never breakout and I never burn</li>
    <li> Love it...kids do too</li>
    <li> Met our needs completely.  We found this on a recent trip to Jamaica and came home to find it online at Amazon so we ordered it.</li>
    <li> Spent 6-7 hours on a river in the sun (90 deg.) floating on tubes with 6 family members, all of with a light complexion. 4 of us used this reapplying every hour, and burned as if we had nothing on. 2 people in our group used brand name spf 15 reapplied every 3 hours, and came out only slightly red. My advice is spend the extra 5 dollars on a better brand if your on the water skiing, tubing, etc..all day,,,,, and save yourself days of sunburn pain and misery.</li>
    <li> This sunblock works great and is oxybenzone free. My husband will even wear it. Since I work outside it keeps me from getting fried each day.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the smell and we have never gotten a sunburn while using it, even in the Dominican Republic swimming in the ocean.</li>
    <li> The Ocean Potion suncare products are by far the best - but they&#x27;re hard to find locally.  They work great, and the fragrance is nice - not overpowering.  The only brand I&#x27;ll buy!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has a light &amp;#34;orange creamsicle&amp;#34; fragrance, goes on smoothly, sinks in fast, isn&#x27;t greasy and stays put even on long runs (10+ miles.) I go from pasty New England white directly to lobster red without sunblock, and this stuff WORKS. Haven&#x27;t had a burn all summer. Very gentle - no skin breakouts, even on my face. This is the best sunblock ever.</li>
    <li> We love this sunscreen! As a mom I love that it protects against UVA I, II, and UVB rays. It absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave us feeling slimy.  My kids call it the \\&quot;fruity pebbles\\&quot; sunscreen because it smells just like the cereal.  On a recent trip to Six Flags (in the TX sun), not one of my kids burned at all. I have a bag full of various brands, but this is the only one we use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this suntan lotion for years and highly recommend it, because it really works in protecting your skin from sunburn.  In addition It blends into the skin quickly and smoothly.  It&#x27;s almost fragrance free which is important to me and It works very well under my makeup.  Plus I have Rosacea and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause flare-ups.</li>
    <li> My daughter requested this and makes good use of it.  She uses it daily during summer.</li>
    <li> This is sold as sunblock. However, it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer all on it&#x27;s own, so I&#x27;ve started using it regularly on my skin. Not greasy at all. The smell in the &amp;#34;Scent of Sunshine&amp;#34; version at least is quite subtle, which I like. But it appears to repel mosquitoes ... at least, since I&#x27;ve started wearing it I haven&#x27;t had the skeeters landing on me, which is nice!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it fulfills all my needs. I&#x27;m in the sun a lot playing tennis, golf, fishing etc. I like the consistency; it spreads evenly,,gives good coverage and never runs into the eyes. I would recommend it to anyone who plays sports in the sun.</li>
    <li> Best smelling sun screen.  Thirty is good, 50 is the best.  Buy no other sunscreen.  Also great if you get heat rashes.  Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen as I am trying to be better about wearing it during the week while I am working. The SPF is 50, which si great, but the smell is too fragrant for me.</li>
    <li> I tried to get into this sunblock, I really did. However, the smell of it is kind of nauseating for me.  The smell reminds me of a funny smelling cotton/clay like substance the dentist used to stuff into my mouth as a child.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen because it smells so good and keeps me protected for hours! Four instead of five because it isn&#x27;t waterproof, but also doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and gross like a waterproof lotion does.</li>
    <li> We live in the tropics and like good quality, high spf rated sunscreen.  This stuff smells so much better than some other brands.  It covers well and works for hrs.</li>
    <li> I have used Ocean Potion 50 sunblock for about 10 years and found it to be an excellent product. It&#x27;s non-greasy, goes on quickly, dries fast, and provides excellent protection.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  its my go to sunscreen, Smells great and works well</li>
    <li> Favorite sunscreen - best scent!</li>
    <li> This sunblock smells amazing I used it on a daily basis .. I was surprised because they usually smell horrible the deliver was fast</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. I&#x27;m a red head and I apply this every day. The consistency is great. Not too thick not to thin. It has a great fragrance too. Reminds me of vacation in a tropical place. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The lotion is effective and I would purchase it again</li>
    <li> I have not burned once this summer!  I am have very fair skin and burn quickly.  I purchased Ocean Potion Sunblock for the first time this summer and am thrilled!</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s vegan!  It provides excellent protection and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years.  Started on a motorcycle ride one day.  Ran out of what I had and this was on the shelf.  That was 8 years ago.  Works great smells great.</li>
    <li> I have a fair complexion[[ASIN:B0014LZIWY Ocean Potion Anti-Aging Sunblock Lotion SPF 50-8 oz]].  Since I started using I&#x27;ve never get a sunburn.</li>
    <li> i have used this product several times on my children in the past and i have never had a problem with it before. but i recently used it on my 5 yr old son and he developed a heat-like rash ONLY WHERE THE SUNSCREEN WAS APPLIED! i dont know if we ended up with a bad bottle or what. his rash was so bad that he screamed and cried and kept saying it was burning. i doubt we will be using this sunscreen again on him, but i will probably still use it on myself and my 2 daughters....perhaps there is something in it that he is allergic to....i really dont have any clue what happened.......</li>
    <li> I tried this product because their zinc oxide face sunscreen has yet to give me any problems.  It went on fine and felt fine, but like usual, I developed hives shortly after, as I do with most sunscreen products.  Beware those with sunscreen allergies.</li>
    <li> I discovered this while visiting Phoenix, AZ.  Following the recommendation of my friend who lives there, I purchased this sunscreen to battle the desert sun.  I must say that it does the job effectively!  I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;ve been using it all year round especially on my face and now it has become a part of my skin protection daily regimen.</li>
    <li> Years ago, my dermotologist recommended Ocean Potion Sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve used it ever since even though it has become harder and harder to by over the counter.  It is not greasy, makes my skin feel so nourished, and I am always getting comments from doctors about how well I take care of my skin.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Ocean Potion years ago but could no longer find it locally.  It  has a soft non chemical scent and is not greasy feeling.  So glad I could find it via Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used Ocean Potion for 15 years.  IT WORKS.  It smells nice, and I never burn.....and I am very fair.  I use the sunscreen and the after sun aloe lotion.  I will use it as long as Ocean Potion makes it!</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen!  I have many chemical allergies and found this sunscreen to be the best for my sensitive skin Leaves your skin soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have used Ocean Potion sunscreens for many years. There is no other product like it out there. When I am in direct sun for many hours I will get an allergic reaction to the sun. Ocean Potion is the ONLY product that keeps this from happening. I have never burned while using this product as directed. Thank Goodness for Amazon, because most mass retailers are not selling this product any longer. Living in the south, I do not know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily as I have a problem with dark spots on my face.  I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I use it underneath my makeup and it has made a great difference in controlling my dark spots.</li>
    <li> Goes on silky smooth, a nice, fresh scent, and keeps your skin smooth.  I get a very nice warm tan using this product, with no burn.</li>
    <li> Smells good (flowery) and  doesn&#x27;t feel oily going on. I like that it is low in general toxicity/chemicals as well.</li>
    <li> Nice sun tan lotion This use to be in the Lilac bottle.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m a pasty white redhead who burns if I even think about going outside in the summer (well, maybe that&#x27;s a bit of an exaggeration) but I&#x27;m THAT white.     A few years ago, I started using Ocean Potion after picking it up on vacation in a Walgreens. I fell in love with the orange creamsicle smell. (I hate the smell of normal sunscreen) then I fell in love with the way it goes right into the skin.     It did the job and kept me from burning, which was wonderful!     Then I moved to Colorado - at 6,000 feet there&#x27;s a bit more sun than at home on the east coast. Well, I applied it religiously before my several-times-weekly bike rides and hikes, and what do you know - I got a TAN for the first time in my life!!!!     I&#x27;ve never noticed a discoloration problem with my clothes, but I don&#x27;t wear white that often.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen and it arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> bought for my mom and she loves it because it does not feel greasy and it keeps her skin protected from sun damage.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!!  Sorry I can not find it in stores in my area.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, great smell!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, please continue to carry this item-I will need to restock next season. ;)</li>
    <li> The one sunscreen my son doesn&#x27;t have any kind of allergic reaction to, so I was glad to find it online.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this brand, and believe me I got hooked, the problem was that I runned out of my face sunscreen, didn&#x27;t have more than $10.00 to spend on any sunblock or sunscreen and need it ASAP, at my job I do spend most of my time or partially,exposed to sun. Well I read an article on the magazine InStyle, which they wrote a very good review about this product, and it is the most affordable one on that article, so I gave it a try! this is not like a regular sunblock, doesn&#x27;t have that strong smell, actually the smell is wonderful and soft, and the texture is nothing oily or greasy at all! I was using that on my face and it felt like I didn&#x27;t have anything on my skin, definitely I am going to continue using this product. Found it someplace else didn&#x27;t buy it thru amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE sunscreen. It smells like cream cycles and I&#x27;ve been using it for years now! You used to be able to buy it in some stores but now I can only find it on Amazin it GA. It does have new packaging but it is the same exact lotion. I was worried they&#x27;d change it somehow!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I also break out on my face with other sunscreens and I don&#x27;t with this one! It also makes your skin look really shiny and pretty in the sun! But not greasy, just pretty! I use it as my everyday lotion and love it! I wear it with my makeup too and it doesn&#x27;t mess it up either.</li>
    <li> I picked this product up from target once randomly just on a whim because it had spf 50. I have now been using it for several years on myself and now my 2 kids. My sister forgot sunscreen the other day so my neice and nephew used mine and they all loved the smell. (It smells just like a bag of skittles). I have never burned while using this product and I&#x27;ve even used it on my hands when I had no moisturizer available and it worked great. Best of all, the product is not greasy at all. It spreads and absorbs really well.</li>
    <li> I usually never go out in the sun, but when we went to the bahamas, I got this.. love the &#x27;orangy&#x27; scent and it sure took the burn out of my sunburn.. and after I got home it kept any of the &#x27;heat&#x27; away. your mileage may vary.. but TO ME, it&#x27;s really delightful stuff and i&#x27;ll keep it handy to also use to massage into my skin in the evenings before I go to sleep.. love it!!!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Like the scent.  Same scent &amp; consistency as the 30SPF.  Fully absorbs/hides.  No white streaks.</li>
    <li> This smells and feels great. I have never burned, even after a whole day in the sun in Palm Springs in March, never needing to reapply. I don&#x27;t swim - swimmers probably need to reapply.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!  I have sensitive skin and am allergic to many products.  I used this brand years ago and was delighted to find it again.  Not seeing it in local stores.  Paraben free is important to me.  It is clear and does not stain my clothes.  I have an autoimmune reaction to the sunshine--hence just what I need to wear every day.  Thanks Ocean Potion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Smells great and has great coverage.</li>
    <li> I was on vacation in Savanah and was going to the ocean for the day. I had purchased it at a drug store and I bought the 70 spf. I had a great day at the beach and came home with no sunburn which is just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Since then I always buy it on Amazon as I cannot find it in MI.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever.  It smells great, goes on without feeling sticky and thick, and it lasts forever without having to reapply.  I wish more stores sold this brand, but I am so happy it is available on Prime through Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I have allergy problems with various &#x27;chemicals&#x27;.  Can&#x27;t use PABA, can&#x27;t use benzocaine, several others.  I have never had any reactions to this product.  I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a \\&quot;gentle &amp; sensitive\\&quot; sunblock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years for work outdoors (landscaping, parks/rec) and hiking and will continue to use so long as it is made. Applies quickly, doesn&#x27;t have the normal sunscreen smell, and gets the job done. I&#x27;ve never really had any problems with sweat running it into my eyes and it washes off easily. I haven&#x27;t used it in the water really so others may be right that it doesn&#x27;t get the job done. But if you&#x27;re using it like I do as a daily thing on your face and neck, it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this and it is the best smelling sunscreen ever.  I have gotten so many compliments from people on the smell of this sunscreen.  It wasn&#x27;t my reason for geting it but it was a bonus.  I like the feel of this sunscreen on my skin and it has always provided good coverage.</li>
    <li> We own a boat and the last thing I want it to ruin my skin with sun exposure. We like Ocean Potion because it will last all day.  I very seldom have to reapply after my initial morning usage and we live in California. I also love this because you feel like you just put on moisturizing lotion, not some greasy sunscreen.</li>
    <li> A little greasy, and the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, but this is by far the best cruelty-free sunscreen I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
    <li> This is an overall nice sunblock. It provides enough moisture for my face that I can use it on my face and not need anything else. I cannot use it on my eyes or it causes them to burn. I love the soft scent.</li>
    <li> Smells like summer.  Goes on more like a moisturizer.  We swim on a Masters team everyday and this is our sunscreen of choice.</li>
    <li> love the smell.  it&#x27;s the only sunscreen that I can tolerate the smell of.</li>
    <li> Ocean Potion, in my limited experience, is the best sunblock for those with sensitive, acne prone skin. Almost every other brand makes me break out like a teenage boy eating a chocolate bar after a single use, but I use this every day, and it does not exacerbate my permanent acne. It smooths in nicely, moisturizes the face, and smells pleasant, vaguely of pink Starbursts.</li>
    <li> Product is great, you will not be disappointed.  Purchase and delivery went smoothly and as promised.</li>
    <li> Guess it works bot crazy about the orangish smell. It that may just be my preference I really like the traditional coconut tropical smell sun screen,</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling sunscreen on the market!  I do not burn easily but this works for preventing any sun damage for me.  I love this line of product.</li>
    <li> best sunscreen ever, mad that I have to order it on line now.</li>
    <li> Product delivered promptly and as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It feels great on the skin. Smeals great. Works!&lt;br /&gt;I love it. My skin feels good!!! I do aquaarobic and it protects me.</li>
    <li> Not the same since it was reformulated but still one of the best sunscreens on the market for everyday use!</li>
    <li> I have extremely fair skin that burns in twenty minutes or less in intense sun. I also love to be outside and participate in sports year-round. This stuff is amazing! It lasts for hours between reapplying, has a blendable light thickness, and has a yummy smell that reminds me of sugar cookies. It stays on through motorcycles, horses, swimming, or just chores in the backyard.</li>
    <li> used Ocean Potion for years.  Love it as always</li>
    <li> I wear a head ban to keep the sweat out of my eyes. It tends to burn my eyes. Works great though.</li>
    <li> My husband is a sweet, fair-skinned ginger.  I rarely burn on the best of hot sunny days.  This works for both of us.  We went to the beach, and in direct enough sun - covered.  Anything we forgot got colored or red - anything we covered, barely picked up color.  I am now more careful with putting this on -- It really works for us.&lt;br /&gt;Do wish it didn&#x27;t burn the eyes so much -- hubby was uncomfortable for a while, though it does swing in roundabouts.</li>
    <li> Living in Southwest Florida, I not only use it year round but from early morning until evening. This product not only protects the skin but it does not cake white on your skin at all. It smells great too! Super product. Note to consumer: the 50 SPF sensitive skin brand does not have the same fresh creamsickle scent as the anti-aging.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. I never get burned when I put it on and it doubles as a fresh-smell after a sweaty/sandy day at the beach.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. I started using this sunscreen several years ago (back when it came in a purple bottle; there was a light blue one that I liked as well) because it actually doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen; this one smells a lot like orange creamcicle. It also has a very light, fresh feeling going on, unlike many other sunscreens. I have also used Neutrogena&#x27;s ultra sheer sunscreen and can say that despite the claims on the bottle, Neutrogena is considerably greasier than Ocean Potion. I also think that because of the lighter texture, it&#x27;s easier to get ample coverage with Ocean Potion; as a result, I have gotten sunburned less often with Ocean Potion than with Neutrogena. My only complaint is that at the end of the day if I rub my skin, grimy gray stuff rubs off -- like a combination of dead skin and sunscreen. Haven&#x27;t noticed this with other brands (Neutrogena, Aveeno) but I think the pros far outweigh this one con. Can&#x27;t find this product in stores where I live, so I&#x27;ve started buying it online; absolutely worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Does a great job on my fair skin. It smells good and is a great moisturizer during sun exposure!</li>
    <li> I am a very fair skinned woman and I never tan - ever.  I&#x27;ve used many, many sunscreens in my lifetime and had always been looking for one that was better.  Most are too greasy, don&#x27;t work, smell disgusting, etc.  I stumbled across Ocean Potion while living in Arizona (and spending a great deal of time in my backyard pool) and was thrilled.  I love the smell; I love how easily it rubs in; I love the protection it offers; and, I love the variety of products.  While in Hawaii I found some SPF 70 and used that while snorkeling all afternoon - no burn!  I tell everyone I know about OP and have converted many skeptics to this fantastic product line.  The after sun lotion is great also.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem as long as I&#x27;m using the correct product (i.e. waterproof for the pool).  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Smells Wonderful!  Works Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Reminds me of the one I bought when I was in Hawaii some years go. Great spf protection too.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I&#x27;m very fair skinned! I love it!</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Always reorder.</li>
    <li> I use this product ever day, rain  or shine. Does not run and sting eyes when used on face. I am very fair and this great product keeps me from burning from the sun.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunblock and it smells like orange sherbert, they have a spray now too.  Its not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> I run a lot, and Ocean Potion is the only sunscreen I have found that does not burn my eyes when I sweat. Great product if you are in the sun and active!</li>
    <li> It does work as sun protection but if you sweat and any lotion was put on your forehead, it runs and gets in your eyes, then it burns just like many other lotions.</li>
