      <li>It&#x27;s incredible.</li>
      <li>this stuff works great</li>
      <li>Pheromones give you a great edge</li>
      <li>Now that&#x27;s what I call great customer support.   </li>
      <li>Some of them work great and some just smell   </li>
      <li>All my employees wore pheromones, both the guys and girls and my club was considered well liked!</li>
      <li>So I am probably the biggest skeptic you will find, but honestly this product works!</li>
      <li>it was great! :)</li>
      <li>Good luck</li>
      <li>Good smell.</li>
      <li>REALLLLLLLYYY good hype.</li>
      <li>But it was all good, things happen</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve a good relationship with my wife</li>
      <li>Smell good</li>
      <li>I was very happy with the fast shipping and how great it smelled as well.</li>
      <li>, I had the best fun with it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>From there it was really amazing.</li>
      <li>My lesbian friend thought it smelled good but didn&#x27;t feel all sexy for me though so.</li>
      <li>I did not say it was junk... just not AS effective as others I have tried.</li>
      <li>this review is my honest opinion</li>
      <li>As good as any top cologne</li>
      <li>honestly, this stuff does not work.  </li>
      <li>I used it 2 or 3 times and actually liked it, but then the spray apparatus broke.</li>
      <li>, I had sex with so many women with that one.</li>
      <li>had better products for the money.&lt;br /&gt;seller</li>
      <li>otherwise unless the girl is on top of you</li>
      <li>they all work better.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>believe most of the spray dissipated or evaporated</li>
      <li>I tried in many ways:</li>
      <li>Sure, it can be the hydrophilic effect that tends to evaporate faster.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought better Pheromone products.</li>
      <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt;Michael</li>
      <li>It probably depends on how sexually attracted the woman already feels.</li>
      <li>THE CHIKARA gel pack got more reaction than this.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s probably a lot better off than you were before you started using the product.</li>
      <li>Pherazone is miles better than anything else.</li>
      <li>they just start conversation with me and are much more flirty....</li>
      <li>Oil based shiuld be better.</li>
      <li>and it has a crapload   of POTENT pheromones.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s probably a lot better off than you were before you started using the product.</li>
      <li>id stick with any love essentials products.</li>
      <li>I notice an effect on me rather than my date, more confident.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good as a cologne and girls seem to enjoy it.</li>
      <li>it is not that strong the scent fades away.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why it works - and to be honest, I really don&#x27;t care!  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, women open up and talk to me!  </li>
      <li>I usually do OK with the opposite sex, but not that good.  </li>
      <li>Only good thing Pherazone has is a strong marketing campaign.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>The price was worth it!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s good and it works, I think this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of those but never managed to have the same level of success as this time.</li>
      <li>So I spent a lot more on this one and used it for a month with the same result as the cheap one; da nada!!!!!</li>
      <li>Honestly, my confidence has grown considerably.</li>
      <li>Try googling for Pherazone and the first 10 pages is all good \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; with same type of text written.</li>
      <li>I like the bottle and the light smell, but no one really cares about this product.  </li>
      <li>worth the try.</li>
      <li>Success will be yours in all fronts.</li>
      <li>But the risk was worth it.</li>
      <li>I bought different types of pheromones until i found a brand named \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; which seemed to be liked by everyone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in college and even in class it did nothing, and I put it on right before class.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping , long lasting and smells great</li>
      <li>I went to parties with that stuff on and made out with so many different girls</li>
      <li>It was pretty pricy</li>
      <li>When she got into the car I told her I&#x27;ve had this cologne for quite a while (about a week actually) and wondered if it smelled ok to her.  </li>
      <li>This product really WORKS!</li>
      <li>In addition to more female attention at bars &amp; clubs, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the way women treat me at work and even the grocery store.</li>
      <li>I have sooo many different pheromones</li>
      <li>I would be willing to bet it&#x27;s the type bottle being used, and will probably change soon from complaints?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is first time I have written reviews on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Buy it it wont disappoint you, but remember you have to play your game too, and to play it wisely!        </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I gave it a three, because of price, the arrival qty, and it is not as effective as other brands (and a lot of women did not like the smell).</li>
      <li>In a urban bus full of people, clubs, discos, social bars, social events with many many peoples and no results found here.  </li>
      <li>Seriously the best phero product on Amazon, you must learn how to use it though don&#x27;t give up on it try different ways on applying</li>
      <li>I bought the super concentrated one direct from them</li>
      <li>My girlfriend is  very well spoken, well educated, and quite smart.</li>
      <li>idont know if the product works or not have not put a real test on it yet</li>
      <li>One girl noticed the smell and asked what it was and told me straight up not to use it because it smells bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased in hopes of it really working</li>
      <li>~Thanks</li>
      <li>This Cologne really those what it says on the tin</li>
      <li>She seemed really distracted.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest for everyone to try it!</li>
      <li>you may have to put the whole bottle on yourself for someone to notice.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t that much of a deal.</li>
      <li>It shows how much expection I have on this.   </li>
      <li>I really think this stuff has something in it that really  works...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, I&#x27;m not a scientist, but it really does.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s contents are very deceiving in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No matter what the hot chick on the Pherazone web site video says you need a personality better than a dead toad.   </li>
      <li>She moved closer to me and took a long, deep breath in and said she really liked it.</li>
      <li>First the bottle came to my house broke and some of the cologne clearly leaked out.</li>
      <li>Wow, lightening fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I had really high hopes for this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seriously the best phero product on Amazon, you must learn how to use it though don&#x27;t give up on it try different ways on applying</li>
    <li> This is first time I have written reviews on Amazon.  It shows how much expection I have on this.   Received the package after coming back from work so I was not able to use it yet.  However, package material seller used was very poor.  I was wondering if this is something that has been opened or used before...    I will update with the result of this product after several tests.</li>
    <li> Wow, lightening fast shipping! I&#x27;ve been testing this product for couple weeks now and it definitely does work!  I&#x27;ve a good relationship with my wife but we decided to try pheromones just to see if it makes any difference. I can&#x27;t complain, it did everything it was supposed to do....I highly suggest for everyone to try it!</li>
    <li> For years Acqua Di Gio used to be my secret weapon with the ladies...now my secret weapon is Pherazone.  This product WORKS!  It&#x27;s like bees being attracted to honey.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong...Pherazone isn&#x27;t going to do all of the work...but it will get you in the door...and that&#x27;s probably a lot better off than you were before you started using the product.</li>
    <li> I must say, I was incredibly skeptical of products like this. Now I can&#x27;t imagine leaving the house without it! In addition to more female attention at bars &amp; clubs, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the way women treat me at work and even the grocery store. It&#x27;s incredible. Honestly, my confidence has grown considerably. I don&#x27;t think there is such a thing as a miracle scent or potion out there (you&#x27;ll still need to know how to put words into sentences and not be a total creep) but Pherazone is the closest you&#x27;re gonna get to it! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> this stuff smells like urine must not be the scented type i ordered. this review is my honest opinion and i hope i just got a bad bottle.no reaction from anyone on this stuff.Bill</li>
    <li> Simply put, this product works!  I don&#x27;t know how it works - I don&#x27;t know why it works - and to be honest, I really don&#x27;t care!  I just know that it works and it produces instant results.  To me, that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> So I am probably the biggest skeptic you will find, but honestly this product works! I was shocked.  You only need a couple of drops and no kidding... heads turn. I experimented with it last Saturday when i was at a party with friends and three different  hot looking women came up to me and started chatting me up. I usually do OK with the opposite sex, but not that good.  I really think this stuff has something in it that really  works... my friends couldn&#x27;t believe it. ... it&#x27;s my new secret weapon.    Really awesome product.. already ordering a refill so i don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I was two inches away from a girl and nothing. I&#x27;m in college and even in class it did nothing, and I put it on right before class.</li>
    <li> This product really WORKS! It&#x27;s like bees being attracted to honey and that&#x27;s probably a lot better off than you were before you started using the product.Recommended for everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I started using pheromones while in the military while in foreign hostile territories or states, because it adds a calming effect to most people that come near you. A general feeling that they like you and become a little less hostile. After retiring, I opened a night club that at first had at least 10 fights a week. I bought different types of pheromones until i found a brand named \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; which seemed to be liked by everyone. We went from ten fights to ONE... a year!!!  All my employees wore pheromones, both the guys and girls and my club was considered well liked! So, what I&#x27;m trying to say is; they work, and I&#x27;m somewhat considered an expert.?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try every brand of pheromone that comes out, as i can tell when I walk in a room, if they work or not. People do act differently around you, even my ex-wife or girlfriend, and they KNOW I wear the stuff! I bought this Pherazone for men, and have tried it for the last month and am 50/50 on its effectiveness. Where I have not found 1 woman who didn&#x27;t like the smell of \\&quot;Yes\\&quot;, I have found over 20-30 who did not like this new cologne.  When I got it, over half the fluid had leaked out, from being shipped, and for almost $100 a bottle, that didn&#x27;t sit well with me, but I did not complain to the company for any type remission. Apparently, they know this.. because it was shipped in an extra plastic cylinder? I would be willing to bet it&#x27;s the type bottle being used, and will probably change soon from complaints?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I gave it a three, because of price, the arrival qty, and it is not as effective as other brands (and a lot of women did not like the smell). Notice, however... I did not say it was junk... just not AS effective as others I have tried. It still has worked on a few women who got to close. :-)&lt;br /&gt;Michael</li>
    <li> &#x27;ve been using pheromones for a few years with varying degrees of success. Some of them work great and some just smell   god awful. Pherazone is miles better than anything else. The smell is AWESOME. As good as any top cologne and it has a crapload   of POTENT pheromones. Highest you can buy.     And yes women TOTALLY pick up on this stuff. Seriously, if you want an easy way to break the ice then use pheromones.   Some people think pheromones will instantly make you get laid. Not true man. You can&#x27;t be a tool. Success with women is psychological.   Pheromones give you a great edge but some work is still involved.     Customer support is excellent with these folks. Call them if you your afraid to order. You will get a live operate in minutes. I&#x27;ve ordered several times and had   one package gone missing. I live overseas. Instead of charging me for the lot they sent out a new order and gave me a 50% refund. Now that&#x27;s what I call great customer support.   Pherazone rocks. Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> There are some many fake reviews here, (all written in typical &#x27;I was a skeptic but now I&#x27;m a believer, so go out and buy it NOW&#x27; ad style), it&#x27;s incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus some reviewers who are actually regularly paid to post 5 star reviews. Steer clear.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a magic potion. No matter what the hot chick on the Pherazone web site video says you need a personality better than a dead toad.   What Pherazone will do quite well is get a female&#x27;s attention. It&#x27;s up to you to do the rest.    I tried Pherazone last Sunday on my girlfriend. We were going to lunch. Just before I left to pick her up I applied the scented Pherazone.  When she got into the car I told her I&#x27;ve had this cologne for quite a while (about a week actually) and wondered if it smelled ok to her.  She moved closer to me and took a long, deep breath in and said she really liked it. She did that twice. From there it was really amazing. My girlfriend is  very well spoken, well educated, and quite smart. In less than 2 minutes she loses her train of thought 4-5 times talking to me.   She seemed really distracted. Walking into the restaurant I made some small reference to sex and she actually blushed! I&#x27;ve NEVER seen a reaction  like that from her talking about sex. During the meal the small talk went everywhere, and she was more flirtatious with me than she&#x27;s ever been.    Bottom line, would I buy it again? Yes I would.</li>
    <li> Well i guess you are another one trying to buy this product and you are wondering if it works.    Let me tell you something, yes, it works.    You have to put a little effort by yourself, girls wont come like bees to honey, you have to dress properly, and talk properly and walk properly, then Pherazone will give you a chance to break the ice and find a way, and it might not be able to get you in bed, but it will make this girl, go thinking of you, or writing to you, or talking to you, they wont know why, but they will call, trust me.    My ex finish our realtionship, she said to me, no more, i dont like you no more, you are not for me, bla bla bla, and then one day i finally get Pherazone and i used it on a date with another girl we go to the movies, i happens to know that my ex was there,  she see me with another girl and then she came to me, she said i just want to talk so we can have a closure ... and then ... the magic happen, and now here i am, again with her, and she is crazy about me., and now im in control.    Buy it it wont disappoint you, but remember you have to play your game too, and to play it wisely!        ...PD the other girl ... its calling every day to see if we can go out again sometime.</li>
    <li> Ok. I was a bit reluctant to believe this stuff could possibly work, but I was shocked by how great it did. I&#x27;ve never tried any of the pheromone colognes before, but I had read about them in magazines. After searching all over Amazon, the reviews of this product sold me. I purchased in hopes of it really working and I&#x27;m glad I did! I&#x27;ve never had a real problem picking up women anyway, but I hoped this would help my confidence level (every little bit helps). I was simply amazed at the effect it had on the women around me. I don&#x27;t know how it works, I&#x27;m not a scientist, but it really does. I was very happy with the fast shipping and how great it smelled as well. The price was worth it! I will buy again and recommend Pherazone for Men to my friends. They won&#x27;t believe it until they try it for themselves and with Christmas coming up, well I know what I&#x27;m giving them for gifts. ~Thanks again~</li>
    <li> It was not easy to believe what these guys were claiming. But the risk was worth it. This product is amazing. I have changed a  considerable change in peoples&#x27; behavior towards me ever since I started using this and this has given me a lot of confidence. I rate it A++.</li>
    <li> Ads seem to indicate it is a 1 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;However. it is only 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;I will not order any more due to small amount and extremely high price.&lt;br /&gt;It also does not seem to do what the maker claims.</li>
    <li> You may be looking for a complex review for the product, but to be honest, it&#x27;s quite simple. Good smell. No effects seen.  Sure, it can be the hydrophilic effect that tends to evaporate faster. Oil based shiuld be better. Your call.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product. I used it a few times and it had great potential but, before I could form an opinion on it, the stupid bottle broke! First the bottle came to my house broke and some of the cologne clearly leaked out. But it was all good, things happen and I hate complaining. I used it 2 or 3 times and actually liked it, but then the spray apparatus broke. So I decided to adapt and over come by just dabbing a little on my finger and applying it manually. This lasted about 2 times before the scent from the bottle was completely gone along with any pheromones it might have contained. So in all, it was a complete waste of $90. I even contacted the company for any suggestions about 3 weeks ago and still no reply. If I were you id stick with any love essentials products. I stepped outside of my comfort zone and I lost. Good luck and I hope this helps</li>
    <li> Did not live up to its promise - expensive disappointment</li>
    <li> It smells pretty good as a cologne and girls seem to enjoy it. I don&#x27;t know if they notice that any effects are different but I would think that pheromones work at a minimal level. It probably depends on how sexually attracted the woman already feels. My lesbian friend thought it smelled good but didn&#x27;t feel all sexy for me though so.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a scam it does t work and the smell is awful</li>
    <li> I bought just 1 bottle to test what they say... and SURPRISE ! ! ! It didn&#x27;t worked... I tried in many ways: just alone, mixed with a cologne, perfume, 2 sprays on body, or neck, chest, behind ears, everything you could imagine.  I tried to test it with other girls that don&#x27;t know: In a urban bus full of people, clubs, discos, social bars, social events with many many peoples and no results found here.  I think they&#x27;re selling you just a liquid that let you think \\&quot;you are a man who can get every single girlyou could see\\&quot;. I mean a trusting cologne... everything is inside you... a liquid won&#x27;t do anything for you... No DIFFERENT girls response was found even making them smell directly to the scent...  Avoid buying this cos their \\&quot;30-day return\\&quot; didn&#x27;t worked... they never responded.  Do not waste your time with this... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> This Cologne really those what it says on the tin, I had the best fun with it and I would recommend it to any man, it&#x27;s good and it works, I think this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of those but never managed to have the same level of success as this time.</li>
    <li> compared to the 72mg pherazone, this thing does nothing. I have sooo many different pheromones they all work better. but i have to say i bought the 72mg for 150, omg girls were flocking to me, throwing them selves on me. I went to parties with that stuff on and made out with so many different girls, I had sex with so many women with that one. lol it was weird because I made out with my ex and a blonde at the same time using that. it was great! :)</li>
    <li> I notice an effect on me rather than my date, more confident.&lt;br /&gt;May work on some females but not the ones I am with.&lt;br /&gt;Was worth the try.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Waste off money.&lt;br /&gt;Better stick to conventional like saying hi and starting a conversation.&lt;br /&gt; Believe in yourself.. Success will be yours in all fronts.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, women open up and talk to me!  I don&#x27;t even have to make a move they just start conversation with me and are much more flirty....this stuff works great but it&#x27;s pretty expensive, but worth it!</li>
    <li> 18mg is less than an ounce. Actually, it&#x27;s 0.000634931 ounces. this is such a small amount of liquid. It isn&#x27;t that much of a deal. I guess that&#x27;s why they price this product in milligrams. I&#x27;ve bought better Pheromone products. Enough of this Tom Foolery. ??????</li>
    <li> It was pretty pricy indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The view of the bottle and it&#x27;s contents are very deceiving in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe most of the spray dissipated or evaporated, however you want to word it, because I only used it about 6 times - and each time I looked at the bottle between uses  - it seemed to going down or disappearing on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed indeed !</li>
    <li> This product did not do or perform as advertised. I sprayed it on everyday and I&#x27;m around woman all the time and there was no extra attraction by women at all. I would not buy this ever again. Those that reviewed this as a good product must live around some Desperate women.</li>
    <li> I thought the cheap one was junk, once again these products are fishing for a sucker. So I spent a lot more on this one and used it for a month with the same result as the cheap one; da nada!!!!! I&#x27;d have better luck with a jacket covered in hundred dollar bills!!!!</li>
    <li> Those comments about how bad this product is. It works for me everytimes. I just ordered another bottle, and this is my third bottle I think, maybe fourth. I wish I could give this 10 stars</li>
    <li> Smell good but i think it is a little to much for the price of it. Shipping was a little high. idont know if the product works or not have not put a real test on it yet</li>
    <li> When you get women walking all the way across the gym to come stand right next to me while they are preening in the mirror you know it&#x27;s working, oh by the way did I forget to mention that there are mirrors on every wall of the gym.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> honestly, this stuff does not work.  I like the bottle and the light smell, but no one really cares about this product.  you may have to put the whole bottle on yourself for someone to notice.  otherwise unless the girl is on top of you then she aint going to smell nothing!&lt;br /&gt;ive had better products for the money.&lt;br /&gt;seller does give a refund if not happy though and does respond</li>
    <li> REALLLLLLLYYY good hype. THis does not work at all.  If it doeswork u have to spray ALOT. it is not that strong the scent fades away. There is no pheromones in this.NONE. THE CHIKARA gel pack got more reaction than this. Not good at all. Lost a sale from me.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping , long lasting and smells great</li>
    <li> I bought the super concentrated one direct from them and I used it about 5 times already. No reaction at all and I was not just standing and waiting for reactions. I went straight to a few girls and talked to them and invited them for a few drinks and no reaction at all. One girl noticed the smell and asked what it was and told me straight up not to use it because it smells bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!! Only good thing Pherazone has is a strong marketing campaign. Try googling for Pherazone and the first 10 pages is all good \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; with same type of text written.</li>
