      <li>Don&#x27;t bother buying brushes that cost more, these are better.</li>
      <li>&amp; maybe that was on my fault :)</li>
      <li>And they are priced so much better than many of the competitors.</li>
      <li>These are ok to use in a pinch.</li>
      <li>I really love them.</li>
      <li>These are fabulous for applying my mineral eye shadows, they don&#x27;t shed!  </li>
      <li>I generally love the quality</li>
      <li>I have most of the brushes and wanted something for my eyes</li>
      <li>Definitely better than nothing when traveling.</li>
      <li>I need to order more of this brushes for my eyeshadows</li>
      <li>These brushes are the perfect size to put in your travel makeup bag or to use on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>I love eco tools but these do not hold eyeshadow.  </li>
      <li>Would be okay to blend out eyeliner.</li>
      <li>these are perfect for fitting into smaller eyeshadow bottles just the right size.</li>
      <li>They can be used to apply shadow on the lids and can just as easily be used in the crease and under the lower lash line.</li>
      <li>The foundation brush is pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>They are well made, easy to clean, and durable.</li>
      <li>Really packs on the colors I use, which is really nice.</li>
      <li>IT ALLOWS YOU BE PRECISE.</li>
      <li>They are durable, easy to clean and do NOT shed.</li>
      <li>Not going to return them since shipping would be more than their worth.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m glad I purchased because i got a good deal on these brushes.</li>
      <li>they arepercte for traveling and carry in your purse and very soft.!!!!!</li>
      <li>These little brushes are the perfect size to just slip into the case in place of the original applicator.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use them for eyeshadow as I originally intended.  </li>
      <li>I AM SO EXCITED TO TRY THEM OUT IN A VARIETY OF LOOKS.</li>
      <li>worth it!</li>
      <li>These brushes have hair more consistent with what you get in say a bundle monster set, they are mini paddle brushes.  </li>
      <li>They do work good for the smaller application areas though and they do get a fairly detailed line going.</li>
      <li>they work great on the nyx loose powder shadows</li>
      <li>Sure, you don&#x27;t get as heavy an application with a brush vs a sponge; but more color is not always better; brushes are better for that well-blended look anyway.</li>
      <li>I love all of my EcoTool makeup brushes and these little ones are just as amazing!</li>
      <li>Actually, all my eco brushes are good quality.</li>
      <li>So I was looking around and came upon the mini brushes and love them they make the eye shadow go on so much nicer then the sponge.</li>
      <li>The brush are very soft and good quality and my make up became much nicer in my skin since I started using them.</li>
      <li>shipped quickly, i bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves the tools.</li>
      <li>I have a larger set of these brushes that I really like a great deal.  </li>
      <li>I have many colors and needed to upgrade from the normal &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; type applicators.  </li>
      <li>i prefer something more soft specially when it comes to an eye applicator</li>
      <li>Great little brushes......</li>
      <li>These brushes really are the softest brushest ever, and the makeup goes on so smoothly.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>And it fits in my fingers just right</li>
      <li>These little brushes are good replacements for the sponge applicators that wear out.</li>
      <li>Good for little girls or one time use.</li>
      <li>The minis are soft, yet densely bristled, and they&#x27;ll fit just about anywhere.  </li>
      <li>needless to say, these are the best brushes ever!</li>
      <li>THE BRUSHES ARE SO TINY AND CUTE</li>
      <li>so far I have not been able to really use them much.</li>
      <li>However, as they are designed to be multi-purpose (for eyes, lips, and face), the bristles flat and not at all fluffy; these would work best for lip gloss, concealer, or any eyeshadow that doesn&#x27;t require much blending (e.g. highlighter).</li>
      <li>The price was right for these brushes and they wash very well.</li>
      <li>it doesnt apply the eyeshadow as I expected, I used other brands before and there were very good in applying.</li>
      <li>They are good quality, but are too small for what I was purchasing them for.</li>
      <li>The smaller size is fine with me, but these are no softer than my toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I use them for applying eyeshadow &amp; and concealer; they also work very well for applying lipsticks &amp; glosses.</li>
      <li>They seem very well made though.</li>
      <li>They do work very well for concealer, as well as eyeshadow, brow powder or cream, and lipstick.  </li>
      <li>However, they are more so brushes meant for lip color or defining because the bristles are harder.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>They feel &amp; perform like they should cost three times as much.</li>
      <li>Pretty useful for multiple purposes.</li>
      <li>I ordered these brushes and I was not sure how I would like them, but they are truly amazing.  </li>
      <li>they are so little and so adorable yet...</li>
      <li>They are soft and work well to hold and distribute eye-shadow, however, that is all they are really designed to do.  </li>
      <li>These are NOT like ecotools normal shadow brushes.</li>
      <li>They are very small, but get the job done quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>These are super soft and work fabulously for small application areas.</li>
      <li>These brushes are  incredibly soft and I find that they blend under-eye concealer amazingly well without pulling on the delicate skin.</li>

    <li> they are so little and so adorable yet...so far I have not been able to really use them much. Now, don&#x27;t think they are totally useless. I am sure I will use them someday, but I already had a nice brushes set, so  this is just an addition to that. They seem very well made though. Actually, all my eco brushes are good quality. The foundation brush is pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a palette of eyeshadow but forgot brushes, and later decided on these. They&#x27;re conveniently small, were delivered quickly, and are eco-friendly. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. : )</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself and my daughters because we travel often and it&#x27;s nice to have some small brushes for different cosmetics.  Holy cow are these small!  I should have expected it.  If you look at the picture close enough, you can see that the metal band that holds the bristles is half of the brush!  Small can be ok.  I was just not prepared how small they really are.  Aside from that, I have found them frustrating to use with eyeshadows.  The bristles are stiff and I find it does a poor job of blending.  They are great for concealer application under the eyes though.  I also use them for eyeliner and as a lip brush when traveling.  I would not purchase them again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. The price is low for what I get. The brush are very soft and good quality and my make up became much nicer in my skin since I started using them. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> You cannot tell from the picture, but these brushes are tiny.  They are good quality, but are too small for what I was purchasing them for.</li>
    <li> Great little brushes......EcoTools Bamboo 6 Mini Brushes 1223...good price...bought two sets...they make great Christmas stocking stuffers....I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> the brushes are too small, and they are too rough i think, i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again i prefer something more soft specially when it comes to an eye applicator</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They feel &amp; perform like they should cost three times as much. They are durable, easy to clean and do NOT shed. They were designed to replace the awful spongy applicators that come with most eye-shadows but, they have any number of uses! I use them for applying eyeshadow &amp; and concealer; they also work very well for applying lipsticks &amp; glosses. These brushes are  incredibly soft and I find that they blend under-eye concealer amazingly well without pulling on the delicate skin. Don&#x27;t bother buying brushes that cost more, these are better.</li>
    <li> I really like the bristles on this brush, they&#x27;re not too fluffy so they&#x27;re great for precision work.  I wash them every day and use them for my eyeshadows.  I see another commenter is using them for lipstick, I&#x27;ll have to try that too.  They&#x27;re a perfect size - about the length of my finger (about 3 inches maybe?) - and don&#x27;t take up a lot of room in the makeup bag - great for traveling.  Good to know they&#x27;re friendly to the environment too.</li>
    <li> These are well made brushes that are definitely a good value when priced under $10.  The brushes are small, about the size of an adult pinkie finger.  They are soft and work well to hold and distribute eye-shadow, however, that is all they are really designed to do.  The rounded end make they unworkable for applying fine lines and their small size prevents them from being used as blending brushes.  The short staff and small size makes them ideal to travel with but a little awkward to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous for applying my mineral eye shadows, they don&#x27;t shed!  I reuse them and have washed them, they hold up to a lot of use.  They are great for face painting and also use them for lipstick application.</li>
    <li> good for on the go. Kinda on the small side. But they do what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m glad I purchased because i got a good deal on these brushes. However, they are more so brushes meant for lip color or defining because the bristles are harder. I was looking for small travel eyeshadow brushes and these arent soft enough for that really. But perfect if you need lip stain brushes or eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews so can&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t warned.  These are just under two inches long.  The bristles aren&#x27;t very fluffy so I don&#x27;t use them for eyeshadow as I originally intended.  They would serve as concealer/lip brushes but I don&#x27;t generally use brushes for that.  Since they are so tiny, I intend to just use them when travelling.  The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t seem to shed.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very stiff not at all what I wanted... Waste of money. Was going to use to apply makeup but they cannot be used for that....not sure what I will do with them.</li>
    <li> I love eco tools but these do not hold eyeshadow.  They are too small and stiff.  Would be okay to blend out eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Bought this and other brushes probably 4-5 years ago....needless to say, these are the best brushes ever! I still have all of them. Great brand!</li>
    <li> Triple like.Works great and does not fall apart. use these daily. I need to order more of this brushes for my eyeshadows</li>
    <li> I used it with my concealer wheel. Perfect fit for this.</li>
    <li> These are super soft and work fabulously for small application areas. They are listed as to be used for eye liner, but they have a wider tip than needed for eyeliner. They do work good for the smaller application areas though and they do get a fairly detailed line going.</li>
    <li> Pretty useful for multiple purposes. The quality is the same as any other product from the same brand, but I just didn&#x27;t expect that they are very small.</li>
    <li> The minis are soft, yet densely bristled, and they&#x27;ll fit just about anywhere.  The size is just like a typical eyeshadow sponge. For storage and travel I kept the plastic slotted case from the package bc it keeps them separate and protects the bristles.  I bought these just hoping they&#x27;d work for concealer in small areas, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised to find they have lots of uses. They do work very well for concealer, as well as eyeshadow, brow powder or cream, and lipstick.  Plus it&#x27;s great there are 6 in the pack so you don&#x27;t have to mix make-up on them between cleanings.  And, just like all my Ecotools brushes, these have held their shape through use and cleaning, and do not shed at all.</li>
    <li> THE BRUSHES ARE SO TINY AND CUTE AND THE BRISTLES ARE VERY SOFT. I AM SO EXCITED TO TRY THEM OUT IN A VARIETY OF LOOKS. BEING SMALL IT ALLOWS YOU BE PRECISE. THIS IS A NIFTY IDEA FOR BRUSHES AND A GREAT BUY.</li>
    <li> worth it! they arepercte for traveling and carry in your purse and very soft.!!!!! I recived them before the stimated time</li>
    <li> I thought they would be bigger for some reason. They were just too small for me and my eyes. Good for little girls or one time use.</li>
    <li> the bristles are decent but nothing special and they are sooooo small. they look bigger in pic.and they are exactly the same. i ordered it for the purpose of traveling brushes nd thought it would a contour,shadow etc...but they are just a bunch of the same brushes. good thing abotu them is they fit into any compact. so u can still travel with them but definitly no first choice for at home use</li>
    <li> I love all of my EcoTool makeup brushes and these little ones are just as amazing! They are so much easier to use than the cheapie sponge applicators that usually  come with eyeshadows. I always just chuck those because, to me, they seem pretty useless. These brushes are great to toss into my makeup bag at home or my makeup pouch in my purse. They are very small, but get the job done quickly and easily. They can be used to apply shadow on the lids and can just as easily be used in the crease and under the lower lash line. I like that they come in a plastic type pouch so that they can be kept together and are easier to find in my makeup bag. Another great product from EcoTools!</li>
    <li> I have most of the brushes and wanted something for my eyes but I didn&#x27;t want the long handles. So I was looking around and came upon the mini brushes and love them they make the eye shadow go on so much nicer then the sponge. And it fits in my fingers just right</li>
    <li> This is a great company. I knew it would be because Silverstone is attached to it.  But what is soooo great is that I get to be environmental and I don&#x27;t have to pay a fortune to do it.</li>
    <li> These are NOT like ecotools normal shadow brushes. These brushes have hair more consistent with what you get in say a bundle monster set, they are mini paddle brushes.  That being said you can use them and they pick up product well just really inconvenient - about the width and length of a perfume sample.</li>
    <li> Bought these mini brushes for my mineral wear eyeshadows.  I have many colors and needed to upgrade from the normal &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; type applicators.  These work great!  Super fast shipping!  I will be ordering more of these for sure!</li>
    <li> I bursted out laughing when I opened my package. I was astonished that these brushes are smaller than my pinky (I&#x27;m petite)!!! I generally love the quality EcoTools brushes but these are going back. They&#x27;re way too small for any significant use. Don&#x27;t spend your money, just go to Sephora and grab their sample applicators.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of these brushes--that is, an alternative to those awful sponge tip applicators. However, as they are designed to be multi-purpose (for eyes, lips, and face), the bristles flat and not at all fluffy; these would work best for lip gloss, concealer, or any eyeshadow that doesn&#x27;t require much blending (e.g. highlighter). They&#x27;re roughly the size of those mini sponge applicators (which these are essentially replacing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, these are terrible for blending. That sort-of defeats the purpose of using a brush over a sponge applicator. It&#x27;s difficult to get any pigmentation on the brushes, unless you&#x27;re working with loose pigments (like mineral shadows). If you want nicely blended eyeshadow, I would stick to sponge applicators over these stiff flat bristles.</li>
    <li> I have purchased similar bamboo mini brushes in a local drug store and they worked well for doing French nails.  While these ones come in the same package and look similar except color of the metal band, they don&#x27;t last and fall apart quickly.  The bristles started falling out in the middle of the first use.  I don&#x27;t know if it is that the metal holder isn&#x27;t crimped hard enough or if the glue holding it in the base is faulty... Regardless they do not last and are very faulty.  Also if someone wants to use these for eye shadow the bristles would be too stiff.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you just hate it when the applicator that comes with your eyeshadow disintegrates into a powdery mess before you finish the eyeshadow.  These little brushes are the perfect size to just slip into the case in place of the original applicator.  Sure, you don&#x27;t get as heavy an application with a brush vs a sponge; but more color is not always better; brushes are better for that well-blended look anyway.</li>
    <li> These are ok to use in a pinch. they are a bit too stiff for me to like using as eye shadow brushes. Definitely better than nothing when traveling.</li>
    <li> I did not order this set of 6 mini - brushes.  I ordered the  5 piece brush set.  I&#x27;m not satisfied at all with this order and would prefer to send it back in order to receive the one I wanted from Eco tools.</li>
    <li> it doesnt apply the eyeshadow as I expected, I used other brands before and there were very good in applying. overall dont like it and not recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these to apply lipgloss and they are the perfect size! Not sure that I would use them for any other product however (eye shadow, etc.).</li>
    <li> These brushes really are the softest brushest ever, and the makeup goes on so smoothly. And they are priced so much better than many of the competitors. I can&#x27;t imagine buying another brand after trying these. I really love them.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of these against my skin when using compared to the ones I have purchased from local store. I have purchased cheap to very expensive brushes and they are rough and do not hold up to the usage the way these eco bushes do.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes and I was not sure how I would like them, but they are truly amazing.  They hold and grasp onto the color of your eye shadow and blends it  so well; your makeup will look like it was done by a professional.  These brushes are the perfect size to put in your travel makeup bag or to use on a daily basis. The price was right for these brushes and they wash very well.</li>
    <li> When I first saw these, I thought that they would be around 2-3 inches long, when they&#x27;re really only about an inch and a half long. That&#x27;s really the only thing that surprised me about them. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re too good to put on eyeshadows with, but I do use them for my lipstick application and whenever I use cosmetic glitter on my eyelids. Really packs on the colors I use, which is really nice. They&#x27;re good to have around and I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for eye shadow, and smoothing out your makeup.  Different size brushes for different brushing around the eye.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly, i bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves the tools. they set had a nice varity everything needed!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very stiff. Not able to use for applying makeup which was the intended purpose.</li>
    <li> Although, it says mini brushes I assumed it would be a little bigger than the usual sizes of brushes. I was wrong they are so tiny! The description of the product was misleading and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again! I rather buy the bigger ones for the same price!</li>
    <li> These little brushes are good replacements for the sponge applicators that wear out. They are well made, easy to clean, and durable. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have a larger set of these brushes that I really like a great deal.  That&#x27;s why I purhased these and for the convenience of size.  The smaller size is fine with me, but these are no softer than my toothbrush. Seriously. Not going to return them since shipping would be more than their worth.  I&#x27;ll just pass them along to my sis and maybe she will like them.</li>
    <li> these are perfect for fitting into smaller eyeshadow bottles just the right size. they work great on the nyx loose powder shadows</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to the reviews where they said it was small &amp; maybe that was on my fault :) but about the product: IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GREAT CONCEALER AND UNDER THE EYE BRUSHES these small guys are definitely worth it! I didn&#x27;t expect small but I use them anyways for traveling! BRUSH QUALITY: Absolutely AMAZINGLY SOFT! n don&#x27;t shed! (:</li>
