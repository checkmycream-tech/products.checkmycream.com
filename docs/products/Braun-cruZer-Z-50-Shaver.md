### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>A blade that extends 90 degrees from the handle works best for trimming and defining, but the cruzer3&#x27;s blades work well</li>
      <li>It came in perfect condition and all the attachments work wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>, that gave me the best results.</li>
      <li>In a word ... Excellent!  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>now I can honestly say that this is the best (shaver+trimmer+styler)</li>

      <li>Great idea.</li>

      <li>Another reviewer rated the closeness as fair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good points.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a good Shaver.</li>
      <li>If you want a good trimmer don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
      <li>and I feel they make a good quality razor.</li>
      <li>it is as good as it gets without your barber doing the work.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I would have to agree as it was not anywhere close to good.</li>
      <li>This is a good mid-price shaver</li>
      <li>it is a damn good trimmer.   </li>
      <li>But this one performed up to the Braun name - a good shave, convenient and reliable.</li>
      <li>If you want a good shave don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
      <li>Those are the good things.</li>
      <li>As nifty as it looks, this razor is surprisingly second-rate.</li>
      <li>good: &lt;</li>
      <li>and you have to make a number of passes over the beard to get a good trim.</li>
      <li>I had to dig in there with the shaver to get a good shave.  </li>
      <li>The new Braun Cuzer I just purchased is perfect and amazon got it to me in under a week, great deal and great shaver.</li>
      <li>I like it as the commerical is so cool; Braun&#x27;s shaver is the best.</li>
      <li>Iv been using this shaver for about a month now, I just would like to say WOW this shaver is almost perfect and the trimmer is amazing , the styler does an excellent job, battery life gr8 (almost a week of shaving per charge)... been using electric shavers for years</li>
      <li>As I am a great Amazon shopper and was doing some (neglected) reviewing, I thought I would let those considering purchasing this razor know that it has lasted a good while and that he has been pleased for years with it.  </li>
      <li>According to him, this braun shaver gives him an excellent close shave in a quickly and painless manner.</li>
      <li>had a Braun before that worked great and thought I would be safe buying another.</li>
      <li>not the perfect shave, but for it money - i think its worth it.</li>
      <li>Battery life is great, too - much better than e.g. Philips/Norelco.</li>
      <li>It fits my hand nicely and is a good traveler.</li>
      <li>I got the cruzer 3 one, It is works wonderful from the first time, no irritation, shave well.</li>
      <li>in all, this razor will work great for you if you want an easy cleaning beard trimmer.  </li>
      <li>I liked the great price, and great crisp look of it.</li>
      <li>The price of this one was amazing (under $40)</li>
      <li>He says it gives him a smooth shave and trims his mustache great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the electric razor as it&#x27;s convenient.</li>
      <li>length adjustment accesory is nice tool as well.</li>
      <li>I have to admit that the magazine ads sold me on this product, and I kind of regret that.  </li>
      <li>This Braun looks nice, feels nice</li>
      <li>styler is a nice tool, as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice theory that doesn&#x27;t work as intended.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d probably buy one of those Norelco Beard Trimmers and use it for shaving because they have a vaccuum which means that your hairs are tidily sucked up</li>
      <li>No such luck, the shaver part works great and am very happy with it (but would have rather had the self-cleaning model)</li>
      <li>I compare that with a $ 20 Wahl beard trimmer I own, which has 6 beard trim settings.</li>
      <li>The shaver works well; not as good as a razor of course, but it&#x27;s great for touching up spots I missed or a full shave when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>Well i must warn you though, those of you looking for a perfect shave look elsewhere and expect to pay more, because this if for more of a quick shave on the go person.</li>
      <li>Also, the 5 minute quick charge feature - for a man who ALWAYS forgets to plug the darn thing in until 5 minutes before he has to shave - seem a perfect fit.</li>
      <li>The parts fit well, the trimmer does a good job and it feels nice in the hands.  </li>
      <li>it is not an easy to use device, I have tried to trimm my beard and goatee with it but always have to shave it all, i have never had good results with it.     </li>
      <li>Make sure you have the power lead handy.</li>
      <li>but for the time being am pretty happy with this thing.</li>
      <li>A shave as close as a mach3 is achieved on the face, though the neck and jawline are not as good, but adequate.  </li>
      <li>This part is flawless, all you have to do is attach the beard trimmer, select the desired length then enjoy a fast and easy beard trimming.    </li>
      <li>Ok so i saw this shaver in a magazine ad and it caught my eye</li>
      <li>It takes more to shave with it than with foam and blade...  </li>
      <li>Twice the price of the 2865, but 10 times better.</li>
      <li>This thing is the most inefficient trimming device I have ever seen.</li>
      <li>I think I have better using a pair of sissors to trim my bear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with it&#x27;s operation and capabilities, but do see some shortfalls.</li>
      <li>By mid-July 2009 this tactic no longer worked and rather than suffer more pain and expletives</li>
      <li>it takes many strokes over the area which also can cause some irritation.</li>
      <li>The trimming blades are well-shaped and work much better than I thought they would.  </li>
      <li>My favorite feature in the cruZer is the adjustable beard trimmer.</li>
      <li>must say that the razor is an Ok shaver;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s trimmer works ok for a while.</li>
      <li>This shaver is just ok.</li>
      <li>The Braun CruZer 3 is many tools in one, let&#x27;s take a look at them one by one:    1-Shaver:</li>
      <li>For the price i recommend it to everyone and amazon.com got it to my house in 3 days with free shipping!</li>
      <li>and I must admit it is a lot better and potent than my Norelco shaver.</li>
      <li>Even if that means charging $20 USD more for it.</li>
      <li>Now to Braun&#x27;s cruZer Z-50; reputable Braun name, rechargeable foil shaver with loads of gadgets for sideburn / beard grooming, all for under $50.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just OK for the money, there is only one blade so you will have to move back and forth in the same area at lease 5 times to have a decent cut.  Spend more money on the multiple blades.</li>
    <li> I live in Norway, and bought this product. Knew that the charger wouldent work. so i bought an adapter. Still wouldent charge. perhaps its the adapter. But I havent turned it on yet.</li>
    <li> I had a big bulky Braun that quit on me after about 6 years.  I trusted the brand and was not disappointed. Shaver is easy to clean and a snap to use.  I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for 1 month.  Takes about 20 minutes to get an unclean shave. Trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim very well. Plus, foil makes it difficult to see what your shaping</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, this razor replaced a decade old Norelco lift-and-cut shaver.  Perhaps I&#x27;ve just been spoiled by that, but seeing as my 10+ year old razor with 10+ year old blades gave me a closer shave in half the time as this brand new fancy gizmo (the old Norelco didn&#x27;t even have the problem with an extra-day&#x27;s growth that this one does), I&#x27;m rather disappointed in that aspect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That said, I do like everything else about it.  It&#x27;s a really convenient size, adequate clippers, and the beard trimmer does the job.  If you&#x27;re looking for precise control of beard length, go get a dedicated trimmer, however, because the 4 settings just don&#x27;t offer the exact control you might want.  I&#x27;m also very impressed with the batter life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a real close shave from an electric, don&#x27;t bother.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that does a better than adequate job, has a lot of useful features, and is reasonably priced, this is a good option.</li>
    <li> After many years of searching, I finally have found a razor that meets most of my criteria for a great razor.  It is reasonably priced (around $60), it is cordless, it fits the hand nicely, it is light, it is easy to clean, it has a single curved screen, it gives a pretty good shave if you are in a hurry and will give a blade close shave without irritation if you are willing to spend a litle more time, it has a well fitted protective cover with slots to allow the head to dry after cleaning, and the replacement cutter and screen that are good for over a year of shaving will cost you around $20 bucks. This is an extremely well designed razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this with some concern as the Braun Series 1 150 I previously purchased was of poor quality. But this one performed up to the Braun name - a good shave, convenient and reliable.</li>
    <li> It works great for me both as a shaver and a trimmer!</li>
    <li> Not a replacement for a traditional razor, but great for quick clean ups, trims, etc.  Holds its charge well and fits in the hand easily.  Very easy to clean, too.</li>
    <li> I guess this is what happens when a company gets too big.  It sits back on its laurels and outsources to China.    First off, the electric shaver it was replacing was a Japanese \\&quot;national\\&quot; brand battery operated single rotary head shaver that was smaller than the palm of your hand, yet lasted over twenty years of daily use, including travel, camping, a good many drops, and a couple of accidental submersions.  Purchased in Japan back in 1987, it always shaved close, never nicked or irritated, did its job in under two minutes, and cost less than $20 (adjusted Yen to Dollar).    Now to Braun&#x27;s cruZer Z-50; reputable Braun name, rechargeable foil shaver with loads of gadgets for sideburn / beard grooming, all for under $50.  A bit pricey, but seemed like it would make a fine replacement shaver.    Wrong!  After charging it up, as per the instructions, I tried shaving the one day old growth and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  I still had all the same stubble stuck to my face instead the shaver.  Blade to the rescue while reviewing the instructions at work to try and figure out if I did anything wrong.  Next morning disassembled / reassembled the shaver to check that it was working properly and wound up with the same results.  Over the course of the following couple weeks, I tried hot wet electric shaving, electric shaving with creams and gels, spending ten freakin&#x27; minutes doing a two minute job, combining all of the above - all with the same dismally disappointing results, but with varying levels of rash streaks on my cheeks and neck - and still having to go back over with a blade razor daily.    In the end, I was donated (Yes, DONATED by a work colleague) a 2nd hand, \\&quot;2nd rate\\&quot; Norelco rotory.  The Norelco works, the Braun does not, and I can not replace my old national that bit the dust.  I will not speak of Braun&#x27;s more expensive model shavers as I have a friend who speak well of his, but as for my future backing of Braun products, I think I&#x27;ll stick to their Formula1 race cars and skip on their shavers.</li>
    <li> this shaver looks good and works good ,but seem the motor of this model not as strong as my old one,but maybe my r defective or something else,I really like it if the motor got more powerful,just feel not sharp enough.</li>
    <li> I used a Remington for quite some time, but then started traveling a great deal.  The Remington could not withstand the shock and broke quite often. A razor repairman suggested that I try a Braun.      The Braun cruzer Z-50 is an excellent razor.  It&#x27;s very sturdy, has a long lasting battery, many features and provides a consistent and close shave. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my product, who just utterly hates shaving with regular blades. According to him, this braun shaver gives him an excellent close shave in a quickly and painless manner. \\&quot;No more blades... ever\\&quot; is what he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried it myself and I must admit it is a lot better and potent than my Norelco shaver. Next time I have to replace my Norelco, I&#x27;ll definitely be moving to Braun.</li>
    <li> i have had the braun free control (series 1) for about a year now, and was excited to see this cruzer as an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;. on [...] it clearly shows the cruzer to feature the smart foil design, which was a big reason why i plan to buy this. does it really have the smart foil design for clean shaving? or is it the same...what ive seen here on amazon leads me to believe it may be the same as opposed to what ive seen on the braun site. thanks</li>
    <li> I had bought the braun cruzer as my first electric shaver at 16 as i was sick of the irritation i would get from razors. The Trimmer and Beard trimmer were the big reasons as to me buying this product. Ill tell you this thing was pretty damn good. Like Braun says its sleek modern design does fit well into any hand, yet they should definitely have rethought the beard trimming attachment. I dropped this one time and the thing was done. cracked and i couldn&#x27;t get a replacement. Also this shaver will not shave any beard longer than 2 mm very well. it takes many strokes over the area which also can cause some irritation. I find if you do have longer growth trim it with the trimming attachment (This works great and is also good for just creating the stubble look) then shave over it with the foil screen.  I had recently upgraded to the Braun Series 5 Shaver. Wow. This beast gets the job done! Trimmer works great and the shaving is closer and you can definitely shave a 4 or 5 mm beard easily with the cutting comb in the center. I did have to buy a real beard trimmer for times when i do want it a bit longer. Philips Vacuum Trimmer does the job pretty well and keeps everything nice and clean.     For someone who wants a shaver for an amazing price buy the cruzer.. yet be warned, it may not last very long.</li>
    <li> great shaver, works great, holds a charge a long time, easy to clean.  the razor works great on a daily basis, but a little slow if you&#x27;ve not shaved for a wknd, just have to go over your beard a few times. the trimmers are awesome, work great, just be careful in the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas down below, but really good on chest hair and trimming those bushy places.  definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I picked this up hoping to use it a few times a week and keep a short beard. What I got was a pain in the neck. Unless you want to keep a lumberjack length beard, this is not the trimmer for you. The attachments do not give you a close trim and the razor itself only worked for about 4 months before it started cutting me through the foil. And I&#x27;m not even talking through holes in the foil. I come away from using the razor with scrapes all over my face on a daily basis. Save your money and invest in a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> I used the first Braun Cruzer 2000 which is a four year old product and have loved it every use. The Razor begun to turn blunt so I bought this instead and I am very happy. The trimmer works perfect and the small trimmer head is very versatile, more then I thought it would be.    Great purchase, will recommend it for everyone!</li>
    <li> I have owned this since 2005 and it works like new even today, after 6 years. I use it 5 days a week, every week. I tried a few other shavers in the last 5 years but nothing came close to the comfort and smoothness as this one. This is simply the best razor for  less than 100 dollars out there in the market.</li>
    <li> El producto muy bueno, me llego a Colombia incluso antes de la fecha, tardo 15 días en llegar.  Hasta ahora lo que he probado muy bien.</li>
    <li> I been using this type of razor for 6 years, but needs replacing every 2 years because the razor gets dull. It is cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the blade inside. Overall, it is just ok. It does not shave as easily as I hoped and it misses longer hairs and small fine ones, so you got to shave the same area over and over again.  I would not recommend spending over 60 bucks for this German-brand made in China shaver...and do not bother buying the newer model called Cruzr 5 - it is a piece of junk!</li>
    <li> This razor works alright as a shaver. Not as close as manual razors. It&#x27;s trimmer works ok for a while. But it pulls a bit on the hair after a while, which hurts. It&#x27;s nice to have the electric razor as it&#x27;s convenient.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in June 2007 as it seemed to be the ideal solution for a guy with a goatee. At first, it pretty much matched my expectations - a good three-function trimmer and a half-decent shaver all in one. It&#x27;s stamina sucks, however. By March 2009 I had to keep my thumb on the trimmer blade extender to prevent the blades from pulling the hairs out rather than cutting them off. By mid-July 2009 this tactic no longer worked and rather than suffer more pain and expletives I now have a full-face beard of over four weeks growth while I wait for my Philips Norelco hybrid trimmer/vacuum cleaner to arrive. If that doesn&#x27;t do the business it might not help convince my wife I&#x27;m not trying to look like Steve Earle but at least I&#x27;ll be able to give the living room the once over. All I can do with the Braun is throw it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun&#x27;s cruZer shaver before.  It has several helpful modes.  It fits my hand nicely and is a good traveler.</li>
    <li> I was very dissapointed, i was under the impression that this thing would trim beards effectivelly. I think I have better using a pair of sissors to trim my bear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 2 rabbles</li>
    <li> Maybe my facial hair is thick/plentiful but i find this shaver really struggles to get the job done. With some effort it can be done however. After a couple months of usage I wanted to throw it away because it started to pull on my hair instead of cutting it, and this was even on areas where hair wasn&#x27;t thick. I&#x27;ll chalk it up to a bad egg because everyone else here seems to love this shaver. Certainly not me, it&#x27;s the worst I ever had.</li>
    <li> This shaver did not live up to my expectations from reading other reviews.  I have used a remington microscreen foil shaver for over 20 years (2 different units) and thought I would try something different.  Big mistake!  This Braun looks nice, feels nice but that&#x27;s it.  It takes at least 5 minutes to repeatedly go over my face to finally cut all the hair down to a decent close shave.  My old razor would do it in under 2 minutes.  Hopefully my regret will not be yours also.</li>
    <li> I got mine on clearance at Target for about twenty five bucks, but mainly use it as a trimmer. The foil shaver is good but still not as easy and close as using a plain old razor blade, and does irritate my skin unless I use some sort of aftershave toning cream afterwards. So instead I now use the trimmer to shave...this leaves me with a five o&#x27;clock shadow look but it&#x27;s much faster and doesn&#x27;t require the lather-up-and-rinse process of using a blade and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really appreciate the ergonomics of this thing, it fits perfectly in my hand. The battery holds a decent charge, I recharge it maybe twice a month tops. It&#x27;s not too loud either, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it all over again I&#x27;d probably buy one of those Norelco Beard Trimmers and use it for shaving because they have a vaccuum which means that your hairs are tidily sucked up so there&#x27;s no mess you have to clean up afterwards...but for the time being am pretty happy with this thing. I also like that it&#x27;s water resistant, so I can use it in the shower if I want to.</li>
    <li> I have a goatee and I have been looking for a single shaving device that would trim and define my beard and also give me a decent shave for those times when I don&#x27;t want to use a razor.  The cruzer3 was the only device I could find that claimed to do all three tasks.  I took a chance and ordered it through Amazon - and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  The shaver works well; not as good as a razor of course, but it&#x27;s great for touching up spots I missed or a full shave when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  The trimming blades are well-shaped and work much better than I thought they would.  A blade that extends 90 degrees from the handle works best for trimming and defining, but the cruzer3&#x27;s blades work well (you just have to tilt the shaver 90 degrees from your face).  The beard trimmer attachment also works well.  I have a hair trimmer that I use for buzz cuts and was using it for beard trimming, but the cruzer3 works just as well.  And it&#x27;s one less device I have to keep track of.  Finally, I appreciate the fact that I can rinse off the unit with water when I&#x27;m done.  I am completely satisified with the cruzer3; it meets all of my requirements for an all-purpose shaver/trimmer.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good Shaver. It is better than I expected. I do recommend this shaver as a very good combo tool for beard and close shave.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
    <li> I got this because it has the styling attachment that you usually only get with a separate trimmer. So it&#x27;s one gadget for shaving instead of two. For me it replaces a similar, but less futuristic looking model, that I had for a few years and did the job pretty well.  This one is made in China instead of Germany, and looks like a ray gun. I&#x27;m not impressed by the appearance: the combination of shiny silver plastic and black rubber looks a bit tacky, and the lettering on the body is very tacky.  But, this doesn&#x27;t really matter, does it?  The good news is that it feels well built, even if it doesn&#x27;t look it, though I think the buttons that release the sliding trimmer and styler adjusters are horrible to touch and a poor design.  I like the enthusiastic whirr of the motor when you press the go button, and as a regular shaver it does an adequate job. Not sure the floating head makes a scrap of difference. Does it shave as close as a blade? Nowhere near. But it&#x27;s fine.  The trimmer spins around so you can use the wide head, or the narrow one. The narrow one has a rounded end, so you may be able to stick it in your ears if so inclined. But maybe a square profile would&#x27;ve been more useful. But... on the whole, the double ended trimmer works well.  The unique feature of course is the styling attachment. Apart from the horrible adjustment mechanism mentioned earlier, this works reasonably well, though probably not as good as a dedicated machine. But for what it is, it&#x27;s fine.  You can leave the styling thing on all the time because it acts as the foil protector too. This is good, because it was separate on my previous one. Braun supply a simple foil protector if you want to leave the styler at home. You get a brush too, and a  little bottle of oil. No case though.  One thing to watch is that when the battery&#x27;s running low, the shaver decides at some point that it&#x27;s going to switch itself off and stay off until you recharge. If you&#x27;re in the middle of a shave, it grabs you and won&#x27;t let go, which is, to say the least, painful! Make sure you have the power lead handy.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer rated the closeness as fair. &lt;br /&gt;I would have to agree as it was not anywhere close to good. &lt;br /&gt;But, I got this shaver to trim my beard. &lt;br /&gt;It does not trim beards at all.  Facial hair cannot reach the micro-screen.  It may be a good gift if you hate someone. &lt;br /&gt;I will be returning mine, as it does a bad job as a shaver, and does not trim beards. &lt;br /&gt;I am very dissapointed now since I&#x27;ve been waiting for a while to get one and received this as a gift.  It was hard to tell the giftor that it didn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver will produce a close shave if you&#x27;re willing to spend some time going over the same areas many times.  However, a quick pass usually produces a shave that&#x27;s close enough to suit me.  The thing I really like about this shaver is the dual trimmer and the snap-on guard for beard trimming.  It&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
    <li> Not the best electric shaver I have ever used, but it works ok. Sometimes I have to go back over with an actual razor to get everything.</li>
    <li> I got the Braun 3-in-1 shaver on the 18th of April as promised, it is very easy to use and works pretty good so far (as may 14, 07). the power plug connects to wall power source is too big and heavy, will not stay, should be redesigned to a lighter or smaller size, or having a 90 degree angle. This is my personal opinion. &lt;br /&gt;robert, Santa Ana, CA.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the shaver for about a month now and used it like 3 or 4 times. I am satisfied with it&#x27;s operation and capabilities, but do see some shortfalls. Gripe no. 1, the trimmer for full beards leaves something to be desired as the teeth seem a little light and you have to make a number of passes over the beard to get a good trim. Since it does an alright job on with the initial first pass, you have to follow that up with a hunt for individual hairs the trimmer might have missed and touch up the whole beard. &lt;br /&gt;Gripe no. 2, the shaver also give me problems shaving under my chin right around where the jaw meets the neck, forcing me to do a once over with my razor to get it truly clean. &lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite things is the mini side of the trimmer as it makes certain detail work much easier.</li>
    <li> As soon as I tried it I wanted to return it. I had a 5-day beard, the shaver would fail to cut most of it, only small spots were shaved. After 10 minutes going over and over it, the result was horrible. I gave up and used my razor.    It just does not work.</li>
    <li> In a word ... Excellent!  Great shaver and trimmer. I have tried many different brands, Braun wins again!</li>
    <li> This is my first electrical shaver so i might be bias as there is nothing i can compare it with.  I got this device last week but get to test it just now! It looks good, the construction is solid, and it is really waterproof. After i unwrapped   it, i immediately turned it on, to my surprise it worked, i started shaving, in a few seconds the device turned off, i thought that something was wrong but after plugging it into the currency it turned on! At first i thought  that it is as good as wet shaving when i realized that it is not giving  me smooth and deep shave. The problem became bigger when i got to my neck, as  my chicks and goat part was ok. I could not shave my neck completely, the shaver left a lot of hair there. I even managed to cut myself little bit, previously because of the lack of experience with the electrical shavers i thought that you can not get cuts with electrical shavers. At the end i had to finish shaving with my wet shaver.  I gave 4 stars as i can not compare this devise with other ones as i have never used one and i like the trimmer part which you do not get with your wet shavers. The price is quite affordable, and you are getting 3-in-one package.  I still can not decide whether to keep it or not!  Your skin gets irritated, you can get cuts, and the time you spend is comparable with the wet shaving!</li>
    <li> If you really need something better, buy the cruzer 4 2838. It isn&#x27;t sold in the USA but you can find it online. Twice the price of the 2865, but 10 times better. Check it!</li>
    <li> I wanted a second Braun for travel. The price of this one was amazing (under $40) so I thought I&#x27;d try it. Well, you get what you pay for. The shave is very poor; takes several passes over a spot to do what a normal priced Braun can do in a single pass. This thing actually cut me too; I&#x27;ve used various Brauns now for over 10 years and none has ever cut me (unless the foil was torn, of course). For travel, there&#x27;s no lock (as another reviewer pointed out), which is a horrible design choice; this razor could easily turn on while in your suitcase. It also does not come with a case of any kind (very odd). The trimmer is useful, and that&#x27;s pretty much all I use it for now. (And, it&#x27;s ugly, but who really cares). I basically gave it to my 17 year old, and even he says it&#x27;s annoying to use compared to mine, and he&#x27;s got like 9 facial hairs.     For under $40, it&#x27;s tolerable. But if you really need to use a razor regularly, lay down the $80-$120 for a better model. Braun really should not put their name on this model; their other products are in a different quality category.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a full beard for some time and this is the first product that I&#x27;ve found that facilitates full maintenance of that beard with minimal time and trouble.  It&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This shaver provides an excellent shave.  Very easy to use and the shape contours to the hand very well.  The trimmers work well.  I like the fact that it works with or without a cord and a charge lasts a long time.  All-in-all an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> I bought a cruzer3 last year before I left on a 4 month trip. I was traveling light and didn&#x27;t want to bring both a shaver and a trimmer, plus a separate recharger for both. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a combo device it does very well. This is the first foil shaver I&#x27;ve used, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to any others; although I found that I preferred it to the rotary shaver I had been using. The trimmer worked fine, but it&#x27;s width made it somewhat awkward &amp; uncomfortable at times. Plus, there are only 4 cutting level adjustments. Once I returned home, I immediately switched back to a dedicated trimmer; it was simply more effective and comfortable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only real complaint I have is with the battery life. After a year of use, I now only get 4 shaves out of a charge. If I were using it as a trimmer as well, that might only be 2. When new, I was getting 5 or 6 days (trim &amp; shave) from a charge, so it&#x27;s lost approximately half it&#x27;s battery life in a year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For traveling, I definitely recommend the cruzer3. The shaver &amp; charger are reasonably small &amp; lightweight, although including some sort of case would have been nice of Braun. And the charger is dual-voltage, so you only need a plug adapter, not a voltage converter, in most places around the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But for daily use, I think a separate trimmer works much better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - german engineering, what can I say? Especially if you have a short beard/goatee, this is the only shaver/beard trimmer you&#x27;ll ever need. Close, smooth shave. Very good trim. I did a lot of research, and Braun makes the ONLY rechargeable shaver/beard trimmer with truly universal power charger (switches automatically to any input power you may encounter on trips abroad). Battery life is great, too - much better than e.g. Philips/Norelco. Blows competitors&#x27; products out of the water.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a big disappointment! It takes more to shave with it than with foam and blade...  Shaving quality is low, even if you patiently try to cut all the beard that is left by the main razor with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> it is not an easy to use device, I have tried to trimm my beard and goatee with it but always have to shave it all, i have never had good results with it.     The shave function is worst, I have a heavy beard and it always let my face with spots, it is not easy to use.</li>
    <li> The new Braun Cuzer I just purchased is perfect and amazon got it to me in under a week, great deal and great shaver.</li>
    <li> well to be honest, I took my chances while purchasing this product, after reading all the bad reviews    I took it basically for trimming and it doesnt work.    Totally useless product, its all the hype, totally not worth it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, since his old shaver no longer held a charge.  He needed a combo shaver and trimmer, since he has a mustache.  He says it gives him a smooth shave and trims his mustache great.  I definitely agree.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a smooth close shave.  Takes twice as long to get shaven as it does with my Remington.    The trimmer is virtually useless.    Very disappointed because Braun has the reputation of producing quality items.  This is not one of them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn a three-day beard for almost eight years, and this combo shaver has performed extremely well as shaver and trimmer.  The design allows for neat beard lines, and the shaver--with multiple passes in heavy beard areas or neck curves--performs solidly.  Considering the price, it&#x27;s nearly a steal.    The reason I rated it at four rather than five stars is because I&#x27;ve gone through three of these in eight years--the first one just stopped working after about four years, and the trimmer on the second one broke very recently.  Just bought the third (great service again Amazon, BTW).  But for roughly 40 bucks, maybe a four-year life in a shaver/trimmer is good these days.</li>
    <li> This is supposedly an all-in-one product with the trimmer and a shaver. In reality, it doesn&#x27;t work.  First thing I noticed was that the guard comb is very flimsy. It has a simple selector that allows you to change the length of the comb.  It doesn&#x27;t work: you have to hold the selection with your finger, otherwise it slips. This is such a basic thing and would be so easy to design well... but it looks like nobody at Braun is paying attention.  The most serious problem however is the trimmer: after only several weeks of use it became dull and was pulling my hair. This was so painful that the trimmer became completely useless. Like everything else in this product, the trimmer itself is very flimsy, and I see no way it can be sharpened or repaired.  The shaver works... sort of. You do not get a good shave, and you have to work very hard at it.  If you want a good shave don&#x27;t buy this product. If you want a good trimmer don&#x27;t buy this product. My experience was so bad that I intend to stay away from Braun products altogether.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  For the price this is a multi-tasking must for those with beards, goatees, etc.</li>
    <li> not the perfect shave, but for it money - i think its worth it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a very well made product.  The parts fit well, the trimmer does a good job and it feels nice in the hands.  Overall, a Braun.</li>
    <li> I was attracted to this razor because of its multi-functionality, but dont buy it unless you want to spend forever in the bathroom trying to trim up... This thing is the most inefficient trimming device I have ever seen.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver mainly for travel because of the ability to clean under running water, secondly for the need to trim sideburns and beards.  Haven&#x27;t washed it under water yet but it works great on trimming, fine tuning edges and general shaving.  Cleaning with the supplied brush is easy enough and does a good job.    It&#x27;s a Braun what do you expect!</li>
    <li> Bought this as my first electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending a frustrating 20 minutes trying to shave 3-day old stubble, only to find it had only shaved a few patches, returned to the instruction manual, assuming I must be doing something wrong. Re-read, attempted again, same problem. Read these reviews and realised that this shaver is, essentially, a waste of money. For an item that touts itself on its flexibility, this is nothing short of a rip-off.</li>
    <li> I like it as the commerical is so cool; Braun&#x27;s shaver is the best.This one is no exception!</li>
    <li> I have no idea what is wrong with some of these people. One actually said in the trimmer mode the hairs don&#x27;t reach the screen. That&#x27;s because they aren&#x27;t supposed to, the trimmer does the cutting. I guess that&#x27;s why they call it a trimmer. Read the directions and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. Some people apparently expect this thing to act like a ladies electric. This is a razor for a man so like all mens razors it has power and isn&#x27;t delicate. If you want that buy a ladies version. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With electrics you have to go in different directions more than once a lot of the time. This is no exception but it does a great job on my neck which was ALWAYS a problem with the Remington&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a couple of Remington&#x27;s that didn&#x27;t last but a couple years then broke down or the battery died. I had an old Braun that worked well for several years with little sharpening. Now that I&#x27;m back to Braun I&#x27;ll never switch back. HUGE difference. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This thing does a great job of keeping my facial hair trimmed and once you get used to the trimmers you can easily create anything you want. Just be extra careful when you start using it and you shouldn&#x27;t have problems.</li>
    <li> It shaves well, but it vibrates a lot. I don´t mind the vibration, but i wonder...is it bad for my hand bones?? don´t know.</li>
    <li> The Braun CruZer 3 is many tools in one, let&#x27;s take a look at them one by one:    1-Shaver: This shaver uses the Braun shaving foil which is supposed to catch all hair regardless of the direction of growth, it raises it and then the cutter block finishes the job.    It&#x27;s a nice theory that doesn&#x27;t work as intended. The shaver foil doesn&#x27;t catch all hair and the cutter block isn&#x27;t sharp enough or maybe the whole mechanism needs a redesign.    At first when I tried to shave after a few days of not shaving (Braun in that case recommends using the trimmer first then the shaver) well, I did exactly that and only thing that worked was the trimmer, the shaver still didn&#x27;t shave well.    Next time I used the shaver I had just shaved the day before and I noticed that the shaver did a better job than the time before but still not as good as I expected.    After a while I figured that this shaver doesn&#x27;t need to be moved quickly up-down like others, you better press well against your skin and move very slow, that gave me the best results. Still not perfect but acceptable.    2-Styler: The CruZer 3 comes with a very good trimmer, it&#x27;s sharp and accurate, you can use the wide shaper (1.1 in / 28 mm) or the narrow shaper (0.55 in / 14 mm).    I personally think the styler part is great, the ability to do wide and narrow areas of your face and the way the trimmer rotates 180 degrees with a push of a finger gives you quick access to both trimmers while in the middle of styling.    At first I was bothered because I couldn&#x27;t see the trimmer from all angles, also if you lean the shaver against your face there chance the foil might miss another area. So, I tweaked the thing a bit, I removed the foil, pulled the cutter block out then used the trimmers just like that (no foil and no cutter block). That eliminated the threat of the foil cutting hair and also made the visible area bigger and clearer.    No kidding, but with a styler as good as that you can write your initials on one checkand draw a picture on the other.    3-Beard trimmer : This part is flawless, all you have to do is attach the beard trimmer, select the desired length then enjoy a fast and easy beard trimming.    With that said, the shaver comes with universal power adapter which serves as both a power supply and charger. Yes! You can use the CruZer 3 in cordless mode for 30 minutes.    The on/off switch is neat and the light on the front informs you about charge power and other information.    You can wash the machine --when not connected to the power chord-- also it comes with cleaning oil and a nice brush to clean all and every part    That&#x27;s all to it, I do recommend this machine for the serious styler, if you just want to have a clean shave then maybe this machine is too much beside the shaving part isn&#x27;t exactly where it excels.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a nice clean cut, however it seems to take over twice as long as my last Braun shaver.  My previous Braun has two heads while this one only has one.  At the time, I didn&#x27;t give it much thought, but in retrospect, I would have sought after one which had two.  All in all, paying an extra $30 for one of the nicer Brauns would have been a better idea.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas after getting fed up with my old Wahl beard trimmer.  I have to admit that the magazine ads sold me on this product, and I kind of regret that.  But it&#x27;s not without it&#x27;s good points. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The good: &lt;br /&gt;-The beard trimmer works fine and trims quickly and precisely. &lt;br /&gt;-Quick charging &lt;br /&gt;-Extremely easy to clean, and can be rinsed with water. &lt;br /&gt;-Shave in the shower. &lt;br /&gt;-An acceptably close shave, but not the best you could get from an electric. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bad / the ugly: &lt;br /&gt;-A charge doesn&#x27;t hold for very long...several shaves at most.  Luckily it charges back up to full capacity again in an hour. &lt;br /&gt;-Shaving can take FOREVER because this razor simply REFUSES to cut some hairs, no matter how much you run over them.  Most of the time I get so frustrated that I just switch to my Norelco. &lt;br /&gt;-It feels like you&#x27;re holding a lawnmower, and it&#x27;s almost as loud. &lt;br /&gt;-There are only two settings on the beard trimmer attachment: fairly long (for my goatee), and really short. &lt;br /&gt;-I experienced much more razor burn with this razor than with my previous ones. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, this razor will work great for you if you want an easy cleaning beard trimmer.  But if you are looking for something to shave your face with quickly, look elsewhere.  I highly recommend Norelco razors, as mine has lasted me six years on one set of razor heads and still outperforms this Braun.</li>
    <li> Iv been using this shaver for about a month now, I just would like to say WOW this shaver is almost perfect and the trimmer is amazing , the styler does an excellent job, battery life gr8 (almost a week of shaving per charge)... been using electric shavers for years now I can honestly say that this is the best (shaver+trimmer+styler) all in one &lt;br /&gt;I have one thing to say to the people who didn&#x27;t like this shaver, read the manual! Ur supposed to shave against the way Ur hair grows, and it takes a couple of times till Ur face get used to it  &lt;br /&gt; The only bad thing I can say about the cruzer 3 is it doesn&#x27;t do too well on the neck but hey iv always faced this problem with all electric shavers at least here u can get the suckers by using the trimmer. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband thinking I was getting quite a deal for my money. The washable and worldwide voltage features are definitely a huge plus. Also, the 5 minute quick charge feature - for a man who ALWAYS forgets to plug the darn thing in until 5 minutes before he has to shave - seem a perfect fit. Unfortunately, all the impressive extras in the world don&#x27;t really amount to much when the main function of the device - giving a close and comfortable shave - doesn&#x27;t work. According to my husband, it&#x27;s jumpy, clunky and leaves stubble and clumps of hair where you&#x27;re meant to have a clean cut. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a shaver for yourself or the man in your life, I&#x27;d recommend looking elsewhere. You&#x27;d probably be better off with a £20 shaver and a separate trimmer that actually work, rather than this fancy machine that can&#x27;t even perform its basic task.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> First the good: The shape of the razor fits very comfortably in the hand, I get a nice close shave with the regular shaver, and the charge stays forever. Those are the good things. The big downside is the trimmer. It appears to be nothing more than a serrated piece of metal that uses the vibration of the razor when the power is turned on to trim the small hairs on your face. The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t work. I keep thinking I&#x27;m doing something wrong because I get no benefit from it at all. I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t used the beard trimming attachment yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> it is a reliable brand</li>
    <li> this shave is not the best. if you dont have a beard or whatever, then go away now, please, but other wise this thing is amazing! and no it wont work as well as a normal razor. duhh</li>
    <li> I bought the Cruzer3 with the intention of only occasionally using it.  I&#x27;ve used it only a handful of times and it&#x27;s already falling apart, won&#x27;t hold a charge, and the foil already has huge holes in it. &lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints with this razor. I have been very happy with it. This is my second razor from Braun and I feel they make a good quality razor. I like that you can use it in water.</li>
    <li> I use this razor to trim my beard short.  There aren&#x27;t alot of alternatives out there, and I find its settings are excellent.  I actually don&#x27;t use it to shave the parts where I don&#x27;t grow my beard.  I find it is not that effective/takes too much time.  I use a blade instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husband, he had an old Norelco that worked great but was not charging anymore.  His main complaint with the Braun is that it will not shave his neck, but it does fine with his face.  I did read other reviews that had similar complaints, and I wish I had listened and bought something different.  I hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> As nifty as it looks, this razor is surprisingly second-rate. Unlike my previous Braun razor (from 1999), this shaver doesn&#x27;t even have a &#x27;lock&#x27; setting. And since the on-button is very touch-sensitive, it&#x27;s practically a guarantee that it&#x27;ll accidentally go off in your luggage. Whose idea was that? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, I find I have to go over the same area several times for it to be shaved to my satisfaction. Sure, it has a beard trimmer (which I barely use), but lots of other, assuredly better razors have them too. Without the sucking.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric razor though I have tried many others in the past.  I have a thick beard and am usually clean shaven.  This model caught my eye because of the wide and small angle pop up trimmers as well as the trimmer attachment.  Overall, it is very good.  A shave as close as a mach3 is achieved on the face, though the neck and jawline are not as good, but adequate.  The razor is best if you shave everyday or relatively often, otherwise you might want to look at a rotary.  However, the brauns and other foil razors are usually best in terms of closeness.  The trimmers work well to an extent, if you are doing heavy trimming, get a dedicated trimmer.  The wide and narrow pop ups are great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor is sturdy and looks a little flashy but is washable which makes cleanup easy.  I just rinse it off with hot water or use compressed air to blow off the hair.  Once a week, I will soak the cutting head in alcohol and oil the trimmers and foil.  Unfortunately it is made in China not Germany.  It holds a charge for over a week, more like 2.  Also the quick charge option lets you charge it for a single shave quite quickly, though if it does run out it will suddenly stop grabbing the hairs on your face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cliffs: Great all around razor, trimming pop ups and attachments are great, worth the price despite a few flaws.</li>
    <li> Great features if they worked! &lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun before that worked great and thought I would be safe buying another. Not so. This   &lt;br /&gt;Was a wasted 60 bucks. Takes me twice as long to shave after going over each area of my face several times (and my facial hair is not thick). I regret not returning it every time I shave. If you buy Braun make sure it is one of the more expensive models.</li>
    <li> It does everything as advertised.  It came in perfect condition and all the attachments work wonderfully.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> design seems great...but does not shave very close, even the trimmers seem a little dull.. &lt;br /&gt;disappointed</li>
    <li> I have an aincent Norelco with spinning blade heads that does a much better job than this thing did out of the box, even though my old shaver has blades which have been in it for a few years.  I needed a new razor since the battery is almost toast on that old thing.  The Cruzer3 has a lot of power, but it just wants to vibrate its way across the room.  It takes a long time to get a good shave with this, and my hand was numb by the time I was done.  The screen is no good at picking up longer hairs -- admittedly more comfortable than the snagging that my old razor sometimes does, but the vibration far outweighed that benefit.</li>
    <li> Great idea. Bad quality.  It has some issues cutting long hair but you have the trimmer/whatever.  Well, tonight the trimmer chocked and died on me on my beard.  Basically the blades got enough \\&quot;hair inside\\&quot; that something got suck and stopped moving.  I have had this product for about 4-6 months.    Sorry but if a product is aimed at trimming beards/goatees, etc also, I expect it to work *and last*.  Didn&#x27;t.    Went back to my Norelco for a second to finish my shave (it runs low on batteries even at full charge for being old) and I was surprised how much better even in non-trimmer mode it grabbed longer hair.    My disappointment is that Norelco doesn&#x27;t make an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; product like this anymore. They charge high, but I have to say, they work better, and I think this is the first and last Braun shaving product I buy.    Hint to Braun: you have the right idea. But it needs to last. Even if that means charging $20 USD more for it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by posts from those needing just a beard trimmer. Listen to those who really SHAVE with this razor.    My previous Braun razors were all great. When the foil hit your face - you knew hair was really being cut. Not so the Cruzer.     This razor&#x27;s foil has woefully tiny holes - all arranged in a spoke-wheel pattern - which actually prevents hair from being properly channeled into the blades.     I first thought the foil head wasn&#x27;t seated properly. It was - to my disappointment. Then I tried shaving with water &amp; gels - with only minor improvement. After shaving 3 times longer than necessary, I finally got a mediocre shave (and a nice skin rash the following day).     Braun&#x27;s vaunted foil-design fails in spades - and my beard just isn&#x27;t that tough.     Don&#x27;t get me wrong, no electric razor shaves like a blade - but come on.    I tried sending my concerns to Braun on their website which is complete with slick videos but with little functionality for speaking directly to \\&quot;Star Base Command\\&quot;. Sort of like their recent products, flashy and colorful but unresponsive. So here I am on Amazon.com.    As an ex manufacturing engineer - I feel this is just plain old marketing dept interference with engineering, or simply engineers intoxicated by their own design philosophy. Probably a bit of both.    I loved my old Braun razors, but this just isn&#x27;t the same company anymore.    Braun needs to get back to basics. Had their engineers used this product at home for a few weeks before committing to the design, they would have spotted this turkey in a minute.     This problem spans ALL their shavers using this flawed foil pattern, so don&#x27;t be tempted to buy the next model up ($$$) unless it has a totally different design. It won&#x27;t help.     Braun can EASILY FIX this by offering a replacement foil with a REDESIGNED pattern at nominal cost WITHOUT REPLACING THE WHOLE RAZOR. You&#x27;d just snap it on - and be out of the woods. But since they seem beyond the reach of customer feedback and will never see this message - you&#x27;ll be looking like you just came out of the woods for some time to come.    Which brings me to my second gripe - Braun is FAMOUS for changing its razor designs so frequently - that you never know what you&#x27;re getting into when you trade up. They&#x27;re losing their audience - and loyal customers are going elsewhere.    The boys in marketing strike again.    Rob in Riyadh.</li>
    <li> I hate this machines they work only for couple of months and then cause a lot of wounds while shaving and not practical at all</li>
    <li> design seems great...but does not shave very close and takes longetime to shave and have to go back over to get everything.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t use it that much of time,, it doesn&#x27;t shave will. and it always corrupted and it fall in parts !! i used Panasonic and it&#x27;s way better then this crap</li>
    <li> This is a good mid-price shaver but I still have to do some touchups with a safety or disposable razor for my medium thick beard.</li>
    <li> I bought norelco one 2 years ago, very expensive it did not shape pretty well, It was very expensive, then I tried a previous model of this braun ones. I  work much better now I got the cruzer 3 one, It is works wonderful from the first time, no irritation, shave well. I strongly recommend it. do not waste your money on the very expensive ones as norelco ones that promised improvements that in fact do not work , this one will do the job perfectly</li>
    <li> I liked the great price, and great crisp look of it. And on Braun website, the ads were fantastic, so these all made me to buy it. Also I was tired of regular razor shaving and i wanted electric shaver to do the work for me. &lt;br /&gt;I must say that the razor is an Ok shaver; Ok, because it didn&#x27;t match my facial hair structure. In order electric shaver to cut hair, the hair has to be standing on the face. But my facial hair lies on the face, so it&#x27;s hard for razor to cut them. Also face must be shaved at least every other day; otherwise it won&#x27;t be able to cut the long hair. &lt;br /&gt;Hair length adjustment accesory is nice tool as well. Not only facial hair can be shaved with it, but also body hair can be trimmed. &lt;br /&gt;Rotating styler is a nice tool, as well. You can easily correct the sideburns, and neck can be cleaned with it from ugly hair. &lt;br /&gt;In the end, i must say, that electric shavers aren&#x27;t for everyone. Unfortunately facial hair structure has to be compatible with electric shaver too.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Cruzer for about a month, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  I&#x27;ve been making do for years with a beard trimmer, and using a razor for close shaving.  But, with this device, it&#x27;s all at your fingertips in one device, and so far I haven&#x27;t a single complaint.  Hard to understand those here who have berated this shaver -- works for me exactly as advertised.  I get a close shave AND convenient, consistent, no-hassle beard trimming. It&#x27;s great. Easy clean-up.  Holds a charge for a decent length of time.  Overall, a clever and efficient device that does the job amazingly well.</li>
    <li> Strengths: Fast charging, sleek and ergonomic design, easy to clean, international voltage adapter (low-end panasonic models dont have this feature), 2-yr warranty (again panasonic lacks this) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Weaknesses: Heavy, Vibrates a lot, Noisy, Does not have battery low indicator, the trimmer is almost useless, cant be used for wet-shave, does not shave very closely around neck and chin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Summary: I got one of the closest shaves on my cheeks and moustache. However, the neck and chin area were not the best. I had to dig in there with the shaver to get a good shave.  &lt;br /&gt;A dry-shave irritates my skin for a few hours... probably because I m not used to it. So the next time I m going to try a dry/wet Panasonic shaver.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In spite of the weaknesses, I think this is still one of the better products. Panasonic ES7035 is the closest competitor in terms of features and price.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Needs a battery-level indicator as it is pretty useful if one travels a lot and needs to find out the battery status.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have a full beard, and the trimmer that I bought last year just doesn&#x27;t get the job done.  I also hated my rotary electric shaver and wanted something for the days when I needed a quick shave in the morning.  So far I am quite happy with this product, especially as a trimmer.  No major complaints yet.</li>
    <li> I keep changing my mind about this trimmer. I now believe it to be very good, but only for trimming beards. It is terrible if you want a very close shave, like you would get from a razor.     However, if you just want a very nice beard trim, it works very well. I am very happy with the result when I put the beard trimmer attachment on and then shave at a \\&quot;1\\&quot; or \\&quot;2\\&quot; setting. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it only has four settings for beard length. I compare that with a $ 20 Wahl beard trimmer I own, which has 6 beard trim settings. I find that having 6 settings is about right, and four seems a bit too few.</li>
    <li> The Cruder is just a mediocre razor and a less than mediocre trimmer.  I purchased it as a replacement to my travel razor and thought the trimmer would be an added bonus. Its okay for occasional use but for everyday, consider getting something better because with the Cruder, you are getting what you paid for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice one, I still have it until now, but don&#x27;t try to use the trimmer for very long hair, it is not designed for that.</li>
    <li> Trim nose hair , shave and other things, like trimming around the ears and back of the neck on the head</li>
    <li> Ok so i saw this shaver in a magazine ad and it caught my eye, I needed a new shaver to replace my old Norelco, so i thought i&#x27;ll give this one a shot since it had alot of things to offer. I don&#x27;t have a beard or goatee so i can&#x27;t tell you about shaping up using the features provided on this shaver but i&#x27;m really satisfied with it so far just after the first day of use. After one quick shave, my skin felt alot smoother i like the fact that you can rinse it in water and you can go wireless. Well i must warn you though, those of you looking for a perfect shave look elsewhere and expect to pay more, because this if for more of a quick shave on the go person. For the price i recommend it to everyone and amazon.com got it to my house in 3 days with free shipping!</li>
    <li> I saw this shaver in few ads and I really liked the way it looked and was impresed it had shaver trimmer and shaper in it. &lt;br /&gt;Well only until I opened the box and tried it for the first (and last) time! It took me over 30 minutes to shave half of my face and it still left a lot of places with plenty of hair on them. Btw i also tried the shaper which didnt work at all! &lt;br /&gt;the only thing it does well is look good in the box ! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I really should know better. You never buy anything that claims it takes care of all your needs. I really was in the market for a new beard trimmer as my old Norelco had finally died.  I had also planned to buy on of the more expensive self-cleaning Braun&#x27;s later on. But I saw this and thought I would kill two birds with one stone. No such luck, the shaver part works great and am very happy with it (but would have rather had the self-cleaning model) The beard trimmer part does not work that well. Took several passes to trim my beard evenly, and if your going for that stubble look it does not trim close enough. Even my 6-year-old Norelco took only one pass. I will use this as my primary razor for a few months till I can afford to buy the more expensive self-cleaning model. Then use this as my travel razor as it is one unit to pack instead of 2.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Save the money and buy a sole beard trimmer and a sole shaver. You will be much happier and feel less taken by marketing.</li>
    <li> First electric I&#x27;ve had in a while.  I was surprised by how close it shaves, but as another reviewer pointed out, if you go a few days between shaves the longer whiskers don&#x27;t get in the foil.  it&#x27;s also necessary to go over the same area from different directions a few times, this shaver is not faster than a blade.  I like the beard trimmer, I usually keep my beard trimmed pretty short and the trimmer attachment will get it down to three-day-growth short if you want.  I have not gotten used to using the trimmer without the attachment, there&#x27;s two sides to it; one rounded and one straight.  The straight side is an inch long which is a bit too long and unwieldy, I usually end up using a separate mustache trimmer.  Cleaning is a breeze, just run under hot water.  Seems to keep a charge for a about a week for me, but I don&#x27;t use it everyday.  As far as maintenance, I&#x27;ll know more in a couple months.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver and beard trimmer.  My husband can trim his beard and moustach and keep the rest of his face kissing clean.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. He has a gotee and he really likes how well it shaves around his facial hair.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works really well for a combo shaver. The close shaver works as well as any electric razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It seems that you always have to avoid all in one solutions, they keep doing everything bad</li>
    <li> i have been most pleased with this product.  along with the cruzer 3 i have a braun 8585.   i bought the cruzer for the trimmer.   i have a very large thick stache .   this unit is not an 8585.  with that said.  it is a damn good trimmer.   and for a quick clean up shave is quite good.   don&#x27;t expect a 50 dollar unit to shave like a 150 dollar unit.   but for a trimmer.  which it is why it is designed.   it is as good as it gets without your barber doing the work.  they provide a length guide or you can go it free hand.   i will replace with the same if the battery ever dies.   good luck stache guys.</li>
    <li> This electric razor works better than I had expected. I was looking for a combined razor and beard trimmer and not thinking to spend a ton of money. Overall it works fine and surpassed my expectations.</li>
    <li> This shaver is just ok. If I was to buy another shaver, I would buy something a bit more expensive that would do a better all around job of  shaving and trimming.</li>
    <li> My favorite feature in the cruZer is the adjustable beard trimmer. Just set it to one of 4 preset lengths and trim away - no need to worry about an uneven beard or trimming off more than you wanted. The cruZer also does a great job with basic shaving, and the fact that you can rinse it off under the faucet is a real time-saver. The only downside is that you&#x27;re supposed to drain the battery completely before each recharge (to maximize battery life), so you sometimes have to plug in the shaver mid-shave.</li>
    <li> This is a fine razor and my hubby is still using it over 3 years later, so we would really recommend it. As I am a great Amazon shopper and was doing some (neglected) reviewing, I thought I would let those considering purchasing this razor know that it has lasted a good while and that he has been pleased for years with it.  Braun is a high quality manufacturer and this razor is easy to clean, not too noisy and gives a decent shave. It is a bit pricey but well worth it now as it has lasted him for a long, long time. We recommend it highly!</li>
