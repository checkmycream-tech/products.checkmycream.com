      <li>Well not any more with the WEN Shower Comb</li>
      <li>Most combs are made from a mold with the seams on the inside of the teeth and handle....</li>
      <li>It is ok</li>
      <li>I made sure I ordered the product that is identical in ingredients to the authentic Wen.</li>
      <li>Better to buy a cheeper comb with padded tips and hangs in the shower.</li>
      <li>Had to toss the Wen Cleansing Cream because it caused hair loss, but I love this comb.</li>
      <li>I appreciate Chaz Dean for coming up with this ingenious comb and his cleanser conditioners.  </li>
      <li>Love having two sizes in one.  </li>

      <li>Nevertheless, it has always remained healthy &amp; shiny looking.</li>
      <li>This comb works pretty good.  </li>
      <li>This one seems more sturdy, but the conair is more comfortable.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love this comb, I have fine hair</li>
      <li>Inexpensive comb very sturdy good for after shower use get through the tangles</li>
      <li>so it breaks easily and this comb seemed to add to the breakage.</li>
      <li>This comb is sturdy and glides through my hair easily when used with WEN.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have other wide tooth combs, but this WEN shower comb is so different and amazing. No snagging, pulling and glides through my hair with ease. Love it.....and will be getting more just in case I lose this one. Got the product fast and in perfect condition. Thanks so much!!!</li>
    <li> If you need to detangling your hair, this comb is great. I recommend this comb to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> as described and shipped quickly</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this comb, but it does not pull your hair out.  I can tell a huge difference since I started using it.  I&#x27;m not losing half my hair everytime I try to wash and detangle my hair.  If your hair is fine and tangly, this is a God-send.</li>
    <li> Lost my comb by Chaz, so glad you all had it!  I&#x27;m happy with styling again!</li>
    <li> This comb is terrible. The teeth are so hard and sharp.  It hurts my scalp. Better to buy a cheeper comb with padded tips and hangs in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love this comb.......I leave it in the shower and use it with my shampoo and my conditioner......leaves my hair so silky smooth</li>
    <li> The comb is a nice one. My hair is long so it works nicely. It is inexpensive so give it a try.</li>
    <li> This comb has two parts, the wide tooth part and the thin tooth area.  The wide tooth part of the comb is excellent to use on your hair when the hair is wet to avoid breakage.  It is a wonderful comb!  I keep one in my purse at all times.  I appreciate Chaz Dean for coming up with this ingenious comb and his cleanser conditioners.  My hair is getting healthier!</li>
    <li> This comb is not as nice as the WEN comb I got as part of a set of WEN cleansing conditioners I purchased elsewhere. The teeth are hard &amp; scratch my scalp. Also the teeth are squarely perpendicular to the comb back, whereas, in my older comb the teeth settings are more rounded and clearly won&#x27;t damage my hair.  It&#x27;s okay, but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This comb was great it just slid right through my hair no pulling and no hair was left in the comb!!!!</li>
    <li> Great solid heavy duty comb but really you can get away with using any wide toothed comb. I&#x27;m not returning it but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend paying the price asked for this particular comb.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd com I have gotten from WEN. I really like this comb because it&#x27;s heavy duty, but if you drop it in the shower it doesn&#x27;t break. I got the 2nd one to leave at my mom&#x27;s home.</li>
    <li> This brush smelled like water paints when it arrived. I was expecting a plastic brush, but it&#x27;s sort of ceramic or something of that nature. It&#x27;s an ok brush. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair after using it.</li>
    <li> Awkward to use - I don&#x27;t see this as anything better than the wide tooth combs I get at Walmart</li>
    <li> I love my Wen Comb, and I would not be without it. I have thick course-textured hair about 2 -3 inches below the shoulder. The Wen is jumbo large so that I am able to get a good grip, and this comb is a perfect detangler for me as it glides through without pulling out my hair like all the other wide tooth combs that I had previously used. I like that the ends of the large wide toothed area are pointed. This helps to detangle the occasional snarl at the hair end. I do not comb my scalp, only my hair, so I cannot attest to any scalp irritation. I generally use just the wide tooth part of the comb, however, in the past when I had ‘bangs’, or even a shorter haircut, the closer tooth part of the comb holds my hair perfectly when I am working with the hair dryer. Since the larger part is jumbo sized, I never burn my hand under the heat of the dryer. The Wen comb is seamless and sturdy and I have had mine for years, I have switched around with other shampoos and have tried different hair products, but since I have discovered the Wen jumbo wide toothcomb, I have never wanted to try any other.</li>
    <li> I originally received this comb with an order of WEN shampoo.  I loved it!  My grand daughter has long hair and I gave my comb to her because it does a great job combing out tangles with ease.  I then ordered 5 more combs and gave all but one to my family members who also have long hair.  I use this comb every time I wash my hair.  It is great to use when you have tangled hair and for combing conditioner through your hair.</li>
    <li> Great comb to get all the product through your hair</li>
    <li> This comb is ok, but you can get similar items at other local stores.  The teeth of the comb are rather sharp and can scratch your head.</li>
    <li> not as good as the one that you get directly from Wen but works.  just feels heavier and thicker so not has stream line</li>
    <li> what in the world? This comb arrived intact and it works (I mean it is a comb) but it has an AWFUL indescribable smell to it!! REALLY bad. I tried washing it and it still stinks. I may just toss it which is a shame because I really like the finer end of the comb for product placement in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have a Wen comb purchased from Wen which is the best comb I have ever used. Love it. Bought 2 here and received horrible combs. There is a huge difference between these and the one I bought direct from Wen. These are not made of the same material. The teeth are sawed off to look the Wen comb. These are not Wen combs by Chaz Dean.</li>
    <li> Its just like any other comb you can buy. It also pulls my hair out, which I don&#x27;t need help with!!! Don&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a genuine Wen comb, and I bought this so I could keep a second comb at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is counterfeit. It has the Wen stamp on it, but I think I&#x27;m going to contact Chaz Dean and tell him this fake is being sold under his name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teeth are not rounded at all. They have sharp edges, scratch your scalp, and pull out your hair. The REAL Wen comb is wonderful. This is TERRIBLE.</li>
    <li> Ace brand combs were the ones I grew up using on my hair (wavy, curly, frizzy depending on the weather). However, I couldn&#x27;t find a \\&quot;shower comb\\&quot; version. At LESS than FIVE BUCKS and free shipping this is a worthwhile investment for a hair tool for use both in and out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll spend a fortune on hair lotions &amp; potions and complain about FIVE BUCKS for a decent hair tool. Yes it&#x27;s plastic, it&#x27;s hard, doesn&#x27;t splinter to snag/break your hair. It helps evenly distribute your cleanser or conditioner product through your hair so the product can maximize it&#x27;s benefit. I&#x27;ve used various Revlon shower combs before that quickly and easily shed their teeth and need continuous replacement. This has not been the case with this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended getting the comb whether I purchased the WEN cleansing creme etc or not. I&#x27;m glad I did, I actually purchased TWO. One for the shower and one for my nightstand so I can detangle my hair after the nightly scalp massage rather than the finger combing I&#x27;ve been doing. Just know you&#x27;re not going to find the same quality at the Dollar store or Wally-World, I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I like the idea that the comb is well made and there are no ridges within the teeth to snag or rip my cuticle.  But it is clumsy comb in the shower---a handle with a grip would be nice.  You know?  Shower, slippery soap, shampoo etc.  Why they call this a shower comb I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid 5.97, I think.  It&#x27;s kind to your hair but next time I order a comb (for the shower) it will have a no slip handle.</li>
    <li> I did not realize this was a fake with his name on it.  It&#x27;s twice as heavy and the teeth are thicker.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> My wife is silently happy with this comb. Uses it all the time. She never questioned it when it arrived, just combs away!</li>
    <li> Had to toss the Wen Cleansing Cream because it caused hair loss, but I love this comb.</li>
    <li> I use this comb as directed by WEN to help with the cleansing procedure. This comb is sturdy and glides through my hair easily when used with WEN.</li>
    <li> Love having two sizes in one.  Husband likes it so much he took it!</li>
    <li> I have had it wen comb for some time, at some point a couple of the smaller teeth broke on the fine comb end.. So I decided to order another comb..when this one arrived it looked like it was unfinished, the teeth are not smooth,  it doesn&#x27;t have the same cut and polish...it does not go through hair the same!!  it&#x27;s a small enough item that I&#x27;m not going to return it, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I would need it to use with the Wen shampoo. I guess if I had long hair it might be more useful.</li>
    <li> Amazon and Amazon buyers beware... Not a Wen product. The comb it sharp and will cut and damage your hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this comb thinking it would be perfect to use when I shampooed and conditioned with my Wen products.  I have fairly thick course hair and prior to using Wen it was hard to get to the scalp with a comb.  Now that all the commerical stuff is long gone my hair is so much healthier and I don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;hot\\&quot; all the time because my hair can&#x27;t \\&quot;breathe\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be perfect for me if the ends of the teeth were rounded so that I wouldn&#x27;t be scraping my scalp while trying to comb the products through.  I would also love to be able to hang it on the shower caddy so it would always be handy when I need it.</li>
    <li> This comb is durable, but does not pull or tear on your hair.  I am african-american with natural hair and I love it, along with most of the WEN products.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER been able to use a comb in my hair before. I have thick, coarse hair, and even running a brush through my hair when wet was painful and unproductive. When I got this comb, I figured, \\&quot;hey, it&#x27;s not expensive...it&#x27;s worth a shot!\\&quot; I&#x27;m so glad I made the choice to purchase this. It runs smoothly through my hair, and is an effective multi-use styling tool as well. It&#x27;s a MUST if you&#x27;re looking to begin using the Wen line!</li>
    <li> I have several Wen combs...and this is not one of them! Amazing that they are now making \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; combs, huh? Oh well, it could have been worse. At the last minute, I revised my order from 3 combs to 1 comb because I thought the price was pretty low and I should check the product out first. Unfortunatly, it was a smart move on my part.</li>
    <li> A must for Wen products but I use it with all my other shampoos. Wished I had this my whole life, just bought another one for travel so I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I am a huge believer in and lover of WEN products EXCEPT for this comb!!  I think the 2 different style teeth is a great idea - I always use 2 or 3 combs every morning anyway, so def thought it SHOULD simplify my a.m. routine. Problem is teeth broke off both of the 2 combs I tried on 1st or 2nd use.  The 2 combs were purchased at different times so it&#x27;s not like i ran into a \\&quot;bad batch\\&quot;.  Oh well....</li>
    <li> I love this comb! If you are a Wen girl you absolutley have to have this comb! It really helps to push all the cleanser through your hair and is very gentle.  It is a super heavy duty come and very high quality!</li>
    <li> This comb sucks. It pulled me bald and i have very thick curly wavy hair. Dont buy it.I wanted it to see how it worked and it was horrible.</li>
    <li> Really - this is the WORST comb I&#x27;ve seen in my life. All my life I had a long hair, and I went through many combs. This one pulls your hair and it&#x27;s just... strangely designed.</li>
    <li> When I first got this comb, I hated it!!! Literally. It was because the teeth are flat. It felt like it just &#x27;skimmed&#x27; across my hair. But I gave it a try and I hardly use anything else on my hair. I realized you don&#x27;t need spiky teeth as I thought before. It&#x27;s very gentle, but does the trick. I simply love it and don&#x27;t think it was too much $.</li>
    <li> I have two of the real Chaz Dean combs which I love, but the ones I received from Amazon appear to be fakes. The combs  from Amazon look nothing like the wonderful combs I have directly from Chaz Dean. The combs from Amazon break the hair while combing and are uncomfortable on the scalp. I will be returning for a refund...</li>
    <li> this comb is not like the first one I bought from qvc  I wonder if it is the real thing  Sharp edges&lt;br /&gt;disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really like this comb and the price was excellent.  I have a natural and really enjoy using this comb. Thanks</li>
    <li> This comb must be for thin stringy hair, the teeth are too thick which makes it impossible to get through thick hair..It is a well made comb, just isn&#x27;t made for Afro hair.</li>
    <li> For some reason I hate this comb. It is stiff and pulld hair out if you aren;t careful.</li>
    <li> I really like Wen cleansing shampoo so I tried this comb. It is ok but it is quite thick and very stiff. Not all that easy to use.</li>
    <li> Personally, I LOVE this comb! Generally I will use it in the shower when I am conditioning my hair or using the WEN Cleansing Conditioner to make sure that everything is distributed evenly; or when I am applying product to my hair after my bath, for the same reason. This comb works well for me because it doesn&#x27;t generally get caught in the snags my hair sometimes will get. I ONLY comb my hair when wet, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work for those of you using it with dry hair, but I truly love this comb and it works exceptionally well for my personal hair care needs!</li>
    <li> I bought this item as an \\&quot;add on\\&quot;, as I have a comb that I got previously from the info-commercial package. They only look the same. This one from here has sharp edges on every edge! My real Chaz Dean WEN comb has all soft edges, and no pull or breakage. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I keep this comb in the shower to comb my conditioner through my hair.  I like the way it has the super wide teeth and the ordinary&lt;br /&gt;side.</li>
    <li> These are the same combs that come with Wen products for alot less, buy you wont be diappiointed with these.</li>
    <li> Happy this is a true WEN product! Enough said! Use this comb during every cleanse.  it does not tear my hair, love it!!</li>
    <li> I have one comb from wen kit and bought this one and I love it.  I gave one as a stocking stuffer and my husband uses one.</li>
    <li> I strictly use this comb in the shower after conditioning my hair.  It keeps my it from tangling as it glides through my curly, fine locks preventing knots and knarls.</li>
    <li> Odd little comb but I know it will come in use.</li>
    <li> WEN is all about treating your hair right!  I use this comb everyday in the shower to apply product evenly.  I use only this comb when my hair is wet.  I have never had split ends since.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my original WEN comb purchased several years ago, directly from the WEN website.  I saw this on Amazon at a low price as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; and decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, I didn&#x27;t feel that it that same quality as my original comb.  The teeth are much sharper on the scalp and the weight of the comb feels lighter.  Could of WEN changed their product?  Possibly.  I have not yet purchased another comb from the WEN website to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did end up keeping this comb as the low price made it seem not worth it to go through the hassle of a return.  I have however put it aside for use only in my travel tote and plan to buy another one for daily use from WEN directly.</li>
    <li> great price, great comb</li>
    <li> Inexpensive comb very sturdy good for after shower use get through the tangles good made not like to break has thick frame</li>
    <li> This one seems more sturdy, but the conair is more comfortable. The WEN comb pokes my head and drags through the hair. The conair glides and is somehow gentler on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this comb to my family members and friends.  I could not wash my hair in the shower,  before trying this comb. I lost to much of my hair down the shower drain. Well not any more with the WEN Shower Comb</li>
    <li> Great comb for in the shower.  Use it with the Wen Cleansing Creme in your hair, then rinse....leaves it tangle free and feeling awesome.</li>
    <li> I use nothing but WEN products on my hair and I would not be without this comb.  And it is a lot cheaper than buying it through WEN.</li>
    <li> This really helps the WEN hair product suds up your hair.  I&#x27;m really glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This comb doesn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe it for very long hair. My hair is medium length. And my hair is very curly.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product it goes with the Wen Chaz Dean Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
    <li> High quality, durable, does the job!  I recommend it to anyone using the WEN cleansing conditioners!  Highly recommend as a companion in the shower!</li>
    <li> This comb is awful! The ends are sharp! Do not waste your money. I give it  negative five stars --sorry.</li>
    <li> This is the very best comb on the face of the earth.  It creates body where there is no body.  The way that it is made helps maintain healthy hair and never splits or damages hair.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Also, this item was packaged very well for shipment, so as to protect the item within.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Wen hair products! I admit that I was a bit skeptical at first but my hair looks and feels fantastic. But it&#x27;s not because of a $14 comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one that I paid a buck for at the dollar store and guess what? It works the same. Why? Because it&#x27;s a PLASTIC COMB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money for the actual product, not the slick marketing ad.</li>
    <li> Perfect comb to leave in the shower. Takes out all the tangles without pulling out hair!</li>
    <li> Great wide tooth comb for my conditioner distribution.</li>
    <li> I did not have a WEN comb for my recently purchased WEN products so I picked this up as an add-on item. When I received it I was surprised at the flat, sharp edges on all the teeth, especially the tips. I tried using it but it was very rough and scratchy on my scalp and I was afraid it would damage or tear my hair. It is terrible!  A couple of days later I ordered a WEN kit from QVC that included a comb. I just received it and the actual Chaz Dean comb has very smooth, rounded teeth and edges all over the comb which is the quality I expect from WEN. The spine of the real comb is not as thick as the one pictured here and the logo is very near the top edge of the comb, not down by the teeth. The real comb has a shiny finish, not flat black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the sellers: If you purchased these thinking they were an actual WEN comb, you have been grossly misled. This is so obviously a knockoff when viewed side-by-side with the real comb.</li>
    <li> Great comb for in shower to comb the  cleansing conditioner through my hair!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price.  I left mine when I went on vacation so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot replacing it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother buyingt his. You can go to Walmart or Target and buy the same sort of comb a lot cheaper</li>
    <li> I love this comb.It has replaced all of my brushes.The tangles just disappear and very little hair is pulled out.I would recommend this comb for everyone but especially for fine hair.</li>
    <li> But I do love WEN products. So I am going to continue to use it. Chaz Dean is awesome and knows his hair care.</li>
    <li> The odor of the wen comb is the worst. It smells like a pot handle that has caught fire. It was so sickening I had to throw it in the garbage .</li>
    <li> love this comb offer  this product to any one comb feels good in my hair when im washing hair very happy</li>
    <li> really, Chaz Dean designed this?? has he used it?</li>
    <li> Hair dont break as much when using this comb. When coming wet or dry, just start from the tip then work your way up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb, you run it through your hair. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to praise or denigrate a comb.</li>
    <li> the wen comb is great, since there are big and small  ones in it and its good to use after using wen shampoo</li>
    <li> The finish is too dull it tugs through my hair instead of glides through Very dissapointed with it. I think there is a copy of these same type comb hopefully with improvements. I don&#x27;t use it and wished I could have returned it.</li>
    <li> This comb is amazing.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  It is everything Chaz Dean says and more.  Great purchase</li>
    <li> I use this comb in the shower and it really makes a difference to brush the wen conditioner through your hair to make it spread out evenly. After your shower, you can brush straight through your hair with no tangles. Love this comb!</li>
    <li> Made for thick hair but works great.</li>
    <li> This comb works pretty good.  I have very long hair and so it takes a while to get it all combed out.  Nice that it has the wider teeth on one end and smaller on the other.  One of the small teeth did break off but it still works fine.</li>
    <li> I had searched Wen products, and while ordering my shampoo, I thought I would go ahead and order a comb since I always forget to pick one up at the store.  The tines are too wide and are not tapered enough to get comfortably through the hair.  It&#x27;s also very thin, so that makes it sharp.  This is a total failure.  Buy a Goody.</li>
    <li> This comb evenly distributes the Wen Conditioning cleanser without pulling my hair out. The comb also works on my hair to comb out dry with no hair in my comb and I have thick, wavy curly hair.</li>
    <li> Keep it in the shower/tub to use. I thought it was a good price &amp; I didn&#x27;t have anything like it. 3 stars because you could use anything similar.</li>
    <li> I use this to comb out hair after tinting and after washing/conditioning hair.  A very good tool for your hair</li>
    <li> I had this comb and wanted a second, but they are $15 bucks everywhere else. So the add-on price was a great way for me to have a second. It doesn&#x27;t break my hair when it is wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time.  It&#x27;s a great comb in and out of shower.  Take it every where with me.</li>
    <li> nice to keep in shower</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this comb! The teeth are all flat, so there is no harsh feeling against my scalp. And it really helps distribute the product through the hair. And with the awesome price... can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> what can I say ...I love the comb and it works out great I leave it in the shower soooo...</li>
    <li> Easy to use ..basic big toothe comb...stays in the shower constantly to use with conditioner ..still looks great ..no complaints .</li>
    <li> Good price.  I use in shower to move the conditioner through my hair and to get tangles out.  I like it.  I ended up buying a second for another shower.</li>
    <li> I had a comb from Chaz Dean a few years ago that was solid and worked great.  This comb is flimsy and bends entirely too easily. If I had handled this before I bought it, it would still be on the shelf.</li>
    <li> Good, heavy, quality comb for using on wet hair.  Will wear a long time.  These are a necessity.  You do not want to tangle wet hair.  You can comb through, part and either air dry or set hair with assistance of this comb.  As with most WEN products, a good quality value that lasts.</li>
    <li> ...this one is sturdy (does not bend) and has wide enough teeth on one end for think long hair or for combing through leave in products, etc.  The other end is spaced like a regular comb.  Two in one, perfect in my book!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this comb, I have fine hair so it breaks easily and this comb seemed to add to the breakage.</li>
    <li> If I had not used my BF&#x27;s comb, I wouldn&#x27;t have know what a difference a comb can make in how it is engineered. Most combs are made from a mold with the seams on the inside of the teeth and handle....this breaks your hair when combed (feel the little &#x27;snags&#x27;?), especially when combed wet, because the hair shaft is more fragile. Chaz Dean&#x27;s combs are made differently, hence the higher cost. But you feel the difference when you use a comb from a mold, and then use his comb. Love it, love it, love it!! (My BF promptly took his back after I used it.....he loves it too and wouldn&#x27;t let me keep it in my bathroom!)&lt;br /&gt;AFTER USING THE ONE I PURCHASED HERE,  AND COMPARING IT TO MY BF&#x27;s ORIGINAL WEN COMB, THESE ARE NOT THE SAME!! MUST BE A KNOCK OFF OR COUNTERFEIT....BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I have very thick very tightly curled hair and I use WEN cleansing products.  Every once in a while I pull out my WEN comb and I wonder if it will work this time and each time I just.don&#x27;t.get.it!!  This comb will not go through my hair.  The so-called wide-tooth half is not very wide at all but I think the worst part about this comb is that the teeth have flat, wide points instead of the rounded, narrow points that most combs have.  Rounded, narrow points on a comb seem to allow a comb&#x27;s teeth to get through the hair and down to the scalp a lot easier than this comb with it&#x27;s wide, flat \\&quot;points.\\&quot;  I just don&#x27;t get it.  I can&#x27;t use this comb.  When I put it to my hair, I can&#x27;t get my hair to actually get into it and get it down to my scalp.  I suppose maybe people with thin straight hair might find success with this comb?</li>
    <li> Works like any comb but does work.</li>
    <li> You need it  with the conditioner otherwise you won&#x27;t be able to get tangles out.</li>
    <li> Just as described, the comb works inside and outside of the shower&lt;br /&gt;no tangles, it&#x27;s a little bulky but it does fin in the hands nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> love the wide teeth ! fits nicely in my hand even when i use it in the shower, it doesnt slip out of my hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this comb to go with the Wen Cleansing Creme Shower Conditioner, this works great and makes it so much easier to distribute throughout my thick hair</li>
    <li> HAD TO RETURN THIS CAUSE IT WAS BROKE A HEAVY COMB WHICH I AM SURE SOME REALLY LIKE TO USE</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This comb bites at the scalp, only if you have super thick hair will this work for you.</li>
    <li> I carefully read through the item descriptions &amp; ratings of the various Wen products found on Amazon. I made sure I ordered the product that is identical in ingredients to the authentic Wen. Guess what? Despite diligence in ordering; I RECEIVED THE FAKE, BOGUS, WEN CLEANSING CONDITIONER (SHAMPOO) -- the ingredients are not--I repeat-- ARE NOT AS LISTED IN THE ITEM INGREDIENTS DESCRIPTION!. It was obvious after the first (and will also be the last) shampoo!  I have above-shoulder-length, straight, baby-fine &amp; color-treated hair. Nevertheless, it has always remained healthy &amp; shiny looking. I normally steer clear of heavy conditioners, or 2 in 1 shampoos, as they always weight my hair down. However; pressed for time one day and rushing to get showered and out. I noticed a bottle of Wen among other bottles of shampoo on the shower shelf (apparently ordered by my daughter, from the authentic Wen website) Thinking I could kill two birds with one stone (shampoo &amp; condition in one step): I tried it.  I was [very] pleasantly surprised with the results-- and over a period of time ended up using the entire bottle. Wanting to replace it, but not wanting to commit to Wen Website&#x27;s automatic renewal scheme, I looked to Amazon. After carefully reading the reviews &amp; warnings, and after an \\&quot;online chat\\&quot; with a Wen website representative during which I copied and pasted the ingredients of the Amazon product, and received confirmation that they were indeed identical to the ingredients of the authentic Wen product, I placed the order thru Amazon. HUGE MISTAKE! It took just one shampoo for my hair to look &amp; feel like a bail of wiry, sunburned, dried out hay! I&#x27;d been so diligent in ordering that it didn&#x27;t dawn on me, at first, that the shampoo might be responsible. I just thought \\&quot;My hair feels weird\\&quot; but didn&#x27;t dwell on it --kinda told myself it was probably just my  imagination. But, as the day went on and I periodically ran my fingers through my hair, and/or brushed it, the undesirable look &amp; feel was undeniable. Then the lightbulb switched on, and I decided to check the new Wen product I&#x27;d used for the first time earlier that day. BINGO! It listed the very ingredients Amazon reviewers had specifically warned about and said to avoid!. Shame on you Amazon! It&#x27;s false advertising! A deliberate bait &amp; switch by the merchant seller. And pointing out the \\&quot;Refund\\&quot; policy is of absolutely no comfort!. As I&#x27;m sure is the case with countless other unhappy customers, the hassle of repackaging (especially since it involves removing the pump that comes packaged separately, making sure the bottles are sealed, etc. etc.) is a hassle I can&#x27;t take on right now. So... I&#x27;m stuck with $30 worth of a product I will never use, am out of funds to order the authentic product from Wen, and am disappointed, angry, and frustrated at yet another rip off!</li>
    <li> The teeth on the comb are broad and did not work well for me  and my coarse hair. Don&#x27;t use it anymore as a result.</li>
    <li> This item is an authenic. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> For the money the comb is made very well.</li>
    <li> Worth the wait. This comb makes cleansing my hair with WEN products much easier.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and product is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Should have paid attention to a previous reviewer.  I too misplaced my old Wen comb and after what I thought was a thorough search ordered a new one.  Noticed the difference immediately!  The teeth on my new comb were flat instead of rounded and so, when combing your hair it feels like you are ripping the comb through your hair.  Very disappointing!  Luckily, my old comb was found but, kept the new comb for my husband.  Definately NOT worth the cost.</li>
    <li> These combs are great for wet hair.  No pulling or tangling.</li>
    <li> this is not the same quality as my other Wen combs...the teeth are so sharp on this it will cut your scalp!  the plastic is also not shiny like my others...sending this fake back</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job but for way less money any wide tooth comb from the drugstore will work. I do use it everyday in the shower but it is nothing special. If the one I have gets lost I won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
    <li> This comb is alright. I wish it came in two sizes instead of half the comb large spaced and half small spaced. I find it hard to get it through my hair. I use the larger size and some of my hair gets stuck in the small teeth and yanks my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this comb as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; item and am glad I did.  It gently massages your scalp as you comb WEN conditioner through your hair.  I also use it as a regular comb when not conditioning.</li>
    <li> This item is a counterfeit Wen product. BUYER BEWARE!!! The teeth of this comb are not smooth on the ends (as the REAL comb&#x27;s are) and they will scratch your scalp when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;:(</li>
    <li> My previous WEN comb had become dried out and brittle - I dropped it and a tooth broke off.  Works just as well and for a great price!</li>
    <li> Fine for thin hair. If you have thick not so good product. This is just my thought in this,</li>
    <li> I so love this comb and found it here on amazon for a good deal!!</li>
    <li> I really love the combs, and needed them to use with my WEN.  They came fast and were wrapped perfectly.  A great dealer to do business with.  Thank you very very much for the attention to detail. :)</li>
    <li> Less functional that cheaper combs because teeth are squared off at ends. I definately don&#x27;t mind paying for quality, but this was not worth the price. I ended up buying a different one, for less, at a drugstore.</li>
    <li> This comb doesn&#x27;t work smoothly through hair.  It gets caught and tangles.</li>
    <li> I watched Chaz Dean discuss this comb and it works like he said.  It does not break my hair, makes it much easier to go through wet hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this comb to use in shower because I have very thick hair and I wanted to be sure to get the WEN conditioner into each strand of hair when it was wet.  It works.</li>
    <li> Ive been using Wen for a year now and love it. I recently broke my comb though and went online to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a Wen comb. The plastic has a different weight to it and the points on the teeth are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not using it because it was snagging my hair. Next time I make a new Wen order, Ill just order another from there directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want a regular plastic comb, hit up your local drugstore instead and dont waste the cost of shipping.</li>
