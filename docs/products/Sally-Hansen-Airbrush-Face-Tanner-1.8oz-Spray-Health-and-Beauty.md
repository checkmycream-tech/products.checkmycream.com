      <li>My favorite self tanner!</li>
      <li>I love the face and their leg tan also!</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>Make sure to put lotion on the bottom of your feet and on any area you don&#x27;t want tanned!</li>
      <li>I had some kind of skin disease.</li>
      <li>I have tried Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clinique, Neutrogena but Sally Hansen is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I do not know why it doesn&#x27;t get more attention than it should.  </li>
      <li>I usually love Sally&#x27;s products...</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>so make sure you have a towel over your hair when you spray it on yourself, and if you use your hands (without gloves) to spread it, make sure to wash them with soap and water immediately within minutes after you are done.  </li>
      <li>Instead of spraying it on, though, I spray it into my palm and apply it with my fingers to make sure I get even coverage.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply though.</li>
      <li>I like this tanner as it is an easy way to  tan your face.  </li>
      <li>Its easy and  </li>
      <li>So I wanted a fine mist to spray to my face and not have to rub in.  </li>
      <li>I wish I could say the same for the body tanner, but this face product works great.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and gives a really nice, natural color.  </li>
      <li>I love this product there is no false statements on it.  </li>
      <li>not bad.</li>
      <li>Gives great believable color and lasts for a few days, applying more frequently lets the color build.</li>
      <li>it is simply just amazing.</li>
      <li>The sprayer was not working right.</li>
      <li>It was like the sprayer was jacked up, not allowing the spray to come out right.</li>
      <li>It gives you a real looking tan and it is so fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this!!!</li>
      <li>I really like the outcome!</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like this product because it didn&#x27;t seem like it was working.</li>
      <li>This face tanner works very well and is easy to you with no mess.  </li>
      <li>Does clog pores as much as i use it</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t tan that much, but it was a saver.</li>
      <li>Guess it doesn&#x27;t advertise as much.</li>
      <li>I t performs better than any other tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used -including</li>
      <li>after seeing all of the 5 star ratings i had really high hopes for this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m scared of most facial tanners, but this one is so subtle that it&#x27;s easy to use without fear.</li>
      <li>After about 2 days I noticed a difference, not a huge difference, but I did look tan, and my skin looked better.</li>
      <li>it is a little bit oily and doesnt dry very fast, but good enough.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; roseca</li>
      <li>It lasts for at least 3 days and fades gradually, however I have used it for so long as part of my bedtime routine that I use a small amount every night and hope they won&#x27;t discontinue this wonderful product!!  </li>
      <li>The color starts to develop within an hour, but by the next morning, you are sunkist and ready to bear your legs.  </li>
      <li>It gives me the under makeup look of a natural tan.   </li>
      <li>I think the product must be quite old, because it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
      <li>The smell is nice, and by morning, you will look like you spent a few days in Hawaii, without the wrinkles and cancer risks that come with laying out in the sun.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty decent tanner but startes to look a little splochey after 3 or 4 days so you will need to reapply.</li>
      <li>This is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works well on my face - meaning color appears natural, not orange at all.</li>
      <li>Hold your breath a second and spray directly on face.  </li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t get it even, you can end up with large dark spots on your face and they don&#x27;t wash off for days.</li>
      <li>The instructions were not clear on use with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The product was good just really dark and orange on my face could have been wrong color for me just wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
      <li>next day you have as little or as much tan as you want.  </li>

<li> Now I am totally addicted!</li>
<li> This product was useless.</li>
<li> some very expensive face tanning items...    </li>
<li> too bad</li>

Will I buy it again \\&quot;in a heart beat\\&quot;.  It gives me the under makeup look of a natural tan.   IT&#x27;S EXACTLY TERRIFIC!!!!</li>

    <li> This face tanner works very well and is easy to you with no mess.  My only complain is the smell.</li>
    <li> I think the product must be quite old, because it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  I&#x27;ve used it in the past, and it has worked well.</li>
    <li> after seeing all of the 5 star ratings i had really high hopes for this product.  it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  there was no color change in my skin at all.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for years, and she says it is the best.</li>
    <li> Gives great believable color and lasts for a few days, applying more frequently lets the color build.</li>
    <li> I have tried Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clinique, Neutrogena but Sally Hansen is by far the best. I do not know why it doesn&#x27;t get more attention than it should.  Guess it doesn&#x27;t advertise as much. It goes on easily and gives a really nice, natural color.  I am extremely pale so this gives me an instant tan.  The color starts to develop within an hour, but by the next morning, you are sunkist and ready to bear your legs.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I WOULD NEVER BUY ANY OTHER BRAND FACE TANNER.  THIS IS WONDERFUL.  AND FOR THE PRICE, YOU CANT BEAT IT.    KUDOS SALLY HANSEN</li>
    <li> I use this product just on my face.  I use it daily (sometimes twice a day).  I put my lotion on then spray a little.  I really like the outcome!</li>
    <li> I like this tanner as it is an easy way to  tan your face.  I spray the brush and put it on.  Its easy and  you can build the color.</li>
    <li> I have used at least 20 different face tanners and this one in my opinion was the worst.  Did not work, and stunk.  I usually love Sally&#x27;s products...but this one def not.</li>
    <li> This took a few days to develop &amp; after the 2nd day my face was extremely dry &amp; irritated despite moisturizing. I have very sensitive skin &amp; roseca and this product was extremely drying to my skin. The instructions were not clear on use with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love the face and their leg tan also!</li>
    <li> love it! works great on olive skin tone.</li>
    <li> I have used this self tanner now for 15 years, ever since it came out. It is perfect to put on after a night shower, on a freshly scrubbed face, neck, chest for winter, and all over in the summer.  It is not orang-y like other self tanners I have tried, and a bonus is that it helps my oily skin to eliminate pimples that other lotions used to cause.  The smell is nice, and by morning, you will look like you spent a few days in Hawaii, without the wrinkles and cancer risks that come with laying out in the sun.  It is quick-absorbing so make sure you have a towel over your hair when you spray it on yourself, and if you use your hands (without gloves) to spread it, make sure to wash them with soap and water immediately within minutes after you are done.  If you use it for whole body, definitely spread it with thin gloves.  It lasts for at least 3 days and fades gradually, however I have used it for so long as part of my bedtime routine that I use a small amount every night and hope they won&#x27;t discontinue this wonderful product!!  Make sure to put lotion on the bottom of your feet and on any area you don&#x27;t want tanned!</li>
    <li> not bad. used it for my CABO trip, so i didn&#x27;t have to wear makeup at the beach and still tan. too bad i didn&#x27;t tan that much, but it was a saver. it is a little bit oily and doesnt dry very fast, but good enough.</li>
    <li> Be careful when applying this to your face. I suggest spraying on your hands in small amounts and applying to your face as evenly as possible. if you don&#x27;t get it even, you can end up with large dark spots on your face and they don&#x27;t wash off for days. Unfortunately I have some light colored freckles. This product will tan your freckles and make them darker too. Has a coconut scent or a scent that reminds you of suntan lotion....more like a cocoa butter scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is frighteningly effective! Now I am totally addicted!</li>
    <li> It was \\&quot;Okay\\&quot; Had a faint smell, but not bad. Heard from people I looked kinda orangey. I didn&#x27;t think so but that is what others told me. Easy to apply though. I don&#x27;t know. I only used it twice. Maybe I oversprayed? It did fade nicely - no spots looking like I had some kind of skin disease. Maybe good for a one night thing?</li>
    <li> got it today sprayed it on my hand and it looks great thank-you</li>
    <li> This product was useless. The sprayer was not working right. When I&#x27;d spray my face, a yellow substance come out. There was no mist. It was like the sprayer was jacked up, not allowing the spray to come out right. I don&#x27;t know... I&#x27;ve used this product numerous times and this has never happened before.</li>
    <li> This is the best face tanner ever. It gives you a real looking tan and it is so fast and easy to use. I will only use this face tanner from now on it is simply just amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m scared of most facial tanners, but this one is so subtle that it&#x27;s easy to use without fear. Instead of spraying it on, though, I spray it into my palm and apply it with my fingers to make sure I get even coverage. Just one piece of advice: don&#x27;t keep a bottle from one year to the next, because it&#x27;s sort of dies over time, creating an orangey effect.</li>
    <li> I got this product so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to rub any product into my face as I find this to stimulate outbreaks.  So I wanted a fine mist to spray to my face and not have to rub in.  This product sprays out unevenly and does not meet my requirement.  I paid a premium by ounce for this effect but will end up using on my body instead.</li>
    <li> The product was good just really dark and orange on my face could have been wrong color for me just wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent tanner but startes to look a little splochey after 3 or 4 days so you will need to reapply.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face tanner for a few years. This is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works well on my face - meaning color appears natural, not orange at all. I wish I could say the same for the body tanner, but this face product works great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this!!! I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years and I don&#x27;t know what I would do Without it!</li>
    <li> I can make my face look as dark as I want and when i use it a lot of people asked me, Have you tanned? I said no, spray tan for the face, give it a try!!</li>
