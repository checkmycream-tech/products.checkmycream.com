      <li>BUT, if you like tea tree scent and/or have oily/acne/etc body skin or anything else which can be cleared up by the medicinal properties of tea tree oil -- this makes a strong and effective bath.</li>

      <li>I use in the morning and night, gently massage it into a great lather on my face, leave it for about 15-30 seconds and rinse well.</li>
      <li>miracles~ out of most of the people in my family</li>
      <li>refreshing-- tea tree, eucalyptus, rosemary, etc.</li>
      <li>This face wash is fantastic!</li>
      <li>It is ok, not what I was hoping after all the reviews.</li>
      <li>Just waiting for the hormones to chill out :).</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>So glad I found it cause I couldn&#x27;t find anything to control my oily skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this from another site glad to find it on amazon.  </li>
      <li>I used gels mostly for that purpose, but was recommended foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am happy to say my skin responds very well to tea tree oil</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite face washes.</li>
      <li>smells like tea tree oil, which i love.  </li>
      <li>The best container I could come up with is a regular soap bottle that produces foam from liquid.</li>
      <li>Once a month or as needed is perfect and you only need a pump or two.  </li>
      <li>Yessssi love it</li>
      <li>:-)residue</li>
      <li>i love my body washes and fancy soaps..</li>
      <li>im pleased.</li>
      <li>I still have some breakouts, but I am in menopause and think most of it is hormonal.  </li>
      <li>I can get more on the oily side with my skin and sometimes get breakouts and this helps a lot.</li>
      <li>Since taking stock of this I decided to see what else I could do with this wash, and I found that it made for an interesting bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Nature store by me inconsistently carries this and when they have it, it is significantly more costly.  </li>
      <li>Hope this helps! :-)</li>
      <li>refreshing-- tea tree, eucalyptus, rosemary, etc.</li>
      <li>give me more break out</li>
      <li>so upset I got more acne</li>
      <li>I started using this face wash daily(2/day) more than 10 years ago.</li>
      <li>feels very clean on my face.  </li>
      <li>This is a great huge bottle that&#x27;s good to refill my smaller bottle.</li>
      <li>The label says to use cool water, but I use warm water.</li>
      <li>I have been using this morning and night for two years and over time, after using it consistently for a while, have received compliments on how good my skin looks--something I never thought I&#x27;d hear.</li>
      <li>so i think salycic (idk if I spelled that right) acid and witch hazel oil should be added into the solution to be more effective.</li>
      <li>great for refilling old facewash bottles (not so great if you&#x27;re trying to pour it straight out of this huge bottle).  </li>
      <li>Great face wash, though it can be drying with frequent use esp.</li>
      <li>like that Desert Essence has been a company with a good conscience for decades, and I really like the price, too.</li>
      <li>I love how clean my face feels after using this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy on my skin.  </li>
      <li>It flattens out very quickly and leaves the water cloudy.</li>
      <li>It was more refined, pores shrunk, and felt clean without drying my skin.</li>
      <li>It does smell really strong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect for oily skin</li>
    <li> Leaves your face a little dry, good at getting rid of oil related acne</li>
    <li> I cannot stress enough how much I love this face wash! I have been using it every night for the past 4-5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Profile: my facial skin is normal/dry with moderate breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using this product, I was trying all kinds of face washes. My skin is normal/dry, but I do often have bad breakouts, with huge, deep pimples that scar my skin.  I just so happened to be browsing through whole foods and read the label, and thought I would give it a try. It was about $16+ a bottle, but it seemed good. After a few washes, it cleaned my face right up without leaving it dryer! (please also note that I use a Japanese nylon wash cloth to wash my face) The scent is not too overbearing - just smells botanical. I also love that there are NO chemicals in it - just a natural cleanser. It has evened out my skin tone, it feels exfoliated and smooth, and I rarely, rarely get breakouts any more. I also now only use a daily moisturizer and maybe blush when I go out - no need for make up my skin is so radiant! I get compliments all the time on how good my facial skin is, even in cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily when I was searching online, I found that vitacost had the cheapest price for it (even with shipping factors to Hawaii at the time included), and have been ever faithful after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest trying it out. I would give this product a 10 out of 5 stars. My only slight complaint about the product overall would be that I bought the smaller soap pump once, and the pump was not good - it wouldn&#x27;t pump correctly, so I would have to untwist the pump and pour it out (could maybe have just been that one bottle).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle. I love how clean my face feels after using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a young and powerful heterosexual male and let me tell you, this product is fabulous. Me and my eastern European skin are gleaming with excellence. If you want to be as dazzling as I... then go ahead and buy this superior face wash. You won&#x27;t regret it, boys.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a teen, I have had acne non-stop. My dad is in his 50&#x27;s and still get acne! I tried everything from masks to Proactiv to antibiotics. I wanted something that would work that contained little to no chemicals. This stuff is amazing! Just use it once a day, and no pimples at all. You rub it on your face for 30 seconds, then rinse it off! The label says to use cool water, but I use warm water.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work. I used it for over 6 months without writing a review and I noticed nothing different with my skin. It does smell really strong.</li>
    <li> This face wash really works. I don&#x27;t really write reviews on items but I decided to on this one. I have awful acne all over my face and did I mentioned how greasy my skin is.This stuff makes my skin feels clean and it brightens my skin too.It didn&#x27;t cure my acne though,I still have acne and trying to find something that can help me on that issue. It has a herbal scent which I like and my skin loves it too.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact I&#x27;m impressed and very happy with the natural ingredients and, most particularly, the fact this is not tested on animals, I have to say I&#x27;m really not happy with it.  The primary complaint is the smell.  Some have said it has a &amp;#34;tea tree smell&amp;#34; but I find it more in the arena of alcohol or some other astringent.  Very offensive smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried to improve the smell by adding lemon essence but that simply could not cut through the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have only used a small portion of the bottle and will be trashing it.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and this is the one product that I can count on to keep my skin under control! I don&#x27;t even bother using metrogel anymore-I don&#x27;t need it! No more tender bumps on my cheeks with consistent use of this product! And, not to mention, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my skin. I simply pour this in a foam soap dispenser and place it in the shower for use, and I use it all over my body! I personally think it smells refreshing, but I have been using it for a while, so I am sure I have just gotten use to the smell, which may be strong to some people. And it may be drying for some skin types, so make sure you moisturize! Even with that said, I would most definitely recommend this product, especially if you have suffered with Rosacea like me. It has been so effective and I could not be more pleased with this product, and I love that it is foamy!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my son and it has helped  with his acne very much, i would recommend this face wash</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how much I love this!!!!!! I have&lt;br /&gt;acne and I&#x27;ve tried proactiv which DID NOT WORK!!! I started using this recently And its working !!!! Yessssi love it the smell isn&#x27;t bad. I will deff be ordering more! Thank you</li>
    <li> Such a great, crisp clean feeling whenever I wash my face! Tea Tree Oil is the best cleaner ever! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving the product. It&#x27;s a very liquid product, so i put it in a bottle that turns each pump into foam. I have dark spots so i think salycic (idk if I spelled that right) acid and witch hazel oil should be added into the solution to be more effective. Other than that im pleased. My face feels super clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Great face wash, though it can be drying with frequent use esp. in the winter months, use a good moisturizer such as CeraVe. you may want to use it every other day until your face adjusts to it.&lt;br /&gt;Product is very watery, but if you put it in a foaming  pump soap dispenser it comes out a foam, and it does lather when you wash your face, you just have to apply the soap to your hands 1st with a little warm water,and rub your hands together before applying it to your face. Rinses well, no breakouts. Will purchase again. The foaming soap dispenser is a must.</li>
    <li> I have very finicky combination oily skin, with that being said it is so freaking hard for me to find products that don&#x27;t give me pimples or rashes. I am happy to say my skin responds very well to tea tree oil (thank god, because its in EVERYTHING related to oily skin) I LOVE this product, and i&#x27;ve used a few other products by desert essence and have been pretty satisfied with the results. I do have really red cheeks (i&#x27;ve tried so many things) and this doesn&#x27;t help with redness but everywhere else on my face has a very good even tone with no pimples thanks to this........now at one point i ran out of organic/whatever &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soap i had, i hate using my families processed gunk soap because i can tell it destroys my skin, so i started using this as body soap as well......miracles~ out of most of the people in my family i&#x27;m not too smelly but i do still have B.O. like any other westerner, but i&#x27;ve actually noticed a significant decrease in my body odor after using this, which I tested by using my families normal soap and being stinky again. so hey two in one! plus the price can&#x27;t be beat with the size of this baby it&#x27;s lasted me quite awhile now and i&#x27;m not the only one using it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I have very oily skin and have to rotate cleaners daily.  Using this product straight is wonderful and I also use it as a base of homemade face scrub.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> It is ok, not what I was hoping after all the reviews. It is very thin and does not really lather well. Being it was such a thin consistency it would get into my eyes and burn. It did not do a good job at removing make up and the smell was not pleasant. It is such a big bottle so I am trying to use it up but just can&#x27;t due to the burn in my eyes and smell.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:b7e8a9265e7b6f7c2c72ffb8e56be04f]]Oily and acne prone skin has always been my problem. Every esthetician told me that the first step is to thoroughly cleanse the skin. I used gels mostly for that purpose, but was recommended foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I did not know before purchasing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This cleanser comes in a large 32 oz container, so you will need a smaller bottle to use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is very liquid, close to water, so if you use a bottle with a large opening, you will waste a lot. The best container I could come up with is a regular soap bottle that produces foam from liquid. It really works well with the liquid state of the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does feel tight after using tea tree oil cleanser or toners, but as long as I apply moisturizer after, the skin feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash because it is priced right and that it feels like its working. In fact I am quite sure that it is working because i am experiencing less break outs. Use this with a good toner, and i think you will be happy with the results. I chose another tea tree product for toner just to increase the effectiveness of it. I like the Body Shop Tea tree toner, works hand in hand.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser. Dries out my skin a bit so make sure you use a good moisturizer after</li>
    <li> What a great product! It does a great job cleaning my face with no skin irritation at all. The tea tree oil scent is not strong and literally disappears when you dry your face. Just be aware that it is very watery and you will need to put in a smaller dispenser to avoid waste.</li>
    <li> give me more break out I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle i only like 1/4 but didn&#x27;t finish the 1/4 I put in my dispenser, I throw it im so upset I got more acne</li>
    <li> I started using this face wash daily(2/day) more than 10 years ago. It does great cleaning job and very easy to use. My facial skin looks good without makeup after 10 years usage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my 2 sisters and both of their husbands liked and switched to this brand too! If you are seriously looking for a good face wash, specially for the oily skin, this may work on your needs.</li>
    <li> I keep this in the shower and wash my face and acne prone areas, (ie: shoulders, neck, back) with it.  Been using it for several years and finally hooked my husband on it, who is &amp;#34;not into that natural stuff).  I even will use it in my hair once a month to strip out any hair product and build up.  I do not use it more than that because IT WILL dry out your hair and strip the natural oils out.  Once a month or as needed is perfect and you only need a pump or two.  You get a very thin lather but don&#x27;t let that discourage you.  Thin little layer on the face.  AND, I only use it once a day because I don&#x27;t have very only skin as a whole.  My husband had very oily skin and has to use it twice a day.  You much be faithful with it, using it for a few weeks.  I found results within a week&#x27;s time, but my daughter needed a couple of weeks to show results.  (She&#x27;s young and a bit inconsistent with it so of course did not see fast results such as my husband and myself did.  It&#x27;s with buying the small bottle with the pump and then ordering the big refill bottle.  The Nature store by me inconsistently carries this and when they have it, it is significantly more costly.  I ales you the Tae Tree stick by Desert Essence.  It works for the big blemishes that all of a sudden arrive.  I use it on the spot for two or three day, two or three times a day.  Works in mosquito bites, too!  Put it on the bite and it itches like CRAAAAAZY for about a minute, but the relief afterwards is incredible.  It shrinks the bite down faster in a couple of days with consistent use.</li>
    <li> I like it that the product came up among the lowest toxicity score on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database. I&#x27;ve bee using it for a few years. I have combination skin and this keeps the skin clean and clear without feeling too dry. Only problem is I tend to pour out too much at one go once I take its cap off!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a daily facial wash that leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean - this is it.  My skin is very sensitive and I was worried that I might have a reaction - but I have used this Tea Tree Wash daily for several months now and I have not had a single problem.  It also makes my skin feel tighter - but not dry.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Best face wash I have used, I have ultra sensitive skin and I can use this without fear of irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> I luv this product I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 years and just luv it I have really sensitive skin and this seems to do the job and last a long time, I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or has acne or oily skin !</li>
    <li> I tried this at a friend&#x27;s house before I bought it for myself. It works great - my face feels really clean and not greasy afterward, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated. I have acne and sensitive skin, so I find this face wash works well for me.</li>
    <li> Cleans well at full strength but I prefer to dilute and use a foam dispenser. Doing this reduces the stinging eyes that can occur.</li>
    <li> However, the value is great and will last for months!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile and I have hardly broke out.  I have combination/oily skin.  It does not leave my skin dry and I use it every morning/night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued by acne for almost 20 years now.  It&#x27;s simply a part of my life that I accept and I&#x27;ve never really found a face-wash or any sort of medication that helps with it.  Eating &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; helps somewhat, but I&#x27;m still prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now, and it&#x27;s an excellent product.  It seems to be helping with my acne by healing breakouts faster and generally preventing them.  It&#x27;s also easy on my skin.  It&#x27;s no miracle product; I didn&#x27;t use it for a day, and boom, new pimple, but its very good, all natural and relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> refreshing and clean -- I use it as shower gel to clean entire body; generate a lot of lather if you put it on bathing towel to massage and clean in shower.  I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> This product is great for problematic acne skin. I have somewhat oily skin (not too bad) and I find that this definitely cleanses my face well. The tea tree oil also tends to help any sort of rash or irritation I have going on. Though it does seem that at times, the moisture is sucked right out of my skin! I guess can deal with that if it means I can get rid of those pesky zits. Do be warned to not get this product in your eyes as it can be uncomfortable. I do like to use facial washes to get my eye makeup off so that would be the one downside.</li>
    <li> Where has this cleanser been my whole life? I noticed a difference in my skin the second time I washed my face.It was more refined, pores shrunk, and felt clean without drying my skin. I have suffered breakouts for 13 years and this helps my skin stay clear (with my claraonic brush). The. Only negative is sometimes the cinnamonsmell makes me sneeze.</li>
    <li> Pros: favorite cleanser to clean makeup brushes or makeup in general. This stuff strips. I use it sometimes when my face is crazy oily and/or horribly broken out and it does help. I would never use this twice a day, I would never use this in the winter. But it&#x27;s definitely become a staple in my bathroom. It does not break me out but it probably would if I overused it and didn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
    <li> This product really cleans without drying. I personally don&#x27;t care for the aroma that much but it really does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Once rinsed you don&#x27;t smell it anymore.  I will continue using it because it cleans quick and easily.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite face washes. I can get more on the oily side with my skin and sometimes get breakouts and this helps a lot. This is a great huge bottle that&#x27;s good to refill my smaller bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to clear up oily skin. I was reading through the reviews on this product and thought I would give it  a try. I&#x27;m so happy I did! I could see a difference right away, and my skin was smooth after the first wash. Very happy!:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years! Great for teens acne and older people with dry skin. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this . The smell is a little stringent when you use it but it doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on your body.</li>
    <li> This product was incredibly drying on my skin. I bought it to replace a more gentle lotion cleanser I had been using, but which had not improved my acne. The first time, I used the product by itself, and used a lot because I thought the liquid consistency meant it wasn&#x27;t very strong. This was absolutely incorrect I quickly learned it had to be VERY diluted. When I would use it on my face, I would pour a small amount into my hand and then lather it up with 5 or 6 parts water, until the lather was very thin. This was the only way I could keep it from stripping all the oils on my face and leaving the tight, &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling. At that point I was essentially washing my face with just water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product twice a day for 2 months, and after seeing no improvement in my acne (and even getting a patch of breakouts on my chin) I am buying a new facial cleanser to replace this one. I now have this huge bottle taking up space in my bathroom cabinet, but I think I will use the rest as a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: In case you did not know, that squeaky clean feeling is BAD for your skin and means your skin&#x27;s natural moisture has been stripped away. This leads to dry skin or oil overproduction or both!</li>
    <li> The same stuff we by at whole foods, but less expensive.  It&#x27;s a great face wash without the nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> This face wash is fantastic! It makes your skin feel clean and I really like the smell. This was a refill for a previous purchase I made and I am still very happy with the results. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>

    <li> this is really good as a face wash/body wash/and shampoo! at least that all the things i use it for lol.</li>
    <li> I started using this based on some of the reviews here.  I have very sensitive skin and break out easily.  I was using another face wash that recently changed from a simple gel to only having a foaming face wash - and I started breaking out the minute I used the new stuff.  So I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot.  I love the smell but I do feel a bit of a residue after rinsing.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of small pimples since I started using it but it still seems to be a better product than the last stuff I tried.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! So glad I found it cause I couldn&#x27;t find anything to control my oily skin. I wear foundation and everyone know makeup and oil don&#x27;t mix so now with the oil at a minimum, my face doesn&#x27;t look all greasy. I will say it dried out the skin around my eyes. I use coconut oil under my eyes at night to help but other than that I like it. I&#x27;m on my second bottle which will last me another four or five months!</li>
    <li> Came across this old favorite from my teen years, and decided to try again - glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference: I am an adult with oily, acne-prone and somewhat sensitive skin. Too harsh chemicals or scrubbing will really irritate skin around my nose, chin and cheekbones, in particular. Oh, and I always forget - my cheeks only are quite normal to dry! It&#x27;s pretty mean, but such is life. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great. It&#x27;s fairly gentle, so I can use it with a soft washcloth to lightly exfoliate my skin. It&#x27;s frustrating to have sensitive skin that is easily congested by oil, that *needs* daily exfoliation, but this stuff seems to bridge the gap of gentle + cleansing. It feels like the tea tree helps heal my skin on the occasions which I over-scrub or it gets damaged by the harsh weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that Desert Essence has been a company with a good conscience for decades, and I really like the price, too. If you have combo, oily and/or acne-prone skin - this one to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is a huge 32 oz bottle, with no pump. It&#x27;s probably a refill bottle, but this price (currently ~$13) just can&#x27;t be beat. Buy a pump, or pour some into a smaller bottle that you refill, like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and my boyfriend sometimes steals a wash-worth of this when the skin under his beard is itchy, flaky -- generally winter cranky. He likes it, too. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12/01/2015 - Okay, so this really is a ridiculously large bottle. As such, especially given my propensity to try new things, this bottle was still heavy and full after nearly a year of time. Since taking stock of this I decided to see what else I could do with this wash, and I found that it made for an interesting bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bath additive - this is not foamy for long. It flattens out very quickly and leaves the water cloudy. I think this is due to the castille soap, as this is the same as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps. Like Bronner, you may not want to get this in your hair, or if you do reeeeeally rinse and condition and rinse - or you will get a weird residue + dry out thing. It also may gunk up your razor and leave a film in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, if you like tea tree scent and/or have oily/acne/etc body skin or anything else which can be cleared up by the medicinal properties of tea tree oil -- this makes a strong and effective bath. I don&#x27;t really have oily skin aside from my face, neck and chest, but this still left my skin feeling great after a soak and jumping out of the bath to slather on some body oil. And I do happen to find some of the mediciney-smelling scents refreshing-- tea tree, eucalyptus, rosemary, etc. Mmm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! :-)residue + dry out thing.

    <li> It made me breakout. tea tree supposed to be good for skin but too many ingredients might have caused me breakout. i have oily skin by the way.</li>
    <li> My mother said dont pay a arm and leg for something going down the drain. But felt because of the cost this wouldnt work. I was wrong...its excellant. Ive used proactive...and other name brands without success.This cleared my acne in a week without useing anything esle. I do find washing twice daily a bit drying, so added about three tablespoons grapeseed oil to the bottle. I washed my dogs with this...worked wonderful. It is a bit watery, so you have to be careful when pouring , I put it in a squrit top bottle. I have never been so impressed with a face wash before , clean , soft , and clear. One reveiwer said his pores were shrinking...I too have seen that. I just resently added the tea tree skin ointment and I feel confindent about what the results will be. I know I will be useing this for a long time. Shipping on the wash was reasonable...the ointment took a coulpe of weeks. Everything arrived sealed and in one peice.</li>
    <li> great for refilling old facewash bottles (not so great if you&#x27;re trying to pour it straight out of this huge bottle).  smells like tea tree oil, which i love.  feels very clean on my face.  only giving it 4 stars because it dries out my (oily &amp; combination) skin a bit and i haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic improvement in my breakouts.</li>
    <li> Only wish it would have come with a pump handle. AND only use it twice a week it can be drying to the skin. But it&#x27;s perfect for keeping the skin clear!</li>
    <li> I bought this from another site glad to find it on amazon.  I bought this after trying the same brand tea tree facial pads and tea tree bar of soap.  This works great for cleaning the face but also on the body.  I first soap up my wash cloth with [[ASIN:B001E763NQ Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Rich Moisturizing Pure Vegetable Oil Soap, 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)]] I then pour some of this wash on the cloth as well and rub them together.  Great for under arms, prevents rashes and odor.  Great for private areas (odor control and cleansing)and where you have rashes or eczema patches.  Helps with itchy spots and bug bites. With the generous 32 oz bottle you can definitely use it all over your body.</li>
    <li> great cleanser.  helps clear up breakouts.  can be drying if used everyday</li>
    <li> Love it! Great value!</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time finding the right face wash as my skin is oily/combination, and has in the past been prone to breakout and leave dry patches. I am a nearly 30 year old female, living in the air-polluted city and have had issues with past sun damage as well.  I have tried many many face washes , ranging from $6 to $30 and this by far has been the best. I have been using this morning and night for two years and over time, after using it consistently for a while, have received compliments on how good my skin looks--something I never thought I&#x27;d hear. I barely wear any makeup anymore. I love this, love that it is natural, cleans thoroughly, produces great results and is priced so well!</li>
    <li> hey ya&#x27;ll..just wanted to share this with you..i love my body washes and fancy soaps..but this stuff is so good! if you have acne..anywhere..back buttocks..etc..this will clear it up! a little goes a long way..it does smell like tea tree..but you get used to it..i keep it in the shower in a soap dispenser..you just need a drop or two.</li>
    <li> This seems like it would be good for maintaining already clear skin, but hasn&#x27;t done much to help regulate my oily/acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from another retailer. I&#x27;ve tried many different cleansers over the years and I never found anything so good on my oily face. My face gets even oilier in the summer and this cleanser makes my face feel clean and oil-free without it feeling tight. I also think it cleared up the whiteheads I&#x27;ve had on my chin for years. I can&#x27;t think of any other reason they&#x27;re gone. All that and it&#x27;s the least expensive cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Ok this is by far the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever bought.  First of all the price for quantity is amazing… I bought it a couple months ago and still have half a bottle.  I use it on my body too.  I have not had any brake outs since using it.  It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.  I used to by the tea tree face wash from the body shop.  But that stuff is like 10 bux for about a third of the amount that comes in this bottle.  This seems a bit more watery than the body shop one, but it works just as good, if not better.  I highly recommend trying this!</li>
    <li> This cleanser has worked well fro my acne prone, oily skin. It&#x27;s gentle and has pretty great organic ingredients. But the huge negative is that it has no pump! How am I suppose to get this stuff on my face without spilling it everywhere? hugely inconvenient...</li>
    <li> I am currently deployed and my face has broken out like crazy. Cystic, blackheads, white heads and scarring. Horrible! In my search for something to calm and heal my skin I cam across this, tried it and love it!!! It smells like Pine-Sol, but it cleans your skin and leaves it nicely balanced. Removes the daily dirt and oil, brings pimples to a head and balances your skin tone. I use in the morning and night, gently massage it into a great lather on my face, leave it for about 15-30 seconds and rinse well. Make sure to follow up with a a great moisturizer, nothing heavy that will reclog your pores. And in one week you will see a dramatic difference.</li>
    <li> This face wash visibly reduced acne and other skin ailments I was having. The best organic facewash I could recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great. I bought this for my two daughters and me. We all love it and leaves our face super soft.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great</li>
    <li> Awesome face wash. I had a weird fungal candida infection on my face &amp; this seemed to really help with the symptoms. The bottle is huge too so it&#x27;ll last a long time. Worth the extra money. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  This product continues to meet my expectations.  I still have some breakouts, but I am in menopause and think most of it is hormonal.  Anything that keeps it to a minimum will make me happy.  I still use this as a cleanser, with a homemade, all natural, toner, moisturizer and spot treatment.  My skin hasn&#x27;t been perfect but not too many cyst type of breakouts as I&#x27;ve gotten shortly after starting with some other cleansers.  I like the way it lathers up, and it washes away cleanly without residue. I will continue with it. It&#x27;s been several months, and I have no complaints.  I don&#x27;t know that there is anything that will completely stop breakouts at this time.  Just waiting for the hormones to chill out :).</li>
    <li> This product shipped quick and is the answer to all my prayers! I have sensitive acne prone skin and I have been using this for months and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get what the description said. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, product is great. But I went by the description &amp;#34;Oily Skin&amp;#34;. What I got was &amp;#34;Oily &amp; Combination Skin&amp;#34;. Got back on Amazon  &amp;  enlarged the picture and that is what it is. Good product, but its frustrating that the description is not truly represenatative of the product being purchased.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a very good product. Have only used it a couple of times, but so far I like it.</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin. The soap is thin/watery. I used a foaming soap dispenser as suggested by another user &amp; it works great. No waste. You def get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been having a lot of skin problems because I work in a building without air condition and sweat all day.  I used Proactive for at least six months, maybe longer, with no real results.  THIS STUFF, however, is amazing.  My skin is squeaky clean but not dry.  I haven&#x27;t had a blemish since I started using it.  I use it all over my body; it lathers so well that a little bit really goes a long way.  It&#x27;s cheap enough that you can just TRY IT because it really is amazing.  I have eczema, sensitive skin, allergies, and this product really does its job!</li>
