<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When my product arrived I was out of town...I have only been using it just barely a week and already see a difference.  This is amazing. My skin is smoother and the dark spots are lighter. Even my husband noticed that &#x27;something&#x27; was different, that my face looked brighter, he even said happier.  Really like this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this products for two days now, and I can already see the difference on my face. This product is excellent, and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a younger, more vibrant skin tone. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I can see my skin looks better than before! Thank you!</li>
    <li> My initial reaction is very positive in that l like the packaging and like the feel of the cream on my skin. I will post again in a few weeks in terms of my skin appearance.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks but my skin feels smoother and some of my fine wrinkles appear to be less noticeable.  I cant wait to see what happens after using it for several months.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Love its  impressive ingredients  list and  instant  tightening effect on my skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I really recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I love the way this serum smells. I love the way lavender smells and this serum has a nice lavender scent. I love to use this serum before bedtime because the smell of lavender is relaxing and can help you sleep. This serum is packaged nicely and comes in a pump bottle. This makes it really easy to apply. It only takes a pump or two to cover my entire face. It doesn&#x27;t take long for the serum to absorb into my skin. It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I haven&#x27;t been using the serum long enough to notice any anti-aging improvements. Either way I like the way it makes my skin feel and that is what matters!</li>
    <li> The product has done,as expected,with the fine lines slowly fading and the deeper lines,on the forehead,showing less and less. The neck lines are not as responsive as hoped,but will keep applying,with the hope this will start to take effect and become less prominent. Also the smile lines are becoming less noticeable,but hope they will be less crisp,in appearance. This is by far the best product,for removing the lines of aging,that I have used,for this as always,aging problem. At any age,this product,Ageless,is one that should be added,to anyone&#x27;s,daily routine,of health and wellness.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your battle,in the fight for a more youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;M.J.Lewis</li>
    <li> Smells awful, and dries my skin. I thought it was supposed to do the opposite?</li>
    <li> The scent is very nice,  and  texture is very smooth, and it blends into the skin very well!</li>
    <li> This product make my skin feel tight and smooth. This allows me to put on makeup without having to add another moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about it when at first I kept pumping the bottle and nothing would come out. I was able to unscrew the top off and found there was nothing connecting the top part of the bottle to the inside. I then realized I have to hold the product upside down and then pump to get anything out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product for me skin which is combination oily with occasional acne.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten into my 40s, I have noticed more and more fine lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes. I like to use products with natural ingredients, so this serum is perfect for me. I saw great results right away, which surprised me because it usually takes me a couple of weeks to see any kind of difference. I applied 2 pumps of the serum to my face right after I had washed it. The serum has a light lavender scent that is very nice. The serum went on easily and absorbed pretty quickly. The thing that I noticed right away, is that my face seemed to plump up (in a good way), so my fine lines weren&#x27;t noticeable anymore. It gave it a more youthful appearance. I did use a moisturizer afterwards because I always use one in my daily facial routine, but I really liked the way my face looked with just the serum also. I enjoyed trying this product for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference already.  My skin seems smoother and especially around my right eye I have one line that is very noticeable to me.  It seems to be less noticeable.  I&#x27;ve never used a product like this...I think I&#x27;ve been denying that I&#x27;m at the age that I need it.  Now I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long.  Highly recommend. Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Keeps your skin smooth and firm. Love it makes my face feel fresh and extra firm.</li>
    <li> Did not see any changes at all</li>
    <li> Love this product amazing</li>
    <li> I like the way the product feels and I notice an immediate tightening of the skin it but I&#x27;m not sure if there are permanent changes.  I&#x27;ll keep on using the product and update as time goes on.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I actually use it not just around my eyes but whole face. My skin is smooth and brighter the next day, and I like the smell</li>
    <li> Love this.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and it totally replaced a much more expensive product that had the same main ingredient in it.  Makes my skin feel soft and seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Used only 2 times. First time i had gotten a mild red itchy spots so i waited a while and tried it again then it got worse.</li>
    <li> The product is not greasy or sticky like other products on the market. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and I can feel the difference. It makes my skin firmer and softer. I also notice my acnes are less after I use the product. I would definitely buy this product for my daily usage.</li>
    <li> I love this face serum. My skin is looking better and better each day &#x3D;) I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and will purchase again when I run out. Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product  I really like it. You have to put lotion on like it say&#x27;s right away.&lt;br /&gt;I order it and they I get it so fast, never had a problem yet.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed that aloe is the first ingredient.  Good grief, the price I paid, not to mention the supposedly &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; price was totally unjustified.  Get real.</li>
    <li> The Ageless serum is a great product. I love the way my skin looks and feels. I&#x27;ve been using the serum along with the microneedle roller by Thera Vita. The tiny laugh lines around my eyes are less noticeable and my skin is improving overall. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I&#x27;d highly recommend using the microneedle roller with the serum for best results.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a good product, It makes my face feel tight and firm. I wear it under my makeup and it makes me look a little younger. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It keeps my skin moist and plump.  I use it everyday.  My mother has started using it too and her skin is so much better than it used to be.</li>
    <li> Since my (over 60) face has wrinkles and fine lines, I am looking forward to trying Thera Vita&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum. Also love the organic herbs! All I want for Christmas is a younger face :)</li>
    <li> This serum is so moisturizing and it smells so good! I love the texture and it absorbs instantly when I applied it on my skin. The lavender in it also calms my skin so I love to use it before bed time with my Hitachi Hada Crie, so far I love the pairing effect, you could really notice a shrink in my pores!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised, nice quality</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick with this product and I like the packaging, what is inside is even better.  It has a mild but pleasant scent and soothing to my skin.  I like the ingredients and my skin is responding to it.  I look forward to even more dramatic results.</li>
    <li> Bought this product about 2 months ago and still have some left!  I use one pump&#x27;s worth before I go to bed at night and in the morning as well.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth and tighter.  I feel like it has helped with the fine lines on my face.  I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try this product. Hyaluronic Acid is touted for holding moisture in the skin and for firming the appearance of the skin. It appears from the reviews that many are experiencing good results.</li>
    <li> I thought I had posted here before, but I guess not. Great product. Goes on light, you barely know it&#x27;s there after you apply it. You can feel the skin tightening minutes after you put it on. Only downside is the pink label (talking as a guy here, ha ha).</li>
    <li> Thera Vitas&#x27; Ageless Serum is a great choice for those looking for a gentle, natural approach to anti-aging. The active ingredients give the serum antioxidant potency and hydration to your skin. I have noted an all-around positive change in my skins&#x27; texture and appearance. For those who fall in the dry skin category and are looking for overall healthier skin, this is a great product to add to your morning routine.</li>
    <li> When you put under your eyes there&#x27;s some tightness that you feel once it dries. I do follow it with eye cream. I still need to give it some time to use it..will update soon</li>
    <li> I love this serum I would buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> After using twice a day for 3 weeks straight so far, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin whatsoever. Pretty disappointed considering all the good reviews. It may be doing good things for my skin that I just don&#x27;t see....or perhaps it takes longer than 3 weeks to notice a difference, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> It not only helped my skin retain moisture but it created a cushion to help plump out the look of my fine lines and wrinkles. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, but a bit expensive.  It does help retain moisture, but I was hoping for more of a lifting experience, especially the neck area.  I used the entire bottle, a little does go a long way, but no real noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I placed an order for the serum and after a few days I received the product. I was highly impressed by the product. It had no smell to it but it worked on my skin very well. I was complimented on a daily basis about my facial complexion and tone. My friends were shocked that a cheap product of this kind was creating wonders for me. U want a younger looking face, look no further. This product rocks.</li>
    <li> BIG PACKAGE BUT SMALL CONTENT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it but there is only a tiny amount in the container.  I think it only lasted 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the serum three times and I would say the results were good but not great. I put the serum on after I used a micro-needle on my face.My skin improved with each use.I&#x27;m happy with the results, i&#x27;m sure if i stuck with it, the results would improve little by little.</li>
    <li> Great product along with great customer service!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the product a couple times and can really tell a difference in the firmness of my skin.</li>
    <li> So far I agree with Dr. Ozz! The proud icy has been great, and plan to continue using it. Thanks for the info.</li>
    <li> You definitely need to use with your own preferred moisturizer but after a couple of weeks, I thought I saw some noticeable results and have been using it faithfully every day.</li>
    <li> I liked the product.  You do have to use a moisturizer after applying the serum.  It works as well as many double the price.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> super good, I&#x27;ll buy it agagin</li>
    <li> like it. thanks for the great deal.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working!  I had someone ask a few days ago what I was using on my face that is was so smooth.  I plan to continue using it.  Hopefully I will continue to see improvement.</li>
    <li> This product does not at all live up to its promises............it is a total waste of money!!  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this product! The serum is not greasy and drys quickly on your skin. It is good for whatever skin type you may have and is especially good on oily-combination skin, which I happen to have. Ageless makes my skin feeling so nice and smooth and wonderful. The hyaluronic acid in it is designed to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I have tried other hyaluronic acid serums before and would have to say that this serum is tops for my favorite. It has a nice light fragrance that I really like also.</li>
    <li> Firm until you add moisturizer. Then it becomes &amp;#34; just another useless layer&amp;#34;. Nor is it anything noticeable used with your other products.</li>
    <li> Recently, I noticed that my chin has been breaking out a lot. I assume this is from all of the humidity which causes me to sweat; this is all part of summer. I had been cleaning it a lot and trying to get the breakouts to clear up but in turn, this caused my chin to dry out. Once my Ageless arrived I started concentrating on using it solely in the hopes that it would be the answer to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of days my skin began to heal nicely and the breakouts started to clear up. I also noticed that my skin felt softer and was no longer dry. There was no itching, like some of the serums that I have tried has caused; I attribute this to the fact that the product is all organic. Normally I am not one that is big on products being organic just because it is not something that I have ever really focused on; however, I really think this is the reason that the serum cleared up my chin as quickly as it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ageless also says it helps clear up fine lines. Now, this is not something that I will admit in public but I am starting to get very small smile lines around my mouth. While using this product to clear up my chin, I noticed that my smile lines all but disappeared. Even my sister, who is six years older, was joking around with me about how young I look. People often mistake us for twins, which makes her feel fabulous but me, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product.</li>
    <li> *****Great seller, great product.****</li>
    <li> Have noticed some fine lines have disappeared and my skin looks and feels smoother!  Would recommend this to others looking for a good skin treatment.</li>
    <li> I was in love with Ageless by Thera Vita the very moment the package arrived from Amazon. The bottle is sleek and gorgeous. One pump of Ageless goes a long way and the texture is luxurious with no heavy perfumes or scents at all. It feels great going on your skin and skin looks hydrated immediately. This is a beauty product I don&#x27;t want to leave home without. There are plenty of days I&#x27;ll skip make up entirely, but there&#x27;s no way i&#x27;d skip Ageless. Who doesn&#x27;t feel great about great looking and youthful looking skin? Ageless is a great value and can easily compete with the pricier products!</li>
    <li> I have been using this wonderful product for a week and i absolutely love it! Not only does it have a lovely scent to it but it has really made a change in the way my face looks and feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had really oily facial skin especially around my nose and forehead so many times a product designed for the face was such a hassle trying to find one that did not make my face even more oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular one is organically infused hyaluronic acid smooths away the appearance of fine lines in seconds and helps keep moisture in and external irritants out to preserve the integrity of the skin and mantain a natural beauty and glow. It also increases the strength and elasticity of the skin for a firmer look. It has ntioxidant properties eliminates sun spots caused by sun, pollution or smoking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it has no useless additives in it and feels light on my face. I usually apply this at night before going to bed. My face feels so soft and not oily upon waking. Have not had any irritation and am noticing a brighter tone to my skin. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I recently had a chance to try Ageless by Thera Vita. I&#x27;ve been using the 1.7 ounce bottle of their hyaluronic acid serum for the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ageless is a lightweight, clear gel you apply to your under eye area. I use the serum in the morning, after washing my face. Thera Vita recommends applying your favorite moisturizer or eye cream after the gel has a chance to absorb into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum contains a variety of ingredients including aloe juice, lavender oil and witch hazel extract. The hyaluronic acid may cause a very slight burning sensation so if you are new to this type of product, you may want to use it every other day instead of daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the consistency of this eye gel, some anti-aging formulas tend to be a bit thick and/or greasy. I plan to use Ageless by Thera Vita as part of my normal beauty routine.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!  I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and my skin is already firmer and softer. It is also lighter, softening dark spots. I am looking forward to the next month of using the product!</li>
    <li> MY PERSONAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW WOW WOW!!!!  The Ageless Moisturizer arrived completely wrapped in plastic with a beautifully labeled bottle in pink and silver that has a pump applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this stuff. I use it twice a day. I will wash my face in the morning, and apply the Ageless moisturizer, let that absorb, then follow it with my primer and then my make-up. It goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily or greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels more even. I have noticed that my pores are becoming smaller, and my skin just looks younger. I am extremely pleased with the way that Ageless has effected my skin. It will definitely remain a part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/best-hyaluronic-acid-serum-vitamin/dp/b00ezzrrhk</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a Hyaluronic Acid Serum for my face because WebMD and other sources say hyaluronic acid has been promoted as a &amp;#34;fountain of youth&amp;#34;. It has a pleasant smell and does not leave my face feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning after cleansing and before applying moisturizer. I noticed an instant tightening of my skin after my first use. I also love the way the bottle looks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about three weeks now and can really see a difference in how my skin feels and looks. Upon opening the package from amazon I was pleased with how nice the bottle of serum was, it didn&#x27;t look cheap or gaudy, the simple labeling really makes the product look high end. I have used this every night after I wash my face with my normal cleanser. The scent of the serum  is pleasant, not to overpowering which is great. My face feels so smooth and looks brighter after three weeks of use, I have recommended this serum to several friends!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!!!!! Must have for all! Don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for a week so I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic changes but I really appreciate how well the treatment fully soaks into your skin and quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any sticky residue that other products I&#x27;ve tried before do. I will continue to use this for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 1 week and I can see and feel a difference already.. my old dead skin is sloughing off at great speed.  I neglected my skin for a couple of months as I ran out of product.. I found yours, it is affordable and does the trick. I&#x27;m sure Ill see more improvement as time passes..  I will defiantly let you know.  I am 65 and have always prided myself in taking care of my face.  I get compliments all the time.  Now I have a product I can recommend...&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;Dee</li>
    <li> Cali Julz Says… The Ageless by TheraVita is a clear gel that goes on smooth, has no sticky skin feel, and has hardly any smell to it. My pores are smaller and the skin around my eyes and mouth are firming. You need such a thin layer to cover the face area it’s a great value as well. I recommend this product to anyone wanting a smoother more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference after using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum/Vitamin C for my face for a month.How much longer do I need to use it to see a difference.</li>
    <li> This wonderful serum by Thera Vita is a great sized anti-aging product. I am always looking for a multi-benefit beauty product so that I can save money, and time. One or  two pumps will cover the entire face. One bottle should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is very similar to aloe vera, and the serum&#x27;s scented with witch hazel, aloe and lavender. Those ingredients are what gives the serum its skin soothing properties.&lt;br /&gt;Even after the first application there was a noticeable difference in the softness and general appearance of my skin. Ageless helps provide less spots and wrinkles in a quick and effective one step a day treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a bottle for free to review, but my opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum a few weeks back because of the ingredients and the reviews. I thought for sure the vitamin C in it would give me the results I saw when I used vitamin C serum alone. I haven&#x27;t seen any results whatsoever I&#x27;m disappointed to say. My skin usually responds within a week when I try something new and it works. 3 weeks have gone by now and I&#x27;ve used it daily. Nothing. For me, it was a waste of money. Too bad because it seemed perfect given the ingredients. I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone just in case and then I&#x27;ll come back and eat my words if I&#x27;m wrong!</li>
    <li> I noticed from the first use that my face was softer. My little girl even noticed. I have used it for a couple of weeks now and continue to see improvement in the texture of my skin. I also love the pump. Two pumps is the perfect amount to cover my entire face and neck. Great coverage!</li>
    <li> I WILL DONATE TO A FRIEND. I THINK AAN ALLERGIC REACTION.</li>
    <li> like using this at night and you can notice a difference</li>
    <li> Love the scent. A little drying. Use with moisturizer. A little too early to notice any improvement in skin.</li>
    <li> very nice will buy it again</li>
    <li> I really dont think anything g works</li>
    <li> Heard about this and just start using it now... Love it</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I can already tell a difference in my skin. Great price for the size bottle you receive and the shipping was fast. I could&#x27;t be more pleased this product!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I have been using it since Tuesday November 11th and it has cleared up all of my blemishes that appear on my cheeks!  In addition my skin smooth and soft looking, It also creates somewhat of a matte finish to my skin when I apply my make-up. In addition to that I am prone to a little facial hair and seems to stop the hairs from growing on my face in such  a short period of time!  You don&#x27;t need to apply much, so one bottle will last awhile and it is definitely worth the price! The serum has a very light texture and not much of fragrance so if you have allergies you will not be affected. I am so glad I tried this product! It is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I like this - I put it on under my regular moisturizer.  im not sure if it has changed my skin any yet regarding wrinkles.  But it hasnt caused any adverse affects so I feel it&#x27;s worth using.  Well priced compared to similar products.  ;-)</li>
    <li> This is serum has a pleasant smell and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see changes in my skin yet but my first impressions are surprisingly good.  I definitely think its worth the money so far</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now and I really like the way my skin feels.  It is smooth and soft and feels more hydrated.  I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!! It is everything it says it is. It&#x27;s light, and oh So nice, makes your skin feel nurished. I wear it under my daily moisturizer, and my skin loves it! I Recommend it-- Ladies quit spending hundreds for products at beauty counters...this product is wonderful! and it works!!</li>
    <li> After applying this the skin feel tighter for a while but it doesn&#x27;t appear to make the wrinkles any less noticeable or lines less visible. Knowing what hyaluronic acid is supposed to do I was expecting better results.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Although I know that I needed to give this product some time to get best results, but after the first use, I already noticed that my cheeks were softer. I think this is because the product makes your skin well-hydrated, which is just what I needed. My face gets easily irritated when it becomes too dry, making it red and scaly (especially during winter).What&#x27;s worse is that most moisturizers (even Olay and my son&#x27;s baby moisturizer) make my face red and irritated, making everything worse. For what reason, I don&#x27;t know. But, with Thera Vita&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it doesn&#x27;t do what other moisturizers do to my face. I am so happy I tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still in my late 20&#x27;s, so wrinkles are not yet a biggie, but I will definitely use this regularly and hopefully, those wrinkles won&#x27;t show up! I also love how the bottle looked like and how it is very convenient to dispense the serum with it&#x27;s bottle pump.</li>
    <li> A little bit light for me. Not as moisture as I think it should be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this product to one of my relatives and they enjoyed it so much.  I felt it was worthy to leave a great review.  Nice job!</li>
    <li> Light dries quickly. I think it does plump. But not so sure it&#x27;s not clogging my pores alittle. When I use it I notice I get bumps that I don&#x27;t normally have. Still like it though.</li>
    <li> This feels great on your skin and really reduces wrinkles. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this!  So far so good!!</li>
    <li> twice the size and half the price of silimar product i purchased in department stores. works as well.  its a great item to use especially in the winter when air is dry. I also put them over other fine lines on my face.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Nice lavender aroma. not greasy. nice.</li>
    <li> First of all, I like its nice package with a perfect pump. Then, I applied it to my skin at night. It was neither liquid like other serums nor greasy. It was fast absorbed gel with a cool mild fragment. Most of all, I surprised by its results. Since it contains powerful organic herbs such as aloe, witch hazel, MSM, green tea, vitamin A, C, E, jojoba oil, and geranium oil, it can increase the strength and elasticity of the skin for a firmer look. Usually after I wake up, I can see more lines and wrinkles on my skin every single day  but it not only left my skin firm immediately  but also when I woke up my skin was still firm, soft and glow. I found it effective.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I work on me. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I Have used this for 2weeks. The smell is Good （Not too much)  i have Very sensitive skin.... especially around my eyes. Like the product. 4stars</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for about a month and I am pleased with the results.  My skin tone is definitely more even and I notice some difference in the fine lines around my mouth.  My pores also seem to be smaller and less noticeable and even the old acne scars on my face seem to have diminished some. Not dramatically but still there is a difference and nothing else has ever really helped at all.  It does cause some dryness.  That&#x27;s the only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it a 5 star, and really that is solved by using a moisturizer with it.  Great product for a reasonable price and customer service is prompt and helpful if you have any questions.</li>
    <li> Since I have very sensitive skin, I was a little concerned about using the product, I&#x27;ve literally been burned before. Not so. Additional instructions showed up in my email box and when I followed them, it was great. All the &#x27;congestion&#x27; my aesthetician told me I had seemed to disappear, lines plumped and my skin seemed more taut. Love it and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I am happy to say that they use a pump to take the content out of the bottle instead of a dropper, that makes it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of the content, it smells really good, made of a clear Hyaluronic acid serum plus aloe and lavender oil. Absorbs fast and leaves you a fresh and clean feeling once applied which I like for in a serum.</li>
    <li> Picked this up for my wife and I did good! She loves this stuff, I don&#x27;t think she needed it but all women like to feel like they are doing something to make themselves younger. But it smells good, goes on nicely and from what she says it works great, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Loved this serum - from the design to the product itself.  The addition of lavender is genius -- I love using it, especially at night where I find it really helps relax me and help me fall to sleep.  The pump dispenser is really easy to use and I love that the bottle can also unscrew, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about the product at the bottom of the bottle going to waste like you do with others!  Really like using after a home peel. Very soothing &amp; smoothing.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try Thera Vita Ageless!  Would love to diminish some fine lines around my eyes and could definitely use some hydration on my entire DRY face.  The organic herbs that are infused is a plus!!  Looking forward to healthier, younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted this product to work so badly, but as it turns out is sadly did absolutely nothing for myself. My forehead has a couple of immature lines, which I thought could be an easy fix if I started a regimen now......turns out this won&#x27;t be the case while using this stuff. (Used for almost a month now) Onto look for another....</li>
    <li> Very good, it came as describe</li>
    <li> Very nice feeling hyaluronic serum.  I love the way it feels and you use very little.  So far my skin appears better but I am also using another cream over this.  I will reorder this as it really does feel nice. The dispenser also gives you the exact amount you need each time so there is no waste.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed any positive effects from using the Ageless product.  I don&#x27;t see any negative effects either.  However, I have only used it a couple of weeks.  I can say that I was not happy with the pump...which has never worked.  I had to take off the pump and then tap some into my palm.  I decided to look up some of the ingredients.  For one, I looked up the ingredient Phenoxyethanol and it&#x27;s a toxin.  This product is advertised as natural, and although it does contain some natural ingredients, it also contains toxins. Needless to say I will discontinue using this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful thank you! IUse it twice a day!Itworks better than products that cost twice as much,as a seventy year old sun worshipper, I have had an oppertunity to try many</li>
    <li> Very good product, work as I expected, thanks.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying a smoother skin. Great product</li>
    <li> I have tried several Hyaluronic Acid Serums and while this one does work to lock in your skin&#x27;s natural moisture I find the formula to be harsher than most. As you apply it you will notice an astringent scent that reminded me of bactene. I&#x27;m not sure if this is partly from the lavender (I do not like lavender) or something else. It hasn&#x27;t harmed my skin in any way, I just unfortunately don&#x27;t care for the scent of it.</li>
    <li> Goes on so light, you&#x27;d hardly know it was there, except for the immediate firming sensation. Feels completely pure and clean, no worries about questionable chemicals or toxic perfumes. Just honest ingredients penetrating invisibly, and gently stimulating the skin. I particularly love how it feels around my eyes, where I need it most! I will be using this product with great interest for long term results.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!  From the first application, I felt my skin slightly tingle, without any redness or irritation.  I used it with my favorite face moisturizer and the next morning, my skin felt remarkably softer, and the &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; wrinkles at my eyes and mouth were markedly diminished.  I&#x27;ve used it day and night since then and it&#x27;s making a beautiful difference daily.  I will be purchasing this product over and over again, and will be passing it on to my friends.  It&#x27;s affordable and remarkable...a great combination!</li>
    <li> Beauty Without Cruelty. This amazing serum contains both Vitamin C and Co Q10 which helps brighten your skin and improve your skin&#x27;s texture and clarity. It also contains Vitamin E and A which are anti-oxidants that,with regular use, fends off free-radicals which causes aging signs. Perfect product for me!</li>
    <li> I started seeing results quickly while using this product. I loved that it left my skin soft and smooth. I like the ingredients are natural and powerful and how they work to help my pores look smaller and my skin feel smoother. It has a light lavender scent which I love, but I do wish they made one with a different floral ingredient because I can&#x27;t use this if I am going to see my sister or nephew because they are extremely allergic to Lavender.</li>
    <li> Love my smooth and bright skin.  Love this product~~~</li>
    <li> I got this product about 10 days ago and already I can see a noticeable difference, My skin is must smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Much fewer fine lines and wrinkles are much less visible. I would recommend this product and intend to continue using it.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll need to use this product, as with most hyaluronic acids, for some time to get them to work best.  Give at least a month.  Some tips to help accelerate the process I&#x27;ve found.  One, be sure to do acid peels or other methods to keep your best skin refreshed.  Two, always apply a good moisturizer directly after the application.  Three, give it some time, don&#x27;t expect too much for at least a month.  Overall very happy with the product.  If you have built-up older/duller skin this will probably not work as well.  BUT I also found that this did accelerate the dull skin lifting better so my acid peels work much better.  Cheap enough for a great return on the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ageless for a little over a week now and I like the way it goes on.  You don&#x27;t need much, one or two pumps.  I can feel it tightening as it dries.  I wear a tinted moisturizer over it and it goes on flawlessly, no smearing or streaking as with some others I&#x27;ve tried.  I have noticed my pores are smaller and a slight decrease in the small lines around my mouth.  Very good product!</li>
    <li> I had high expectations but did not find the results as amazing as described before I purchased this product. Maybe it works well for some, but I did not notice any changes at all. The product smells good and seems nice just not for me.</li>
    <li> Cant wait to start the product now :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hyaluronic acid serum! I&#x27;ve been using another brand but I will definitely switch to this one. I&#x27;ve been using it with a derma roller for a couple of weeks and my skin already looks better. I had small wrinkles on my forehead and since I used this before they got any bigger, they have a less slightly appearance. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this to keep those wrinkles away! It soaks in my skin right away and doesn&#x27;t leave a scent behind. The bottle it came in looked amazing too.</li>
    <li> This is working well for me, and it feels nice.</li>
    <li> Great product really diminished the appearance of my pores. Smells good, goes on easily, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful for my skin. Easy to apply and Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days so I haven&#x27;t noticed any anti-aging effects. I&#x27;m 27 years old with combo dry/oil skin. I applied this serum first after washing my face then my daily moisturizer. I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t need as much moisturizer and my makeup lasts longer</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my moms face. shes been using this for about 3-4 weeks and she even says she doesn&#x27;t feel much difference or see it. But she did say it was very enjoyable to put on.</li>
    <li> Anna Yates wrote:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Thera Vita for 18 months now and love it when my granddaughter asks me why my skin is so soft whenever she kisses me.  I am attaching a photo of myself.  I am nearly 62.  I hope you will agree that Thera Vita is working for me!..</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid is a common ingredient found in skin care products. Used mostly as a moisturizer, hyaluronic acid can hold up to 3,000 times its weight in water. As a result, hyaluronic acid serums help deliver powerful hydration to the skin in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid serums keep the skin soft, supple, firm, and moisturized, which help prevent breakouts and signs of aging on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is safe for even the most sensitive of skin types, making it a popular ingredient for many skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instantly plump fine lines while reducing the appearance of wrinkles gradually&lt;br /&gt;Add intense moisture to dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Instant glowing complexion&lt;br /&gt;Improve appearance of dark under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;Safe for all skin types including sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good serum. I have used it for a while now and can really tell a difference in how my pores on my cheeks look and how soft and lively my face looks. My pores have become less noticeable and the dark circles are almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I received this product 3 weeks ago and thought I&#x27;d give it a try before I write a review. Well, after just a week I noticed that my pores were becoming smaller and the fine lines were becoming finer (if that&#x27;s even a word). I&#x27;ve tried other products before with no visible results, so I am very pleased. It goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t sticky, and has a nice faint smell. I love the way it makes my skin smooth and soft. One pump will cover one side of my face, so a little product goes a long way. I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed, so I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding customer service: I received an email the day after my order was placed on Amazon. Then, after I received the product I received another email making sure the product arrived and that I was satisfied. I don&#x27;t believe I have EVER had that kind of service when I&#x27;ve order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> very good product. highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time tonight.  I like it so far.  My skin felt softer moments after I applied it.  Excited to see what happens over the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> Really nice &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; but more like a serum. Not greasy at all. Goes on nicely. Too soon to judge the anti-aging effect but I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now. Wanted to try it for a week before I left a comment. My face looks so much softer and younger. I can see the difference in the mirror. I have allergies and am always concerned about the smell. It does not bother my allergies at all. My skin is oily and it does not make it any more oily. I have been looking for something to make my face look better without making it more oily. Most anti-aging products make my face real oily. I would highly recommend this product. It is well worth the money. The packaging is real pretty. Looks like a very expensive product! Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an email the day after I purchased the product giving some key tips on the product and another one later to make sure I received the product and if there was any problems with it. I have never had customer service like that.</li>
    <li> This came highly recommended by two different Dr. sources for Health Products and when Dr. Oz put his seal of approval on it I just had to try it!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a Week now and I love the way it goes on my Face!  It absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky film like so many Moisturizers and it has not clashed with my other Moisturizers that I&#x27;ve been using for more matured Skin!  It does make my Skin feel Smooth and lifted!  Thank you for such a great Product which I will be ordering again as soon as it&#x27;s gone but I&#x27;m told it should last for about 3 Months!...Mahalo Nui Loa, Nicky</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try this.  I&#x27;ve been reading about the great results others are having.  I have Dr. Charles Livingston to thank for turning me on to this product.  I think I&#x27;ll ask Santa Clause for this in my stocking!!!! 😉</li>
    <li> Received the product promptly and was impressed with the follow up emails I received.  I love how the products absorbs with no residue. Unable to detect any results due to the short time I have been using the product.  I can say a little of this product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I got this serum at a discount price to exchange my unbiased review. I have been using this for 3 weeks now, it is a light serum, not heavy, very easy to massage into the skin and absorb quickly. The smell is light and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I like the feeling when I put it on, it makes my skin so soft and smooth. This serum claims that it can be used on eyes and face, which is a plus for me. I can just bring one bottle on the trip for my whole face. It&#x27;s a pretty big bottle (50ml), and it will last a while. Plus, I love the ingredient, all natural.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is crazy good too. They make sure that I am satisfied with the serum. They stand behind their product. You will never regret to get it.</li>
    <li> I had some irritations after I used it, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s I got very sensitive skin or what, but I&#x27;ve stopped using it after few tries.</li>
    <li> I really love most aspects of this product  I&#x27;ve seen rapid results---lines diminished, dark spots nearly gone---and I use it with a 2 mm derma roller, for MUCH  faster results.  Bottle is lovely, but I would just as soon have it in a baggie to save some $$$, as I am buying the product  inside.  Packaging is immaterial.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it, at this point...unless or until I run into.a similar product with LESS additives and/or ingredients----especially the lavender fragrance..  I would much prefer no fragrance at all, or the natural ones emitted from any truly necessary ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Overall.....good stuff!!</li>
    <li> My skin becomes too dry</li>
    <li> Love this product, the amazing service of it&#x27;s speedy delivery was a first, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!  My face feels so smooth and soft, with only the use of 1 pump for my whole face and neck twice per day.  I plan to continue ordering this product when I run out!</li>
    <li> Great full size we&#x27;ll worth the price and they ship very fast</li>
    <li> works very well i love it my skin love this product...for those who wanna skin whiouth bottox i suggest Hyaluronic Acid serum</li>
    <li> Dark spots are less visible!!!!  It also helps when I am having acne, it seems that it prevents it from breaking out.</li>
    <li> This product did not make my skin feel nourished...it felt dry. The packaging was nice though.</li>
    <li> Started doing Micro Needling in my spa and used this product on my clients...fantastic!! The skin is left smooth, more even toned and hydrated. Healing time is quick and skin looks great. Compared to other more expensive HA serums, this product is not just cheaper but gives if not the same then a better result. I love it and would definitely continue to use it and highly recommend it to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Used it for a month now, almost every other day or so.&lt;br /&gt;I forget to use it otherwise I would apply it nightly.&lt;br /&gt;Tightens your skin after application and feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;Have to follow up with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my neck, hoping the tightening effect will work on my neck lines.&lt;br /&gt;So far I haven&#x27;t noticed much differences.&lt;br /&gt;Will try to use it regularly, hoping to see better results!&lt;br /&gt;No allergic reactions and has a faint pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I felt absort fast, and used pretty good.</li>
    <li> Great value considering all that it has done for my skin.  It&#x27;s perfect as a primer under my BB cream. I&#x27;ve seen noticeable reduction of the fine lines on my forehead and eyes, reduces eye puffiness and seems to reduce, at least the appearance, of sagging skin on my neck and chin areas.  I have extremely sensitive skin and has not caused any breakouts or irritation.  A little goes a long way.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> **Negative: the pump doesn&#x27;t work..** I ordered it  a couple months ago. I was looking for something that would take away my imperfections. Smile signs, forehead wrinkles, &amp;  under eye bags etc. Hands Down best product that I&#x27;ve used! (:  I use it every morning in my routine. I&#x27;m happy with my results &amp; I got my money&#x27;s worth(:</li>
    <li> I love Hyaluronic Acid Serum product.  I have ordered it twice.  It is moist and it peels away dead skin cells and brown spots from years of too much sun.  I see fine lines slowly disappearing, especially around the mouth and eyes.</li>
    <li> I got a sample at an event for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  Gonna stock up.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this products. It goes on smooth and makes her skin soft. After a week, she could see noticeable change in her skin. Like I said, it is softer, but some of the age lines are gone or fading already. She will continue to use the product and expects more great improvements. My wife is Filipino and they have a darker tint to their skin. She likes how this product takes some of that darker tint out of her face. It doesn&#x27;t make her white looking, but makes her look like she wants to look. Great product that both of us are happy she was able to try.</li>
    <li> On most mornings and also evenings before I go to bed, I like to follow a routine of washing my face very well and then applying vitamin C serum, followed by hyaluronic acid. Ageless is not a sticky or thick gel. It smooths onto my skin and is very easily absorbed. It isn&#x27;t really scented. It has never caused any irritation or dryness on my skin. I also always follow with a good facial moisturizer which I think makes these types of serums work even better, but maybe that is just my own opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, since I do like hyaluronic acid, but it did not do anything different from any of the other hyaluronic acid serums that I have tried in the past. It is just packaged in a prettier bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid, in general, is really good for the skin. It does help reduce many of the visible signs of aging. I have been using it in combination with Vitamin C off and on for several months and have noticed a dramatic change in the appearance of my skin. My skin is firmer, it is smoother, it is clearer too. I plan on using products like this one for years to come because I would love to keep my skin looking healthy and glowing.</li>
    <li> If you read my post or follow me socially you know that I recently gave my first negative review. I must confess it was really hard to do because I know people make mistakes, shipping mishaps happen, and things change. But you see I guard my word and honor very carefully. I make sure to partner with businesses, people, and services that bring forth nothing but the best affordable reliable luxuries. But as a new beauty blogger I too make mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see I agreed to review some products to grow my beauty voice, to build professional relationships, and to showcase some great variety. Like that of the Thera Vita products. I have reviewed three of their products. Including the Thera Vita Thera Relief  and the There Vita Paradise Pure Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. One as you may know did not go so well and the Thera Relief was a hit. Now today I bring you the Ageless by Thera Vita. A hyaluronic acid serum enriched with Vitamin C, D, E, and A nutrients to boost collagen building and hydration. Paraben-Free, amazing ingredients, and proudly made in the USA. So needless to say I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly was it my product? You see I thought I was getting Ageless Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Organic Herbal Infusion. Like seen in my review here [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I received was Ageless Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Aloe &amp; Lavender Oil. As pictured now here on Amazon. Was it the same product? Similar product, new face, new packaging, and new label? The problem with that is who are you? Are you a established company? Are you a true presence, true brand, or are you just getting your feet wet with no directions? How can you showcase a product your not sure of? And most importantly how can I back that? You see I am all for new businesses, new innovations, and small business but I am also for backing a business who backs theirs products, services, beliefs, and employees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So unfortunately I find myself at a crossroads. Do I recommend this product? To be honest I am not sure. You see I don&#x27;t recommend this product today but I believe this company is on the right track. I believe they need to restructure some things, build a solid product line, and build a solid voice and I am willing to share that voice when they do. Until then I will keep a eye on the brand to see what direction they go and revisit with them in the future.am not sure.

    <li> Best  anti-aging gel I have ever tried. I just love it and I intend to keep using it.</li>
    <li> My face is losing its wrinkly look.</li>
    <li> I knew that only using this product for just a few weeks, I could not expected to see a dramatic change (like making me ageless), but I found the product to be efficient at moisturizing and making me skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Great product. It makes my skin feel soft and clean. Will recommend to friend and family.</li>
    <li> This feels great and hopefully is helping. I will buy it again since it is better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I returned from my morning visit with my dermatologist and she was shocked by the severity of the hives. Thankfully, the redness died down slightly after two days, but the bumpiness is still there, as well as a rougher skin texture. I gave her the bottle of serum so that it can be tested in her clinical lab, along with an allergy test for me. Hopefully this will pinpoint exactly what ingredient caused this allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2: On the issue of lavender: A simple Google search will tell you that lavender is phototoxic and cytotoxic, but my boyfriend&#x27;s sister, a licensed esthetician, confirmed these problems I outlined about lavender in a facial serum. If you choose not to believe this, use it at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW: Terrible, terrible, terrible--would not recommend to anyone. The packaging is wonderful, and it smells great, but the product itself gave me a miserable allergic reaction and contains LAVENDER which is toxic to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I am an frequent user of hyaluronic acid serums and think that it&#x27;s a great addition to any skin care routine--even to those with sensitive skin--because it helps your skin absorb moisture better, thus makes any moisturizer a lot more effective. However, I had many different problems with Ageless, and I&#x27;ll outline them below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. As with most essential oils, lavender oil is widely known to be a skin irritant. It&#x27;s a beautiful fragrance and is nice for potpourri or aromatherapy, but it does NOT belong on the skin. There is still lots of research being done on lavender&#x27;s effects on skin cells, but one thing we know for certain is that it is highly phototoxic, meaning it reacts strongly to sunlight, which could lead to hyperpigmentation and inflammation. It can also by cytotoxic, meaning it is actually harmful to skin cells themselves, causing additional damage and potentially scarring. I love lavender--it&#x27;s a very soothing scent--but it truly does not belong in a skin care product, especially not in a facial serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Take a look at the ingredients list and you can see there are a plethora of other synthetic chemicals in this product that make it even worse. I&#x27;m not a stickler for \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; products, but obviously, the less synthetic ingredients, the less harmful effects they can have on your skin. Among the ingredients is also sodium hydroxide (NaOH) which is a very, very strong alkaline base. It has a very high pH, which makes it just as harmful as a strong acid. I would never, ever suggest putting it on your skin, even in small quantities. Bases strip your face of its natural pH-acidic oils (think back to high school chemistry: acid + base &#x3D; neutral) which can lead to permanent erosion and damage to your skin. It&#x27;s like putting bleach on your skin--a huge no-no!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The texture was the worst I&#x27;ve tried in a serum. Usually HA serums are slightly gelatinous and goopy, but they&#x27;re very smooth and fluid. Thera Vita Ageless was super clumpy, like some sort of coagulated gel, and therefore very hard to spread all over my face. I was not a fan of the consistency and appearance; serums should be smooth and spreadable, and this one was neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did manage to spread it out as best as possible (granted, I had to wipe away some of the clumps that wouldn&#x27;t break apart), yes, it made my skin extremely soft and helped absorb my moisturizer better, just like hyaluronic acid should, BUT it also made my face red and splotchy. The effects were almost immediate and I could feel the irritation right upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I used this for the first time at night. When I woke up in the morning, my face was quite sticky and still irritated (despite applying moisturizer over it, as I am supposed to do). Ageless is definitely not hypoallergenic, because my face was covered in hives: red, bumpy, rash-like irritation that was hot to the touch. I clearly had an allergic reaction to it, with visible symptoms just within its first use. I have waited more than 30 hours and the hives are still there and the skin on my face has hardened (still bumpy and red, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not just a product I won&#x27;t be using again; it&#x27;s a product I&#x27;m throwing out immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: I received a complimentary sample of this anti-aging serum from Thera Vita in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions--positive or otherwise--and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.and the hives are still there and the skin on my face has hardened (still bumpy and red, too).

    <li> I am in Aw with this product. It works so well and helps my skin feels great and rejuvenated and healthy. It is one of the best products out there. I have also shared it with my mother and she loves it also.</li>
    <li> This stuff is actually working nicely according to my mother in law! Bought her this for her birthday, she was skeptical at first, I saw all these good reviews and well I thought I could let her try it, turns out, she likes it, and I finally got her a present she appreciates! :D I&#x27;m not too positive on the specifics of this, but she told me it is working and she likes it so I think I did good buying this product!</li>
    <li> Smell good n feel good when applied on the face. I have combination skin type. I notice that after using it for several days, it does keep my skin moisture. I don&#x27;t need to re-apply day/night cream like I used to.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet, have to use it a little longer to see any results, will let you know later!!</li>
    <li> I like the smell and feel comfortable after use.  I feel skin more smooth and hydrate.  Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> excellent serum I wear it everyday and has such a pleasant scent I cant get enough of it. I am very happy with my purchase and results I will definitely purchase again. This is a must have product for any woman. you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Too early to see any results.  Ok for my skin.  Will have to wait and see.</li>
    <li> This product is great so far.  As a Certified Health Coach, I&#x27;m always skeptical of products like this, but decided to give it a try.  The ingredients are natural, (which is very important to me because so many products like this contain unhealthy and unnatural chemicals), the smell is great and I love the way if feels on my skin.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> After a week of use I did see a tiny bit of improvement but of course, I don&#x27;t expect miracles to happen overnight. I like to use a scrub on my face and rinse off with a microfiber cloth to get the dull skin off so this serum can seep in better. Two pumps is good enough for my whole face and neck. My skin gets a little dry afterwards so I follow with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like the smell even though some review says it bother them. But i found it&#x27;s very nice .</li>
    <li> My pores actually looked bigger.  I think I&#x27;m in the wrong age range for this product.  I read that after I purchased.  I&#x27;m sure this is fabulous for some over 40.</li>
