<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product and was shipped fast. Thank you</li>
    <li> My husband didn&#x27;t care for this.  Went back to Freedent.</li>
    <li> The only tooth cream I have used that works.  So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Lasts for me about 8 hours.... Not as strong a hold as&lt;br /&gt;Advertised... Also leave a film&lt;br /&gt;On&lt;br /&gt;My&lt;br /&gt;Plate that needs&lt;br /&gt;To be cleaned daily.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re always happy with our purchase of Secure. Since switching from Polygrip, we haven&#x27;t looked back. It works well and Grandma doesn&#x27;t have to cover the entire denture to get it to hold. (Even holds through meals, which her former products didn&#x27;t). Never going back to anything else.</li>
    <li> Throw your Polident and all that other goo out the window! Secure Denture cream is by the far the best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market. It works even on a hard to hold lower plate.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> I continue to purchase this product and have been using it for over a year. This seems to work best for me. I would recommend all who wear dentures try it. The most important issue in wearing dentures is to make sure they fit properly. Using any adhesive, creams, powders or pads all depends on how your dentures fit.</li>
    <li> Basically the same as Fixodent or Polident that you can buy in your local stores</li>
    <li> Works better than any other brand</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a couple years. No zinc, and great adhesive!</li>
    <li> Good price and shipped fast. One of the adhesive that&#x27;s works for me</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best adhesive I have ever used. I will never buy anything else. I can get 2 full days out of 1 application.</li>
    <li> Finally something that holds and works as claimed. Awesome product....</li>
    <li> Almost impossible to get off dentures.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than adhesives from drug store.</li>
    <li> Good product, great hold, and long lasting</li>
    <li> This is the best denture adhesive on the market. Can&#x27;t find it in stores but it works for up to 10 hours.</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery.  thank you.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time and works great.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It doesn&#x27;t hold twelve hours.  I still had to re-adhere for dinner.  But the worse part of it is it left a build up of residue behind.  Even Polident couldn&#x27;t break through the residue.  The residue builds up very quickly and there were even little black spots below the surface? After four or five days I stopped using it and went back to my regular stuff... the name escapes me at the moment, I continued with the Polident and nightly cleaning with dish soap.  After a week everything was back to normal, thankfully.</li>
    <li> I am still experimenting w/ different denture adhesives and so far this one holds the longest. Its only drawback is that it takes time to get it out at night. Yes I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there. got the 4 pack why not.</li>
    <li> Great product holds my dentures better than any other adhesive out there. Last all day long. Would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a strong hold for their dentures. It&#x27;s a great value also.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works best for me. Longer lasting hold than the other adhesives. Shipped quickly and was cheaper than other sellers. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE, SHE DID NOT LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> Service from the company was really great. Fast and the product arrived well protected with good and minimal packaging. Still trying to figure out how to get a full day of use out of one application. For 12 hours I am having to use 2 to 3 applications which makes this product way to expensive to use so I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> It  burned my mouth &amp; tried for a few days. The burning just got worse. I  think the product could be bad news for other users.&lt;br /&gt;Johnnie</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new denture wearer and had tried 7 other denture products and none of them worked.  I found Secure and I like it.  It&#x27;s trial and error how much to use.  Too much it melts and feels slimy. Too little and it just doesn&#x27;t work. So you have to play around to get the right amount for you.  Some reviews said it&#x27;s hard to remove from the mouth. For me, if it feels like a lot I remove what I can with a gauze pad, then I use my water pic (permanently hooked up to the bathroom sink (by Glacier, I think))on a strong setting and it washes it right out. Even if it&#x27;s a small amount left in my mouth I use the water pic because it&#x27;s so easy. I remove all I can from the denture with gauze pads (4x4), scraping out as much as I can, then wash the denture with a denture brush and soap until it no longer feels slippery with my finger.  Then I put it in a warm water vibration jewelry cleaner which automatically runs for 4 minutes. In the morning I run it again for another 4 minutes. Then rinse and dry with a micro cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the right amount of Secure a couple of times and it gets very frustrating.  But, I can&#x27;t get my teeth back so I have to keep practicing until I know the right amount to use.  When it works it&#x27;s great!! I hope this helps someone. I don&#x27;t know anyone with dentures and my dentist never even told me about pastes to use so I felt I was all alone in the dark. So, if you&#x27;re in the dark, I hopes this helps to bring a little light to your life.</li>
    <li> Does NOT hold as stated..very \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; and loose after the first bite or swallow no matter how long you wait after applying...will not purchase again</li>
    <li> This was supposed to help with my dry mouth and it made it worse and left a bad taste in my mouth. I threw it away!</li>
    <li> Works somewhat better than Fixodent for my bottom dentures.  My husband uses it as well and likes it. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very fast and it works very well. The taste is not great but after leaving the denture in cold water over night it was gone.</li>
    <li> My Mom feels secure when using this product.  Her teeth stay in place.</li>
    <li> Secure is the best, hands down, of any denture adhesive. I put it in at 7 am and it is still holding tight at midnight.  If this product is ever discontinued, I will find every tube I can and stockpile it.</li>
    <li> Forget all the other products you used. The pads, powders, and dental glues that break down and melt all over your mouth, and make you gag and swallow who knows what. I can see why some women don&#x27;t like to swallow! The slimy goo that Fixodent and the others break down to, is disgusting and maybe harmful. So, finally, someone invents a product that not only holds like the dentures are bolted in, but there&#x27;s no messy residue in the mouth to spit out. This stuff works so good, I&#x27;m able to eat anything. I did what it said, and I put just 3 drops on the lower and then took a small empty ink pen case, which works well as it fits good, and smear it around the inside. I waited 30 seconds, then put them in, and they are very secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I just called the biggest store chain in my state, which is Fred Meyers, and asked, no demanded, that they get this stuff. They were very excited, and were thinking that maybe it&#x27;s only available online. So, I called the 800 number for Bioforce and spoke to a lovely lady, (don&#x27;t know, but I just do}, and she said it was not in big stores yet, like Walmart, because the big companies like Fixodent, which is owned by Proctor and Gamble, have been fighting to keep it out! They are afraid of people discovering this product, as it will hurt the sales of their lousy product, that melts in your mouth, and makes you spend more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lady didn&#x27;t tell me all that, but she did say the big companies were \\&quot;making it hard to get into the big chain stores\\&quot;. Well, guess what. This is America, and if someone invents a better mousetrap, then we have the right to buy it. And some Australian dentist invented this product, and he probably refused to sell the patent to the giant P+G, and so they are making it hard for him to sell. This stuff works so much better then their stuff that it HAS to be sold to the public and not just online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Fred Meyer store back, and told them to call Bioforce as they wanted to do a deal with them to sell it. So, hopefully in the next few months Fred Meyer will have it. They already sell Cushion Grip, which is another great product thats hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe by the time I run out of this tube, my store will have it. I also, just wrote to Winco Foods to ask them to sell it. It&#x27;s only right that people be given the best product out there. And, it&#x27;s criminal when the huge companies like Proctor and Gamble try to stop it from happening. This adhesive is the best made, bar none. And, I&#x27;m sure the lab boys at the big companies are working hard to steal the formula. For now, this is the only one I want.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried just about everything.  This stuff is fantastic!  I&#x27;m still wearing the temporary (or immediate) dentures with a soft lining applied by the dentist&#x27;s office.  I have about a month left before I get my permanent dentures.  This works great my temporaries!  I apply it in the morning at about 7:00, following the instructions.  I use the tip of my finger to spread the cream slightly, wait about 30 seconds, then place the dentures in my mouth, applying pressure for a few seconds.  I don&#x27;t eat or drink anything for about a half hour after putting the dentures in.  My teeth are nice and secure all day.  I have been able to eat and drink anything I want without a problem.  After eating, I usually rinse my mouth lightly with water, then use a soft bristle toothbrush with just water to brush the teeth, leaving them in place.  At the end of the day, I remove the dentures usually between 9:30pm and 10:30pm.  They&#x27;re still tight enough that I have to get a good grip and rock them loose.  I use a denture brush and an anti-bacterial hand soap with warm water to clean them, and rinse them well.  I use a regular soft bristle toothbrush and toothpaste to clean my gums and mouth (the same toothpaste the rest of the family uses, although I have found the Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste works well).  It takes about 15 minutes.  (If I had taken care of my natural teeth as well as I take care of my dentures, I might not be needing dentures now!)  I then soak the dentures in a denture bath container with plain water overnight.  The next morning, I replace the water in the denture bath with warm water and add a Secure Denture Cleanser tablet and let them soak for about a half hour while I do my morning exercises.  Then rinse well and start the process over again.  The denture  cleanser removes any residue left over from the cream.  I highly recommend this product and the Secure Denture Cleanser tablets to anyone that has trouble finding something that works.  This is a little more expensive than many other brands, but for me, it&#x27;s well worth the extra cost.  Clean up isn&#x27;t any more difficult than any of the other products.  It might not work for everyone, but it sure works for me.</li>
    <li> It has a immediate holding power but it only will hold for about 30 minutes.  You are almost better off using standard adhesive it is less expensive.  this product is very much over blown in your advertisement.. There is nothing in your reviews to tell you to  put the tube in hot water prior to trying to get it from the tube</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not water based like Poligrip and Fixodent so it last all day and not a few hours like the other two. This product saves me a lot of aggravation when dealing with Dentures</li>
    <li> I recommended Secure to my Dentist, it works great, a lot better than the other ones that you purchase at the store!</li>
    <li> Best denture cream ever! Recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I got it for a very good price and even though I didn&#x27;t pay for next day delivery, I still got it the day after I ordered it. I will most definitely order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> It works 10 X better then over-the-counter  but wish is was less expensive.</li>
    <li> I FOUND IT TO BE NOT ANY BETTER THAN FIXADENT. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RESULTS FOR THE PRICE!!</li>
    <li> This product works better than some others I tried at first, still could be better. None them last as long as they say they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
    <li> This a product I have used for five years and it is better than other brands.  Stings a bit when first putting on dentures</li>
    <li> The only adhesive I&#x27;ll ever use again.  No other brand keeps my denture so secure and lasts as long.  I can eat just about anything with this.  It&#x27;s well worth the price and inconvenience of not being able to purchase locally.  I LOVE this adhesive!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands and types of bonding agents, but Secure is by far the best.  Hold is great and best of all - NO TASTE!  The only one I use now.</li>
    <li> The best denture adheive I have ever tried.  I do not have 12 more words.  I buy this stuff seeral times as year. and I get tired of these forced revues.</li>
    <li> If holding power is what you require this is the product you need. However, since it is not water soluble you may find the adhesive more difficult to remove prior to reapplication.</li>
    <li> Bad product wasted my money.Doesn&#x27;t work at all.Never ever buy it again.</li>
    <li> Best Stuff on the market.</li>
    <li> I have not realized the anticipated performance. In simple terms, double the cost is not justified.</li>
    <li> Best denture adhesive I&#x27;ve ever found. Not 12 hours, but a good solid 8hrs.</li>
    <li> Burned the H*** out of my mouth.</li>
    <li> Excellent bonding power when first administered to gums, kind of burning sensation at first but well worth it. I use secure denture cleansing tablets to clean off my dentures because of the high alkaline content it leaves no residue on your dentures.</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff I have found</li>
    <li> Far surpasses any other adhesive. Isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; when you take out your dentures. After hearing all of the other rave reviews about cushion grip I tried it. I thought it was terrible! It&#x27;s not an adhesive, but more of a relign. That&#x27;s when I found this stuff, and love it!</li>
    <li> Good product used before purchased direct.</li>
    <li> Secure enables me to wear my partials for most of the day - no other adhesive does that.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for maybe......10 years now and have loved it from the beginning. Well, that is not entirely true. The original product I used was called Fitty Dent... same basic product with the exception that it is not available in the US as far as I know. The Secure is the American version of the Fitty Dent. It seems to me that the non American version was a bit better than this one. The only problem is the only place I could find it was in Australia and the shipping was well over $50.00 USD. If there is any way to get fitty dent in the US I would be a customer for life of the company that did it. Anyway this is the best product in the US that is available to hold dentures.... especially lower dentures. Good stuff and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best denture adhesive I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Not much better then what he got at store.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as stated!!</li>
    <li> Mom said it worked great for upper dentures but not lower.  She does not want implants so we were hoping this would work.  Will keep trying to find something.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product, would recommed it to anyone in need of denture cream! U will see the difference from anything u can purchase in a store.</li>
    <li> Secure is the best denture cream I have found to hold my lower plate in place all day. I have tried every adhesive available and Secure works so well I sometimes have trouble removing it at night. I can have lunch and dinner with my plate in and never have one problem with my plate coming loose while eating. A few tricks I&#x27;ve learned--you have to follow the directions exactly or you will end up with a gooey mess like fixodent and polygrip. It says to wait 15 minutes after inserting your denture before eating or drinking--I&#x27;ve discovered that is the bare minimum amount of time. I&#x27;ve found the best results I get are when I wait 30 mins, that really gives the adhesive time to set. Make sure you denture is completely dry if I&#x27;m in a hurry I&#x27;ll use my blow dryer for a few seconds just to make sure it&#x27;s dry. After I apply the adhesive to my denture I take a washcloth and dry my gums right before I put them in. With the cap on you should squeeze the tube and \\&quot;mix\\&quot; up the adhesive as I think it tends to seperate some after it&#x27;s been used a few times. I figured this out when I realized I got fantastic hold with a newer tube but the adhesive from the older tubes wasn&#x27;t holding as well. Since I&#x27;ve started squishing the older tubes before use I haven&#x27;t had any problems and the adhesive works just as well as it does from a new tube. To remove them after they&#x27;ve been in all day get some hot water hold it in your mouth as long as you can spit it out then start working to loosen up the denture. You may need to use the hot water trick a few times to get it completely loose. Also when you remove your denture all of the adhesive may not come off--don&#x27;t worry just soak your plate in water overnight and the next morning all the remaining adhesive comes right off. This may seem like a lot of work but once you get the true Secure hold you won&#x27;t mind the extra steps because having your plate that tight in your mouth is worth every ounce of effort you put into it.</li>
    <li> This product makes all the other brands obsolete!!!  It is a super product, with super hold.  I followed the directions per a You-Tube video: a thin evenly spread layer over the entire denture, hold in place for a minute or so, and forget about it!!!  Got rid of all the other products and am now worry free about my denture hold.  At night a rinse with warm water, a side to side wiggle and my dentures break free.  Highly recommend you give this super product a try!!!!</li>
    <li> Good  product . It works.</li>
    <li> Love this adhesive, it holds all day. Just remember a little goes a long way. The best way I have found to apply it is in a thin layer all over the denture, take a drink of water to moisten your mouth. Make sure the denture is completely dry before applying though or you will have a mess.</li>
    <li> Best product- and food grade. Probably one of the safest products. Extremely good hold, water proof as well. A little more expensive than other products, but well worth the extra cost. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Price was very good/shipping was a little longer than i am use to but overall it was worth it/I would do business with them again</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without Secure. Don&#x27;t understand why this product is not available in ever store. The only retail place that I have seen this at is Sprouts.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Excessive shipping costs.</li>
    <li> While this product works, it certainly doesn&#x27;t work better than other denture creams and it&#x27;s much harder to clean your dentures after use.  For me, it&#x27;s not worth the hassle. I will neither recommend, nor condemn the product. It&#x27;s a matter of personal choice. I just didn&#x27;t find it to be the superior product it was advertised to be.</li>
    <li> One application last all day;  this is the best denture adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used.  Would recommend this to any one using full dentures.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any adhesive that would keep my dentures in for a whole day.  This product to me is a miracle. I can sometimes even sleep with my dentures!! It saved me the embarrassment of have my teeth drop down!</li>
    <li> Nothing works better, you cant go wrong using this product</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product, it works better then any of the denture cream that are available at our local stores.... but would like one that is a little stronger. They all come loose while eating, but with Secure it lasts the longest....</li>
    <li> Set my gums on fire and took 2 days without using it for the tenderness to leave. Sure wish I didn&#x27;t buy the 3 pack.</li>
    <li> Works as stated will order again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fixodent in the past and with the good reviews, thought to try secure. I don&#x27;t seem to like it as when removing my upper denture, the glue sticks to the roof of my mouth. This is not pleasant to remove. It has a chemical taste also.</li>
    <li> None of these work well but this is better than most it does not hold for 12 hours I might get 3 to 4</li>
    <li> Product is better than the leading brands, but I expected more from the reviews from youtube ,etc. Its doesn&#x27;t last as long as advertised</li>
    <li> The best adhesive on the market.  My wife will use nothing else.  Does not contain potentially harmful ingredients that national brands often do.</li>
    <li> It is the best cream for keeping dentures tight and in place.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product many times and each time it holds fine for about two hours and my dentures are loose again.  It does not even come close to the products sold across the counter at drug stores.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t purchase mine here at Amazon, but directly through Secure. So my review is for the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the short version,  5 stars! Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It would be fair to say I&#x27;m very new at all this.  I just had all my teeth extracted and temps put in 3 weeks ago. But I&#x27;m not so sure my gripes about adhesives will change too much. Still, I think fair to point out as some of my issues may be resolved once I&#x27;m fully healed. I&#x27;m still  in that rapid shrinkage stage right now where they fit perfect today and 2 days later loose again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited one week after extractions before using adhesives. I started with Fixodent Food Seal and it worked OK, but I always had issues cleaning it up. There always seemed to be a slimy mess left over that took a bit to get rid of. Especially on the roof of my mouth. Really nasty.&lt;br /&gt;Now this perhaps may be better when 100% healed, I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the Powder and it  was a lot better in the clean up regard. After removing my Dentures there was a bit of a slimy mess, but cleaned up fairly easily for the most part. . It also held very well ..  well sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like the food seal, all was fine until I ate. At that point my Dentures would start moving around and getting loose again. It was time to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Secure, and WOW what a difference.  I got a tube of regular and the sensitive. I didn&#x27;t get the tingly sensation that some mention with either version. Not sure why some do and some don&#x27;t though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any count, my dentures really stay in and don&#x27;t move with this stuff. And best of all, Eating doesn&#x27;t seem to loosen the hold and&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get any food under them either! I&#x27;m not experienced enough yet to learn to control my dentures with my mouth so this is a HUGE help for me right now.&lt;br /&gt;As far as clean up you might have some on your gums but it comes off very easy &amp; cleanly. Another big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it holds very well, and starts to loosen up after about 8-10 hrs or so. But still lasts me around 12 hrs though.  Also, a little goes a long way. Once it gets wet it expands and fills in any gaps/hold that may be there. So it gets full contact and keeps food/drinks out from under your dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it best to apply as you normally would, then spread it out all over the backside of the denture. Take a drink of water to ensure your mouth is good and wet and put them in.&lt;br /&gt;For those that mentioned it sticking to your finger and not coming off, try keeping your finger wet.  You want the denture dry obviously when you apply it, but keep your finger wet. It will come right off with a paper towel then as it doesn&#x27;t stick well to a wet surface..... which makes me curious how it holds your dentures to your gums so well... Hmmm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, Great product.ell, and starts to loosen up after about 8-10 hrs or so. But still lasts me around 12 hrs though.  Also, a little goes a long way.

    <li> It is very difficult to apply a small amount with the size of the tip.  It tends to give you dry mouth.  Hard to remove from teeth.</li>
    <li> Best adhesive I&#x27;ve used, but it last only four hours rather than twelve as advertised. At four hours this adhesive begins to dissolve in my mouth and feels like others I&#x27;ve used. Cleans up very easily and not like I have read, difficult to remove from mouth and dentures. I will continue to use this until I find a better one.</li>
    <li> This is the only adhesive that holds my dentures. It has no taste and is waterproof , unlike all the rest.</li>
    <li> love this product! best on the market</li>
    <li> Denture bond works great for me until I can save up enough money to have my dentist fix the problem</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best Denture Adhesive I have found. It&#x27;s all natural &amp; holds really good for 12 hours, like it ad vertices. But her like I did &amp; you will save a lot of money. Thank you. Maria</li>
    <li> I purchased the 4 pack, to date I have used 1.It might work for some, but not for me. I went back to Incident complete.</li>
    <li> does not hold as promised.  same hold as with other denture adhesives, but much harder to clean off.  it became \\&quot;gluey\\&quot; as quickly as the others... not sure how \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; it can be if it still got messy/gluey after a cup of water or tea (waited an hour before drinking)  I followed instructions, used blow-dryer to make sure they were dry, used sparingly, etc., etc.  no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was SO hoping this was going to be different.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;funny thing tho... harder than heck to get off your finger if you need to clean up a spot on the denture.</li>
    <li> Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit!!  I am 3 months post extraction and had a soft reline done a month ago. My top plate is horribly loose and I have tried everything on the market.  Polygrip, fixodent, cushion grip, ect. Nothing was really top notch. I haven&#x27;t had steak in almost 4 months because my teeth would come out. I finally ate steak tonight after putting Secure on my top plate and partial bottom. Ive had it in for 6 hours so far with no problems. We will see how it does the rest of the evening. I will post an update in the morning. As far as my bottom partial is concerned... Absolutely nothing helped.  Until now. It didn&#x27;t even budge. If you follow the directions it&#x27;s great. No burning sensation at all. I bought the cleaning tablets as well and they work great. I will be a Secure customer from now on. No going back for me!!!</li>
    <li> Secure is superior to any other adhesive I have tried.  Having a full top denture and my natural teeth on bottom since 2 months ago, this has been an adventure! Going the traditional route, waiting 6 weeks to heal, it should fit perfect, right? Wrong. Very loose even with adjustments, they rock and no &amp;quot; natural suction&amp;quot; is going to hold them. I&#x27;ve tried the relines, and the top 2 water-soluable adhesives, along with the discontinued cushion grip,( had found a tube at cvs). Nothing worked and the adhesive didn&#x27;t hold up to much water, not mention nasty slimy. I read about Secure online, ordered it, and WOW. It works!  Made of natural ingredients and NO ZINC, is a bonus PLUS not water soluable.  If you buy this, DEFINATELY buy the secure cleanser tablets along with it.  If not, it&#x27;s difficult to get residue removed from denture!  Now, this product WILL SWELL, throughout the day, and it will feel a little spongey under there, and you may get a little oozing from the back of palate area, and think it&#x27;s coming loose.  NOT. When it comes time to take it out, it&#x27;s still VERY SECURE. This product FAR SURPASSES any other I have tried!!  Now, I&#x27;ve NOT tried eating corn on the cob, or an apple, or steak, but I am a avid gum chewer ( yes, I can chew Extra brand), and I can eat nuts, and a large variety of foods! Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.  And it is not any more expensive than the ones available in the stores! The denture cleanser is a little bit more, but you need a higher ph with this adhesive to dissolve it.  I have tried a STRONG baking soda solution, and it works to a point, but not like the cleanser tabs. Secure is also not easy to remove from the roof of mouth BUT if you&#x27;ve tried the top creams from the store, you know they are a slimy, gag you, difficult mess to remove also.  Secure is easily removed with ( you&#x27;re going to this this is weird), a teaspoon. Just take it and gently pull the tip of it across your gumline and roof of mouth and wipe into tissue, repeat. I follow up with a baking soda solution mouthwash, and regular brushing.  I DO wish SECURE offered a mouthwash that helped remove the product from the roof and gums. But not yet.epeat. I follow up with a baking soda solution mouthwash, and regular brushing.  I DO wish SECURE offered a mouthwash that helped remove the product from the roof and gums. But not yet.</li>
    <li> Ever since I stumbled on Secure in a mom and pop pharmacy I have been a customer. I am in the process of having extensive dental work done which includes wearing removable dentures. As my gums have changed, I have needed to &amp;#34;secure&amp;#34; my dentures and tried every mass market product out there. SECURE lives up to the hype! Worth every penny. I really do feel secure when I use this product</li>
    <li> Not nearly as &amp;#34;Secure&amp;#34; as advertised, but better than Fixodent and Polygrip.</li>
    <li> This product definitely lives up to it&#x27;s promises.Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  It&#x27;s the best of the creams and jels for holding in dentures.  I use it in conjunction with a powder to get all day holding power on my dentures.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Use it once in the morning and your dentures are SECURE all day long... Recommended by my dentist, SECURE does not disappoint. Try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> It is OK. Polygrip which I just got is better. Secure burns and doesn&#x27;t hold that well.</li>
    <li> for my mom, her favorite stuff, that works better for her than anything else.</li>
    <li> Best food grade adhesive I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> l mix this with fixodent and it works better but it does discolor and eat away at the denture material.</li>
    <li> found something that actually works. The stuff on the market is full of zinc and dissolves in liquid. How can that hold---it doesn&#x27;t.  This holds very well since I only have to use it 2-3 times a day. Will be using Secure from now on.</li>
    <li> Fixadent is cheaper, can be purchased locally  any where and works just as well. This was a dud for me.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my dad, and he has not  looked back since then, it is a nice product and according to him the only one that works right. he has both top and bottom dentures and he only needs to apply it once a day. hes free to eat and drink with out having to apply more or worrying his teeth will get loose</li>
    <li> I was hoping for better results in providing longer bonding, does not last very long. Trying different amounts to see if that will help. From what reviews I have read on this only use a small amount as it expands with liquid.</li>
    <li> it works great and will buy it again</li>
    <li> This is a very good product holds very well but it has a burning sensation for a few seconds which is a little unnerving when i used it but still worth the price.</li>
    <li> the fact that it is not water soluable seemed to be a huge plus. When used, turned out to be not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping the teeth and mouth clear each nite proved to be a real problem for me. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and didn&#x27;t get any better holding than any other product sold at drugstore. Also made my mouth burn every time I tried to use it.</li>
    <li> Stuff is AWESOME!!!...(Yep...ALWAYS a few MORONS who need instruction...Bottom of a Coke bottle says &amp;#34;open OTHER end&amp;#34;!!!)...VERY simple!!!...DRY gums with paper towel...Just DOTS!!!...MUST be dry...NOT WATER FRIENDLY!!...SEE, It WORKS ONLY when gums are DRY!!!...(MORON!!)...You can still smoke your dope, MORON...JUST make sure your gums are DRY!!...(SINCE, you lost your teeth to METH!!)...For the rest of us...NOTHING works BETTER!!!...2 beers, my teeth were FLOATING!!...(Fixodent!)...NO LONGER!!!...(Takes 8 beers &#x27;till my teeth float!!)...BAD REVIEWS ARE dumb PEOPLE!!...(i cun&#x27;t fIGGER IT OUT!!...i don&#x27;t WANT THEM THERE &amp;#34;FALSE TEETH&amp;#34;!!...i USE MY ONLY TOOTH TO OPEN cans!!!)...oK, Clem...STUFF is AWESOME compared to other stuff out there...TWICE a day!!...COMPARED to 4 times a day!!!...KEY!!!...DRY!!!...NO BETTER stuff!!!...(No, Clem...REMOVE ALL chew FIRST!!!)</li>
    <li> So far (after 2 weeks) this has been the best denture adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve yet to get &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; / &amp;#34;12 hour&amp;#34; adhesion as the packaging claims, but it is close to that and far better than the supermarket name brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Following the instructions carefully helps, as does drying the gums with a tissue just before inserting the dentures.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Well done!  Ordered on Monday...product has already arrived,  and in great condition!  Price was right too!  Will order from again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you!</li>
    <li> may be waterproof but works no better than Fixodent, Polygrip, etc  and doesn&#x27;t even hold as long,  I&#x27;d send it back but it&#x27;s too much trouble</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
    <li> I have had my dentures for two years and this is the first product that has allowed me to eat solid food.  I have had to be extremely careful (especially in public) with my choice of food.  With all of the other adhesives my dentures would pop out of my mouth.  NOT WITH THIS ONE!!  I did have to figure out the correct usage for my denture situation.  If I use too much it gets gooey and if I don&#x27;t use enough it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  However; THIS STUFF WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> Item was received on time as promised and was packaged securely. There is nothing better on the market than Secure bonding cream. There was no problem with the order in any facet. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED IN A VERY GOOD TIMELY MATTER, I HAD NO PROBLEMS</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and excellent price. Will not hesitate to order again. I find this brand, Secure, is the only one that works well for me, especially on the lower dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am still using this product. I have found that this works the best. It has even lasted more than 24 hrs. Another thing I like about this product is that there isn&#x27;t a lot of oozing goop. Although, there might be some...especially if you put a little too much on the denture. It&#x27;s really trial and error to find the right amount. Honestly, with Secure, sometimes less works best. Don&#x27;t give up. Keep trying for a month....eventually you&#x27;ll find what works best for you. Especially for new denture wearers. My dentist gave me my first tube.</li>
    <li> stay away  does not hold</li>
    <li> First of all I should state that I have what is called a flat palate and no ridge bone at the front of my mouth so there is basically no natural retention of my denture at all. I have been using fixodent which does not stick well to my denture, so I have been putting a very thin layer of \\&quot;comfort grip\\&quot; on first, and then putting the Fixodent on top of that. The comfort grip bonds well to my denture and the fixodent seems to bond to the Comfort Grip better than straight to the denture.&lt;br /&gt;So, when I first put this \\&quot;Secure\\&quot; on and put it in my mouth it felt great! There was no goopy stuff oozing out the sides and it made the denture feel as if it were actually stuck to the roof of my mouth. It felt great! Until the first time I tried to eat something. It came loose immedately and I was eating a VERY soft cookie. It was a little bit messy to clean off, but not too bad. If this product would have allowed me to eat it would have been well worth the money and cleanup, but I&#x27;ll have to stick to the Comfort Grip and Fixodent for now. At least with it I can eat soft things and a few slightly harder things. I was so hopeful, but extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the major brands claiming different things..even some from Europe. Powders,pastes,strips.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down easiest and most secure for me. I have uppers and lowers and am new to dentures but did my homework during the process. Keys to making it work 1)dentures must fit,and&lt;br /&gt;2)denture must be dry 3)thin as possible coating.Just like structions say.&lt;br /&gt;Been using since Feb 2012.</li>
    <li> I am very  satisfied and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> My mom was very excited to get this product to help with her lower partial. She did exactly what the packaging said, ensure partial is completely dry, used the proper amount and bite down for 1 minute . She even waited for 30 minutes to take a drink of water. The first bite of soft baked potato, an hour after application, her partial came loose. So, unfortunately we are stuck with 5 tubes of the same old product that doesnt work. Only difference was that this cost $25.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way it stuck to my gums and still did not help retain the denture.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what i was looking for.  Easy to use and not messy.</li>
    <li> no better than any other paste</li>
    <li> After reading some of the other positive reviews for SECURE, I thought this was going to be the solution to getting my lower denture to stay in. It works O.K. through breakfast and sometimes lunch, but then I have to reapply the cream.  I&#x27;ve followed the directions (drying my denture thoroughly and waiting for about a half hour before eating) but it loosens up within a few hours.  Have had my denture now for about six months and it&#x27;s been re-aligned once.</li>
    <li> did not meet the specifications at all...Anything over the counter is better...</li>
    <li> This gives me freedom and a quality that I haven&#x27;t found in other products</li>
    <li> really great denture cream and it holds the dentures very well .. the lower looses a bit after a few hours but the upper holds up for two days</li>
    <li> This was for a friend of mine and after trying several other products he said this was the only product that has helped him. He plans on ordering more.</li>
    <li> Received 6 istead of 4 and 2 bonding creams NO BONDING CREAMS</li>
    <li> Disappointed, will not buy agsin</li>
    <li> great product holds all day</li>
    <li> I have been a denture wearer since young age. despite well fitting dentures have always been disappointed with every product on the market until I tried secure.&lt;br /&gt;a product that holds my dentures in place for 24 plus hours with no mess. clean up is easy between applications. I like the non taste also. this product is clearly above all the rest!</li>
    <li> Received quickly and in good order from vendor.  Still working with Secure, still have hopes and want it to work.&lt;br /&gt;But, thinking I am hoping for miracles, lol!  Had my teeth extracted 7 months ago, and still using my intermediates, which of course, do not fit at all since healing. Humongously too large!  Would have gone for my permanent uppers and lower about 3 months ago, but developed some respiratory issues that have required steroids, and in the past three months have gained 30 lbs, and feel like a stuffed puffy sausage, so holding off my permanents until (hopefully) I get off these steroids and get back to normal size.  So I am trying anything to get these temporary dentures to &#x27;fit&#x27;  Comfort Grip seems to fill in the huge gaps, but then Secure doesn&#x27;t work so well with soft relines (so they say).  Trying now to mix a combo of Secure w/Fixodent as some reviewers have suggested, good for 1/2 day. I&#x27;ll keep trying, but probably will always continue with Secure because of no zinc and natural ingredients.  Will update if I find a solution that will get me thru this temporary situation.</li>
    <li> Tip for those frustrated....use part fixodent (gold) with part secure and will last all day and feels like your natural teeth (almost anyway) as close as you can get!</li>
    <li> Works better than any other product that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping thank you all I can say about this product is it crazy glue for dentures awesome stuff will be buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Not, what I would call , an excellant product on, the market. Secure is the best one out there.I wish something better would come along.</li>
    <li> They say it&#x27;s waterproof,but it&#x27;s not,it does stay in longer</li>
    <li> I have use this adhesive exclusively since I first tried it.  Does the job and is not oozy&lt;br /&gt;and gooey like some others.  Holds for hours.  Is a little difficult to remove the excess&lt;br /&gt;from your dentures, but I can live with that.  The price was very good here.  It was&lt;br /&gt;delivered very quickly.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Item does hold extremely well, however is a little difficult to remove from denture and any left in mouth. Overall very good product.</li>
    <li> Before I tried secure, I was in a pit of never ending despair, and I am not being hyperbolic.  There were days where I would put my dentures in, sit in my car before work and cry about how horrible they felt, how hungry I was, and what a horrible choice I had made.  It didn&#x27;t matter if they were in my mouth or out I was in pain and uncomfortable.  I had been to the denturist more than 10 times to have them adjusted, including 2 soft liners.  Yuck!!, and nothing he could do seemed to make them better.  Then a friend who lives in the UK suggested I try secure.  I had no hope left in my soul that I was ever going to be ok or normal again, but I ordered a tube.  Within 5 minutes of securing my dentures my mouth felt FANTASTIC.  The pain I had been experiencing was gone..my dentures felt natural and comfortable for the first time since getting them.  After about 20 minutes I thought I would try something crazy and attempt to eat..(for 2 months up to this point I had been unable to eat anything that didn&#x27;t come in mush form) low and behold I ate an entire hot pocket.  Granted not the healthiest meal choice, but far from the giant poo sandwich I had been eating since getting my dentures.  I am ecstatic and actually glowing..I have hope for the future and I promise I will never buy another brand of adhesive ever again..I feel like I have gotten my life returned to me..</li>
    <li> I have used Secure before.  I found it to be the best denture cream.  It holds my dentures for 2 days.  I only wish I could buy it in my area</li>
    <li> THE BEST DENTURE ADHESIVE ON THE MARKET, HOLDS LONGER. I FIND IT BETTER THAN THE REST OF THE PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET.</li>
    <li> This stuff is easier to get out of your mouth than polydent and fixodent. It does hold as well as any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Upon having all my teeth pulled, I researched the best denture adhesive. This brand was unknown to my dentist (who may not do a lot of dentures). This is specifically made for lower dentures, which require a much firmer hold. While I have to admit that the removal requires the same awful scraping of the gums to remove the glue, it does hold much better than Fixodent or Polident.</li>
    <li> great product arrived on time  i recommend it to everyone shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in any stores but this brand is better than any available in the stores.</li>
    <li> Supposed to hold for 12 hours. Had to replace glue every two to three hours. Did not make it through a meal without teeth coming loose.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good pricing, excellent packaging and fast shipping. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this dental adhesive.  It is safe and works very well....you do not get the feeling you are killing your insides if it gets ingested.  Leave it to an Austrian, with good health on the mind, to invent this product.  Great price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Now that Cushion Grip is off the market, it is the next best thing. Not bad at all.  I like it.</li>
    <li> this is the only product that holds my dentures in place for an entire day.  I don&#x27;t have to worry.  I can eat almost anything I want to and not worry about loose dentures.</li>
    <li> My dad enjoys this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME! My boyfriend LOVES it. his teeth are new and are still not fit perfectly, so they flop around when he eats. They are not going to do an adjustment for a couple months so we got this adhesive and the reline-it kit to help stabilize the teeth until his fitting and the combo of this stuff and the reline kit have REALLY helped him! we will continue to buy this product, it has at least 8 hours of strong bond after eating and drinking.</li>
    <li> I have tried all different adhesives ... they are normally full of mineral oil products ... this one is by far the very best ... no artificial additives and one needs much less than with other adhesives and the dentures stay as promised ... after 4 weeks I know ... I never will use another one again ... I know Dr. Vogel with other products from Germany and you can be sure, he never would put some nasty stuff in his products ... this company I surely trust ... and the price here is a good offer ...</li>
    <li> This works better than the powder (with zinc) which is a no no from my doctor because of the zinc. MY dentures stay in place more securely than they ever did with the powder and for an amazingly long time by using Secure Bonding cream.</li>
    <li> Its the only one that will work for me and you can&#x27;t buy it any cheaper.</li>
    <li> Always recieved fast and works better than any other dental paste!</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all; by lunch time they were completely loose. I was eating grapes, small crackers and soft cheese with my water. I will not purchase this ever again.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. If anyone has any doubt about this adhesive compared to what they carry in stores then ease your mind. I have been buying it for a year now and try to keep extra. This is the ONLY denture adhesive I will ever use on my lowers. I use powder on my uppers because for me it works better. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> If you where dentures you will love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. I only wish I could go a full 12 hours with one application. But, no matter which denture adhesive product I&#x27;ve tried, none of them have lasted using only one application. Maybe it&#x27;s just me??  However, my dentures were really secure for those hours I could wear them before having to reapply any product. I do like the fact the product is zinc free, and love the fact cream is easily wiped off your gum (if you have ooze.) Product is very simple, and easy to remove from your gums. ONE BIT OF ADVISE.... YOU NEED TO USE THE SECURE DENTURE CLEANING TABLETS WITH THIS CREAM. YOU HAVE TO USE A CLEANER THAT HAS A HIGH PH CONTENT, IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE CREAM FROM THE DENTURE. But, thanks to amazon, they have that available also.</li>
    <li> Works great, wish it was lower cost. Good holding power, a little hard to clean off the dentures but not too hard.</li>
    <li> have tried fixodent and its comparable or better. have also tried the store knockoffs that maybe last a day. i can usually make this last 2-3 days before it starts loosening. I can sleep with it on and no problems. I know you are to get rid of bacteria everyday, but....</li>
    <li> Works great, keeps my dentures securely in place all day!</li>
    <li> Secure works as advertised.  I am a new denture wearer and I was having problems with keeping the dentures tight.  I tired everything and when I received my order of secure my problems were over.  Secure is extremely adhesive.  This product puts a adhesive seal on your dentures that blocks any food or drink from reaching your gums, and breaking down the adhesiveness of the bonding cream.  I can eat just about anything now once my secure is on my dentures.  Chips, crackers, and snacks are no problem.</li>
    <li> works good on upper dentures but like most of the rest it does not work as good on lowers.</li>
    <li> Works best of all those Ive tried - Fixodent Cream and Powder made me feel  dizzy - guess it was the zinc? Otherwise I like Fixodent - holds well as long as I dont drink or eat anything acidic - soft drinks dissolve the adhesive immediately. But SECURE definitely holds best - no zinc - but it does sting when I first insert denture - Im a new denture wearer - waiting on implants to heal - so one month post surgery - all of my complaints could simply be a result of the process of fitting - I dont know - just glad I got 2 implants to hold bottom one in place - otherwise I think I might starve.</li>
    <li> very thick. this does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> The best denture adhesive ever. Not gooey or slimey. Holds securly at least 12 hours or more. Residue in mouth is easily removed after dentures are removed for cleaning.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the expedited service- I am always pleased with the performance of secure- it is the only product I rely on as it never lets me down.</li>
    <li> I tried so many different bonding creams, gels, and pads. This product is the best so far. doesn&#x27;t loose it&#x27;s grip in a couple of hours like the others.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews on Secure and thought it was the answer to long lasting denture adhesive.  It doesn&#x27;t hold any better than the \\&quot;complete\\&quot; adhesive I can purchase in my local drug store for less!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but first of all right after I applied it I had a slight but definite burning sensation on my palate I don&#x27;t get with poligrip or fixodent. That passed but it makes me wonder if the ingredients are safe. Secondly it started to loosen after an hour and I hadn&#x27;t eaten anything too hard I may have only been drinking. Now I suspect my upper isn&#x27;t fitting that well but nevertheless it loosened faster than the other denture creams do and by the time I got home it fell out completely. This was less than three hours after applying the paste.  I am NOT pleased.</li>
    <li> Product does not work as advertised,  holds for 12 hours, I have watched the video to see exactly how to apply Secure Denture Bonding Cream to make sure that it goes on properly. I was so disappointed that it only held for about 2 hours. I had something to drink, Secure is supposed to be waterproof, right away my dentures started to loosen and fall. I am NOT a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this brand for the last year and my best advise is:  Don&#x27;t put your teeth in with this unless you really, really want them to stay in.  I have trouble keeping the bottom plate in but this really helps- the best of all that I&#x27;ve tried.  And I&#x27;ve tried them all.  They either have a horrible taste or just don&#x27;t work.  I still can&#x27;t keep the bottom plate in all day but it wins for the longest hold.  It is very inexpensive to use as one time usually does it.  Best of all, no zinc.&lt;br /&gt; The down  side is that it is really tough to clean this off of the denture.  I finally found a way that makes it a lot easier but it&#x27;s not easy.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this.  I trust it and have had really good luck with it.  It has never failed me where others have.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of other denture adhesive creams. Secure tops them all.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, It&#x27;s Great product.</li>
    <li> I order this for my elderly mother, who has tried every product on the market to help secure her problematic dentures due to bone loss over time. This is the only product that works for her.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this and I liked it till I tried the secure with aloe in it,it seemed to work longer. It holds your dentures all day as long as your dentures and gums are clean and dry.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered sooner than promised but I find the product no better or worse than any of the other denture adhesives.</li>
    <li> Really works all day! No other product has.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, who has  a problem with loose lowers, and it burned his mouth so badly he had to stop using it.  He tried it again after his mouth healed and it burned again.  It did hold his denture securely, however.</li>
    <li> has  a good bond, without the zinc taste</li>
    <li> I have just gotten my Dentures in May of this year and just recently had them relined. However I still need to use adhesive especially for the lowers.&lt;br /&gt;I am a coffee drinker and the other adhesives usually dissolve within 3 hours. That is a real hassle because I have to take a Tube with me so that I can reapply. This stuff really works, I can drink coffee all day long as well as eating without my Denture popping out. It has lasted a minimum of 12 hours and I never have to reapply it during the day. It also comes off the gums much easier than all the other adhesives, they tend to become real gooey and I have to spend a lot of time to try and remove it of my Gums. \\&quot; Secure \\&quot; adhesive comes off easy by just using a toothbrush.Will absolutly buy more.</li>
    <li> The best bonding cream money can buy. I have tried everything and nothing secures like this one does. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is probably the closest to implants as you can get.  The clean up requires a little elbow grease but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn a lower partial for years and just recently got a full upper denture.  I&#x27;m now trying different products to see that works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this with my (older) lower partial that&#x27;s been giving me trouble because it slides around a lot.  This keeps it in place fairly well.  It has done a great job at keeping food from getting trapped under the partial.  This is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quit using this on my full upper denture, though.  Now it may be that I&#x27;m just not used to the whole full denture thing ... plus we&#x27;re talking the temporary denture you wear for the first year rather than the better quality permanent denture.  Regardless, I did not like this for the top denture because when it was time to take out the denture and clean it ... a)  the denture really stuck to the roof of my mouth  b)  it was a gooey mess when I got the denture off  c)  it was pretty hard to get the adhesive off the denture as well as off the roof of my mouth.  I now use a powdered denture adhesive on the top - while I think it&#x27;s less adhesive (which could be perceived as a negative), I find the cleanup less of a hassle, which makes a difference to me.  I guess, ultimately, it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.</li>
    <li> This stuff sticks.  I didn&#x27;t buy the cleaner and have been using &amp;#34;Stain Away&amp;#34; which works okay.  Last night I put&lt;br /&gt;my denture in Calgon and it came out great with not as much scrapping.</li>
    <li> I asked for an alternative to cushion grip and this was recommended.  It was terrible  It felt ike I had mush in my mouth all day  I have used cushion grip for the last twenty years and I know how to apply it  If you ever used cushion grip you would know what I am talking about  There is not anything better than cushion grip, but!!!!!!!!!!!! they quit selling it  It is the worst thing they could do  Cushion grip is still for sale at amazon but the sellers are trying to make a huge profit on the tubes that are left,  I bought mine at CVS for 6.00 a tube Now they are selling the ones left for 20.00 a tube.  Go into the reviews on cushion grip and read them and you will understand  One thing I know  I will gum my foods before I use secure denture adhesive</li>
    <li> i was rather disappointed in secure vs the two store brands-especially in light of your product being reccommended by my dentist.....it seems to glob up when removing the denture and hard to remove the center gob from the roof of my mouth. i also resented being made to buy 4 tubes of the cream before i tried one to see if i liked it.&lt;br /&gt;peter freeman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sularan@aol.com</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by denturist who says a little will last twelve hours unlike over the counter stuff.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear dentures myself, but I have a friend who does and he&#x27;s never been able to find any brand of denture cream in any store that doesn&#x27;t really bother him,,,,,,  until he ran across this Dentek Bonding Creme from Amazon.  He loves it and will use nothing else since he discovered it.  I ordered this 4-pack for him for his birthday and he&#x27;s just so pleased!</li>
    <li> This is the worst denture adhesive I have ever used. It smells like wood glue and then when you put it in your mouth it burns for first 10 minutes. If that is not enough by 3pm I was having to reglue my teeth, and since secure was all I had I had to endure the burning all over again. I will not and would not ever recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Secure Denture Bonding Cream is amazing. I have had dentures for 6 years. The first five years I could only wear them a few times because I hated the other brands of adhesive. Then I found Secure and gave it a try. I am so happy I did because now I use my dentures everyday. Thank you Secure for making my life better.</li>
    <li> For the price and quality I would never purchase anything else! Ever!</li>
    <li> My Dad is the one who is using this product, but he is not happy with it.  We read the reviews and advice prior to the purchase, but it is not any better (my Dad considers it worse), than what he had purchased locally.</li>
    <li> this is the best denture adhesive I have found.  It&#x27;s base is same as chewing gum so has nothing toxic. However, drinking anything like soda or&lt;br /&gt;fruit juices will dissolve gum based product.  Using lemon juice based  mouth wash will dissolve and remove any adhesive in your mouth.</li>
    <li> This is the best Denture product I have ever used. One time a day and it holds the entire day waterproof I loved it!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesnt quite hold for 12 hr but best ive found yet</li>
    <li> This is awesome, this is the only paste I can use so I can eat whatever I want. Unfortunately what I don&#x27;t like about any of them is the gel like crap that starts oozing out a couple places at the end of the day. But I love the hold it does. To help not have the goo is to put a very thin line, which it tells u to do on the box but I guess I didn&#x27;t see that part. I thought I&#x27;d need more to hold it better, that is not the case. A little line is all that&#x27;s needed and then u don&#x27;t get that extra goo after putting it in. Still some goo when taking out for the day but I figure it&#x27;s worth it if I can finally eat. I&#x27;ve used this product now for over a year, started out just the bottom denture. But I guess because of the tongue constantly moving the bottom doesn&#x27;t hold as long as the top. The bottom holds half a day or less if u eat a lot of things. But the top one lasts at least 8-12 hours easily. I tried all kinds of adhesive and this one was the only one capable of letting me eat steak.</li>
    <li> I just went to 7 weeks of radiation on my face and expecting severe burns I barely had a mild sun blister.  Very happy with the results and I continue to use it to help avoid more skin cancers.</li>
    <li> Great Dental Cream at a great price.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Getting 24 hrs. This stuff is like iron. Try it with the stain away for easy cleanup. It is really GREAT.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast.  Communications was very good.  The product itself is interesting.  While it says it is for a 12 hour hold, it so far has lasted only one meal.  It holds well during the day but eating seems to loose it.  There is a slight burning sometimes when it first goes in but that is mentioned in the information sheet that comes with the tube.  I found that when I made sure the dentures were totally dry, the non-water based glue worked better.</li>
    <li> good product, good price, very good Amazon seller.</li>
    <li> Better Than Most I have found! New to dentures and still experimenting with application. But this one beats everything i have tried to date.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is unquestionably the best.</li>
    <li> Great product! A must get for denture wearers!</li>
    <li> Having tried Fixodent (which doesn&#x27;t work), Sea Bond (which doesn&#x27;t work), Super Poligrip (that works) and Super Poligrip Comfort Strips (that work) I was glad I gave Secure a try in an earlier order because their product REALLY works. I re-ordered the product, this time for four tubes and could not be happier, except that you still have to remove the goo from your mouth and that is where it gets its four stars. At this time though I have no intentions of buying anything else, I just wish a formula could be developed that allowed denture users to dissolve all the goo with a mouthwash but if that is going to happen, it won&#x27;t happen very soon. I do highly recommend this product to those who are after a secure fit when putting in their dentures, and want the confidence it gives that when you bite down on something hard, your dentures will stay in place. The price is not bad, either.</li>
    <li> Better than most denture cream, but I still have issues with the bonding cream</li>
    <li> ONLY THING TO KEEP MY LOWER DENTURE IN...NOT 12 hrs but longer than others. I&#x27;m still trying to figure amount to use but I&#x27;m closer to success.  My dentures are so tiny it is hard to spread the adhesive around even with little finger.  It would be nice if Secure included sticks or fingertip rubbers to evenly spread the adhesive for those of us with sensitivity to it.  That part works except for the lower cushion...can never get rid of the tingling period.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market have used all the other products and they don&#x27;t work.  This does the job great</li>
    <li> I love this product. It lasts all day, even more than 12 hours if needed. With other adhesives I used in the past, I had to re-apply it 2 to 3 times daily, which was very inconvenient. It&#x27;s a bit pricier than most, but with the length of time it lasts and the confidence it has given me, it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Ok, so in November I had to have an extraction and it happened that the tooth that was removed was an anchor tooth for my denture.  My dentist advised me to let my gum heal, and then leave that gum space uncovered, since he felt that the longer that denture was, without an anchor, then the more it would tend to &amp;#34;flop around&amp;#34;.  Sounded logical.  It took a very long time to get used to the new deal, and I tried lots of other denture adhesives.  Since there is only one tooth on that side of the denture, there was not a lot of space to accept a denture adhesive.  I figured I would end up reapplying denture adhesive several times a day, but then I found Secure.  I have only been using it for a few days, but it really has changed my life.  I have had several days of one application lasting through all 3 meals with NO rocking and rolling of my denture.  I feel so much better about my future with this situation and it is almost like I have a new lease on life.  Happy man!  Highly recommend, but apply as suggested.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever found. Last a good 8 hours for bottom dentures and I&#x27;ve fallen asleep, woke up the next day and uppers are still in.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product to me, as neither my top or bottom dentures fit properly, which I am very disappointed over ... The only place I could find Secure Denture Bonding was here on Amazon, so I order it by the 4 pack, so not to run out ... I have also purchased the Secure Denture Strips that are suppose to work better at holding in your lower denture, but I hav&#x27;nt tried that yet ... My only disappointment with Secure is the removal of the product once you take your denture out ... If someone has a good idea as far as how you get all the paste out of your mouth please contact me, as I have a terrible time trying to get it removed ... That is my only complaint as far as Sucure Denture Bonding Cream goes, and I definetly give it 5 stars, especially in comparison with the other products on line ...</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> Was exactly as expected and got here when promised.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold bottom dentures as well as I expected.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as long as advertised.</li>
    <li> I like this was easy to use and held all day like it said it would if u want a better a little more worked</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have discovered this particular denture adhesive.  It certainly does hold for me as a new denture wearer after having tried three other products.  I gave just four stars because while it maintains complete hold which I&#x27;m MOST concerned about it: 1) still lets some very small food particles enter within dentures but rinsing well after eating takes care of that, 2) your mouth can feel a bit slimy after about 6 - 7 hours and that&#x27;s probably due to a little breakdown of the adhesive BUT it still holds fast, 3) it is very difficult to clean your dentures because IT IS A VERY STRONG ADHESIVE, 4) the adhesive can remain on and around your gums. Hot tap water rinsing of your mouth removes the adhesive and also allowing your dentures to soak a bit in hot water followed by a good brushing then a good denture cleanser soaking (I like Stain Away-it&#x27;s awesome) takes care of the residue. All in all it&#x27;s a great product and since my main concern is holding while talking and eating it completely satisfies those concerns!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Really hold my dentures in. Really fast shipping by seller. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Top notch denture adhesive.  Its the best, and the only adhesive I use.</li>
    <li> Works about as well as the product that I was using before I made this purchase. Can&#x27;t say that the &amp;#34;Hold&amp;#34; lasts as long as manufacturer claims.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions completely and anytime I ate or drank anything warm,  the cream just let go and turned to mush.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Second time I have ordered this product. Holds my lower denture like Silly Glue. I&#x27;ll never go back to over the counter products.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for 4 years. It is easy to clean up, it holds my denture tight go 10 to 12 hours.  It is also ZINC FREE!!</li>
    <li> Works so so for the price</li>
    <li> This is so far the best denture adhesive I have tried.  Most of the adhesive comes out with the dentures and once out my saliva will dissolve what&#x27;s left in my mouth.  After that, I brush my gums with a soft bristle brush and it&#x27;s all good.  I have found that cleaning the adhesive off of the dentures works well if you first remove the majority of the adhesive with a finger and then soak them in very hot water for 30 min or so.  Using a finger again to remove what is left, I then use a mixture of baking soda and salt with a stiff bristle tooth brush and give them a good scrubbing and 99% if not all will come off and your dentures are clean.  No need to spend the extra money on the Secure denture cleaning tablets.  I have been wearing my temporary dentures for about a month and a half now and have found this is best and cheapest way to clean your dentures.  It holds my upper plate well for 12 hours and it holds my lowers alright for about 6-8 hours.  My gums are still healing and shrinking so I think this is why it doesn&#x27;t hold my lowers as well.  Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> Product is very good ,last and grips great. Only issue I had was, when I went out drinking, I drank diet pesi instead of beer ,and  I got some separation.</li>
    <li> Just ordered another batch to last for another year.  Like this brand.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better than Fixodent. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money it is just a big sham and hard to clean off of dentures.</li>
    <li> Love this adhesive. It is expensive but works great for me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok doesn&#x27;t work for long like it says but it&#x27;s better than anything else I have used</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that I could drink and eat with and not have my dentures come loose in my mouth.  I will keep using this product on my lower dentures.</li>
