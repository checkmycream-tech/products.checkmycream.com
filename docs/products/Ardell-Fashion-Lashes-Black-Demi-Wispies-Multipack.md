    <li> love these. they make my eyes POP</li>
    <li> Bestttt lashes ever. Love the price too!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Super fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great length &amp; instantly make my eyes look good.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE these ardell whispies. They look so natural on my eyes. Will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time but fell apart easily, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It a good buy.  Makes you look great and also feel great.  Good quality, easy to put on and will last the whole day or night.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! Love this brand and for the price...great deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with Demi Wispies! The only false lashes that look super long and natural. I always get asked if they&#x27;re my natural lashes ;)</li>
    <li> The  Wispies are longer, thicker and blacker  than I expected. Sometimes photos on the website do not truly represent the product. So I will need to look for some different lashes that are thinner (fewer lashes) and a dark brown. I can always alter the length to my preference.</li>
    <li> Product is right and a great price.</li>
    <li> Wasnt exactly what i expected,but its ok</li>
    <li> I love these.  Natural look.  Feel good and not heavy. Easy to apply.  Not too expensive.  Will keep buying.  Easy to reuse if you do not add too much mascara at the end,  which I do not.</li>
    <li> These are great everyday lashes not too full but lengthy.  I really think I&#x27;ll use these for everyday lashes.  There are between a demi wispy and full length of the eyelid, so there is no need to cut them although you could cut them if you want more of a demi wispy.  I wrote them and last night I was so tired that I feel asleep with them on.  They stayed on great and didn&#x27;t get all crunched up. I woke up this morning almost already to go. At least I look great while I&#x27;m in my jammies drinking coffee , doing Amazon.com reviews ;)</li>
    <li> Love it makes my makeup look fabulous (:</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know wife ordered them on my account . LOL</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect and exactly what i wanted. They&#x27;re lightweight and they look natural. I love the way they look!</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars because I can tell these aren&#x27;t Ardell. The band is thicker and the way they&#x27;re cut, it&#x27;s too round, nothing like the Demi wispies should be</li>
    <li> Satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love these.  this is the only type of falsie ill use.  I, of course, cut them to my preferred width and they work great.  they don&#x27;t shout &amp;#34;hey I obviously have on fake lashes!!&amp;#34; at all...they add just enough pop that im looking for with a bit of the Audrey Hepburn flick towards the tip of your outer eye. great quality.  I also have very sensitive eyes, allergic to almost anything and ive never had an issue w/ these lashes.</li>
    <li> These are the best lashes ever!</li>
    <li> It did take a while for them to ship, but I absolutely love them! </li>
    <li> These are not exactly like the demi wispies but I can work with them. They were a good price for 4 pairs.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected them to be!</li>
    <li> Ive been a fan of this ardell lashes.very natural looking and easy to use. I re-uses mine for atleast 3 weeks with careful ways of taking them out.last almost a month.</li>
    <li> The lashes were good quality but not what I thought I was buying. Demi wispies I&#x27;ve bought in the past are like wispies just shorter and more curled. These are thick and not too curled.</li>
    <li> These did not seem like the regular ardell Demi wispies that I individually by from target/cvs. These were much thicker,longer and not spaced apart at all. I hated them, I thought I was getting a deal but it was a Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Awesome Lashes! Highly Recommend :)</li>
    <li> Perfect!!!! Always my go to lashes. AMAZING PRICE! Must buy!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these lashes. I wear strip lashes everyday. I usually go through about 2 pair a month. My favorite are the Ardell demi whispies as they can be worn appropriately in various settings. I have been leary if purchasing them online as I have often had bad experiences and have not always received what I thought I had ordered. These are good, though. They are the real thing. Good quality, good price. And the vendor is legit. Highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> The product took forever to recieve due to postage not being fully paid. Once I picked up and paid the remainder of the postage the item ms weren&#x27;t even sticking properly. They would come up even with glue. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> these don&#x27;t look natural at all. will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> i bought this based on the recommendation on youtube that it was natural looking. this is not it. they are very long. i intend to wear it for a night out. this will be ok for a dramatic look. the band width is small for my eyes. i have that problem with ardell lashes. this is my last ardell lashes because of this problem. i would not recommend this lashes of you want something very natural for daytime. and also it feels heavy on my lids compared to my other lashes.</li>
    <li> I really loved them. It was very fast Shipping. The lashes were natural and pretty. I recomend these to any one who wants lashes that arent dramatic.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. I watch @itsJudyTime and she mentioned these were her favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are my new favorite. I cut them on the long eye to fit my eyes and they are very easy to glue to the my lash line. They are soft and supple, not as plastic-y as some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can cut from either end without any problems.</li>
    <li> Some of my faves!  I can get few uses out of one set.</li>
    <li> The very best false lashes from anywhere!!! They last and last a long time. Looks natural on and easy to put on. My favorite!</li>
    <li> these lashes are not original demi wispies, they are much longer and has no spaces in between. if you trim them a little they look way better.</li>
    <li> Easy to Apply, Easy to Trim if needed, Great Fit and Durability.</li>
    <li> The lashes are great . They fit &amp; feel great . It&#x27;s my first time using lashes &amp; these made it very easy for me to get used to . I didn&#x27;t need to struggle to put them on . They are very comfortable. You would need to buy glue if you&#x27;re looking to buy these lashes .</li>
    <li> Because of the different lengths, there&#x27;s a more natural look. Lashes that are all the same length look fake. I cut them in half and only place the lashes on my outer eye.  These are my favorite, and I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds.  Will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Such a great price and fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Love it, no messed up packaging the only down side is no glue</li>
    <li> looks super fake&lt;br /&gt;cant even use it</li>
    <li> very pretty real looking</li>
    <li> I liked the product but I found a similar product made from human hair with 5 pair for the same price.</li>
    <li> The band will not bend well and is a pain to fit and glue down. Will never buy again. I have tried with different lash glues so I know that is not the issue.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought I was buying and got it very quickly. Also can&#x27;t beat the price! No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Loved these lashes! Really made my eyes pop!!!</li>
