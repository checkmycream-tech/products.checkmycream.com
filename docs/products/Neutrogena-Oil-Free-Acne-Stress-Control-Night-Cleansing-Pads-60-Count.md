<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I get occasional body acne after workouts on my shoulders and back and these are great for treating hard to reach areas with a quick dose of salicylic acid. They are a little harsh on my sensitive face but the scrubbing pads work nicely on body acne. They are really doused in salicylic acid so a little pad goes a long way and I&#x27;ve had no issues with pads drying out, even with only occasional use.</li>
    <li> It does ease the skin break out problem after using it.  I will definitely recommend it and will get another one.</li>
    <li> works amazing on my dry skin. I have small pimples that are not quite white heads and this has worked wonders for me.</li>
    <li> Very strong alcohol concentration and stings very badly on any sore.</li>
    <li> It is a good cleanser, however it leaves a soapy/antiseptic type of film on your face.  I felt that I had to wash it off with a damp cloth &amp; water.  It would have been easier to just wash my face, wish I&#x27;d have known this before I bought it :(!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these at night to control her oily spots that are break out prone. It&#x27;s perfect when you don&#x27;t want to take the trouble to wash your entire face. Nicely priced also.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without these! I have adult acne and for the last year have been using Rodan and Fields Unblemish [...], with amazing results. I have sensitive skin, typically dry, but yet have acne (and rosacea). I have tried every product line possible - over the counter, high priced cosmetic counter cleansers, spa &amp; salon product lines, all organic lines, dermatologist/ prescription only products. No combination worked like the Rodan and Fields. The problem? The Rodan and Fields product line did not have a toner that was easy for travel (at 4.2 oz - their toner was over the carry-on limit).     So, I supplemented with the Acne Stress Control from Neutrogena - amazing! No irritation, no burning, and a ton of dirt/skin cells removed (eww, but at least I know it was working). These are perfect for travel (a quick wipe to get all that stale airplane debris removed), perfect for the gym (use after, don&#x27;t want it to sweat into your eyes), perfect for the beach (although apply a good sunscreen after- the active ingredient will increase sun sensitivity), perfect for use when driving in a convertible (you&#x27;d be amazed at the dirt from the highway that clings to your skin!) Keep them in your car (add a tiny bit of water if they get dry in the summer) and use them in between an unexpected change of plans/make-up change.    I found this product at CVS pharmacy several months ago, and they have since stopped carrying it in the store. I have looked at three other pharmacies, Walmart, Target, grocery stores and can&#x27;t seem to find it. Thank goodness I can still order online!</li>
    <li> Be careful not to use these too often. They are very harsh. You may burn your face if you use other products to get rid of acne. I usually use them if i haven&#x27;t put anything on my face for about 3 to 4 hours so there is no burning. Doesn&#x27;t totally get rid of acne but definitely gets rid of oily skin.</li>
    <li> Keeps skin acne free!</li>
    <li> Most cleaner pads have a strong odor, but I found the odor in these pads is quite lovely &amp; soothing. There is no harsh burn when applying the pads to my face &amp; I feel refreshed afterward. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a gentle cleanser before bed.   (I pair this with Aveeno&#x27;s Nightime Cream &amp; I have found my skin feels just wonderful &amp; never greasy with these two products!)</li>
    <li> I am not sure about the stress part of it, but it is as good as the original one. Cleans well.</li>
    <li> If I could give this 0 stars, I would. Paying just about $7 for something, you would think it would not irritate you skin so badly. In all the years using regular face wash products I have never had a single one do this to my skin. After just one use my skin was red, puffy and scaly feeling, it kept me up all night with the intense burning and itching. Even after using a special facial moisturizer it did not help. Now it is 4 days later and my face is a little better, but still red puffy and itchy. I would not recommend this to anyone....</li>
    <li> Great great pads keeps my face clear!!</li>
    <li> I see some improvement. My pores are smaller and I&#x27;m not breaking out as much. My skin is still a little oily around the T-zone.</li>
    <li> great product and it removes the top layer of dead skin and dissolves the oil on the top layer of skin as well, great for a general face wash.</li>
    <li> Immediately left my face feeling clean and tingling, though I did not experience the chemical irritation that others did. I wasn&#x27;t bothered by the smell or feeling of the product. My face is often oily and the pores on my nose get clogged, but this cleared all of that up quickly.</li>
    <li> It gets all of my leftover makeup off.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE! They work amazing! I used these in combination with the face wash and acne spot control. Would defintiely buy again!</li>
    <li> This stuff actually is something that works on my face.  The scrub and formulation seem to keep my blackheads from coming back.  I use this in the morning AND night, not just night.</li>
    <li> I had been using tea tree &amp; witch hazel cleansing pads from Trader Joe&#x27;s for months and never broke out. Then I ran out, decided to order something online instead of driving to TJ&#x27;s and now I&#x27;m breaking out again. These are soft and they smell nice and I know some reviewers swear by them...  but something about them just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I noticed a lot more dirt/ makeup on the used TJ&#x27;s pad than I do on these so perhaps that&#x27;s it: these just aren&#x27;t as good at removing the stuff that clogs my pores. Back to TJ&#x27;s I go. (Cheaper there too.)</li>
    <li> Stuff works pretty well, they&#x27;re great to clean your face with when you can&#x27;t wash your face for whatever reason.</li>
    <li> It does the job but has such strong alcohol scent which makes you difficult to breath while applying this pad on your face.</li>
    <li> Perfect to clean your face after a hot day or when you are camping.  I&#x27;m always surprised after you use them and see all the brown residue from the oils from your face.</li>
    <li> This product made me physically sick by using it, which included runny nose, fever, cough, etc, after 3 weeks and many doctors visits we traced my illness to reacting to this product. Stay away, if you don&#x27;t want to be exposed to harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> Ive only been using for a week but I can already see major Improvement. I am 21 and going through the worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve switched birth control methods and work in a hospital. It has all wrecked havoc on my face! I&#x27;ve been using three times a day and have seen major improvements! Even my boy friend had noticed. It does sting a little Somedays and leaves the acne a bit tender but that&#x27;s expected with an acid treatment. It isn&#x27;t gone completely but I will continue to use and see. Now I just need to figure out what to do with my left over acne scars.</li>
    <li> My kid loves this product. She uses it every month so I have it shipped via subscription  via Amazon</li>
    <li> This is an alright product, but it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me. My acne that I already had was barely reduced when using these and I did notice a little less acne when using this product, but nothing huge. I have went through this whole product and used it for a month, but no real big difference. I know there are other people having more success with this product then me, but I guess this wasn&#x27;t the product for me. It is fairly cheap in price and easy to use, which I like. The other thing that I didn&#x27;t like to much was that it left my skin oily, so I would only recommend using this when you are home. If you are interested in this product you should give it a try to see if it works for you, you might have better results. I am fairly satisfied with this item, but I think I am going to look for something that gives me better results.</li>
    <li> helped take oil away but burned</li>
    <li> Works great and cheap!</li>
    <li> Works really good. my acne went away after about a week of use.</li>
    <li> My skin felt smooth and clean after the first 2 days.</li>
    <li> Works great for clearing up skin. Be easy around the lower edges of nose as it can dry that area out rather quick as the skin is thin.</li>
    <li> It has helped clear some tough acne spots on face but not all of them. I was hoping this was stronger.</li>
    <li> Amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;My skin was freaking out after a wax, and after reading a bunch of stuff on the net, it turns out that all those overpriced products for ingrown hairs are basically the same as these, since the active ingredients are just salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;I was also experiencing a skin freakout due to the sudden swampy summer heat. I used the wipes at night before bed. All the bumps were shriveled up overnight, and totally flat by day 2. It&#x27;s been a week and the redness seems to be fading a lot faster than usual, which makes sense given that SA forces cellular turnover.</li>
    <li> Smell really weird (very strong) which make my eyes water and breathing difficult if I try to use near my nose, which is where I need them the most!</li>
    <li> These seem to work as well as any other sacilyic acid pad</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years, off and on as needed.  I use this to treat and prevent my breakouts that are few and far between.  This product works really well for me.  I have sensitive skin and am allergic to many products with fragrances.  I have no problem with this.  I have not had any dry patches or pealing (as I have with other acne products).  I noticed a drastic change (not in a good way) in my skin when I did not have this product for the last month. This product actually keeps breakouts few and far between.  In addition, my husband commented that it smells really nice.</li>
    <li> Heavy alcohol smell, drenched with liquid.  So wet are the pads, that I am applying the alcohol on my face and not wipping off dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t been good for face.  Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t expect the awful chemical smell. it stings my skin and doesn&#x27;t help my acne at all. won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I mean, they&#x27;re ok. I didn&#x27;t have much luck with the stress relief line, though. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Best price and great outcomes!</li>
    <li> It makes my face a little dry and a little hurt. However It is really useful to keep skin clean and free oil.</li>
    <li> These were ok cleaning pads. I didn&#x27;t see and change in the amount of acne but they did clean makeup and dirt off.</li>
    <li> These pads are great. They are nit too stringent. And really do help alleviate stress. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using them for a long time and I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone who asks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive, department store and salon stuff. I&#x27;ve tried all the different 3 step programs out there and this is the only stuff that works. I don&#x27;t know if it will work for you but I love it.</li>
    <li> They smell nice however every time i go to wipe them on my face i loose grip of them because they are so darn little i was not expecting them to be that little. They may work but my concern was the size. I would more recommend the Neutrogena Oil-Free Pink Grapefruit acne prone Wipes, they are the same size as baby wipes much much bigger an better made for the same price too as these pads.</li>
    <li> Work great, no lingering smell or dry skin out.  Great for those pimples that pop up.</li>
    <li> This product isnt bad but I think there are better ones out there.</li>
    <li> serious about my face and love this company</li>
    <li> I have an acne prone skin and likes to break out. These cleansing pads have been effective in preventing acne. I neglect using these cleansing pads. So every now and then I get acne. However, I use these pads in early stages of my acne and it clears out real fast. I don&#x27;t know if this product is being discontinued but there&#x27;s a new Neutrogena product called Rapid Clear with an orange label. I&#x27;ve used both and found no difference in the pads. I think they just changed out the packaging and name. Essentially, it seemed like the same product with the same 2% salicylic acid formula. So, if you don&#x27;t this product anywhere, try Rapid Clear.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with adult cystic acne for the last two years.  If anyone has this issue, then you know this is not a fun thing to deal with and nothing seems to help.  I have tried all sorts of different treatments to help rid this, and nothing seemed to work.  I decided to try out several items in the Acne Stress Control line as I figured it could not hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying, I have used products that have cost $1 to products that have cost over $100.  Like I mentioned, I have been willing to try anything.  I started using the Toner in this line and decided to give these pads a try.  There are some nights I just want to curl up in bed and feel too lazy to wash my face.  I use one or two of these pads, and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;These are very strong smelling and each pad is filled with product.  They are easy to use, I just wish the pad itself was a little larger.  I normally can do half a face with one pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if these are helping my cystic acne or not, but using the toner and these, I have seen a slight difference.  Plus, they have not made me break out even more like some other products.  I really do like them and recommend giving them a try</li>
    <li> I like these acne treatment pads. They work verywell &amp; take all the dirt off my face. The only flaw that this product has is it tests high in toxicity.  I found that out from using the Skin Deep app. But I&#x27;m willing to take the risk because of how much dirt &amp; makeup it can take off.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible, so have your bathroom fan on when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans sand/dust/makeup off well.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, oily T zones.&lt;br /&gt;Chin acne about 1/4 inch in diameter deep into the skin, pink, can&#x27;t even pop them because they&#x27;re so deep inside the skin, very painful.&lt;br /&gt;Pimples on the side of my nose (I suspect from sunglasses and sweat and bacteria trapped in there) more towards the surface, painful too, but not as much as the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have 2-4 of the giant pimples on my chin at any given time. Super deep combo pimples too.&lt;br /&gt;I used this every other day for a week, and I haven&#x27;t had a giant horribly painful pimple since.&lt;br /&gt;I will still get a tiny surface pimple here and there, but the duration and severity is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good, my skin is behaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It kind of prickles when applying and smells like the nail salon/ hair salon vomited on me.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Acne products work wonders for me!  I love this product because I can use it instead of the washes.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it does dry my skin out much more than the acne stress control power foam wash.  However, this product works much faster - for me.  I may alternate between the power foam and the pads so my skin isn&#x27;t as dry but I will keep on using this.</li>
    <li> I love purchasing this product online. I haven&#x27;t had a issue yet and this is my 3rd order. I would definitely recommend this to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  You get a large number of pads for a good price. It helped with my stress acne.  I still have acne at times but not as bad anymore.</li>
    <li> a bit strong smelling but works well.</li>
    <li> My teenaged son and daughter both like this product.</li>
    <li> I am a typical fair skin Asian girl. I have combination oily skin and have couple white/black heads and occasional cysts on my chin. I also have acne on my chest and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for both my face, chest, and back. I used it once everyday for about 5 days and I had to stop using it.  It has a sticky finish. I think I didn&#x27;t realize it immediately but as I went about the day I noticed how sticky and even oily my skin felt. I actually got MORE ACNE on my CHEST after using this product. I can&#x27;t tell if it made my face worse but it definitely made my chest acne worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to using Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Cleansing Pads. That works for me in getting rid of my chest acne!</li>
    <li> Great product.It leaves your skin  feeling refreshed. And really does seem to shrink pores.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make much of a difference in my acne, and didn&#x27;t help to prevent it much. Kind of burned my skin when putting it on.</li>
    <li> These wipes are amazing! I was having a MAJOR breakout sorry I ordered these wipes to try and clear up my skin before school. And with about a week of usage, I only have 2 small pimples left. I used 1 every evening and one every other morning and I&#x27;m almost completely clear. These wipes are a bit strong for my nose and eyes but I&#x27;ve gotten more and more used to it wit more usage. These wipes go nicely with the Neutrogena &amp;#34;On the Spot&amp;#34; salicylic acid treatment put on after you thoroughly wipe your face down. The shipping was fast and the price was average. I am overall very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> so worth it. Helps with acne that is caused by stress. Wouldn&#x27;t want any other product. I love love love this</li>
    <li> Works great I use it every night and during the day... I would buy it again and again and again</li>
    <li> this was a very great product, it cleared up my face. So i like it. It was good! yeah i am sure others will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> These pads worked on my butt acne better than the $300 spent on a fancy Dermatologist appointment and his 2 very expensive prescriptions, that bleached out my bath towels and underwear!  I also get ingrown hairs on the back of my upper thigh and I think it is helping with that too. Does not dry out the skin even though the second ingredient after water is denatured alcohol. I keep one bedside and one in downstairs bathroom to make sure I get a double dose in one day.&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic Acid 2% is what all these types of  acne products list for their Active Ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a list of questionable ingredients in body products found online. Ingredients that end in Paraben is one of them. So I only use products without them. Most Hand lotions, creams will have parabens. Avoid Sulfates in hair shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Gentle Readers and Responders in the Review section, Please remember that Reviews are for the Product, first and foremost.

    <li> These pads are the best acne medication I have used. Certain times of the month my face breaks out horribly and I used them just once for the first time last night and this morning my face was already better. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve replaced my usual acne wash with Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser and these pads and I only use them every other night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is much more hydrated now and my breakouts seem to have been reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the convenience of this product, as I can put a couple in a Ziploc baggie and take them with me in my overnight bag when traveling to ensure I always get an acne treatment, even if I don&#x27;t have access to a wash cloth or I&#x27;m too tired or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These often remove dirt that my Ponds makeup removing wipes leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use a moisturizer with this product as it can be drying.</li>
    <li> The product is fine; I ordered 6 of these for my kids.  The problem is that all six arrived today in fine condition, other than they all expire in a little over one month from now.  Unacceptable; the seller, 1,000 Beauty should state that the product is close to expiring.</li>
    <li> I use this during stressful times which cause my face to break out.  Lately I haven&#x27;t had any bad breakouts now that I&#x27;ve started using this and Neutrogena&#x27;s PInk Grapefruit acne scrub.</li>
    <li> These pads are better than Stridex by a long shot!  You can actually feel them working.  You just have to make sure to moisturize because they will dry out your skin (unless you have very oily skin).</li>
    <li> These are great to use to remove excess dirt in the morning or at night. This product has a pleasant smell and the pads are soaked with the cleansing solution. I like to use them mainly at night to clean the &amp;#34;dirt from the day&amp;#34; off of my face without washing it first. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. I want to keep these handy so I set up a &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; order to regularly receive them automatically.</li>
    <li> I love these, but the jar does get kind of gunky. Totally worth it though</li>
    <li> nice and easy way to clean off face make up.  definitely helps your skin stay fresh and clean between washing.</li>
    <li> Use this on my legs in the morning and before bed after I shower. Leaves my skin feeling fresh and has helped with breakouts and I have really bad skin. I will see how they help in the warmer weather when my skin is at its worst but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This, along with the other products in the line, has helped to reduce my hormonal acne.  I use these every night and my only complaint is that my face feels a little filmy or sticky, but I just tell myself that it&#x27;s probably the medicinal part of the cleanser and try to ignore it.</li>
    <li> I am post menopausal and developed adult acne. This product works better than any prescription drug I have been prescribed. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased these at Walmart after I was told by my esthetician that I should use salycic acid in my skin care routine. I tried these out and loved them. They are really great at getting rid of blemishes and also removing any dirt/makeup from your skin that your cleanser didn&#x27;t fully get.</li>
    <li> its definitely shown improvement in acne for my son. I would say it was about 60% effective. I am sure with continued use it will only get better.</li>
    <li> love the product - doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy...great for the summertime. easy transaction &amp; will be ordering again in the near future.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot.  I&#x27;m terrible with remembering to wash my face, but these let me do it quickly and easily.  I&#x27;ve seen good results.</li>
    <li> These things work, just make sure to use them every night before bed, or if you&#x27;re sweaty. They&#x27;re great face wipes.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE AMAZING. This is the only make up wipe I have found that does not make my face break out. I have bought it several times and will continue to buy it unless and until my skin reacts negatively to it. I use may items from Neutrogena as I have sensitive skin and their products never seem to irritate my skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my teenage son, I don&#x27;t want it to be too strong for his face so I suggested him use them 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> does little to get rid of acne</li>
    <li> I bought this a while back before my new revelation of skin type and product usage (crazy, i know). Anyway, I kept using it because I was desperate for anything to get rid of my acne. I would wash my face, apply this, and then apply my moisturizer. It felt tough on my skin and no matter how much I moisturized it always dried out my face. Would not recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> good product will buy more soon</li>
    <li> I suffer from acne a lot so this product works me,less than 5 days my acne disappear love it</li>
    <li> An esthetician recommended this product over a year ago, and it is my absolute favorite.  Convenient and effective.  It also is affordable.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it, as I can&#x27;t ever find it in stores!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 16 year old son who has problems with acne - pimples, black heads, red splotchy areas on his face &amp; back. This product is easy to use; simply use a cleansing pad out to wipe the face and neck area. This is the one acne product that he has continued to use on a nightly basis. There is no terrible smell and it hasn&#x27;t dried his skin (he doesn&#x27;t have oily skin either). we have noticed a difference in the acne after only a week of using the product. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it is making a difference.  If you are looking for something easy to use that doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel too dry, you might consider this product.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT IF USED CORRECTLY</li>
    <li> Good product.  Strong smell.</li>
    <li> Ok so i have moderate acne. When you put this on your skin is going to burn a little bit nothing unbearable. Then the next morning your pimples will be smaller and dried out! the only bad this is this a little bit too liquidish to me!! and also it dries out my skin a little too much. Overall good product but not amazing :)</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Works better than Pro Active products ever have. Purchased at a great value price as well! The best part about the Neutrogena acne products is that they work very well, they don&#x27;t dry out your skin like other acne treatments do and are a great value.</li>
    <li> I spent about $100 on a bunch of acne treatments and only purchased this because I remember it working in highschool. Out of all the other treatments I purchased this worked the best. It didn&#x27;t burn or dry out my skin but I did notice an improvement in my acne the next morning</li>
    <li> i have seen the results on my face</li>
    <li> I read various online reviews for this product so I guess I was expecting something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son has moderate acne and has tried just about every over the counter product with nominal success. This is just another product in that group. He&#x27;s used the wipes regularly night and day (per the instructions) and I haven&#x27;t noticed ANY difference in his acne. SO, I probably won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> Very helpful in the treating of my preteens acne issues. Would Recommend.</li>
    <li> This product should be better advertised. It works much better than ProActiv and costs less. We bought the whole line of products.</li>
    <li> This is a very, very strong astringent for the control of acne.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to remove my makeup and give &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; sort of skincare when I am too lazy or too exhausted for my usual routine. So I needed a product that not only would remove my makeup and sunscreen, but would also delivery actives to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product fits the bill, but it is also super irritating on my skin. Since I don&#x27;t use it daily, I will continue to use this package, but I am unsure whether I will buy it again. Actually I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• The pads are *saturated* with solution&lt;br /&gt;• The price is economical&lt;br /&gt;• Effective delivery of a medically proven topical for acne, SA, which works better on blackheads and clogged pores than other types of topicals like AHAs&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• This is a very, very harsh product.&lt;br /&gt;I have very resistant skin and very few products cause the mentholated-burning-sensation that this product leaves behind. For that reason, I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone that may have even slightly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;• The main ingredient of this product is denatured alcohol. (the *active* ingredient is SA) If your skin is normal, normal to dry or dry, this product will be too drying for you.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It feels like it is cleaning everytime I use it.  Perfect for a quick clean.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Use it every night. Makes my face feel clean. I use this at night than everyday wash my face with a face wash cuz soap seems to break me out. Than put on a face lotion and I feel so clean and fresh</li>
    <li> This gets five stars from me. It&#x27;s the best cleansing system I&#x27;ve found for my face. Most products are harsh and dry my face out or cause an acne flare up. Not these sweet babies. One swipe and I can feel the awesome cleansing power going to work. I use these every night before to get rid of the ick before I go to sleep. They&#x27;re the only product I use at my current location where I don&#x27;t have the luxury of time to use a proper fash washing system.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting them to do subpar work. Imagine my surprise when they went above and beyond their task as a cleanser to rid my face of irritating acne.....Also the pores on my nose look a LOT smaller than when I started. I&#x27;ve used these for about two weeks and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I use them I put on a dab of the Natural Multi-vitamin nourishing lotion they also create. Smells super nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m your average-basic fair skinned (pale) young adult!</li>
    <li> People claiming this is a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;... really? THere&#x27;s nothing special about this product, it&#x27;s just a very common acne remedy with a stupid \\&quot;acne stress control\\&quot; label poured over some cloths mixed with water and other inactive ingredients. The only ingredient that is doing anything is the s. acid... don&#x27;t be fooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some of the same thing with the same active and inactive ingredients at the 99 cent store. I figured I could try them out, even though I knew that for s. acid has just never done anything, and once again it failed to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it works for you that&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not because of some \\&quot;stress control\\&quot; cloth, it&#x27;s just the salicylic acid that&#x27;s on it.</li>
    <li> These have a nice scent to them, and leave your skin feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I love the face wash version of this product. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite. I like to work out in the middle of the day, and sometimes it&#x27;s inconvenient to find a sink and use real face wash and all the hassle that goes along with it. So, I was really excited to find that Neutrogena made a cleansing pad version of the formula. It does a great job. My face feels very fresh, with that refreshing tingle after using it. The reason I docked it a star is because the pads are so small. I wish they were a bit bigger to hold easier and get more mileage out of.</li>
