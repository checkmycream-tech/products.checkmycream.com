<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works like the cream I was prescribed by the dermatologist for sun spots. Your skin gets a little red, then the top layers flakes off and the skin that shows after that is less blemished &amp; smoother looking. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s like a milder version of a face peel. I personally use it a couple times a day till it starts to sting a little (that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working), then dead skin starts coming off a day or so later. I use some kind of liquid make-up stuff my wife has that matches the color of my skin to hide the redness for about 2-3 days. Then bam, new skin. Works on arms too. So I&#x27;m sure any where else you would want to lighten up a spot or two or just have smoother looking skin. Update: for those saying it isn&#x27;t working, keep trying. Everybody&#x27;s skin is different. Apply 2 min, 5 min, overnight (which is what I do) once a day, twice a day, whatever it takes till you get redness, irritation (some mild discomfort or pain), then stop, then peeling, then start over again as needed. Your dark spots and rough areas will improve a little with each treatment. That&#x27;s what you can expect. No, you will not have the skin you had at age 20. But your skins appearance and texture will continue to improve over time. I&#x27;ve got pretty tough skin so if I can get it to work...</li>
    <li> I had hyperpigmentation as a side effect of isotretinoin treament for my cystic acne. This product made my hyperpigmentation worse. Initially the area I applied this, turned red and darker compared to the rest of the skin.I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s difficult to use.  either you use too little and you don&#x27;t see results or you use too much and get a little burn.  burns go away, but i wish i&#x27;d saved my money</li>
    <li> havent seen any progress</li>
    <li> It makes my skin soft and like baby skin. My sun spots are fading. I don&#x27;t know what the negative reviews are about. If you read the instructions it says increase the time little by little. Almost all the negative reviews are when people apply for 1 min without seeing any effects, they increase to 5 mins the next time!! People, READ!</li>
    <li> I have allergy levels beyond the normal range, sensitive skin &amp; eczema, &amp; this product has cleared up my skin dramatically. I personally leave it on for two whole minutes prior to washing it off with cold water, with the use of a cotton ball applicator. Do not use your hands to apply this, your fingers will burn. It is normal to feel a tingling, slightly burning sensation, but it should not increase. Skin may be slightly red after rinse, which is okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Bio-oil 4.2oz after, then I apply my Aveeno Facial Cream after. Do not use a thick body lotion after on the face. That&#x27;ll re-clog your pores. I can say after a month of usage, my skin has transformed. The pigmentation is much more warmer, and consistent on my face, and my scarring has decreased dramatically. I do suggest this product if you suffer from hyperpigmentation and/or scarring.</li>
    <li> Excellent product if used CAREFULLY  and CORRECTLY with AMAZING results. Consult a Licensed Aesthetician or Dermatologist before trying this at home on yourself because there is a significant burning sensation involved that you need to be prepared for.</li>
    <li> i am  have olive skin The first time I put the acid on my face I left it on for 5 mint ,after 3 days of used it&lt;br /&gt;nothing happen  no peeling no result</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work well for me. My skin was so irritated and burning and swollen. I had to go to the doctor to get salve to put on my skin to get the swelling to go down.</li>
    <li> This Peel is absolutely AMAZING!!!!  It has transformed my skin completely!  I have had issues with Melasma/ Hyperpigmentation for 20 + years &amp; I have tried many professional glycolic peels &amp; microdermabrasion treatments...... I have never seen anything give me results like this &amp; so quickly!  I have only done 4 peels so far &amp; my pigmentation areas have faded by ~ 80%!&lt;br /&gt;In my experience this lactic acid peel is much more gentle on my skin compared to glycolic peels.  I would highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use and leaves your skin beautifully soft.  I would buy this product again.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my dark spots. At first I couldnt leave this product on for longer then 1min due to the heavy irritation and burning. After 2-3 uses I was able to leave on for 3mins. 5-6 times later I was able to leave on my skin for 5-8mins without irritation or burning my skin. After each use I netralize my skin with cool water and baking soda. It stops the burning and process immediately. 2nd I either use my dark spot corrector lotions or I may do a light microdermabrasion with my Kendal set. My dark spots and skin texture have improved extremely.</li>
    <li> I have used many of the peels from Perfect Image and this is definitely one of the gentler ones. If you&#x27;re an experienced chemical peel user like me, this probably won&#x27;t cause too much irritation. I like to use mine before masks as it helps exfoliate my skin and absorb creams and moisture.</li>
    <li> I bought this to get rid of hyper-pigmentation and acne scars. Though this product is actually quite effective, keeping myself in indoors for the next three days avoiding makeup and sunlight (which this product requires) is not a lifestyle I can afford. It&#x27;s important to be patient and let your skin heal fully between peels. I also believe that it makes your skin more susceptible to acne-causing bacteria, considering how vulnerable the skin is post-peel. I have had situations where I broke out afterwards. Effective, but kind of too much of a gamble for me</li>
    <li> First off, I would highly recommend this product.  This is a must in your facial product repertoire.  I started by leaving on face for 1 minute, then worked my way up in :30 increments.  Upon removing my face was the softest I have ever felt it.  I also find it very useful for the stubborn and occasional breakout.  It seems this product speeds up the acne recovery time 5x.  I will be ordering more, and have suggested it to both friends and family.</li>
    <li> This peel is amazing. It goes on smoothly and does not burn. It is simple to use and the results are amazing. I want to incorporate this product in my professional salon.</li>
    <li> I have used this peel several times, for five minutes or less, to make sure my skin could take it; and the results are super!  Follow the directions, don&#x27;t exceed the time; My skin is totally smooth, soft, and the solution not only did that but also started to help reduce the discolorations of long-term dark circles under the eyes.  I only used it on the very low part of the under-eye, at the cheekbones, because it said to avoid the eyes -- and it made a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have rough hands? This product is excellent for that, as well!  I rub it onto my hands as I would apply lotion, leave it on for 5 minutes and the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been two weeks since I used this product and my skin doesn&#x27;t need exfoliation yet!  I think this product is excellent and that by following the directions I got very pleasing results.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used to get Glycolic Peels at my dematologist&#x27;s office for about $75 per peel.  Personally, I believe this formula to be stronger than what my dermo&#x27;s office uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of leaving this product on for 10 minutes (the same time my dermo allows their buffered formula to be left on my skin) and this gave me a way deeper peel.  Some skin was immediately peeled off, revealing pink skin like a bad sunburn.  However, it&#x27;s this peeling that reveals nice, fresh new skin, but I would NOT recommend leaving this on for 10 minutes!  It was OK for me as I use glycolic products regularly and am a male and have thicker skin, but I would start with the recommended 30 seconds and work up until you get the depth of peel you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this (3 treatments so far) I&#x27;ve had immediate reduction in brown spots and a overall freshening of my skin.  Will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Did not  work for me .</li>
    <li> im a 25 yld asian american skin type is normal/combination with slight oiliness on t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;skin tone is light/medium in summer and light in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive always been obsessed with good skin and skin care regimen and etc since I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been blessed with good skin thanks to my mom(love u mom) but I had mild acne in high school and I still have&lt;br /&gt;some tiny ice pick scar/enlarged pores next to my nose. It&#x27;s barely noticeable to other people but I SEE THEM and when I apply make up I feel like I am covering up a hole with products and its not a good feeling...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive gotten lactic acid and TCA peel couple times from dermatologist&#x27;s office&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference after the peel since I would get mild tx that require little to no downtime but&lt;br /&gt;I did notice my face seemed brighter more even toned and my make up would apply smoothly like baby&#x27; skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided this is a definite addition to my skincare but I was hesitant to spend $150~300 every month...&lt;br /&gt;that would total up to about $3000 a year.... phew!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an RN and I thought... well why cant I do this at home myself?&lt;br /&gt;so I asked tons of questions to my aesthetition whenever I would get treatments and I did some research about types of&lt;br /&gt;peels and how to care for them after.&lt;br /&gt;Reading reviews on amazon definitely helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive used this peel about 3 times (once a month) and id say this is good for beginners&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt hurt THAT bad and it almost has little to no downtime.&lt;br /&gt;after prepping my skin with &#x27;Prep skin refresher&#x27; sold by Cellbone Technology, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;I only apply one layer for 5 mins and wash off with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;I make sure I get it all off.&lt;br /&gt;and my skin has this awesome glow afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use chem peel once a week and I rotate this and&lt;br /&gt;TCA 15% Gel Peel - Salicylic Acid 5% Enhanced with Botanical Extracts (Professional Quality Chemical Peel)&lt;br /&gt;by PERFECT IMAGE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TCA peelseems to be stronger and i also use this as a &#x27;dot peel&#x27; meaning&lt;br /&gt;i place little dot of this on problem areas using a toothpick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would definitely continue using products from Perfect Image.&lt;br /&gt;im sure I already saved tons of $$$ by stop going to salons to get chem peel done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think as long as you are very careful and use aseptic/clean tech&lt;br /&gt;you should be fine. If you have never gotten chemical peels before do a test spot on ur&lt;br /&gt;inner wrist to see if you are sensitive to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH and of course&lt;br /&gt;AVOID THE SUNLIGHT LIKE YOU ARE A VAMPIRE AND WILL BURN UNDER THE SUN IN ASHES BECAUSE&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL BURN :(&lt;br /&gt;it would be such a waste to do a chemical peel to improve your skin and actually&lt;br /&gt;cause more damage by running around under the sun after a peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i do have to go outside I wear&lt;br /&gt;46 spf pa++ sunblock with 30spf moisturizer and finish off with bb cream with spf 40 pa++.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i usually stay at home if I plan on doing the peel on my days off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for reading my review!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because a friend of mine who works in the cosmetics industry recommended I use a lactic acid peel . . . i picked this one because of the positive reviews on amazon . . . and was not disapointed. This product has evened out my skin tone and helped reduce acne and wrinkles. I&#x27;ve recommended to all of my friends!!</li>
    <li> it sting on the face and it takes a while for the result to show.  You&#x27;ll have a week or more burning look on your face.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! My main problems were age spots &amp; wrinkles and after using this product I have seen a major improvement. Be sure &amp; follow the instructions as directed and use your sunscreen! I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times but think it&#x27;s great.  I tested on my arm first, had no reaction after 5+ minutes. For my face, I left it on for only 2 min. first time, then rinsed with only water. Slight redness immediately following, but not alarming or painful.  I used again at least a week later and more stinging but again, not alarming or unbearable.  Great price for an at home option, MUCH less than spending $$ at the spa.</li>
    <li> The product was way too strong for my skin!  I left it on for only half of the time the instructions called for and ended up burning my skin. The burn caused a scab which turned into a very dark scar which is why I bought the product to begin with, which is to help with dark spot removal from acne scars. Well this formula even at half the time burned my skin! this was way too strong for me and caused more problems then needed.  It&#x27;s a good thing I used it as a spot remover instead of a facial gel peel!! That would&#x27;ve been a serious and painful disaster! If you are prone to hyper pigmentation, do not use this product! I purchased this 7 months ago and I still have the scar made by this product on my face. My doctor says it may take another 6-12 months for the scar to fully disappear with the treatment I am currently on to fix what this product did. The scar is the size of a pencil eraser!</li>
    <li> This really didn&#x27;t make a difference, good or bad. It stung a teeny bit putting it on, I left it about 30 seconds and washed it off. The next time I left it a little longer. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done anything or made any improvements. I&#x27;ll try it a few more times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got fish belly white but pretty tough skin covered with melasma which I am constantly battling. So, I was able to leave it on for a few minutes without any pain. Afterwards I applied lots of night cream but it still felt dry. Over the next couple of days my skin was a little flakey but it wasn&#x27;t too bad. The second time I did it, after putting on the night cream, I opened an E capsule and smeared it all over my face. It was greasy and gross but I was just going to bed anyway. This time, I haven&#x27;t had much flaking at all.</li>
    <li> This product delivers what it says it does :) Thank you so much for offering at such reasonable prices for such excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a review about this great product, so here it is.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it January of this year in hopes that would help clear my hyperpigmentation, common with people with dark skin like mine. I will admit, at first it burned! But it&#x27;s been a 6 solid months and after using it 1x per week, I&#x27;m proud to say it has worked efficiently to give me a clear, even face!&lt;br /&gt;3 cheers for lactic acid!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product to use to maitain the skin inbetween doctors office visits. Dores not iiritate the skin or cause peeling.</li>
    <li> This product burnt my skin and made discoloration worse. I used it once. I followed directions carefully. Hey it can&#x27;t work for everybody</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. I have olive skin and melasma and used the peel for 8 weeks. No burn, no difference just money wasted.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. I have been suffering from acne and acne scarring, but especially hyperpigmentation for about 7 years now. I always dread getting a pimple because no matter how big or small, it most certainly leaves a dark brown mark on my face. I&#x27;m indian and have naturally darker skin, and it just takes years for my skin to heal. I found out about this product less than a year ago and I can say that it definitely speeds up the healing process for my skin. I apply it once a week, usually the night before a day I know I won&#x27;t be doing much (like Saturday night), because you are not supposed to use make up for 24 hours after using this. So far, I have been leaving it on for 1:30 and following up with a second pass of about 1 minute. I rinse with lukewarm water and usually apply a very gentle moisturizer or oil. I&#x27;ve been using tamanu oil after applying this which is very gentle, non-comedogenic, and speeds up healing as well so I find they work well together. I think I will up the time I leave this on because my skin has not had any bad reactions to this. My skin usually does peel for a few days after using this so that&#x27;s something to be aware of, but it is not severe and I am still able to apply my usual makeup. I can&#x27;t say much about preventing acne, because my acne is strictly related to my diet and lifestyle, and is not a topical issue. I am currently going through a very bad breakout, first one in a while, so my right cheek is filled with more marks which is so unfortunate because my skin was looking great because of this product. I will be back with an update in a few months to see how well it continues to work.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Awful smell, awful tingling.  Broke me out horribly.</li>
    <li> it has so wired stuff in there not sure what it is inside with the gel</li>
    <li> This is a repeat order product for me. Consistently the peel products I order from Perfect Image are shipped quickly, well packaged, and with instructions for use. I use this particular peel once weekly to minimize sun spots on my arms and hands, from exposing my fair skin. The added bonus is that my skin is smooth and soft, and the spots are gently minimized, rather than a drastic peel. Ready for my next order!</li>
    <li> This really works well. Use it sparingly and follow the directions or you might make your scar worse. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every bleaching cream an none of them have worked like this professional peeling. it&#x27;s like getting a peeling at a dermatologist office for less money. I really recommend the serum to anybody. It has really worked for me and when I try something and I see that it really works I start reccomending it to all my friends. You won&#x27;t regret!</li>
    <li> I like what i see whit this product. I will continue using. The spots on my face are finally fading i have sensitive skin and it still work good for me. I am afro hispanic.</li>
    <li> My skin had really worsened after all those tanning sessions at the beach. Wrinkles and brown-spots were really evident on one side of my face that made my face look weird and unsymmetrical. I had previously used expensive creams and masks, but to no avail; they showed minimal or no results at all.&lt;br /&gt;Then a friend of mine recommended gel peels to me and I did a quick Amazon search on them. They turned up quite a few results but thanks to the overwhelmingly positive reviews on this Perfect-Image product, I went for it and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;After only two application (I use this once a week), my skin looked noticeably even-toned, bright and young. I would really recommend this peel to all those who are suffering from hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;A few notes of advice:&lt;br /&gt;&gt; ALWAYS do a patch test on an inconspicuous area of your skin before actually applying the product to your face. It is better than having a lobster-red face and spending a few hundred bucks at a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Always use an alcohol-prep pad before application, it increases penetration.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; When the peel is at work you will feel a stinging sensation throughout the area it is applied upon. To mollify it, sit with your face facing up, towards a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; After you have washed your skin don&#x27;t towel-dry the remaining water. Allow it to evaporate and cool your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Use a good moisturizer afterwards. [[ASIN:B000NURPK0 Suave Cocoa &amp; Shea Butter Body Lotion]] really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Use a SPF 30+ sunscreen WHENEVER you go out in the sun! These peels render your skin sensitive to the sun&#x27;s rays and you may end up with worse skin if you fail to follow this.</li>
    <li> OK product, I have used several peels, this one is an average product, I did not peel at all. However, for the price, it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I purchased this peel for my son who has moderate to severe acne. Nothing has worked so far. He started using the peel about 1 month ago - about 2-3 minutes 2 times per week.  The acne is beginning to go away; his skin is clearer, less red, and softer looking. He will keep using the product and we expect further improvement over the coming month.</li>
    <li> This gives a truly amazing feeling and noticeable  difference to your face!!!</li>
    <li> I love it ! strong ... yes!  however it has clear directions on it,  I can usually stand it on my face for about 2.5 mins.  My skin really looks amazing.  I must also add t hat I do use Kojie soap with it and WOW!  I am a pleased customer.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my skin soft and seems clearer for about a week or so after. I did mess up once and accidentally didn&#x27;t wash it all off in one area on my chin. Sadly it left a dark spot that I had to use Mederma to finally get rid of, so be careful!! But that was user error so as long as you follow the directions and are super careful you should be fine. The only downside is that I don&#x27;t feel like it helps enough. I might need to stick to professional peels.</li>
    <li> To be frank this product worked great at making my skin feel soft and that&#x27;s it. I was excited to try it when I saw the good reviews but it didn&#x27;t do anything for minor dark and sun spots on my face. I did try it for about 5 months now but still no changes. Also don&#x27;t try it within two days of anything major cause my skin would always get dry around edges like nose and peel for about that long.</li>
    <li> Its not as intense a peel as a professional chemical peel but when you combined it with the Perfect Image pre-peel cleanser you get a nice effect. It is a particularly good product for peel beginners. I am having my son use it as a treatment for his mild acne. He likes it and uses the pre-peel cleanser as well but it can be drying so use it only couple times a week.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months so far, my hyperpigmentation (caused by acne) is almost GONE!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I don&#x27;t need my PMD to exfoliate my skin!! Lactic Acid Gel is cheaper and does the same job :)</li>
    <li> Nice product! Helped me with fading keratosis scars which i got due to pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected from this peel, is fantastic for my type of skin, I have a mix of oily (t zone) and dry skin, I also have acne issues, the peel helped me tremendously!.</li>
    <li> Great product - very effective  BUT if you do not know how to use lactic acid -- PLEASE - start at level one and get proficient  THEN move up.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great when used as directed but can burn your skin if you are not trained to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin has to be trained to accept exfoliating products.  Start with this regime Level One - use the bottle completely  THEN move on to Level two.  Don&#x27;t get impatient - your skin must REGENERATE in order for you to move up.....( 20-42 days depending on your age).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this product you MUST use sunscreen religiously - otherwise you are exposing brand new skin to sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these tips sound harsh but it is to save you some time and grief.  (Esthetician)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now.  I use it twice to three times per week on my face, for about 10 minutes, before I shower. I find it  has dramatically diminished pores, my skin is smoother, and even dark spots are fading.  I LOVE it and have recommended to my sisters and friends without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be effective at reducing age spots and smoothing my coarse 60 year old skin. My skin is a medium to light olive&lt;br /&gt;shade and oily. I can leave the product on for a few minutes without a problem with irritation or burning but you should follow the directions first and increase time left on you skin slowly. The Perfect Image Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (POST PEEL) is wonderful! A fabulous combo!</li>
    <li> What I liked about this peel is the gel texture.  Stays put and allows to see coverage.  The Kojic acid and Bearbery is a great addition.  Had to leave on a little longer than Jessiner Peel but like the results better.  Peeling was even and drying was less.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product</li>
    <li> This seems to work well, but you must read directions and be careful. Can causej redness and dryness if used too often.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. After 1 bottle I saw zero change. And its mild too. It did not burn me like other people say it work. I even kept it on sometimes for 3 minutes.Is this for fairskin people only? My skin is the complexion of Dwayne Johnson the Rock and I was using it to try and lighten some brownish road rash scars I have from a 6 year old motorcycle crash. Do I need to buy another bottle? 1 bottle doesn&#x27;t work? IDK but I am not thinking it was just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, hoping to lighten my skin and reduce the visibility of dark spots on my cheek.  This product did not cause any irritation or pain.  The texture of my skin felt better afterwards, but it was not something that lasted for days.  Dark spots on my skin did not get lighter at all.  Based on other reviews, I guess this product is not so bad.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  But, I am willing to try other product from this manufacturer to see if I get better results.</li>
    <li> Ok product, been using it for about 3 months now</li>
    <li> Did not work as claimed on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have only used this 2 times but I love it.  It is not harsh and I definitely see a different in my skin just after 2 uses.  I will absolutely keep buying this. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a wonderful product but the instructions forewarn you that if you have the Keloid factor in your genes do not proceed to use. I wasted 30 bucks but I&#x27;m sure it works well.</li>
    <li> i use this once a week.  it is harsh and takes a couple days for your skin to relax.  use it at least 3 days before an event.  the results are fantastic.  sunscreen is a must.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel anything, no peeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;I expected at least something.&lt;br /&gt;I had to go to professionals to pay much more to get a stronger one.</li>
    <li> Did not affect me in the face .. debut left him 2 minutes ... did not affect me in the face .. only redness simple ... and the second time left him 8 minutes ... and the red face and the second day thing no mention of peels ... did not love him and shocked and will notI buy it again</li>
    <li> PLEASE BE CAREFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint extract in this peel intensifies the effect which really leaves no pondering as to why the directions state to leave it on for 1-2 minutes max. Anything longer will BURN your skin off. It&#x27;s as if I used a TCA peel on my face. This has really left me in fear of using another chemical peel again. I have to use the Obagi regimen to reverse the effects. Now, because of the burn, I look like I have a mask on my face that is a shade darker than my actual skin tone. Mind you this is after the dead skin sloughed off. Upset...</li>
    <li> I am delighted with this purchase, my first foray into peels at home. Perfect Image seemed like a reputable company with high-quality products, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. The product is extremely easy to use, with quality directions and results. I look forward to using other products in this line as well!</li>
    <li> First use was exactly as it was described to be, so very pleased!  am looking forward to further treatments.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. I do expect for it to be used professionally. The acid in the peel is very strong. Do expect peeling after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used the peel for the first time and I was surprised but it didn&#x27;t burn or get too hot.  So far, I&#x27;ve not noticed anything happening but I&#x27;ll try it again in a couple of days.  Per another reviewer I&#x27;m anxious to use it on my hands, they said it worked wonderful.  I love Amazon and the fact that there is so much info to be found on their site.  Going to try some of the other Perfect Image products.  Thanks Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve used the peel twice now, no peeling yet but it leaves my face feeling very soft.  I&#x27;ve not noticed any changed in skin tone but I&#x27;ll keep using it and hope I see changes.</li>
    <li> I am 53 years old and have had problems with discoloration of my skin. Not only have I had discoloration, but also brown sun spots. This product is truly amazing. Since I started using it, my skin has dramatically changed. My complexion looks clear, radiant and my skin looks much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I can leave this peel on for a good 8-9 minutes without any extreme burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and will truly buy it again, and again.</li>
    <li> I liked this product better than salicylic acid.  You just leave it on for 30 seconds and seems to be sufficient to exfoliate and add a beautiful glow to the skin.  For those who have had negative results I would recommend future users be very cautious leaving it on for longer without first testing a very small patch.  I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I just received this purchase.  I&#x27;ve only done a pumpkin enzyme peel and had one microdermabrasion dones so my skin isnt new to abrasive procedures, but it also isnt as accustomed as others may be. I am a darker toned african american woman and I read this was the gentlest form of acid for my skin. Because this is a 50% peel I read that it my be too strong for my skin and that you can dilute it by adding equal parts water which I did. Upon the initial application I didnt really feel anything after having it on for a minute and so I did a second layer with no dilution.  It started to tingle a little bit, but nothing drastic. I did use a baking soda and water mixture for neutralization, and then used an antibiotic cream and shea butter to add moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up this morning with a couple more pimples than usual, but I am just chalking it up to my skin purging.So far I dont see any changes. My skin still looks the same, but this is only the first application and I have read that you have to do a series of 4-6 before you notice any results. I will continue to update the more that I complete the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/15 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;It has been a little over a month since I started using this product once a week.  It has helped to clear up my acne TREMENDOUSLY...I have no bumps at all and if I do get any it may be one or two small ones but they&#x27;re gone in less than a week.  It has not helped with my hyperpigmentation which is what I purchased it for.  I even accidently burnt myself on one of the uses so I have a new mark to deal with.  Overall it is a good product if you use it correctly.  I accidentally went over the 2 min mark that I allowed myself and that is how i ended up burnt.  Hopefully with continued use I will get the skin I long for</li>
    <li> I use to my face for 3 mins feels burn, but not too bad than i use cucumber put on the face for couple hours, skin appears lighter, and smoother after 2 to 3 treatments</li>
    <li> I am a medium toned Caucasian woman in my early 30&#x27;s with significant sun damage to my face from tanning in a bed for several years. I have pigment issues and dark spots. I used this peel to help with that and its actually worked to &#x27;fade&#x27; the dark spots a good bit. They aren&#x27;t gone completely but are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions in the bottle. I can now use the peel more often but the first few times it made my skin burn and flake. Do not leave it on too long the first application. Overall, I thought this was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I used this product on a few sunspots and the peel made the spots darker.  I thought I might at least get some peeling, however I did not.  I realize there are those who love this product, and I am truly glad it has worked for them, but my experience was disappointing.  Thankfully Amazon has a wonderful return policy.  I will look around and see if something else works.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality but really strong, this peel is effective.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a spots from sun and acne, after this first month, I notice that my pores have gotten smaller, the sun spots and acne are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to trying other products of this line.</li>
    <li> I have been using this wonderful product to prevent proliferation of AKs, instead of paying a fortune at the dermatologist and undergoing the pain entailed in their aggressive treatments, not to mention unnecessary biopsies.  Results are not immediate, contrary to the expectations of some reviewers, but rather after a few days.</li>
    <li> The only results I saw was that it made my face burn and sting.</li>
    <li> The product does work, I would not expect miracles but it does make a difference in the way your skin feels. I can see improvements in my scars after only 3 tries, so I will continue to use this. I like what its doing so far, but only time will tell what it can do after 6 months or even a year.</li>
    <li> This product has worked amazingly in helping scars on my leg.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> tackles blemishes and scarring</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t recommend this more. I love what&#x27;s it has done for my skin, love the cost, and especially love that I have total control over how long it stays on.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work in terms of peeling. Thought it would have been stronger than it actually is</li>
    <li> This is a strong peel.  Be careful and follow the instructions.  I&#x27;d avoid this peel if you have been using ANY exfoliants like AHA or Retin-A in the last week, otherwise you may be badly burned, as I was.  I recommend using a cotton swab or gauze to apply these peels - it seems to give more control over location, and you can avoid your thin-skinned eye area more easily (if that is your aim).  This peel, when done correctly does seem to provide a healthy glow to the skin - but I saw no lightening of dark spots, my main goal.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I would avoid this peel - it gave me a permanent scar from a bad burn, even when used as directed.  My skin is not overly sensitive.  I&#x27;ve used a 50% Lactic Acid peel from another vendor that is much milder.  Perhaps the other additives in this peel could be the culprit, causing the burns.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me except burn and tingle when I put it on, used it for a month an saw no improvement. My skin just needs something stronger I guess.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a chemical peel but I have to say that I love this product and will be using it for  many years. My face looked \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; right after the first use. After trying EVERY skin lightening cream on the market this was the only thing that made a difference on my appearance.  I&#x27;m on the 4th time now and the melanoma/dark spots caused by pregnancy are almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU Ideal Image for a great product and Amazon for providing it at an affordable price :)</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff. I paid $150 for a face peel from an esthetician at my dermatologist&#x27;s. They recommend 3 face peels for the best results. The peel she used hardly even got warm and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, not even any pinkness. I was afraid I was going to sink $450 into face peels with no results, so I bought this peel to try it myself. I didn&#x27;t notice any significant peeling, but I felt tingling for a couple of days. My face was a bit pink, but my complexion really glowed. I will choose this over an expensive peel at the dermatologist anytime.</li>
    <li> I used another brand 50% glycolic acid at Amazon with lower price before. I loved it. I gave this product a shot because it has perfect reviews. I followed its instruction carefully and have used this product several times. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement. On the contrary, it burnt my skin so bad that I had to see a dermatologist, which costed me a couple of hundreds $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am double checking all the glorious reviews for the products offered by Perfect Image. I noticed all the reviews were written by anonymous people. The English all looks similar. Not only this product but also other products of Perfect Image all have perfect reviews, and all by annonymous people as well. I cann&#x27;t help wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just searched online. It seems that writing fake reviews by sellers is not uncommon nowadays. I am not saying this seller or his friends wrote all of the glorious reviews. My advise is that it is important to read the reviews carefully and compare different products carefully and make your own judgment.</li>
    <li> Only had a chance to use the peel once so far but the results were promising:  smoother texture, smaller pores, and overall younger looking skin.  I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using this product!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Latic Acid. I normally use Glycolic Acid Peels. This product is amazing! It&#x27;s very strong obviously its 50% so you have to be careful not to leave it on too long. When you use acid peels you will feel a little tingling and that&#x27;s normal. I am fair skinned but have sun spots on my face. I used this product as soon as I received it in the mail and left it on my face for only 1 minute 1/2 and then rinsed it off with cold water. I immediately saw a huge improvement on my face. My face looked more even toned and my sun spots were lightened a lot, they are almost gone! It&#x27;s been a week since I used the product so I will wait two more weeks before I use it on my face again since I don&#x27;t want my facial skin to get too sensitive. Keep in mind that after using this product you may see a little redness in your face but that&#x27;s normal, I actually used a banana oatmeal facial mask after the lactic peel in order to eliminate redness in my face from the peel and it worked great. I now use sunscreen at all times and use hats when I am out in the sun to prevent sunspots. I love the Lactic Acid because it&#x27;s an inexpensive way to improve any weathering damage or aging. If I continue to do my facials along with the Lactic Acid peels, I think I won&#x27;t have to do any botox or other cosmetic surgeries for many years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products similar to this one, but this peel is by far most effective. I have had dark spots from sun and acne for years and I&#x27;m noticing a change in my overall complexion as well as the dark spots.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and I definitely intend on continuing and hopefully seeing more noteworthy results. Try it.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product to remove some hyperpigmentation from around my neck.  While the product did nothing to improve the discoloration of my skin, it did tighten and tone my face, giving it a more youthful appearance.  It did not diminish any of my  wrinkles I am sad to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a product that will tighten and brighten your skin, this is the product.  If you need to deal with skin discolorations or fine wrinkles, you had best look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this peel. This is the first time I have ever tried a peel. Throughout the first week after the first treatment  (only 30 seconds too, as recommended for a first-timer) most of my huge melasma stains (could not even call them spots, stains in shapes of continents on my cheeks) are almost completely faded. I wish I took a before and after photos, because it is truly amazing. My skin is not very sensitive (Caucasian, dark hair, fairly light skin) so the burn is very mild, with almost no healing time needed, I didn&#x27;t even experience redness. The skin is very tight after the treatment, so you should definitely apply a moisturizer right away. I used my regular Aveeno Positively Radiant day cream. I just did a second treatment a week later, for a full minute this time. Still no complaints, hope it clears up my sun damage even better. Keep in mind, I strictly followed all the instructions: did a test on my forearm 2 days prior, prepped with rubbing alcohol, stayed out of the sun for a week, wore a sunscreen SPF 30 every day. Try this product, hope it works for you too, good luck!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent peel, tried another brand and no comparison.  It is as effective as the one I pay $100 for in the doctors office!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now on my second bottle of this.  I find the 50% Lactic Acid peel to be stronger than the 20% glycolic and a bit more drying, but also more effective.  Be careful about the amount of time you allow it on your face and follow the instructions! (I got a telephone call and left it on too long and had a few small blisters! Yikes). I have noticed finer skin tone and a slight diminution of my major wrinkle lines, especially around the mouth.  All in all, I recommend this for someone who has been using a lighter peel and wants to &amp;#34;graduate&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I can only use this once per week. Tried it twice and my skin got too rough and dry. When I do use it, it makes my skin so smooth. Love that part.</li>
    <li> Worst experience ever. It left me a bunch of dark areas. My face has pigmentation like world map! Should have never used it. Hope it will go away but it&#x27;s been a half month now and still there. I just want my original facial skin back. DON&#x27;T USE IT.</li>
    <li> While I do believe this is a great resurfacing treatment, it&#x27;s imperative for one to abide closely to the instructions. If you have sensitive areas, do not apply this peel to those areas, as excessive peeling and hyperpigmentation will occur. Besides that, I would definitely recommend using this product, just be careful, know you&#x27;re skin! Hopefully this will work for you, so far, it&#x27;s been pretty well for me. I&#x27;ll have to continue monitoring my skin to give an accurate update on consecutive use, as I have only used it twice.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so dry and I didn&#x27;t see any result yet after using it for 2 months...</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful at home peel.  I love the way my skin looks and feels after I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and I would say it really does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I will purchase this again because I don&#x27;t want to go without this.  My skin is a lot clearer.</li>
    <li> I thought it would work as a peel, I see no difference in my skin since using this product, pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Okay so to start off, I will say I absolutely loved how fast this was delivered to me. As for the actual product itself I would give it a 10/10. This stuff is STRONG!! and it WILL BURN! if you leave it on too long, which is what I did. I left it on way past the recommended time and it burned like a Mother!. It&#x27;s okay though if you experience this, just wash it off gently with cold or warm water gently with a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;Then wait like 20 min or so min before adding a moisturizer. Those of you using this for skin lightening, if your using HQ you definitely want to wait (If you left it on way longer like I did, you wont even be able to touch your face so wait until the next day to add your lightening agent) unless you can resist or immune to pain. In 48 hours the pain should be gone, you&#x27;ll just have a messed up looking skin for about a week and a half which is how long it took my face to exfoliate all the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD NEWS when all the dead skin has fallen off in a week, or so your skin WILL look AMAZING and  fell super soft.</li>
    <li> This is a good peel for your face. However when I first applied it burned my cheeks and burned them BAD! I did get them to look better after a few days with burn lotion and moisturizer. this thing is very powerful and please use caution when applying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;besides the burn i do feel my face has a brighter glow and very soft and smooth and I have gotten many compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin, and had bad acne in my teen years that left scars. I have tried several of your other products that work very well. This product does just what the description described. After using it for several months, I have noticed smoother skin, less visible acne scars, and also it has shrunken some enlarged pores. THANK YOU so much for a quality product!</li>
    <li> I was allergic to the peel. It gave my a bad rash all over my face.  I used it 3 times (within a 3 week period) as I wanted it to work so badly but alas on all 3 occasions I had the allergic reaction.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> product works well, recommend purchasing the wash to use afterwards to neutralize the peel. I did not and had to stop chemical reaction using baking soda mixture as the wash off procedure was not enough.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use. I have had a professional peel before, this peel is a bit &amp;#34; less&amp;#34; of a peel then a professional one. I leave it on for about 5 minutes. I do not experience any visible peeling. My skin does feel tighter and exfoliated after use. I will use up the rest of this product and them move to a higher concentrate peel.</li>
    <li> This product is great peels and reduces sun spots quickly. Just dont forget to wash and use alcohol pads before the peel for better results. I will be purchasing this item again</li>
    <li> This helps to calm down zits that come out once in a while. Do be careful because sometimes I get dry patches at some part of my face after using this. Overall it&#x27;s a quite satisfying product, and I&#x27;m thinking of trying other types of peels as well.</li>
    <li> This peel stings a lot but that&#x27;s how you know that the peel is getting rid of the top skin layers. Dead skin etc. If you do the peel about once a week (I do it twice sometimes because my acne and skin is so bad) it will last you a couple of months. I recommend using cotton pads to apply the product. Just squirt some onto the pad and wipe in problem areas. Over a few months I have begun to see my face lighten up so I plan on buying more of this product.</li>
    <li> Quite satisfied with this product and will be purchasing it again and also be recommending it to my friends and co-workers. Thank you.</li>
    <li> i have had freckles my entire life and I mean bad horrible brown and red and big blochy ones all over my face. I am very fair skinned, I have used this three times and have seen about a thirty to fourty% decrease in there appearance. Ive maybe used a fourth of the bottle so far. to for thirty dollars this product is amazing. I expect that by the time im half way done with the bottle my skin tone will be almost totally even. also its slowy been improving my skins texture. I never thought I had rough skin but after using this I realized how smooth it can really get. all in all it does what it said it would and what I bought it for. five stars!!</li>
    <li> Excellent peel. Very strong so be careful when applying to skin especially if you have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on pigmentation issues and acne scarring.</li>
    <li> Not good i bought this product and it doesn&#x27;t do anything..</li>
    <li> This is a great peel for home with medical grade results.  Got rid of sun spots. My friend tried some of my product and it completely got rid of her melasma.  Great product. Great results.</li>
    <li> this is my first time to write review. I really like the company&#x27;s service. but not this product.it burns my skin and it&#x27;s been a month, I still have the burning scars on my face.</li>
    <li> This Lactic Acid Peel has really helped to clear up my face and give it a nice glow. It went on nicely and didn&#x27;t burn too badly. I didn&#x27;t actually peel, but I did see results.</li>
    <li> The product works, but you have to be able to know how to use it. If you leave it on too short it won&#x27;t have as much effect, and too long may burn your skin. You can possibly even dilute it if your a first time user. But it definitely evened out the tone and texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> My skin was too sensitive for it. I used it on my face twice, it burned me around my mouth. I also broke out after using it. I think my skin is just very sensitive to lactic acid. I believe it is a good product because it is definitely potent, just not for me.</li>
    <li> I take one star for no negative provided. THIS is a HORRIBLE staff. It feels like something &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; your face by damaging the skill. the acid is too strong, although no any good performance shown in my face. JUST DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only written a review once or twice because I&#x27;ve gotten products that never seem to work. I must admit that I was skeptical of this product and afraid of the possibility of it burning my skin, but this has worked so great for me. You must have at least 2 weeks worth of patience for you to see the results but it&#x27;s well worth it. I used this for the first time and followed it with emu oil and aloe vera gel and it has worked wonders for my skin. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month and I&#x27;m starting to see my dark spots fade. My skin is 100% clear and I use this twice a week. I am mixed and I have sensitive skin so for this to work without any irritation is a life saver. Worth giving a shot!!!</li>
    <li> I love the Perfect Image line. You need to read the directions for use and adhere to them. This can burn areas that are more sensitive if you do not wash thoroughly. It is amazing what this product does...my cosmetic surgeon was so impressed with my skin tone and health.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the peel for my face but for my ankle and it works as it says it does. Definitely follow instructions and don&#x27;t leave it on for more than what it says. I also purchased the retinol a cream to use afterwards as someone else recommended to moisturize the skin and it works wonders. Great product to use.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my skin.  The first time I used it I only left it on for 30 seconds and it was plenty.  The second time I increased it to a minute, the third a minute and 15 seconds.  Once it starts burning I know it is time to take it off.  The directions have this step buried in it -- after you clean your face, wipe your skin down with rubbing alcohol!! It seems scary to apply acid but what I do is this: On a small cotton round apply the acid starting at your forehead working down.  Avoid your eyes and mouth.  After the allotted time wash off with lots of cold water.  Gently dry and apply a moisturize for sensitive skin.  For the next couple days wash your face with a gentle face wash and wear sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;  My pores are noticeable smaller, my sunspots are slighter and my skin is softer.</li>
    <li> Applied just a little bit to my face, I&#x27;m talking a few dabs onto my chin and on my cheeks just to try it, and I got a few red blisters. I guess I wasn&#x27;t meant to use this stuff. I&#x27;d recommend to not use it, but maybe my skin is too sensitive.</li>
    <li> The instructions in the box are detailed but still required some internet research to clarify things that were not easily understood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with the lowest dosage as instructed, 2 weeks later did the next step, 2 weeks later, did the next, etc until 10 weeks later I was at full strength. During the first 4 applications I was fine. My face was a little red when I washed it off but quickly faded. With the 5th application, which was the fullest strength, it burned my face and I had marks and severe redness for a week. I had no idea it was burning my face because it didn&#x27;t give a burning feeling. When I removed it with the water, I discovered the burn marks. The following morning my face was in pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hopped online to find a quick remedy and had already had a lotion that was suggested for burns. I used that along with some vitamin E and lavender oil (which is a antiseptic and promotes skin rejuvenation) to keep my face moisturized enough to keep from blistering. Luckily a few days into it I happened to have a doctors appointment and she ended up giving me a prescription cream that is for fading scars, which was why I was using the peel. I discovered the cream was also good for burns so I continued using that and within 3 more days I was healed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that 10 weeks of applications I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my marks, or my skin appearance in general. I know it takes a while to work show a difference but considering the 5 times I used it used about half the bottle, the money wasn&#x27;t worth it. The cream I have been using was about the same price (not covered by my insurance). I have been using twice a day for 2 weeks, with no side effects and have already noticed significant fading of my scars. I think I will stick with the cream and avoid the possibility of more burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating at &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34; because I have seen reviews where it has worked wonders for others. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I have to say I love this peel! It has brightened up my skin tone and got rid of those annoying fine lines that have started showing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sort of expected this, but what I didn&#x27;t expect, is that it has also faded my post acne hyper pigmentation - which used to make me very self conscious. This peel is strong enough to produce results but gentle enough to not damage or irritate my skin, which is fairly sensitive. Just make sure to stay out of the sun for a full day after you use the peel - seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, this is a great product at a incredibly affordable price. It&#x27;s nice to be able to have a professional peel without the big price tag. Perfect Image has a few other peel products that I&#x27;m really excited to try soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
    <li> Update#1: I just purchased this product and intend to send a regular update for this product.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it because I&#x27;m 39 years old female with multiple face problems:  fine lines, pores, black spots, acne breakout on the nose chin and forehead, blackheads, scars of old acne and oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last 25 years, I suffered acne and tried every possible acne treatment, topical or systemic. I was a regular dermatologist client and I did chemical peel before.However, with family and mortgage, I cannot afford it any more. So, I decided to use this product according to the reviews provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #2: Tuesday: 3/27/2012&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to receive the product yesterday, a week earlier than scheduled. The product was professionally sealed. Immediately after reading the instructions, I took photos of my face and I applied it to my face for 5 minutes. I felt a slight burning sensation for the first minutes for a few seconds, which disappeared. The next day my face was dried and a little itchy. I applied moisturizer and sun screen, it was fine.</li>
    <li> The product arrived at good time, and it is the very thing I wanted. It is very effective for what it is meant to do.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A SCAM. This product did NOTHING for me. It didn&#x27;t even burn no matter how long I left it on. I think all those great reviews are a hoax. Save your time AND your money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve suffered from large pores my whole life and after 1 treatment I can tell a difference!!</li>
    <li> I left this on my face a little longer than the recommended time and noticed no peeling or improvement over the course of the week.</li>
    <li> Wow, so much less expensive than going to spa. So far great results but I know what the product should feel like because I&#x27;ve had it professionally applied in past.  I was at no risk for burning my skin and am very cautious when using.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Latic Acid 50% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Kojic Acid &amp; Bearberry Extract.  I have been using the 20% Lactic Acid, which I can leave on for 4 minutes. The 50% is very powerful.  My suggestion is if you have sensitive skin, the first time you use it only leave on for 1 - 2 minutes. I felt it tinkle &amp; burning, but left on 4 minutes and had a little bit of a burn patch on both my cheeks. After it cleared my skin looked okay. Have to be very cautious the higher the percentages.  It is a good product, but be cautious to build up leaving it on longer unless you have real tough skin.  I wish they made the same Latic Acide at 20% with the Kohic Acid &amp; Bearberry Extract.</li>
    <li> Ive used it 3 times and it makes your skin look better after each use. It really does clear up discolorations and gave my skin a glowing look; helped with pores too and had kind of a lightening effect as well. The peel was somewhat mild so i leave it on longer, but try not to apply it to irritated skin [scratches etc]. It makes zits bleed if left on for too long, but then they dry up and heal fast.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, my fine lines are deminishing and my skin is brighter and younger looking. For the first week, I reccomend using the peel two times and then a three day break and do another peel. If you have sensitive skin,don&#x27;t leave it on for too long for it is very strong.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on its indication for melasmas and its ingredients (specifically kojic acid). I have used the product for several weeks now, and have had mixed results. While it did appear to have an effect on my acne and skin softness, likely a result of increased skin turnover, I have not experienced even the slightest reduction in the appearance of melasmas. While I understand these are difficult to treat, I did get my hopes up based on other product reviews and the claims on the package. Overall, I think this is a reasonable buy if you use it as a refreshing spa treatment, but do not expect a spectacular outcome.</li>
    <li> After the birth of my daughter my pregnancy melasma didnt go away! I was horrified! I thought i would have to live with this the rest of my life...but im on my second use of the Lactic Acid peel &amp; my melasma is fading &amp; my face is brightening up! I even gave my mom a face peel last nite! Ive decided to try their other products because with results like this you cant go wrong! It even has a great minty smell! Thanks Perfect Image!</li>
    <li> I started off with 30% lactic acid peels at my esthetician&#x27;s office, but felt I was not getting the results I desired.  I happened across this product and figured \\&quot;hey, why not?\\&quot;.  After the first use (4 minutes) I could see a dramatic difference in my skin tone and the way my skin felt to the touch.  After my second use (one week later) my boyfriend told me my skin looked very pretty.  This was in the morning, with no makeup!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a professional grade formula, so be sure to follow the directions.  Do not overdo it- I made that mistake this week, and hyperpigmented the tip of my nose (the skin started to turn a tiny bit whitish after 6 minutes).  That being said, I&#x27;ll just wait a week and a half before my final peel (I&#x27;m doing a series of 5, then stopping for 6 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to trying other products in this line.  Flawless skin, here I come!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff does nothing but make your skin feel extra greasy, yuck! I tried to look up reviews on other sites and could not find any, that should have been a hint to not buy this junk. Waste of money for sure!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now.  I do one peel a week, leaving it on for about 5 minutes.  I have not had any major burning or stinging, it&#x27;s pretty comfortable to use.  After this first month, I notice that my pores have gotten smaller, and my skin has a healthy \\&quot;glow\\&quot; that I have been missing for a long time.  I am 43 years old, have some signs of sun damage including sun spots and crow&#x27;s feet.  My sun spots are almost gone!  Still have crow&#x27;s feet, but they seem softer.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Pretty good peel that doesn&#x27;t sting as much as others. Quite viscous, this isn&#x27;t the astringent-type peel that feels like strong salycid acid, but is bound in gelatin or something like that.</li>
    <li> I think this is too strong for me...it burned my skin...now I&#x27;m afraid to use it again.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed Esthetician and I purchased this for my small business.  It performs perfectly. I recommend Perfect Image Lactic Acid 50%.  I have ordered this brand before and I will use it again! IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> I am a man in my early 30&#x27;s who is trying very hard to take care of his skin.&lt;br /&gt;I eat well, exercise, drink plenty of water and take a collagen supplement to help with my skin. I don&#x27;t smoke or drink but I&#x27;ve recently noticed that my skin is starting to look dull.&lt;br /&gt;After a large amount of research I found this peel, it has shrunk the appearance of my pores, and given me a glow that lasts. I look very fresh faced now. I repeat this peel every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, my skin is fairy resilient to this peel; I never have red splotches or burning which is sometimes associated with chemical peels. But, my skin isn&#x27;t very sensitive either and I am still fairly young. I scrub my face with an exfoliant, cleanse with Kiehls Cleanser, follow up with this peel for 12 minutes (long time for most, but I have fairly tough skin) wash off, then follow up with Kiehls Recovery Serum.&lt;br /&gt;I wake in the morning and gently wash and then apply my standard moisturizer.</li>
    <li> works well dose peel I follow initial directions first time 3 minutes next 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before I purchased this product. Tried it for the first time last week. It really does what it says. I read the instructions and you are supposed to dilute it with 50% water before you put it on your face. I don&#x27;t think you can put the gel directly on your face. It didn&#x27;t take away my spots, but I only did it for 30 seconds that one time. It left my skin feeling wonderful. I have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t think I can do it twice a week, but definately will try once a week.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product to help with dead skin cells. It does sting a bit if you leave it on too long.</li>
    <li> I liked this product a lot although I had to be very careful because random parts of my face were more sensitive than other parts. Follow the instructions as given. I ended up creating some dark spots due to the peeling and scabbing of the extremely sensitive parts of my face. Luckily, it wasn&#x27;t anything that was irreversible. The product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but you must take proper care of your skin before and after the treatment. I noticed much smoother and more even texture after the second use. I also used SPF 50 to protect afterwards. The only complaint I have is that the markings on the dropper began coming off with repeated use if there was another measuring tool - it would be even better.</li>
    <li> I have sun damage on both sides of my face, the cheek area.  I typically get a microderm and peel once a month and they use Kojic Acid on the sun spots.  I use this each week in between visits for the microderm.  I am very pleased with how it makes my skin look fresh and it keeps the sun spots at bay.  In the winter I will probably use the Pumpkin peel.  Great product, great company.</li>
    <li> Not sure it did much for my age spots.</li>
    <li> Excellent peel...  with any peel you have to be careful and follow the instructions, which I do and I get great results.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes when purchasing this item....I followed instructions but saw no change in the appearance of my skin..None!</li>
    <li> I am a black 45 yr old female with major dark spots due to to hair bumps, I have been using this for 1 month and have noticed a significant change in my complextion. I use this twice a week and keep my regular skin regime with Clinque as well. The 2 work very well together. Use caution, follow directions works wonders.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My biggest skin problems are post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from acne.  They usually linger for weeks/months on end.  I try to use this product on a weekly basis because it helps significantly.  I can see a difference the next day!  Just be careful - this is a very high strength and you&#x27;ll have to be conscientious of your skin&#x27;s limit.  I burnt my skin with this product one of the first times I used it.</li>
    <li> I have had professional facial peels done and was very happy with them.  I saw this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It works as well as the professional peels that I have had.  Takes care of dark pigmentation over a short period of time if you do a weekly peel.  Your skin is brighter and fresher looking with a tightening feel to it after the peel, even days afterward.  Now for another great use is for your dried and rough skin on your feet.  Soak feet and clean with a brush and soapy water.  Rinse and dry your feet.  Wipe your  feet with alcohol and wipe dry.  You can leave it on longer than 10 minutes, the longer the better.  I do this weekly  when the weather is dry, I live in California.  Afterward, just use Eucerin Original Healing Rich Formula, put on socks overnight if you do it before bedtime, and wake up and enjoy smoother and softer feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my entire life it seems like and this product helps me keep it more in control. My skin is not sensitive at all so I have not had any problems with my skin turning red or drying out. I do notice that when I use it my skin feels softer and my makeup goes on smoother.</li>
    <li> Love it I would definitely recommend it. Please be sure to read the warning and take caution in the time/duration its placed on skin it will definitely burn you if its on too long</li>
    <li> SO far so good. I have used many at home chemical peels. Glycolic peels tend to work best and salicylic typically for me does not work. I have both hyper-pigmentation and acne. I am 35 years old and have had chin acne since my mid twenties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product twice and noticed right away that it was stronger than other acids I have used so I knew to back off on the application time. Already there has been a slight lightening of my pigmentation on my forehead. The real test will be a brown spot that is about the size of a dime on my cheek. I will update this post after I have used the product for a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> I HAVE SPENT (AT LEAST) $400.00 TRYING TO FIND A PRODUCT THAT WOULD FADE (IF NOT) REMOVE MY AGE SPOTS ON MY FACE. AFTER SO MANY TRIES I FIGURED I WAS DOOMED TO SEE A DERMATOLOGIST.THEN I SAW PERFECT IMAGE.I DECIDED OK ONE MORE TRY AND IT&#x27;S A DONE DEAL.WELL , I AM SO GLAD I TRIED THIS PRODUCT. IT REALLY,REALLY WORKS! I HAVE DONE ONE SIDE OF MY FACE AND AM SO HAPPY I COULD CRY. DO FALLOW INSTRUCTIONS. YOU WILL EXPERIENCE REDNESS AND A LITTLE BURNING,BUT NOTHING HORRIBLE.WHAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE IS NO MORE BLOTCHY DARK SPOTS ON YOUR FACE. HAPPY,HAPPY,HAPPY ME.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend that buyers do their research and read the instructions carefully.  My face scabbed in areas where I left them on too long the first time I used it.  However, to me, it was an indication that this product does work as promised.  I used it the second time a couple of nights ago, and this time I left it on for 5 minutes.  No scabbing, so far.  I do notice that my face&#x27;s hyperpigmentation has faded a little since I started using it less than 2 weeks ago.  They recommend using it for up to 6 weeks, so that&#x27;s what I plan to do.  Since it is a very potent product, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it for more than once a week.  My face burned and reddened after I use it, and applied plenty of moisturizer afterwards to help with the healing process.  I&#x27;m also using a medicated cream for my acne since I started using this product, so I can&#x27;t tell if my acne reduction is caused by this product or the other (or both!).  However, I haven&#x27;t had any side effects from this product.  I used a brush to apply it to make sure I had enough on my skin.  I suggest applying it as quickly as you can to make sure your face is covered evenly, because you will want to wash it off quickly when it&#x27;s time.  It&#x27;s a small bottle, but it&#x27;s more than enough for 6 weeks.  I intend to use it for a few more weeks to see the results. So far, it&#x27;s working just as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> As an experienced user of chemical peels, I am willing to try a variety of products for comparative purposes.  The gel peels sold by Perfect Image LLC, including the Lactic Acid 50% peel reviewed here, are the best I have bought.  The dropper allows for controlled application (I squeeze the viscous liquid onto a cotton facial pad); the consistency of the product is syrup-like and not watery.  There is no waste or fear of drips irritating the eyes.  There is no detectable odor.  Follow the directions as indicated, wiping on a thin application (I wash my face first with a cream-based non-abrasive cleanser and dry it; gentlemen:  no shaving first) and leave it on until you feel a tingle.  Rinse well with clean water and a small amount of liquid soap.  Pat dry.  Your skin will look brighter, clearer and smooth.</li>
    <li> THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.  I&#x27;VE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE LAST 6 MONTHS.  I&#x27;VE EVEN LEFT ON OVERNIGHT AND ENDED UP WITH SOME DRY SKIN BUT THAT WAS IT.</li>
    <li> As I am getting older and realized that me and the sun have had a love/hate relationship I have developed sun spots and a big continent on my forehead. After about 3 months of weekly to bimonthly use I and others have noticed a difference. I will continue to be consistent and appreciate the effects. Thank you perfect image ;)</li>
    <li> I started to notice some sun damage on my face about 2 years ago.  The last year a few spots began to darken around my eye area, and makeup wasn&#x27;t completely covering them up. I&#x27;m only 36, so I wanted to do something about this before it got worse.  I tried a handful of over the counter lightening creams and they really did little to help me.  I was looking into getting treatments, but was a little apprehensive to spend a few hundred dollars.  I began looking into different peels and did much research before I decided to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this peel and this is how it played out.  applied the peel  to a clean face after doing a test the day before....  I left the peel on for about 5 mins then washed my face.  There was a slight burning sensation that did go away after about 20 mins.  I had a few spots of irritation around my eye area, and a few spots that I had pimples underneath the skin.  I applied a good moisturizer  and went to bed.  The next day my skin felt tight, and had a few very dry patches and the spots of irritation had darkened.  The second day, my skin started to peel (this is not a dramatic peel, my skin began to flake, like it would if it was very dry)  sun damaged spots appeared lighter.  each day after that my skin was less dry and the sun spots were indeed lighter by the end of one week.  The texture of my skin is much smoother and some fine lines also look to have faded.  I plan on continuing to use this peel...  I love it and I&#x27;m actually surprised with how great my results were.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 3 times so far and have only done it once a week although you can use it twice per week. I am a red head with very fair and sensitive skin.I thought a glycolic peel would be too harsh for my skin, so opted for the lactic acid peel instead. This peel is great. It definitely had a little sting to it the first time and I could only leave it on for 2 minutes. The next 2 times I was able to leave it on for 5 minutes. Again, some stinging but not too bad. Once you rinse the peel off, the stinging goes away. My face was red for about 10 minutes but that&#x27;s it. My face peels only slightly about the 3rd day after using the product and the peeling lasts for about 3 days or so. I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin after the first use. It was much smoother. I have some dark spots that are starting to fade and my wrinkles are already much less noticeable around my mouth, chin and forehead. My skin tone is much more even. Definitely a great price for the wonderful results I see so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item 3 weeks ago. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product worked. I did my initial treatment on Wednesday than another on Saturday and a final one on the following Wednesday. ( I have stepped down to once a week now).  My skin is a lot brighter and my age spots have lightened. My shin looks to have a more even tone. The slight draw back is the peeling process. It takes about a week and a half to fully peel. ( I have learned that you can use tweasers to peel off some of the skin, just be careful not to pull to hard). After three weeks I am completely satisfied with this product and I will punches it again when I need to resupply.</li>
    <li> Hoped this product would help lighten up acne scars on my face. It literally created burns on my skin and looks worse then before I used the product. I would not recommend anyone to use this product. [....]</li>
    <li> I have noticed minimal change as of the first month but I am a darker skinned African American so thats to be expected. It does make your skin feel refreshed and seems to be gradually working however the downside is very sensitive to the touch skin albeit temporary. Lastly, if the product is left on too long on the initial usage it will burn the skin so follow the instructions exactly or risk ending up with scabbed and dark burn spots on your face</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to remove skin tags, dark spots, wrinkles and general uv damage. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent peel. If you are to use it you need experience with it on your skin. I advise to start with 30 sec exposure and increase by 30 sec increments each time. Excellent quality but really strong. Have to find your optimal exposure time.</li>
    <li> No dark marks after peel. Lighten sun spots. It is thick which it will not drip on skin. It works. excellent product.</li>
    <li> Yuck. It burned my face,broke me out,left me a scar,and totally ruin everything. Ugghh. Fast shipping though. I&#x27;ll just stick with the 20% one.</li>
    <li> I have had chemical peels at spas and it doesn&#x27;t come close to the results that this product does. It does leave my skin soft afterwards. I recommend using it once, nor more than twice a week as you want to allow new skin cells to generate. It is so simple to use, but it&#x27;s very important to be careful on how you prep your skin and how long you leave it on. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin normally, but there have been some times where I have left the peel on too long, or have exfoliated too hard prior to application, and caused my face to have red blotches and eventually course skin a few days later due to tiny scabs from the burning of the skin. It scrubs off a few days after that, but if you do it right, you won&#x27;t get those results. Out of the several times I have used this, this only happened a couple times and it was simply due to leaving it on too long or extensive exfoliation prior to application. I personally like to do this on a Friday night so that I don&#x27;t apply any makeup the following day to give my skin some rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am not an esthetician, I googled &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; videos on applying it correctly and here&#x27;s what&#x27;s worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;1. Lightly scrub face with a course washcloth prior to application so that it loosens dead skin cells. DO NOT use apricot scrubs or course scrubs as this will leave tiny &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; in the skin which makes the peel burn those parts.&lt;br /&gt;2. Wipe the face with alcohol to free it of any oils and germs.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply Vaseline around the eyes, creases in the nose, and around lips, so that the peel does not get on those areas. Those are sensitive areas that can lead to burning/peeling of skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;4. Drop one full pipette of the peel into a glass dish/bowl and with a fan brush (recommended) apply the peel all over the skin, starting with the forehead and working your way down. Carefully avoid eyes, nose creases, and lips, or any open skin such as acne areas or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;5. Leave on for about 2 - 3 minutes. It will burn/sting for about the first minute, then nothing, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not still working. Leaving it on too long can result in the face looking sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;6. Wash off with tepid water and apply, if desired, with light oil free lotion.tes. It will burn/sting for about the first minute, then nothing, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not still working. Leaving it on too long can result in the face looking sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;6. Wash off with tepid water and apply, if desired, with light oil free lotion.</li>
    <li> Burnt, blistered, then scabs for several days, after following the directions carefully &amp;  left it on face less than 30 seconds</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this product. I used a light layer, 3x weekly, VERY gradually building from 1 to 3 minutes. Rinsing thoroughly is critically important. My dark spots were 90% gone in most places. A couple of very dark spots in an area with some acne scarring were significantly lighter, but will take more time. Short duration and light layers worked most effectively for me. I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It does the job and I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I assume most of these reviews who say their skin peeled off right away are females&lt;br /&gt;I have dark areas around my arms and knees from outdoor activities and wanted to peel off the dead skin that wouldn&#x27;t go away with just scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;The product works at getting rid of the top layer of skin eventually but I had to use it more frequently than the directions said (once a week) and used it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on my cheek a bit because I thought the reviews were based on facial skin instead of the body, but it&#x27;s not really a strong acid like the reviews led me to believe. Didn&#x27;t feel any stinging, didn&#x27;t see drying peeling skin, but still satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would lighten my melasma spots, but I have used product twice and I have not noticed a slight difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s not too strong. It helps with hyper pigmentation and acne. You could experience some tightness and dryness  the next day after use, but you should also notice improved clarity. For the price, it as amazing product! I only give it 4 stars because the results are not drastic. The improvement is noticeable but moderate. I have used it twice a week for about a month and I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this product I read all the reviews here on Amazon. I find the reviews very helpful when I am thinking of purchasing from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a white 58 year old woman with light skin, a history of teenage acne. the teenage acne that left scars, along with coming from a British background prompted me to begin taking care of my skin at a very early age. My background believes that a woman begins taking care of her skin at a very early age. This attitude has done me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a history of 4 deep TCA peels done by a plastic surgeon. I would not do such a deep peel as what the surgeon does. My skin is too thin (nordic heritage) and very sensitive. I have never used a peel of this strength before but I read the reviews which I always find very helpful and decided that I could do this peel myself. That being said, I was careful, did not over do it and did not expect a miracle. I did not get a miracle but I did get a good enough change to the texture of my facial skin to say YES, I will use this in my skin care. I suspect every three months would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really want to use this for next is my hands, legs and arms. If you are my age and reading this you might agree that moisturizer just does not take off that flaky, dry, thin skin that a woman begins to get at a certain age on her body. I plan to use this product to see if I can exfoliate these areas as a form of maintenance. For the price point it is well worth the product and although I will continue to have deep peels done by a doctor every 3-4 years this product is certainly a very good maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update about my hands and arms when I have the time to try this on my legs, arms and hands.</li>
    <li> Tried several times and although it tingles, no results are seen. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I tried several different leave on times. None worked.</li>
    <li> I was initially afraid to use this product as I didn&#x27;t realize it was a peel. It burns just a little if it is near my hairline. I leave it on for 1 or 2 minutes and wash it off. My skin never felt so smooth and rejuvenated! Try it, you&#x27;ll like it like I do.</li>
    <li> I started with another product for peels about 8 months ago and was disappointed with results. As such, I was hesitant to try a new product, but after reading the reviews, decided to give it a try. It was a great relief to see results 4-6 weeks after following the routine that they recommended. Really enjoy the product and can see the results every day. Will definitely be a repeat customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Bought the product without knowing any of the \\&quot;Extra\\&quot; benefits that Kojic Acid and bearberry Extract would bring to the table. I have used this product for a total of 11 peels,..and must confess that it makes your skin \\&quot;glow\\&quot; after the peeling process. Not red or patch marks. Would highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used the lactic acid peel and the glycolic peel for about 4 months.  I have had no adverse reactions to either and have seen some improvement in my skin.  I am a bit older so anything that makes me look younger is great.  There is a tingling sensation when you use it, but it is not uncomfortable.  I use lots of cool water to rinse and then a moisturizing spritz and all is well.</li>
    <li> make sure you apply it evenly and not too often because it will continue to work after you wash it off, moisturize afterwards it helps tremendously and apply sunscreen as well</li>
    <li> This product works as described but you should be careful!  I left it on too long one time and got a pretty good burn.  Other than that, I like the product and results.</li>
    <li> I am tan-skinned and hyperpigment very easily - so this product has been great.  I use it on my back where I tend to get dark spots from occasional breakouts.  After a few applications (once per week) I can see a definite improvement in the dark spots.  The product smells good and is easy to use.  Be sure to read the instructions carefully because if you leave it on too long or do no use the correct methods to apply or remove it (use an applicator brush and remove it with cool water), it can cause irritation, even a slight burn.  Who said beauty was easy?</li>
    <li> The 50% lactic acid peel is the best skin clearing and brightening I have every used. My skin is pretty resistant to harsh products so I use it 1-2 times a week for the full 5 minutes. Although it burns while on the skin, it does not leave any irritation once is cleansed off. I alternate with Philosophy micro-dermabrasion system to slough off the dead skin after the lactic peel. Wait for at least 24 hours so as not to overtax the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will reorder.</li>
    <li> Great at home peel helps really reduce fine lines and other imperfections.  I use it once a week and have been using it for about 2 months and can really see a difference.  It&#x27;s like my skin is totally refreshed.  Will continue to purchase.  Seller is great too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have hyperpigmentation. I have been using it for a few weeks now and have noticed a big difference in my dark spots. They are going away. Make sure you follow the directions and don&#x27;t leave it on too long.</li>
    <li> This is my third time buying this product. I mean I am completley satisfied with this product. I have used many other products to clear up some old and new dark spots on face that really brought my self esteem down. Many people can relate. But I used this product a little bit more than usual after reading other peoples post. I tried it and the results came quicker with monitered doses. So basically, I used this product 3 times a week at about 8-12 minutes at a time and quickly washed off with cold water. So glad I tried it. I actually cancelled my dermatologist appoitments because after about 1-2 months, all those scars were about gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, it works.</li>
    <li> Not working on my face. Never buy again.</li>
    <li> Waiting, but no difference.</li>
    <li> Beware that if you are a first time Lactic Acid peel user....this will BURN your face if not done properly. I have done a lot of acid peels from Perfect Image and this one is by far the strongest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of putting it somewhat close to my eyes (like on my dark cirlces\slashes under my eyes). It immediately burned it and became very red. Do not make the same mistake as I did. That skin is way too thin and sensitive to have this strong of a acid peel on it. Before you apply the peel, swipe your face with alcohol on a cotton ball and put vasoline under your eyes, around your nostrils, and your lips. They apply the peel ( i used the little fan brush that they recommend). Leave it on for only a minute for your first time, then rinse your face with room temperature water. If you&#x27;re face is still burning and feels like needles are prickling your face, mix up a little baking soda and water (to make a paste like consistency) and gently smear all over your face to neutralize the peel. Leave it on for a minute or so, the gently rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a vitamin c serum and a very good moisturizer afterwards. Thankfully the combination of those two prevented me from severely ruining the skin under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little scary, but if done correctly and patiently, the outcome it fantastic. I have fair skin with a LOT of freckles. I&#x27;ve only done the peel twice, and I have noticed a dramatic difference in the coloration of the freckles. Hopefully after a few more peels, they will fade away. Make sure you use a sunscreen if you&#x27;re going outside. The higher spf the better.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described.  Will definitely be buying another bottle once mine is gone! Be sure to start off with 30 secs to one min and then work your way up to a longer time!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping it would get rid of age spots, well it got rid of the spots and also removed some smaller wrinkles to.&lt;br /&gt;I now have much younger looking skin and my friends ask me what I do to have such beautiful skin. My skin looks younger and it has a beautiful glow to it so I don&#x27;t have to wear hardly any make-up anymore. I just love this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it doesn&#x27;t work!!!!</li>
    <li> I have spent a LOT of money in the past for peels that cost a LOT.  I tried this product after checking the reviews.  Considering the peel is not medical grade it provided good results for the money spent.  I did not peel much.  Still my skin was glowing and dewey after the peel had been applied four days.  Great results.  i&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times now, and I&#x27;m not noticing any difference on my skin. The other day I decided to leave the application for longer than five minutes to see if that&#x27;ll help. I left it on for 9 minutes and I felt my skin was burning. The peel burned my skin, but mostly my acne parts. I have a pimple that&#x27;s now super red. I hope it goes away. I am going to continue to use this product until I finish it (I did pay around $35 for it), but I know it&#x27;s not really doing anything for my skin. I bought for the purpose of getting rid of my acne red marks, but this product is not helping diminish their appearance whatsoever. Also, this is my very first product review on Amazon, and I felt I should review this product since it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t peel my face like I wanted. Don&#x27;t see drastic results but then again I wasn&#x27;t consistent. If u have sensitive skin don&#x27;t use this. It is strong n it does burn. My skin is tough so I could leave on awhile but around the crows feet and crooks of nose were extra sensitive. Def have to watch length u leave it in for. I like this stuff though and will be more consistent with it. My skin was rosy and had a nice glow afterwards. I felt like I just got an intense facial. Moisturizer and sunblock after though.</li>
    <li> Updating on Feb. 18, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried 4 times. For the first time, I put on my whole face, it does not work on my dark spot but burned my left face, and left a small scar/print, and I still want to give it a try/chance because I wanted to get rid of my dark spots so much, so I tried the 2nd time, only for the dark spot area, and I gave shorter minutes for 2 minutes this time, doesn&#x27;t work except some red rush. For the 3th try and 4th try, it did not even get red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark spots are still there not even lighter. This product does not work out at all, and can not be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I put it on, I asked question about what if I put only on the dark spot area on the skin and got no answer. The post was deleted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested on my hand on the dark spots, and got no peel, no change, and a little sting, and then I put on the full face, what I got is some red area on my face, there is no peeling, and no improvement on the dark spots at all but some wounds maybe burned by the acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the second day I did it, maybe I need to wait for couple of more days?</li>
    <li> So far have applied the peel three times for 5mins each.  I&#x27;ve had peels before at a dermatologist.  This is so much better than the doctors office.  Already seeing results.  Will update after 10 applications.  Sun, age and acne spots all fading and skin looks even and is soft.</li>
    <li> Hope this one is great! I read all reviews. Item arrived fast and as shown. I am going to try it tonight. :)&lt;br /&gt;After trying it I must say this product is AMAZING. It removes dark spots forever! REMOVES for good! So you apply a really small amount to cover the dark spot and leave it for a minute or so. Wash with warm water and soap. Two day later same - leave a bit longer. Two days late same. Then you notice dark spot just dries out a simply peals like if you tanned too much and peal. After repeating the above for 3 more times I got rid of 3 ugly dark spots I had on my neck and face. My skin looks amazing now and dark spots are GONE. I tried all different creams earlier and nothing really worked. This one does the job! I would not recommend using it for the whole face due to the fact that it peals and it might be a bit much. This product is BEST on the market - I think so and I have no dark spots any more! xoxo</li>
    <li> I am 45 yrs.old, so I really take good care of my skin. Product works well, so far I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for only two weeks so I can&#x27;t say much just yet, but I do like it. I started off with 30 seconds, but I personally didn&#x27;t feel anything happening. So the next couple of days (I left 4 days in between), I decided to start up again and I did one minute. The next four days, I did it for 5 min and it went well and 5 more min the next four days. It went great. My skin def. does look brighter. I did get burn a little on my chin, but it&#x27;s fine and makeup can cover that great. Still trying to see if my acne will clear up. I&#x27;m not expecting it to do that, but I am looking forward to what it does to my hyper pigmentation from acne. : ) Wish me luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re just starting to look into lactic acid peels or peels in general, this is a great place to start. Also, look into MUAC&#x27;s lactic acid peel too. They have it at 40%. Heard great things about them too. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I was not sure at first but because of the good reviews I thought I would give it a shot. To be honest this chemical is very good be careful not to keep it on to long pay attention to the directions I am African American mid 40 woman over years I have gotten some blotchy uneven spots there are not bad but to me I wanted to get rid of but not pay an outrageous price to have it done professionally at someone&#x27;s Doctor office so I was excited when it came I&#x27;ve been using it every 2 weeks for almost 3 months &amp; my skin is flawless it really works make sure you get a good SPF to put on afterward I use Vichy silkscreen  45 because it&#x27;s oil free. I will be buying another bottle soon</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I like this product or not. I have burned myself about 3 times. I can&#x27;t take more than 3 minutes still. I really don&#x27;t know if I see much of a difference. Though when I first started using it I felt I looked much glowier- but now it just burns me each time. I dunno.</li>
    <li> I have olive to light brown skin that scars easily after a breakout. This renews my skin faster than if I were to let my skin run its natural course. The dark spots improved after a couple uses. Just don&#x27;t use it too frequently because it&#x27;s strong and stings. I used mine about once a week.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the sole intent of lightening melasma patches on my cheeks. After 2 uses, I noticed that the spots have lightened a little. Other reviewers have mentioned that this product burned their skin: everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and that is why it is important to do a small test patch before applying to your whole face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lactic Acid peel has a VERY tingly, minty feel to it--so much so that my eyes started to water shortly after applying the peel. The product is viscous enough (about as thick as Elmer&#x27;s school glue) that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the stuff running into my eyes or nose, so I knew the watery eye-thing had to do with the herbal additions. After a few minutes I rinsed thoroughly and applied moisturizer: no burning or excessive tightness (in contrast to the Glycolic Peel, which continues to sting for about an hour after rinsing). I didn&#x27;t notice lightening of the age spots until I performed another Lactic Acid Peel at the end of the week. PLEASE BE REALISTIC IN YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF ANY PEEL--this isn&#x27;t laser treatment! No miracles, just slow and steady improvement over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Salicylic Peels (in two different concentrations) and Glycolic Peels in this product line for over a year and have noticed that my skin responds very differently to each of the peels. I wait at least 10 days between using different types of acid. All of their acids improve my skin texture--tighter pores, firmer appearance, and fewer lines--but I noticed that the salicylic helps with breakouts the most, while the glycolic peel seems to help with the age spots and deep lines around my mouth and between my eyebrows. I have the least experience with the lactic acid peel, but I did notice that it seemed to lighten my age spots even more than the glycolic acid mix. The spots are still there, but they are more easily covered by foundation/powder, and the color has shifted from dark brown-charcoal to a light brown freckle-ish tone in just a couple of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend all of the peels in the Perfect Image line. I have tried a few peels from other manufacturers with less success and more than a little trepidation regarding their quality control/safety.tone in just a couple of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend all of the peels in the Perfect Image line. I have tried a few peels from other manufacturers with less success and more than a little trepidation regarding their quality control/safety.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be ok. I thought it would noticeably peel of a layer of skin, but it peeled off little tiny bits over about a week or so. No one could tell that I did anything different to my skin. I will keep using it to see if it has a long term effect.</li>
    <li> Love the peel. Its a gel so it is easier to apply and use. I would prefer a more liquid gel but this works great</li>
    <li> Useless,weak product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Tried twice for 3 min each time and nothing. It did tingle with application but no change noticed.</li>
    <li> Great product but the price has doubled since I purchased it in May 2012, which is why I&#x27;m only rating it 4 stars.  It&#x27;s gentler than 30% glycolic acid, and leaves my face glowing after each use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so dangerous to use at home. It took my skin off, And I&#x27;m spending 3times more money to recover from the burns.  Now I&#x27;m left with the burn marks on my face. This product is way too strong to be try to home.</li>
    <li> The sun spots seem to be fading.  I have not used it long enough to see if it will reduce the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I had used a prescription weight loss pill from one of those weight loss clinics and it caused real painful cystic acne all over my jaw and neck. I was left with these dark scars that I became real self conscious about. I went to a clinic and they were trying to sell a $300 kit that would work gradually. I am a skeptic so I chose to do some research and find a cheaper alternative. I stumbled on this gem doing a search on Amazon. This is not magic but it gives you NOTICEABLE progress even after the first application. I am sooo glad I bought it. It is worth a try for only 30 bucks!</li>
    <li> I have been reading up on the wonders of peels for the past few months. I decided to take the leap and try this one since it was highly recommended by one of my colleagues. I must say it was worth every penny. My skin feels like a newborn&#x27;s bottom. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after Dr. Oz recommended bearberry extract to deminish sun spots and age spots on skin. I am usually skeptical of creams or gels actually working, but I thought we would give it a try. The product works and it works fast. My husband and I are both amazed at how his skin looks. It not only is VANISHING the spots, his skin, in general, looks better. I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item and it arrived promptly. I am a Surgical Technician as well as a former medical Aesthetician that has worked with several Dermatologists, so I am very skeptical of products that can be bought over the counter that achieve results. I have been looking for a professional peel that I can do for myself and hat has little down time. I have read several reviews etc. Since I haven&#x27;t worked in the field for a few years. I decided that I would give this product a try. First, I will admit that I should have read the ingredient label because I noticed that peppermint is in the top list. Peppermint tends to have a burning sensation on skin contact. I do wonder if they added this as a psychological effect making you feel as if the peel is really strong.  Then, when I neutrilized the solution after application, I noted that it was truly a high grade solution. I recommend pre-rinsing the peel with plain food water FIRST. This dilutes the think concentration of the gel and when the neutralizing reaction occurs, it tends to burn less. I apply my peel starting with aging line areas first, such as crow feet areas, then I proceed to the neck and declotee , forehead, cheeks and then chin. When I rinse with cold water I use my hands then I apply the baking soda and water solution with soft cotton balls that I fluff up into cotton facial pads. I completely drentch the skin areas and redrench the areas at least three times. I used Neova Cu3 intensive tissue repair creme after the baking soda and water solution was rinsed off. I will applyMustella Bebe SPF50 UVA UVB  mineral sunscreen in the morning. I will deffinately let everyone know how my skin progresses in the next few days. I am excited to try this peel since it has had great reviews. So far, I feel like it has quality potential, but time will tell.</li>
    <li> Works, lighten my scars, but it left many painful colorless bumps on my face, which most will eventually fade after a day or two. But it was still painful washing face because of the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left it on for less than 30 secs the first time but it still left me some bumps, but since it did lighten scars, I left it longer the second time (after two weeks) regardless of the bumps lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bumps are not breakouts because they went away fast and they were not very visible, you know is there because you can feel it with your hands and its kinda painful. I thought it was blisters at first but it had no liquid in them so idk. BUT IT WORKS ON SCARS!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It sooo easy to use, you just have to read instructions n also somes of reviewer really good of telling u step by step n their experienced.  I see my result two days later n love it</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews  I decided to go ahead and make this purchase. I never buy anything that doesn&#x27;t get at least 4 stars on Amazon, whether i buy it here or not lol. Like  everybody else says, follow the directions. I followed it to a T since I&#x27;ve never dealt with acid peels before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peel starts to sting  low-key, but i knew that meant it was working. I went in front of a fan like others say, in order to deal with the sensation. I washed it of with some cold water , super refreshing, and my face looked a little drained. It looked  pale (I&#x27;m black btw) but after I put on my moisturizer, the color came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gradually built up to about 7min tops near the end of the bottle. A super plus is that this last me a looong time. I would use it at the beginning  of every week so that by the weekend the new skin would be nice and fresh. When I forgot to use it for about 3 weeks I noticed that my pours  were a lot bigger so i quickly did another peel and they went back to being almost non visible. Great job Perfect Image!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just recently ran out so i will def be buying more! I highly recommend! My skin tone had improved significantly and that&#x27;s the whole reason why I wanted this product. Its very true you what it says (:</li>
    <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and always have taken care of my skin.  I use wide range of skin care products including retinol, alpha hydroxy acids, glycolic acid, etc. I can&#x27;t say I have ever tried lactic acid so after reading the reviews, I decided to try it.  At first it stung my eyes as I was applying it on my face so I knew it is much stronger product than I&#x27;m used to. I felt a bit of burning/tickling sensation on my face.  I followed the instructions carefully and started out slowly.  The first time I used it, I definitely felt my skin looked brighter, clearer and had a nice glow afterwards.  I used the entire bottle in two months period.  The more I used, my eyes didn&#x27;t seem too bothered anymore and my skin seem to handle it fine.  I think it&#x27;s a good product and I will go back to ordering more.  I&#x27;ve been off of it for a few months as I&#x27;ve been experimenting with bunch of other products too.  It didn&#x27;t change my life or take 10 years off my skin as I already had a descent skin to start with.  But I think it&#x27;s worth keeping in my regular collection of skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> Very good product . now confused should i buy it again or move to TCA ?</li>
    <li> I have KP on my upper arms, and scarring from years of messing with it.  This product does an amazing job of gently removing layers of damaged skin to reveal newer &amp; healthier skin.  If you&#x27;ve ever had a sunburn, and then developed peeling skin after, the result of this product was similar for me.  No burning or intense pain like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried (like, tca peels.)  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have had bad acne deep scars for the last 10+ years, and using this product and the facial Perfect Image cleanser once a week has improved my skin tremendously!! I plan on using these products for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend starting off at a low acid percentage, I started out with 50%, but I&#x27;ve been using products like this and others on my skin for a the past 15+ years, so my skin is a bit user to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gives me little burning at first for the first 2 minutes, but it eases before you know it, when I rinse out feels so soft and leaves my skin looking and feeling smoother! I look forward to using it every week! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s breaking down my melasma over time!</li>
    <li> I use this peel for discoloration and to even out my skin. I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to peels. This was my first peel and its gentle enough that you should be able to successfully complete this. Just follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Great. It&#x27;s really strong and cleans your skin. Will burn so sitting in front of a fan helps cool the burning allowing you to wear it longer.</li>
    <li> I hardly give reviews but this time I am doing it so I can get another 50% discount on my next purchase, which also means hat I am interested in buying this product again, which also means that it is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I know that these acids help to regenerate skin cells and you shed the old skin like a snake (almost) of course you never liked that skin, did ya? or why else would you need this product? just be careful first time and wash it as soon as you feel burning on any spot even if you had it for a few seconds. It gets better with time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 with some uv damage and recently started breaking out (nothing severe) but the occasional under the skin, painful knot pimples. This immediately made them practically disappear in one 30&lt;br /&gt;second application! Second time I used it I left it on about 90 seconds and still had no bad reactions other than it kind of broke the skin over a pimple and was &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; for about one day. I have very fair skin with freckles and consider myself to have fairly sensitive skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> Not as effective as I thought it would be. I see very little if any change in the surface of my skin. Maybe I have to use it repeatedly to get desired results.</li>
    <li> this peel did not lighten my face, it just made my skin super dry afterwards. I had take tons of moisturizer and many days to recover. only used twice and it is history!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for five weeks and see a slight difference in my age spots....just a teeny bit lighter. So I&#x27;m encouraged and will surely continue weekly for as long as it lasts and I&#x27;ll likely buy more.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t recommend it to someone new or inexperienced with peeling, as it is really strong.  If you insist on trying it, put it on and remove it way before it stings.  Better start with the lower peeling concentration.</li>
    <li> I never used a product like this before.  I use a face wash and moisturizer with AHA and i was impressed.  I wanted something stronger to smooth and lighten my areolas.  The product worked very well with a few layers. It did require healing time but it was brief and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  Follow the directions!!!</li>
    <li> The last time I saw my ex-dermatologist was for a peel. He charged me in the hundreds, of course, and just sat back in his chair and directed his sloppy assistant to apply it. So I thought, Why am I paying this chump to tell this slob what to do? After moderate research (i.e. reading amazon reviews ;) I guessed my 40+ mildly sun-damaged skin with mild-moderate rosacea might do well with this product. So far, I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get lazy, and one time I did an extra long \\&quot;burn\\&quot;. Bad idea, although ultimately I got good results. However, for me a once-a-week shortish peel is probably best. I start to get upper lip vertical lines if I go a while without using it. This week I used it twice on my hands to soften and fade spots, and I can already see a difference. Read the instructions and adjust applications with care - if you pay attention and use sense, you can probably do a better job than your doctor or his/her assistant.</li>
    <li> I can tell it works.. nice results.. it&#x27;s not too harsh, but you have to be careful..</li>
    <li> It works great - my skin look so much better and my acne scars are almost gone. I would recommended.</li>
    <li> I tried it on two different areas on my body - face and chest. I have a burn mark on my chest and age spots on my face. Mixed results on each area. The face was a bit more tougher to lighten and I even went over it with 2 passes of the gel but I did notice some lightening after just 1 application. I&#x27;m going to keep trying the product for a few more weeks, giving my skin time to heal in between. My chest though, had great results...I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! Lightened right after 1 application so I&#x27;m going to keep using it there...again, giving my skin time to heal. I believe over time I should eventually see the final outcome I want. But, it&#x27;s no 1 hit wonder...more like 10 hit wonder. Overall, way cheaper than a laser treatment!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 7 months now (1 bottle last a long time) and I am very pleased with it. I suffer from melasma and I am constantly fighting hyper pigmentation.... This product keeps it under control better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to overhype this product, but I&#x27;m very happy as to it doing what it&#x27;s seems like it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve used it twice on the total face and it lightened my skin dramatically. I then realized I could just use it for a dark spot corrector for troubled areas, and it works fantastic for that. I&#x27;ve purchased the E-Vernal dark spot corrector and Equate Dark Spot Corrector. But I have to say that this Lactic Acid peel is the one that&#x27;s making dramatic moves. Forget Equate, which has done nothing. E-Vernal, I&#x27;m not sure, but just going along with it for now. I&#x27;m loving this product and so glad I decided to try it out!</li>
    <li> didnt work..discontinued after 2x..i read so many good reviews about it. goin to look for cheaper peels as well. some of the reviews looks fake not to meniton.</li>
    <li> Product works well. For my skin I have to have it on for 20 to 30 minutes, but it does a pretty good job. Would be a good peel for a beginner, but probably not for someone very experienced with less sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It works great! I could see immediate effect after the first session. Although, I don&#x27;t use it every week, I really like the way it makes my skin look.</li>
    <li> As any peel it will sting a little, but it has at the same time a fresh sensation. It smells good and does the job, I think is a little less aggressive than the Glycolic Acid 30% Gel Peel, I&#x27;ll some times alternate between both.</li>
    <li> i bought this item because it said to reduce hyper pigmentation and acne and I definitly agree with the acne reducing, its all gone! ive never seen such drastic change in size of my pores and it really takes off dead all the dead skin cells that builds up causing acne and dull skin. My skin absorbs products better! thank u alot perfect image, i hope they don&#x27;t raise the price because getting chemical treatments is not cheap</li>
    <li> I have very normal, average 40-year old skin. This peel did not burn or irritate during or after application and the results are impressive---my skin is so smooth and soft! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used this lactic acid, I applied 4 layers and it&#x27;s very mild, no peeling at all. I have used lot of peels, lasers, in the past and I was expecting similar reaction and a noticeable improvement on my skin but so far nothing, I  will use it with more frequency I would say once a week to see if I can achieve the results I want.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions and you will see results. I would purchase this product again as it was effective for removing dead/old skin cells and encouraging new cell growth.</li>
    <li> Product had some ingredients which were unsafe for my skin type.  However, I felt otherwise It would have had good results.</li>
    <li> I have horrible skin from acne when I was a teenager.  I am a 50 year old Native American. This product is absolutely amazing!  Give it time.  I&#x27;m into week two and other people have already noticed the difference.  That&#x27;s the real test.  For the price of this product it&#x27;s really worth a try.  Just use caution.  After the third application you should be able to know your tolerance limit and how long you can leave the product on your face.  I put on one application and then &amp;#34;spot treat&amp;#34; the larger dark spots with a brush as a second application.  Again, use caution.  Your facial skin can be a lot more sensitive than you might think.  I will DEFINITELY BUY ANOTHER BOTTLE for maintenance peels.</li>
    <li> I liked the product &amp; it works well.  Be ready for some peeling skin and do not pick at it.  Have not tried to put on in more than one layer at a time, plan to do that next time.</li>
    <li> This has smoothed my skin and faded my dark spots.  Will continue to use but be careful when using peel and don&#x27;t get on your lips because it will burn and blister</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and it totally works!!!!!  I recomended to everyone!!!! I am  Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Yes indeed! I love it. I have been using this peel sparingly for three months.&lt;br /&gt;Sparingly because it is like gold. :)  I am in my early 60&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve grown towards&lt;br /&gt;the sun all my life and my skin. We are talking days of yore using baby oil. :)&lt;br /&gt;I did not inherit good skin genes, hence, I have acne scars speckled with&lt;br /&gt;sun age spots. This peel leaves my skin glowing and has diminished my&lt;br /&gt;past sins. I will definitely purchase again as budget allows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with detailed instructions so it is a no brainer to use.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to use your own knowledge of you body, when to remove the&lt;br /&gt;peel etc.</li>
    <li> Have done it onces 2 weeks ago. The results were wonderful!!! I peeled with in 2 days . I&#x27;m using it again this week as well my teen son who has acne. Very satisfied less expensive than going to the darmatologist .</li>
    <li> Despite that there&#x27;s positive reviews of this product. I have to say that out of my experience this product is bloody painful and full of skin destruction even for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product to some parts of my face where I happen to have dark spots due to injuries. however, after 1 minute of leaving a little piece of this gel, my skin was bloody red. Yes, BLOODY red. I read the instructions on how to apply this product but all this product seemed to me was like having acid on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;horrible product. It could have been a good product but the thing BURNS and leaves a mark. I went to the doctor and I had to apply a different foam white gel just to recover the burned parts where I applied this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly used this product and I should have returned it for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to lighten some parts of your skin, you&#x27;re better off spending some thousands on a professional surgeon rather than this cheap solution. It was cheap comparing to other products, but the damn thing was a horrible experience.</li>
    <li> Used the product as directed but saw no results.</li>
    <li> This product can riin your life</li>
    <li> Stings a wittle bit but not that much. I have very think tan asian skin and it worked beautifully to smooth out my complexion without too much irritation. I have moderate acne and it helped diminish alot of it in just one application.&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on for 5 minutes and can tolerate it pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy :)</li>
    <li> I suffer from very deep stretch marks on areas of my stomach due to pregnancy. Can anyone tell me if they have used this for stretch marks? I tried reading some of the reviews but haven&#x27;t seen any regarding stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your help!</li>
    <li> In fairness, this product does say that different skin types will react differently to the product.  But I read so many positive reviews that I thought it might help me.  It hasn&#x27;t.  I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my skin tone, the spots or my acne, as some reviewers did.  All I&#x27;ve experienced is dry skin.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. follow instructions.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, NOT AS STRONG AS THE 100% BUT GOOD, REALLY WORKS! MUST BE CAREFUL, WHEN USING BUT IT DOES THE JOB!</li>
    <li> Use on my hands, face and chest. Very helpful with brown spots and fine lines on face. Leave on for less time on face. Minimal peeling so can go out next day. Recommend</li>
    <li> It removes discolorations, and good cell turnover.  I didn&#x27;t peel much.  It &amp;#34;ouches&amp;#34; at the beginning, but, you get used to it.</li>
    <li> So I have a large discoloration above my lip that looks like a mustache and discolorations aobve each eye.  I hate them.  I have bought $300 creams, done microderbrations, gone to dermotogists and nothing has worked to remove these doscolorations.  I have great skin except for these marks.  I used this product one night and the next day the marks had visibly lightened.  I am about to do the third treatment.  this is a great product and it really does work.  Is not as harsh as the spa peels and although theres not much peeling the product is working. Worth the money and worth trying. Better than the pricy stuff.</li>
    <li> Five stars!  I&#x27;ve done all kinds of peels at my spa and dermotologist.  Getting these kinds of peels at a spa can be very costly.  At first I was hesitant to use any kind of peel at home without a licensed professional present.  I know the lactic acid is not as strong as glycolic peel so I purchase this product. I put the solution on a cotton pad a swabbed my face and left it on for a few minutes.  There was a slight stinging sensation, rinse with cool water.  You can tell it&#x27;s working!  My skins looks brighter and smoother.  As you continue using this product, your skin will become more used to the solution and you can leave it on a little bit longer.  Be careful however, if you leave it on too long, it will create peeling and dry patches.  It does leave a beautiful result.  I will definitely keep using this product!</li>
    <li> After two peels I could tell a difference in how my skin felt. People may not have noticed that quickly but I could tell my skin was \\&quot;smoother\\&quot; because my makeup (base) applied better and lasted a bit longer before I needed a powder touchup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a lightening in my dark-spot areas but not as much as I was hoping for. I&#x27;ve done about six peels so far and have a little more than half a bottle left. It does sting but I&#x27;ve managed to work my way up to 10 minutes and three \\&quot;passes\\&quot; on the bad sunspot areas during a single peel. I just fan myself if it gets too stingy and that usually works for me but I can put just about anything on my face w/o any negative reactions. Please note, I followed the directions to the letter in increasing my time and multiple &#x27;passes&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution: The one time I got distracted and left it on for about 12 minutes I did have a few irritated spots on my face. You couldn&#x27;t see them but I felt them. I was worried I burned my skin but they never became visible and each spot was gone w/in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has also helped with the flaking problem I had. It used to drive me crazy but I think the peel has helped strip more of the dead skin cells off and flaking is hardly an issue now. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This works really well. Just don&#x27;t leave on too long. When they say to leave on for 2 minutes and rinse. They&#x27;re serious. I have used other peels and thought I could leave on for 5 minutes. Hell no! Burned portions of my face. So just be careful and follow directions to a T.</li>
    <li> I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews.  I have applied it a few times, but have seen no difference in the appearance of the dark spots.</li>
    <li> mild peel...for that reason I think it is safe to use...I have used a couple of times so far and I do see some benefits...Once I finish the bottle I feel that I will have some lightening of the pigmentation and some refining of  wrinkles. It is advised that you do a skin test.</li>
    <li> this product works amazing.. it really really really does people.. if you have acne or dark spots use this! very high quality though so make sure you rfollow the directions very carefully</li>
    <li> Was nervous using the product but easy to use and I can actually see results after using it 2x in the last month. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and another gel peel of 30% for over a year now. I&#x27;m 56 and still break out. I&#x27;ve cut processed sweets, simple carbs, and dairy and I still break out. Heredity? Using an acid peel every week reduced my breakouts significantly. If I do breakout, I apply the product right on the breakout for 2 minutes over a 2-3 days and it&#x27;s gone! What a difference since a pimple could last 3 weeks. Also, helped with brown spots, red spots from pimples, and reduced wrinkles. My face feels much smoother, like it does after a facial. Helped with fine wrinkles too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gels have the consistency of honey. Use a fan brush to apply.  Leave on for 5 minutes. Gently remove with a soft wet washcloth, then rinse with cool water.  I also mix a mild solution of baking soda in water and rinse. This is a good time to apply a vitamin rich cream, vitamin C, etc.  Make sure you read all of the product literature for your own safety.  Stay out of the sun and use sunscreen and hats.  Happy with product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and it does not produce skin changes it just makes my skin dry and I have scabs in forehead I would not order this again.</li>
    <li> I really love using this but you have to be careful not to burn yourself, start with just two minutes and work your way up to find the perfect amount of time on your face.  Feels so smooth after using, I will purchase again once I run out.  thanks</li>
    <li> After the birth of my daughter my pregnancy melasma didnt go away! I was horrified! I thought i would have to live with this the rest of my life...but im on my second use of the Lactic Acid peel &amp; my melasma is fading &amp; my face is brightening up! I even gave my mom a face peel last night! I&#x27;ve decided to try their other products because with results like this you cant go wrong! It even has a great minty smell! Thanks Perfect Image!</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin.  Lactic acid has been proven to help with acne and scars.  I have used this product for twice a week for a month now.  I have noticed that my past acne scarring has faded significantly and I have less bumps overall.  I love that this brand has only a few simple but potent ingredients.  The product is a little thick to go on but seems to spread evenly on a cotton ball.  I will be buying more of this company&#x27;s products due to the value and improvement of my skin.</li>
    <li> the lactic acid works very good, But you have to be careful if you have sensitive skin. It can give you an allergic reaction. Do not over use it.</li>
    <li> I never want to be without this.  After a couple days in the sun, this is necessary!!  Love what it does to soften and brighten my skin.</li>
    <li> If there was a zero star I would give this product a zero!!!!!!! After using this, it made my whole right cheecks into redness and a burning sensation. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Left a horrible burn on the side of my face BUT I was using a Retinol and Tazorac at the time. You cannot use those at the same time. I have used this peel before and it was fine and worked. Now I have to deal with a burn and scar for who knows how long. Ugh</li>
    <li> Did its job but wow only do one layer and then follow instructions.. this will burn if you do two layers..!!!  My skin looks fantastic!!!!!  I followed the advice of another reviewer on how to prepare your skin.. which was the same as a professional.. First I showered to steam open the pores then a wiped my face with Alcohol then I used the product  but, only do one layer.. then rinse..</li>
    <li> has diminshed my acne scarring DRASTICALLY after a month of using. Does cause peeling and almost burn like reaction at first but totally worth the end result. Five star easy.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews so I started out very conservatively.  The first time I left the peel on for 2 minutes.  I did feel a tingling and I used an acid neutralizer when removing it which really did stop any sign of burning.  I had no redness but I had been using a vitamin A cream prior to use (which I did not use for two days prior to the peel).  The second time I left it on three minutes.  Just a little flakiness the following two days but a good moisturizer took care of that problem.  Have yet to use it again.  About once every six weeks for me in the winter time since the weather dries out my skin anyway.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using it again because I believe it is lightening my sun spots.  I would highly recommend that you invest in a neutralizing solution.</li>
    <li> In the beginning I tried to much of a time around 1 min. It ended up burning my face. The second time I tried I did it for a few seconds. Less than 30 seconds and washed it off with cold water. I also have used it on the rest of my body and I see a perfect glow. It has taken away tan marks so my body is more blended. I love it. Definitely don&#x27;t overdo the time. I leave it on around 3 min when it comes to my knees and elbows but as soon as I feel a tingle within 30 seconds I&#x27;m washing it off because the burn does hurt!!!</li>
    <li> Ive tried quite a few acid peels here from Amazon, ranging from mild to skin-searing. I must say that the Perfect Image brand by far is the better of choices, and this Lactic Acid peel is the best one so far.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I like this product line so much is that it&#x27;s not just acid in the ingredients. All peels are in a gel-like form, making it easy to gauge the amount you want to use, and making it easier to layer if needed. In the case of this peel, the extra ingredients make it worthwhile to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The one ingredient that stuck out to me is the Comphrey; This cooling herb really helps offset the burn when you rinse off the peel. Afterwards you get a cooling, menthol-like sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for sure that the Kojic Acid/Bearberry combo is working for my acne-related discoloration, but I can say the the improvement in my skin texture is very noticeable. In combination with serums and facial oil, my skin is smoother than I can remember! I&#x27;m in shock over how clear and even everything is. In fact I keep running my hand over my cheek in disbelief!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a first time peel however. This is definitely something for those whom have experimented before, especially those who want the performance and results of an acid peel but do not want the harsh nature of pure acid.</li>
    <li> I have used this peel 10 times exactly as the directions suggest, with no results.  It stings while it is on but I work through it; so it FEELS like it is doing something.  No results at all.  I&#x27;m just looking for a dermatologist to go to now.</li>
    <li> I think my skin can handle more... I use this and dont peel at all... I feel like I should leave it on for 30 mins or someting.</li>
    <li> It is strong!  Be careful if you have sensitive skin - don&#x27;t leave it on too long!  I did one time and it ended up scarring my acne scars darker!  Eeeks!  HOWEVER, it did eventually fade!  I would definitely recommend this product since it is a natural product.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOTHING ! I followed all directions on the label, after following all directions I left product on 2 to 3 times longer than it said to and still nothing happened,I also applied it several times and went through a whole bottle and got no results.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and has a pleasant smell. I ordered it for a friend and she&#x27;s said such good things about it, that I plan on ordering a bottle for myself. She&#x27;s used several different peels, and said this one is not overly harsh and her favorite so far. After I try it myself i bump it up to 5 stars (hopefully)</li>
    <li> It works very well for my needs.  With the first application it stung quite a bit so I could only keep it on for less than a minute.  A few days later my skin was clearer and brighter. After several uses, the severity of the sting seems to have lessened (maybe because my skin is getting used to it) so I can keep it on longer.  My skin always looks clearer and brighter after using the peel.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after using the glycolic peel, I find this product to be more effective. It strip my skin very well. After 2 uses my skin looks and feels softer</li>
    <li> I have some wounds on the leg.&lt;br /&gt;I was used this peel that wounds turns into the pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;but this peel is so powerful and my wounds hurts again.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in my face after using this. My skin just looks more radiant. A lot of people have problems with sensitivity but I haven&#x27;t. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin (which I don&#x27;t), this will be fine for you. I know it&#x27;s not the best idea I&#x27;ve had, but I typically leave it on my face longer than it recommends.</li>
    <li> I have used Perfect Image TCA  and Salicylic acid peel.My favorite is TCA because skin feels tighter for a few days.  I add Salicylic acid to TCA when I have acne.  To me Salicylic was not as effective as I expect.  I wanted to try Lactic Acid for whitening. it is amazingly different from those two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as start applying, what I noticed was its scent.  It smells delicious!.. something I know.. is it brown sugar??  Burning sensation was not as bad as Salicylic acid. Then, I noticed it minty sensation, my skin feels tighter already..  read the box, found Licorice is in it also peppermint.  Reapplied few more times, feeling happy about this product.  I love the delicious sensations!.. until I started feeling like poked by needles and tinglings.  Unlike TCA and Salicylic, washing didn&#x27;t stop bunging and tingling. When my face started feeling like cracking, I got little nervous.  After one hour, my face is still burning a little and red.  I  though still have high hope.  Let&#x27;s see what happens next.</li>
    <li> Great product,  would buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a review reader, not writer.  I&#x27;ve suffered from melasma for way too long, and was skeptical reading the reviews.  I ordered this as a final straw in my battle, and I&#x27;m thrilled!!!!  My melasma is so so so much better, and only continues to improve.  Pleas don&#x27;t pass on this if you are fighting what seems like a losing battle..with this, it&#x27;s not!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!!! I even kept it on for 10 minutes! Did nothing to lighten up my Malasma. Not even a little.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely continue us to use this product. Took about 3 uses before I saw results, but my dark marks are really fading. Be careful not to over do it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t remove any blemishes. And only slightly replenished my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, it doesnt work all that great and smells like lemons.  Honestly, I felt like I could have just cut a lemon and put it on my face with the same results.  Too much for too little</li>
    <li> I really like the texture on my face. It is a lot smoother. Works great for those quick fixes before a party. Just do it with causion. Dont leave it on too long to avoid a sunburn look. I do get red. Im hispanic, olive complexion.&lt;br /&gt;You wont peel at all, just  a good streched out look.</li>
    <li> This acid is great to use about two times a week. It is not too strong and does not make you peel but you can see the difference on your face. I like that I can leave it on for 5 minutes easily. I think I am now ready to move up yo 70% or so which I never would have been able to do when I first got this.</li>
    <li> burned my skin. ...... it&#x27;s been 3 months and still recovering from the burns!  do not buy it !!!  :((</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Clears up my acne marks.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It evens out my skin tone and feels really refreshing am smooth when I put it on at night.&lt;br /&gt;After being pregnant I developed a little bit of melasma on my forehead and above my lip. This product lightened it up and evened my skin.&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight tingling feeling when I put it on and  I know it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> Great gentle at home peel. Provides a great alternative to costly facials - just do a light peel with this every 2 weeks for 3 months and you&#x27;ll have great results at a fraction of the cost.  Other pros - lightens dark spots with each use and seems to dissolve sebum under the skin, so your bumps soften and peel off (or become easier to extract).  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This was good.  Just don&#x27;t leave it on too long or it will burn your face.</li>
    <li> too strong for my face!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve just finished my second application and I feel like the age spots look lighter.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, be careful and read the instructions. I did burned myself pretty bad on the side of my face, but once I got the hang of how to put this on and time it perfectly, the change was amazing!  My husband and daughter said I looked ten plus years younger. My skin is lighter and some of the wrinkles are less noticeable.  I also use retinol durning the night as well as vit.C and Hyaluronic serum.</li>
    <li> Strong, be careful - amazing results!  Got comments on my skin after 2 uses.  Predominently used for wrinkles, acne, and redness.  Be sure to moisturize a lot after use&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This Lactic acid peel is wonderful. I use it once a week, it exfoliates without irritating my skin. I feel it, don&#x27;t get me wrong. Once applied after about a minute it starts to get uncomfortable usually on my cheeks first. After rinsing I can \\&quot;tell\\&quot; something has/is happening but it&#x27;s not red or sore looking. It usually feels tight the next day, but not dry. The skin nicely peels off without that \\&quot;crepe-y\\&quot; look of glycolic peels.  I love it and definitely recommend it.  FYI I&#x27;m 39 and constantly mistaken for 30 I know not a huge difference but still good for the ego.</li>
    <li> First time using this product. I was paying $100&#x27;s at a salon and I get the same results when using this product and for less money. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Normally freckles get very light in the winter. The ones on my face are how they normally would be in the winter, light, but not gone. This is barely getting me anymore of an even skintone than I would have normally. The search continues to vanish these beasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT if you have minor flaws it probably will work for you. Just not me who really needs something miraculous.</li>
    <li> This product DOES what it says. Took care of my acne and zits, faded dark spots, diminished my pores. The price is great for how wonderful the product is. I will continue to use it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I must say I ordered this product thinking I would try it and then just throw it our if I didn&#x27;t like it. That said I didn&#x27;t hold high hopes for results. I was wrong. This is a great product and as good as what i paid hundreds for at the dr&#x27;s office. The one thing I love is the thickness of the serum. It really helps it go on smoothly and cover well. I am 100% please and will us this and save my money going forward. Skin looks great after the application. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> 10**********incredible for me!! Hope it works for your skin tooHi, I am putting this review  here hoping you will see it and benefit from my troubles with my skin. I am African American with a light complexion which was really good, I was fortunate. I hyperpigment but I didn&#x27;t have much acne, started to get more in my late 30s and my dermatologist had me control it with low dose doxycycline.(Oracea brand name) I always looked younger than my years, I was fortunate. Then I turned 40, it was like my warranty expired, broke out horribly on side of my face (rosacea) fine lines where none were before, and hormone bumps on chin, I was ready to cry because I knew how bad I scar from acne. Now I did a lactic acid peel with Kojic acid bearberry@50%, I did it 2  days in a row because I was timid and careful the first day.((I will of course wait at least 3 weeks before doing it again) Any way it was incredible, the dark marks seemed to be pushed to the surface as a sort of dried skin, when it peeled...the dark scar peeled right off with it! I would post pictures but I don&#x27;t want anyone to see how bad my skin was forever on the internet. Now my hyperpigmentation scars were NEW, only one month old, if your scars are older more established you will have to do a series of peels. My mother(who is white) has melasma and immediately made me buy her some when she saw my skin. She couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked, 3 days of peeling off dark brown patches and I look like I did 10 years ago, I mean clear skin its not a time machine. Now my warning if you have no experience with acid peels please start gently this peel did not hurt my skin at all. The lactic acid peel felt as if there were thousands of tiny pinpricks in my face which is different than the sensation of a glycolic acid peel which makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s burning. I actually prefer the sensation of the lactic acid peel. I can tolerate 10 percent glycolic acid lotion on my skin if you can not tolerate this much acid onyour skin start slow and start at a low dosage perhaps you can find a 30 lactic acid peel. Make sure to have baking soda and water nearby in order to neutralize the solution if you have to. And make sure you have a watch or timer. Do not guesstimate you will burn your skin and cause more harm than good please start slowly you can always do more but you cannot take it back. I used oil and rosehip oil on alternate days in order to prevent my skin from overkilling. Start slow you can always add more a This product has been a miracle worker for me I hope you have the same success I wish you all the best of luck. Don&#x27;t over do it your skin will burn and peel  for days don&#x27;t make that mistake. I did that with a salycilic peel only 20% red for days! This product is amazing for me I hope someone out there has the same success, beauty and health to you.(I used perfect image lactic acid peel with Kojic  acid@50% I followed with alpha arbutin face masks Korean brand and emu oil, I don&#x27;t even need the hydro quin one my derm prescribed!!!:-D )your skin start slow and start at a low dosage perhaps you can find a 30 lactic acid peel.

    <li> Love it so far. Gave me an instant glow. The smell was a little off putting, but Not enough to quit using. Hardly stung at all. Skin looked even better the next morning.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin more darker. Don&#x27;t buy it unless you want to ruin your skin!</li>
    <li> awesome! using this with murad pigment lightener and I seen results in the first week. this is great! made my skin peel a bit but is working great. it says to leave it on two minutes or so but I leave it on for 20 :) it works better like this!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and it does the job. Not professional level, but for the price it&#x27;s a great exfoliator.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective if you use it correctly. If you have never done a chemical peel I would suggest doing a less strong peel. I only stopped using the product for a short while and my skin reacted differently so I would be very cautious. That being said, it was very good at removing wrinkles and acne scars as well as cleaning out pores. Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin with freckles that seem to cause a lot of uneven skin tone the older I get. I wear a 50 spf, but I still get more freckles and spots when I am out in the sun very long. This peel is working wonders. I saw a huge difference after the first use. Every time I use it my face is brighter and more even. The tightening and fading of the few lines I have is also a major bonus! If you follow the directions of leaving it on only 1 to 2 minutes then this peel will be non-harsh and work great. I have had chemical peels in the doctor&#x27;s office that are painful and don&#x27;t do even remotely close to what this peel does.</li>
    <li> Great, it is good product seems to be lightening the dark spot, my skin was breakout , it is really working well for me for me, i need more time to see the lightening</li>
    <li> Tried it and did not work. .</li>
    <li> Read the reviews.  Best to take it easy at first at 20 seconds and then increase the time by seconds.  I have only been using it for 10 days now (four applications) and see a slight difference already.  But all I want is for the product to lighten my freckles above my lip.  No big deal but hopefully will make a big difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;Do not go for the big burn right away.  Why risk your skin?  Twenty seconds then wash the area with mild soap.  I also put good moisturizer with sun screen on afterwards.</li>
    <li> I usually am so great about reviews, but sadly I didn&#x27;t look into the reviews on this product hard enough. Now that i look it&#x27;s pretty obvious that most of the 5 stars are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy this product and have used it 4 times now. This is my second at home peel that I purchased and honestly I preferred the previous CHEAPER one much much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This peel is intense, and did not leave my skin with that soft, amazing feel that the last one did. It actually has made my face incredibly dry. I have had these horrible rough dry patches all around my face and all the moisturizer in the world isn&#x27;t helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give it a few more times, because i did spend $30 on it so am willing to see if it helps my skin but so far it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
    <li> This product is as effective as described but also (*note*) highly potent!  One must be careful as to not use so much as to burn/damage skin or cause excessive peeling which tends to (obviously) be counterproductive.  However, when used properly and carefully it is one of the most effective products I&#x27;ve tried for deep exfoliation  (considering the price point).  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My birth control caused huge brown spots above my lip. It literally looked like I had a chocolate milk mustache.  I used this 3 or 4 times and you can barely see it. I used baking soda when the time was up to deactivate the peel.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its alright, but I liked this stuff I got a few months ago. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://94014fvhfd024n3o-eqjw9tefn.hop.clickbank.net/</li>
    <li> It does the job of peeling layers. Just follow the instructions, have some patience and you will get some beautiful skin within about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always amazed when people share horror stories about using products such as this one. You MUST follow the instructions and never feel secure that you know how your skin will react.  Always err on the side of caution.  Used correctly, this product provides fabulous results!!</li>
    <li> i use very tin layer and it burn my face so bad i have to stay in</li>
    <li> I have oily acne-prone skin with mild keratosis pilaris. I use this every 2-4 weeks to control breakouts and smooth out my skin and it&#x27;s amazing. I leave it on for about 5 mins (when I first started using it, I could only leave it on for 1 min at most) and wash off with cool water and Cellbone&#x27;s pH neutralizer and use a MyBeautyDiary&#x27;s hydrating mask for about an hour afterwards. I make sure to slather on night cream before I go to bed that night. Days 2-3 after using it, my face gets really dry and the dead skin flakes off revealing fresh, smoother skin. My face looks brighter with less breakouts since I started this routine.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews. But this product (in addition to the glycolic and salicylic acid peels) is amazing. Just the same as peels from the dermatologist at a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;ve battled with acne for years (trying everything - over the counter and prescriptions such as Retin-A and Accutane). Also, in my 40&#x27;s now trying to combat the signs of aging and years of sun exposure. I&#x27;ve spent thousands over the years at the dermatologist treating both acne and paying for various anti-aging cosmetic procedures. My skin has never looked better. The acne is clear, the fine lines are gone and my skin tone is even. No melasma (spots). With regular use, the acne is CURED. I love this! I&#x27;m routinely mistaken for someone in my 20&#x27;s and am often carded. I am so pleased with these products!!</li>
    <li> This has been helping over the months with my oily skin. When I use it I see much less breakouts then when I don&#x27;t use it often.</li>
    <li> I have always exfoliated - with some of the top cosmetic brands and with my clarisonic.  Nothing has come close to the new, smooth, young looking skin I achieved with this peel.  I did the test 24 hours before along my chin for 1 min and had no problems.  Do highly recommend doing that because this is a professional, strong-strength peel.  I had some very minor stinging, no redness.  I had a little minor flaking for a day, but the Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream by Perfect Image made it go away.</li>
    <li> Although I am stating the obvious, this is a strong peel that can and should only be used on the skin for a few minutes.  I use this peel once or twice a week for a few minutes at a time.  I have seen some subtle results with regular usage, including reduction of some fine lines.  However, the changes are not dramatic.  But given that I am using this product at home and am not an expert, the product does what I expected.</li>
    <li> Awesome, worked really well!!!</li>
    <li> My age spots are fading away little by litle.I use the product once a week and leave it on my face for 2 minutes , I started using it 4 months ago, and I&#x27;m going to buy my second bottle. I wish it would work faster, but I think  something stronger could burn my skin. Hopefully in few more months my brown spots are totally gone. It leaves my skin soft after each application and my face looks much better.</li>
    <li> Please forgive me&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m too lazy&lt;br /&gt;It is very difficult for me to write feed back&lt;br /&gt;I have bought a lot of things&lt;br /&gt;I replied this&lt;br /&gt;Express&lt;br /&gt;I like this product</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something for my hyperpigmentation and acne brown spots, I opted for this product because all dermatologist had a miracle cure at a celebrity prices. I opted for this because I have read the Kojic Acid helps fade these brown spots. The instructions are easy to read and understand. My only advice is to make sure that you have no new scars or open pimples because this product will sting your skin. It wasn&#x27;t as harsh as I thought it was. My skin is sensitive and I did not have any discomfort, I use it for 5 minutes and have since been using it once a week. I have noticed my spots fading, more importantly friends have commented on how good my skin looks and thats proof enough. Note, it will take time, its not for someone looking for a overnight miracle, it wouldn&#x27;t happen. Lastly most important...USE SUNSCREEN RELIGIOUSLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THIS PEEL.</li>
    <li> Tried this and it literally had no effect whatsoever on my skin.</li>
    <li> This peel feels really good on the skin. It&#x27;s kind of refreshing rather than burning like some other peels that I have tried. I like the gel formulation. It stays in place and doesn&#x27;t run, which actually saves product. Most  importantly, it does a good job of softening fine lines and wrinkles. My skin feels firmer and less crepey. I really like it.</li>
    <li> After being on accutane I felt Discontempt. The red marks on my fair Mediterranean skin made me felt that I just can&#x27;t escape. I thought I had terrible scarring but I discovered like 85% was discoloration. This is the first peel I have ever done and it was exactly a month post accutane right after I did it I steped out of the bathroom and my mother could not believe her eyes she thought i was wearing make up lol. I feel that the first peel reduced the redness by 35% GIVE LACTIC a CHANCE I thought it was too weak but I chickened out while I was about to buy tca at 12% I can&#x27;t wait for more peels and at this rate I only need abt 4 or 5 more for clear skin.. Btw I&#x27;m 19 and I left it for 8 mins..</li>
    <li> This peel is strong enough to show good results with the first use, yet did not feel like it was damaging my skin as other home peels have.  I keep this in my gym bag and use it weekly (I leave it on for a very short period of time - 45 seconds max). I am an older (60ish), athletic gal with some sun damage and this peel is fantastic for lightening uneven pigmentation, and producing a gorgeous glow.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great peel for acne prone skin. I&#x27;m an African-American woman (Fitzgerald V/VI skin tone) with adult acne. This is a perfect peel that I use every other week to keep my pores clear and to help minimize my hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely had to build up to using the peel. I advise that if you are not used to using peels, to start with a lower % but if you are comfortable, go with this one but START off with a short time having the peel on your face. Don&#x27;t try to jump and apply the peel and leave it on your face for 5 minutes the first time. Build up! Be safe. Don&#x27;t Rush. I repeat: DO NOT TRY AND APPLY THE PEEL ON YOUR FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND LEAVE IT ON FOR MINUTES. Start off easy and leave it on 1-1.5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions, they are helpful and have a neutralizing solution available. I make my own using baking soda and filtered water. I&#x27;ve been using this peel for almost a year and I&#x27;m seeing consistent results. The hyperpigmentation I feel is getting better, but more importantly my acne is less prevalent. As long as I&#x27;m working on the acne, I&#x27;m preventing hyperpigmentation which is a win-win for me. Highly recommended product and vendor! I have the TCA peel, but working up the nerve to start that one! :-)</li>
    <li> Great product! Totally removed the large dark spot on my face. I now use it every month to keep new ones from forming. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not bad. If you had the money go for it.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth and even toned. Can only leave on for a short while but have been working my way up in time. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This works very well to smooth and brighten your skin after used.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Follow directions.</li>
    <li> I have been researching a face peel for a few months.  I have considered professional peel but it is too costly and time consuming.  I have dark sun spots and acne spots which are starting to be more visible.  I came across this peel while searching for a face peel product on Amazon.  It has high reviews so I decided to give it a try.  I am on the second week and have used it twice a week.  I feel that my skin is getting tighter.  The dark spots are still visible on my face.  I leave the peel on for 10-15 minutes each time.  I used the after peel face moisturizer also from Perfect Image.  It seems to help eliminate the stinginess and tightness after each peel and has a pleasant smell.  I will continue to use both products and hope to see positive results soon.</li>
    <li> I use to have to peel once every week w my old product. Now I see that my skin really only needs a peel once every 2-3 weeks w this chemical peel. It is stronger than all other products used. It leavesmy skin feeling cleaner and smoother for a longer period of time, and because of that it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product very much .this was my second time ordered it.i really see a difference in my face. my skin color is much bighter more clearer</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging/shipping and product were great. Easy instructions to use and follow with good results. Please make sure to read all the instructions about testing and time to leave on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I am 49 years old and recently started bioidentical hormone replacement (BHRT). i was warned my skin might react to the sudden influx of hormones, and boy did it. My face became so oily i developed horrible cystic acne around my jaw and my nose. It took several months for it to calm down, but i was left with horrible dark spots. I also had old scarring issues since i&#x27;ve always had issues with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to fork over a large sum of money to have some laser treatments done, but i saw the reviews for this peel and decided to give it a try. Thank God! This REALLY works! You will peel, but ...hello! It&#x27;s a PEEL. That&#x27;s what peels do! It&#x27;s a little frustrating to read so many reviews from people who feel a slight tingling -or even a mild burning and freak out. One reviewer even stated she \\&quot;got scared\\&quot; and washed it off right away. Really?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take a few days but your skin will get flaky and very dry. Use a good moisturizer and sunscreen and please don&#x27;t write silly reviews about how this product makes your skin peel. Obviously the reason you are trying something like this is because you WANT to rejuvenate your skin. The only way to do that is to help turn over the old, dead cells and make room for fresher new skin. Well, this does it. So put on your big girl panties and let this product do its job. You don&#x27;t have to call in sick to work (as another reviewer suggested), you only have to put up with a few flakes for a short period of time. It will be well worth any (very minor not even worth mentioning) inconvenience. No more acne, no more hyperpigmentation!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It works well for spots and fine lines.</li>
    <li> The first peel that really works and I can see it. For professional use only, or follow the instructions directly. Skin becomes softer and radiant. Perfect thing to refresh and renew your skin. My best recommendations. Also I can recommend to use cotton pad while applying the peel, otherwise you can damage your skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this peel! It makes my skin feel so smooth and soft afterwards! I had a lot of acne problems when I was younger and this product has definitely lessened the scarring left by it. My skin has never looked so good!</li>
    <li> I used this peel several times in the last few months. I was very happy with the results-smoother skin, lighter age spots, tighter pores. I had never done a strong peel before and was a little hesitant about it with fear of hurting my skin. I was especially happy with the detailed instructions that helped me along so that I was able to tailor it to my own skin&#x27;s needs. I only gave it 4 stars rather than five because I did not think it was as strong as described. However,it might feel stronger on someone else&#x27;s skin. I am now looking at the TCA peel to see if it will help eliminate some annoying white bumps in my forehead.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tad bit strong but it gets the job done, and there is very little down time. I alternate this with perfect images salicylic acid peel and it has improved my hyper pigmentation and acne drastically!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been messing around with glycolic and sac acids. this one is so far the strongest one. my first time, i left it on for only 2 mins before removing because of the stinging. other acids, i can usually put on for more than 5 mins and not feel anything. no bad reactions here thus far.</li>
    <li> I recently opened an esthetics salon and was looking for quality, professional, effective peels. I am always skeptical of new products. An esthetician for ten years, I certainly love trying as much as I can... But it takes a lot to impress me.&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed with this peel. I have some new scarring, hyperpigmentation from sun and hormone change and was becoming embarrassed about my skin. This peel feels great, improved all of my areas of concern and I have had great results with my clients!</li>
    <li> A little about my skin.......&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had acne since 13 and now I&#x27;m 25. My acne has gone done a lot and now I&#x27;m getting hormonal breakouts which only consists of cysts!!! I have slight acne marks on my face from the healing of the cysts and large pores on my t zone. I was normally getting chemical peels done professionally every month but wasn&#x27;t seeing any results so I did my research on amazon and stumble to find this highly rated product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 3 months now and it has made my face brighter although the acne scarring hasn&#x27;t even faded and plus it didn&#x27;t do anything for my pores. They are still the same. Upon initial usage, I left it on for a minute and then continue using it weekly for 5 minutes. This peel stung like crazy and after I washed it off and neutralized it my skin was bubbly and red as if Ive had an allergic reaction and got hives as a result. It was horrible (And I have  been abusing my face for a long time so it is not new to chemicals either)! After using a good moisturizer (cetaphil), my skin calmed down and for the next following days, my skin started to peel little by little. If you have sensitive skin please be careful of using this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am not too thrilled about this product. It may be a good exfoliating product but I&#x27;m not sure if the burning and damaging after effects of the peel is worth it. Maybe if I was just a stay at home person and didn&#x27;t work or anything I would continue investing in this product but it is way too harsh. I will continue to use a lower percentage glycolic peel. Hopes this helps!!</li>
    <li> I received the product a week ago and I still very excited. I applied the Lactiv Acid twice and I am seeing some changes. Acne is much better so I am expecting to see some sun spots going away... Can&#x27;t wait to a month to see the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this peel about 3 times now.  Every time I use it, my face feels very soft and I&#x27;ve now started noticing that some of my skin imperfections are improving.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great peel and very good price. It arrived quickly and directions were easy to follow. It did not include any aftercare instructions. Some reviewers stated they used a baking soda paste to neutralize the acid peel. I don&#x27;t know if that is necessary, however I did receive small burns to my face. But I am very fair and Irish. I like to use the coconut oil to moisturize after the peel. My skin looks much better after a couple of weeks of doing the peel once a week.</li>
    <li> This peel has been amazing.  I noticed a difference after 1 peel and a huge difference after 5.  I hve received numerous compliments on how radiant my skin is!  Only bad side- it does sting a bit- may not be good for more sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I had previously used expensive cosmetics to treat keratosis pilaris on my arms,they showed minimal or no results at all.&lt;br /&gt;Then I read an article about gel peels to remove the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several times since, then no harms(it stings a little but not that much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t say that I have clear results, but the skin seems smoother.</li>
    <li> This product burned me so much so it made 2 large discolorations on my face! I will never use this again</li>
    <li> this product does absolutely nothing it claims to do....... it has been 3 weeks of using this product and I have seen NO changes to my skin.... DO NOT waste your time or money on this product.</li>
    <li> Ive used it twice so far, the  first time i must have left it on for too long because it burned my pimples and left a scab. But besides that i do see the discolered areas lightening. Im going to try the salycilic acid peel too to help with my pimples.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for  a first time at home chemical Peel.  I found my self loving it.  My skin started looking clearer within a few weeks. I have included this as part of my weekly beauty regimen.  I Love how gentle it was on my skin.  This is a must buy if you are a first time user.</li>
    <li> It really helped improving my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and I&#x27;m satisfied with the result!</li>
    <li> i have only used it twice on my arms so its hard to say wheather its really working or not, but yet again everybody is different. this just might not be the right product for me... im going to wait 6 more weeks and i will get back to you.</li>
    <li> This is a milder chemical peel, the first time I used it, I was able to tolerate it for 5 minutes. I became overconfident and left it on for 10 minutes 2 days later. The result? Scabs on my cheeks as if I sandpapered my face! Since then I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week--at least 3 days between each use. It is not a magical product and it doesn&#x27;t work on pimples or make wrinkles magically disappear. It will however improve the texture of your skin, shrink pores, even and brighten your skintone. I also use DDfF salicylic acid face wash once a day and 40 carrots moisturizer. I noticed results after 3 weeks---so be patient. Most importantly, be careful and don&#x27;t burn your face like I did mine!</li>
    <li> Although I rarely post reviews regarding on-line purchases, I felt this product warranted my positive comments.  As a woman in my late fifties, my skin was showing the results of sun and age.  This product has helped smooth my skin and is lightening the sun spots,hyper pigmentation and especially the redness I have on my nose.  I have followed the directions exactly and am getting good results.  Mind you, it doesn&#x27;t perform miracles, it hasn&#x27;t turned back the clock (or sun damage) twenty years, but I am pleased with how it is working and will continue to use for some time.  I also feel the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> It is probably a great product but no matter and light or short the application, it was too strong for my skin.  I followed strictly all instruction and it burned my skin.</li>
    <li> Slow results so far but it seems to work.</li>
    <li> Love this peel it goes easily my face does not peel much with it but not sure if that is because I scrub my face often</li>
    <li> The item was packaged properly. Everything was in perfect shape. Thanks for the instructions along with the product for safety. They did what they claim. I will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> THis is very strong and is really good.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic for making age spots appear lighter. My skin is dramatically smoother and younger looking.</li>
    <li> Great and safe product to use home !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a doctor, I use Latic Acid 50% on several skin lesions and works great! The patients with some sun lesions and age lesions respond very fast with this product</li>
    <li> This product does not work and is completely unless. I waited for 2 weeks of use but the product does not work.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been using this product for about 2 months now. I have noticed my skin is smoother, and I have a more even skintone. I will be purchasing this item on a regular basis</li>
    <li> Used it once, and I notice visible changes on my skin after 4 days. I have some acne scar on my face and this thing really make it lighter in few days. Cant wait for it to be completely gone.</li>
    <li> Now I know why these products are so prominent on Amazon.  Hmmm&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought it, tried it, it irritated my skin and made my face a little swollen.  When your face is swollen, you cant see the fine lines.  Not impressed, once was enough for me</li>
    <li> This is one product that does work, but very, very slowly.  You must be patient, and not stop using it.  Your skin does burn a bit at first, but after a few weeks, it no longer stings.  I have very stubborn age spots on both cheekbones, and my right cheekbone is the most prominent, but I am beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel.  This product does go a long way, so I feel that it is worth the money.  In a few weeks, if it continues to lighten my age spots, then I will change the rating to a five star~stay tuned.</li>
    <li> I rarely leave reviews but this one deserves praise. I have used this for about two months and my skin tone has improved tons. The texture of my skin is so much softer as well. I really don&#x27;t know how I lived with this before.</li>
    <li> This is a great peel but be very careful when using it do not use if your skin is dry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this peel to try to lighten my acne scars (hyper pigmentation) I have on my cheeks. In one peel I could already see a result from this product!! Also, immediately after washing it off my skin felt smoother and the little acne bumps I had on my face seemed to flatten out a bit. My skin just overall seemed smoother and more even toned than before. My face didn&#x27;t peel too much. Just some light peeling on days 2 and 3 after using this. The second time I used this the results were the same. Scars seemed to be lightened and my tiny acne bumps resolved even more!! My skin is still not clear by any means, but it is the clearest I&#x27;ve seen my face in a LONG time!! I will continue to use this product and buy more when I run out!! I also bought the post peel cream along with this and feel that it really helps with the healing process. It is super moisturizing and smells great!! I would recommend buying both of these products!! They are amazing products at a great price!!</li>
    <li> I will update continuously as I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the shipping was fast. Ordered on July 23 and I had it by the 25th. I have a Prime account though so they have to deliver it in 2 days just as long as you order before Friday or sometimes even Thursday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I learned:&lt;br /&gt;* Be careful and don&#x27;t get too excited and leave it on longer than you should. You could get burned if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;* Put on lots of sunscreen and wait 15-30 minutes before going out because if you don&#x27;t, your skin will darken.&lt;br /&gt;* Have patience and try not to stare so much at the mirror while you&#x27;re waiting.&lt;br /&gt;* Keep your skin moisturized. The sesame seed oil I used made my dry, flaking, peeling skin not noticeable. There&#x27;s other oils out there than you can use.&lt;br /&gt;* Read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;* Don&#x27;t expect a miracle. If it happens to you, Congrats!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1: I did a test spot. Left it for a minute. I was too scared. Nothing happened withing 24 hours so I went for it. I read the instructions and used a cotton ball to wipe the oil off my face with alcohol. That stung a lot... I then used a Q-tip and dropped a small drop of lactic acid on it and painted my face with it. I didn&#x27;t have a fan brush. I still don&#x27;t. I left it on for 1 minute and then washed it off with lots of cold water. I splashed water on my face for like a minute. I was scared that if I didn&#x27;t get it all off my face would melt off. Haha. I looked in the mirror and saw nothing. I&#x27;m doing this for hyperpigmentation around my face. Oh well. Didn&#x27;t expect any miracle on the first time. I used a cotton ball and dabbed my face with sesame seed oil. It&#x27;s the only one I have besides vegetable oil. My face was feeling itchy right after and even a couple of hours. I rewashed my face with some cool water for a longer time and then put on the oil again. I felt much better. This was my first time so my face was probably sensitive. I should have taken that as a warning sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2: After 7 days. Did another test spot the day before. No bad reaction. This time I put on the product for 1 minute, washed it off and did a second application. Oh the second application was a mistake. I put it on for 2 minutes and then parts of my face started stinging. So I quickly washed it off. While I was washing it off, I saw little white blister like things bubbling. Ewww! So I guessed I burned small parts of my face. Within the next few days, those small burned sections turned a dark color, started scabbing and flaking and the rest of my face was flaking and peeling too. Small amounts of peeling going on. Then on the 5th to 6th day, most of the peel and flakiness came off. I was using sesame seed oil and dabbing that on my face every hour for all those days. I noticed that it took away a very very small amount of hyperpigmentation, but nothing major. Week 2 was a learning experience to be careful and not overdo it. I was too excited and got careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 3: After 7 days. Did a test spot the day before first. No bad reaction. I was still afraid from what happened in Week 2 and so I only left it on for a quick minute. Only very slight stinging. This time I used water with baking soda mixed into it as a neutralizer. I soaked a cotton ball of the mixture and wiped it on my face. It started reacting to the acid and making bubbling and hissing noises. Got really nervous with that especially when I started feeling it stinging a little on my face. I guess I was nervous my face was going to get burned again, but it didn&#x27;t this time. I washed my face with cold water for a few minutes and stared at myself in the mirror. No noticeable changes. Sigh. Well, it&#x27;s not over yet. Gotta keep going. I wasn&#x27;t careful with my face all these long years so I shouldn&#x27;t expect it to be awesome that quickly. I put on some oil. I&#x27;ve noticed small amounts of flaking in the days after.  Today is the 6th day of week 3 and I&#x27;ve noticed a few dark areas were lighter. Slightly lighter. I think I&#x27;m going to try to focus on the darker sections of my skin first to make it more even before I do my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 4: Going to wait 10 days rather than the 7 days to give my skin time to heal. Will update once week 4 has happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many weeks later...&lt;br /&gt;I ended up not doing a week 4. Got a bit busy with life and I thought why not take a break. While my skin was healing, there was a noticeable improvement of my hyperpigmentation. I noticed there was less of it. I would say that there was a 50% reduction, which is a great deal for me. I never thought it would actually work especially after only 3 weeks of doing the treatment. So now I&#x27;m restarting the treatment again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1: I did not do a test spot or wipe my skin with alcohol. However I did wash my face to reduce the oils before I applied the chemical. I started feeling it after 30 seconds. I neutralized it immediately using baking soda and water. It reacted to the acid and was making some sizzling noise. My face did not itch or become red afterwards. I just put some oil to moisturize it. I decided to do small mini peels rather than take the chance of burning my face.</li>
    <li> It seems to have worked pretty well.  I think you can really see the true results after about a week and a half or two. This is my first ever using a peel so I was scared at first when my skin blistered.  Not sure if I left it on too long or if it&#x27;s just that sensitive...but afterwards, after my skin started peeling, it looked nice - more fresh.  I noticed a subtle difference in my fine lines (nothing dramatic) but good enough to know it&#x27;s made a difference and actually works.  After the second use, it&#x27;s even better.  My skin looks more smooth and glow-y :)  So overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and very gentle. Just follow the instructions carefully. Depending on your skin type and sensitivity, leave on for the recommended time or slightly less if you are sensitive. Didn&#x27;t get any flaking after using the peel but have only used it a couple of times in conjunction with other facial treatments. Would recommend this product.[[ASIN:B006ZBP8NM Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Kojic Acid &amp; Bearberry Extract (Professional Chemical Peel)]]</li>
    <li> First time peel user. Peel applied for 1-2 min only. Instruction followed.  My face got very red and blotchy.  There was quite a bit of burning for several hours which was relieved with moisturizing frequently. The redness went away after 48 hours and the skin began peeling.  No pain, just burning and tightness/dryness with the peeling.  New skin (5th day post peel) is bright, even toned, and clear.  Next attempt will be for a shorter application time (30 seconds or less).</li>
    <li> So far I like how it evens out my skin. I have only used it once so further testimony will be needed</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I highly recommend. Experienced some redness for a few days, but it is worth the results. I use it mostly to fade some dark spots I have leftover from back acne. Not for first-time peelers.</li>
    <li> I used the product numerous time sparingly of course and cleared some of the dark spots on may face. I will reorder the product if available again sometime in the near future.</li>
    <li> It worked really well. Don&#x27;t leave it on too long tge first time and be sure to protect your lips. Make sure to neutralize afterword. I experienced minimal burning. I loved how bright my skin looked immediately. It&#x27;s been two weeks and it seems my skin looks even  better.</li>
    <li> I like this peel. It doesn&#x27;t burn my skin. Easy to use. I use other peels from this manufacture and I like them as well. The only thing that my skin can take this peel easily and I have to keep it on longer, thats why I gave it 4 stars. I would prefer to have it a bit stronger if I could.</li>
    <li> I am esthetician and I love it your skin loks younger and bright..it minimize age spots,wrinkles and acne spot...I love it ...it doesnt feel to much tingle so you have to be careful because it works fast you dont feel a lot but your skin reacts quickly very careful not to burn.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I&#x27;ve been fighiting with some spots, and this product as all the products from Perfect Image is just magical&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Perfect Image you have my loyalty</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a tad skeptical about trying this product with my skin being somewhat sensitive, however, I am so happy I tried it.  It has worked great for me.  I have oily, sensitive skin and it was looking lackluster and dull.  I decided to try this product just based on the reviews and ingredients.  It has been 2 months now and I use it once every other Friday and I have noticed a remarkable difference in the texture and the tone of my skin.  My skin is now healthy looking, radiant and glowing.  My friends and family ask me every other week if I am getting professionals facials and I just smile.  I will definitely continue to use this product.  I love it!  But be careful not too leave it on too long or apply to irritated skin. It can BURN you</li>
    <li> Following the instructions on the proper use of this product definitely leaves me with glowing skin. The results are immediate.  Provided that I stop the usage of my exfoliating products one week prior to using the lactic acid; especially in these winter months :)</li>
    <li> I believe that some of these product reviews are fake. This Product doesn&#x27;t do anything but Irritate your skin. Try the pallid skin whitening cream instead or you can get Laser skin resurfacing.</li>
    <li> Had my first peel today.  After reading several reviews I was very careful to follow the directions step by step (as far as peel day goes) but truthfully I was in the sun yesterday and I did use an exfoliant yesterday, but this had no effect on my peel today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background on me:  33 yrs old, brown skin (blk, white, chinese, indian mix), many many brown scars on my face.  I still get pimples.  I&#x27;ve had adult acne since I was 18. I did a chemical peel and microdermabrasion 10-12 years ago and 2 yrs ago I had a chemical peel in a spa but I simply can&#x27;t afford it.  I was shopping in a beauty supply place when a lady approached me with a do-it-yourself at home peel and did one on me then and there.  I didn&#x27;t know that you can do that so I looked up reviews and bit by bit I was led to discover this peel on Amazon.  My skin is getting older and doesn&#x27;t shed as fast.  Sometimes it looks scaly, and it definitely is blotchy, nothing smooth about it&#x27;s tone.  I live in California so I get sun all year round.  I don&#x27;t regular use SPF but need to start doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this morning I was excited to use the peel.  I did a patch test for 30 seconds.  Felt nothing.  Proceeded with regular peel.  Loved it.  It tingled but was not intense, was not incredibly hot, just tingly all over and a bit warm.  I did wear gloves, I fanned my face when it tingled.  I left it on for 2 minutes; probably could have done more but this was my first time.  I rinsed with cool water and then PATTED (NOT scrubbed) baking soda on my face.  Rinsed that with cool water.  Then I patted my face dry and used a natural gentle oil free lotion from a natural grocer&#x27;s.  (I&#x27;m an organic girl mostly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first time I do have to say that my face is soooooo smooth and bright and youthful looking and soft to the touch.  I plan on doing this every week until the bottle is gone!!  Well, we&#x27;ll see how it goes.  But I&#x27;m in love with this.  Just how my skin feels to the touch alone is awesome.  I can&#x27;t wait to post more results.can&#x27;t wait to post more results.</li>
    <li> This peel is excellent. It is gentle on my skin. Tightens my skin, clears away dead skin cells and helps to bring the new layer of fresh skin to the surface. It has not caused any problems on my skin and is the most gentlest considering that I have very sensitive skin. I have tried many products and I am very satisfied with Perfect Image LLC products. A+</li>
    <li> My skin is not sensitive, so I am able to leave this on for awhile without it burning my skin.  I don&#x27;t notice too much peeling in the days after I&#x27;ve applied the peel, but I do feel like my skin looks better after use.  I have been using the product regularly for a year and have seen a slight reduction in pigment, but nothing spectacular.  Even though I purchased the product specifically for my dark spots/freckles, I continue to use it because I think it helps my skin overall.</li>
    <li> Kinda burning sensation, guess it should be that way to work out. Will look for a  gentler Perfect Image product for starts.</li>
    <li> too soon to tell if the kojic acid is having and effect (3 weeks in) but oyu can keep in on for longer than the bottle says without any problems</li>
    <li> I have light skin and hyper pigmentation spots on my shoulders. This says to leave on for 30 seconds, but I left it on for longer because the skin on my shoulders is tougher.  The dark spots are fading, not quite as quickly as I would like, but they are fading more than any other product has been able to achieve so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend using a paintbrush to apply -- the applicator is an eye dropper and it&#x27;s not as if you can spread the product around with your hands.</li>
    <li> I am still using this but have seen results. Its slow, but I think the more you use it the better the results. Do not leave it on too long because it will cause scarring. To scar is opposite of what you buy it for, right? I like it but you need to do it until scarring is gone, so be patient. I have been seeing results on mine after I was patient and did it one per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small scab like skin formation happens then it peels off. The new skin underneath is fabulous. Its layers though so I suggest once a week to allow the process to take place and heal. Also exfoliate and moisturize in-between usage. Nice product.</li>
    <li> This was just a ripoff. this was a total rip off. I will never buy it again. Don&#x27;t waste your cash here</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and I was a bit disappointed . My skin didn&#x27;t peel and I used it twice and followed the direction. I wish I can return n get a refund..</li>
    <li> The product works in small steps, which is fine!  After applying to my face, I wet a finger and go over my face, this helps with the burn. Another tip is to leave the product on for half the time, to see how your body responds. It probably helps to lessen the concentration as well.</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviews that this product is a good asian skin. One must be careful though with skin preparation, timing and washing product off completely.  I admit to being carried away one week, left product on a little longer than normal and possibly did not wash all the acid off.  I had a mild &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; on chin so I applied neosporin and waited for it to heal and scab before I could start on another peel. Brown spots on my cheeks have diminished considerably and no more rough skin. Although I am the prettiest of my 4 sisters, my mother has always been displeased that I was darker and spent so much time in the sun. With this product, I absolutely do not regret growing up in Hawaii and laying out on the beach every time I could.</li>
    <li> So this is my first amazon review.  Some of the other reviewers expressed a concern about this company writing fake reviews, however,I got an email from Perfect Image (via amazon) offering me 40% off on my next order if I reviewed their product.  Since I really like this product and plan on buying it again, I figured why not!  So, these kinds of discounts may be why there is a disproportionately large number of positive reviews from people who generally lack the incentive write reviews at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I decided to risk taking a stab at at-home chemical peels after a bad breakout that left some shallow scaring.  I have been dealing with acne for the majority of my life now, and I have to say, this product has been the most effective (compared to retin-A, benzaclin, proactiv, professional glycolic acid peels, vitamins...) at treating acne and hyperpigmentation.  I&#x27;m on peel 5, I think, and the scarring seems less noticeable too.  After starting this peel, I&#x27;ve also noticed that I stopped breaking out as much and that my skin looks younger/brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other comments:&lt;br /&gt;-I follow the directions (including the alcohol step).&lt;br /&gt;-I do the peel about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;-I think that preforming the peel before taking a shower is nice because you can feel more certain that you washed all of it off.&lt;br /&gt;-If I have a small cut on my face, it will scab after applying the peel, but it hasn&#x27;t resulted in more scarring.&lt;br /&gt;-If you leave it on for too long, rubbing the contents of a vitamin E soft gel on your face helps.  (At least for me.)</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely nothing but make your hands greasy. Completely false advertising. There should be a money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> I have been using this peel for about 1 year with minimal chnge, Some days I peel most days I dont so its not veri effective, After las bottle I purcgased will call it a day, Just not for my skin type thats all.</li>
    <li> This product is awful!! It left hideous dark patches on my face the next day, this is the worst profuct ever. All these reviews are clearly fake, I spend good money on this and I will continue to complain about this product.</li>
    <li> I believe this has really helped me to get a hold of my middle age acne.  I use this once a week in conjunction with the Image vital C hydrating mask and finish with the Image daily matte moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few skin care products during the past year and one-half.  I like this lactic acid product best of all.  Notably, I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s instruction to the letter.  By way of example, I only left the product on my face for 30 seconds during my first treatment.  I have  now used the product 5 times over a 5 week period.  The improvement in the texture of my skin is quite noticeable.</li>
    <li> its a awesome product.it leaves my skin smooth and soft.i will def buy it again. thanks perfect image[[ASIN:B006ZBP8NM Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Kojic Acid &amp; Bearberry Extract (Professional Chemical Peel)]]</li>
    <li> Before I say how wonderful this product is, I must tell you that the most important thing you have to know is to FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has reduced the amount of acne I deal with and softened my skin to the fullest extent. You&#x27;ll notice that the first time you use it. Last year I bought a product (lactic acid 70%) that sort of worked. This product, with a lesser percentage work a lot better. I don&#x27;t understand the logic behind that, but it does...&lt;br /&gt;My 17 yr old has completely changed the look of his acne scars by using this product. If you have a minor using this product, please assist them. Using the acid improperly with cause damage to you skin, seriously. It&#x27;s powerful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I thought it would do...</li>
    <li> Like with all peels, especially the more aggressive percentages, follow directions and use with caution, until you learn how your skin will react. This is a nice gel, so it stays in place on the face and decollete. It&#x27;s very effective in lightening my hyperpigmentation. I also use their enzyme mask with a built-in AHAs. It too is nice, yet aggressive, so you must be mindful of time and passes. Just follow the instruction, and you&#x27;ll be fine. I always de-grease my skin using acetone first, so that the products have full penetration potential.</li>
    <li> Being a woman in my 60s, this product will definitely help improve my complexion of small scars and age spots  I&#x27;ve used this peel only once and have seen results that I&#x27;m very pleased with.  I really appreciated reviews that were submitted by others which helped me make a decision to buy. Make sure to get the fan brush, as recommended because it makes applying the peel to your face easier and keeps your hands free from contact of the peel which can cause burning.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fraction of professional face peel service/salons, same results.  Will purchase again.  Used along with other products from perfect image.</li>
    <li> Has anyone had success with this product on Boxcar or Rolling Scars?? I looked through the reviews, but I don&#x27;t see where anyone has mentioned anything about these types of scars. Any info would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, my wife bought it and said she wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone else. However, she will use up the supply she has.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice with very great results.  The directions were excellent and I have achieved the results that I desired.  Just follow the directions and it will go smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is a great at-home professional peel. It&#x27;s even good for novice peelers. It&#x27;s gentle, yet effective. There isn&#x27;t a real \\&quot;down-time\\&quot;. You might look a little red and shiny, but I just do it before going to bed and wake up looking refreshed and younger. I&#x27;ve done other glycolic peels, which are way to strong and abrasive. This one seems to have a perfect balance for results at home.</li>
    <li> This product, like the other Perfect Image products works wonders but be careful.  If you leave the product on too long (say over 4 minutes) you might increase your chances of getting burned.  I still have two unsightly minor scars on my chin and upper lip as a result of using the peel over a month ago.  Lucky for me, the Nature&#x27;s Bounty Vitamin E oil and Salicylic peel that I&#x27;ve used in combination are fading the scars rapidly.  Overall the other areas of my skin look great, and now that I&#x27;m aware of the limitations of using this product too long, I will be more careful the next time around.  And yes, I will be making another purchase.  Thanks Perfect Image!</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to be better. So far I prefer the Salicylic acid. Maybe it just my skin, but the salicylic acid has worked better on my sun spots....</li>
    <li> This little bottle works really well. I have seen my brown spots leaving my face! Follow the directions and do not leave it on for more than directed as it is a bit strong. But it works for sure</li>
    <li> I was scared to try this by myself after having a peel performed by my local spa. But, I really wanted to save money. I just followed the directions and no problems! Great product with great results. I highly recommend this peel!</li>
    <li> This product created rashes in all the area it was applied.  I hope it goes away, else I am planning to see a Dermatalogist.</li>
    <li> I love this peel! It&#x27;s gentle enough that my face doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s on fire. I use it at night before bedtime once a week to gently exfoliate and wake up next morning to a dewy, soft, more even toned complexion. My leave on time is 3 min. and rinse thoroughly with cold water. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Just as I read in most reviews. I&#x27;ve used 3 times with mild discomfort and have definitely felt the difference.  I still have some brown spots but it&#x27;s been 2 weeks only since I&#x27;ve started. So I&#x27;m very hopeful.</li>
    <li> works gret but dont ignore the time limit, it can sting a little lol</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t give out reviews. As a Ph.D., I&#x27;m very skeptical about any claims made without scientific proof and data to support the claims. However, I decided to try this product based on the reviews I read on Amazon. After two applications, nothing short of amazing. My melasma spots are pretty much gone, and I&#x27;ve been living with them for years. Based on this, I felt compelled to give a review of this product. Pretty amazing product. Best way to describe it: a $1000 dermatologist visit in a $30 box.</li>
    <li> The product seems okay. But I am really irritated that they used a glass pipette in the bottle with print on it - guess what is all floating loose in the bottle now? Milliliter markers. Black bits of gunk. I have used the product twice. Not cool. I will contact the seller and see if they will help. I will update if this is resolved positively.</li>
    <li> AMAAAAAAZZZIIIIING! Love this peel!</li>
    <li> Nice product and it does peel. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I use this product once or twice and week in lieu of the expensive &amp;#34;rejuvenating&amp;#34; facials I used to get. It&#x27;s one of the only products strong enough to actually work! I also use their salicylic acid product, also once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> When you put it on, you&#x27;ll feeling like a burning sensation, but it&#x27;ll feel nice afterwards.  It also has a minty smell to it.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve really seen any lightening of my skin.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now.</li>
    <li> Great peel but make sure you follow instructions.</li>
    <li> The peel is so excellent and will definitely recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;m a dark skin African American and I didn&#x27;t see any damaging effect to my skin.</li>
    <li> Be sure to start slow and watch your timing, but you can get nice results. I use it once a week, and I have definitely noticed results: brighter complexion, decreased appearance of fine lines, and my daily lotions sink in faster and easier.</li>
    <li> I have just been recently introduced to this wonderful product and have been using it for the past three weeks now and I love it. It&#x27;s amazing how much my face feels and looks. I have experienced a visible improvement to the blemishes and sun damage I once had considerably.  I was initially attracted to the lightening ingredients Kojic acid and uva-ursi extract not to mention the soothing extracts cucumber and chamomile it also contained.  From the improvement I&#x27;ve seen there isn&#x27;t a doubt these botanicals helped to boost the healing period.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find any other peels online which offered healing ingredients within the peel itself, rather just the acid.  Following 3 treatments in a 3 week time span, the brown spots on my lower jaw has faded and less noticeable.  I feel my skin is a whole lot smoother, I&#x27;m guessing its from the exfoliation process.  By far, this products has much more to offer and it has proved its difference.  It comes with a very nice tapered dropper for easy dispensing with ml designations to assist in the desired amount I wanted to use. This was very helpful to have.  Overall, I am pleased with the results and would continue to use this product!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This peel works great but you really have to follow the instructions. Here&#x27;s what happened when I didnt, feel free to learn from my mistake. I washed my face with exfoliating soap, THEN I used the peel. The first time I used it it didnt burn at all but after exfoliating it burned the crap out of my chin. I got a very light burn, with a really thin and annoying scab. Once it all cleared up and the scab was gone my skin was perfect underneath.&lt;br /&gt;Please, please, please dont exfoliate before you use this product!&lt;br /&gt;As long as you follow the instructions you should see great results. I&#x27;ve never used a peel before, I&#x27;ve always used creams but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I JUST GOT IT AND DID A PEEL LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING I WAS AMAZED ON HOW CLEAR MY SKIN LOOKS, I HAVE A LOT OF HYPER PIGMENTATION AND ALL THIS IS STARTING TO CLEAR, I&#x27;M SURE THAT AFTER 6 TO 8 TREATMENTS MY SKIN WILL BE FREE OF ALL THOSE BROWN SPOTS THAT I BEEN HAVING FOR A LONG TIME AND NOT EVEN WITH OBAGI AND RETIN-A, I HAVE SEEN ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL. THIS PRODUCT IS CHEAP AND EFFECTIVE, PLEASE TRY IT. I WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This is ONLY great product for my skin ....My  skin looks great,soft ...younger LOVE IT Just be cearful how long you gona keep peeling on your face, for beginers just 2 min.</li>
    <li> Ok - First of all I have to say that I am really experienced to chemical peel. Did a lot of them, got a lot of # experiences .. home peel as well as professional @ the saloon. So I can confirm that I have a strong type of skin that Have always \\&quot;supported\\&quot; strong acid on my face. I had previously bought the \\&quot;pineapple pumpkin\\&quot; from the saem seller and I would say it was strong, the effect was slow but there so I was: HUMMMMMMMMM a stronger version of pineaple pumpkin will be wow so I went ahead and bought thsi product. Dammmmmmmmmmmmn it is STRONGGGGGGGGGG, i could feel how it was burning so i did not left it long and even when i wash washing it out Ifelt my all body was crying .... it just burned and peeled of teh skin. I am glad it was on Friday and di dnot needed to present much at work so I applied a lot of creme over the week end to moisturize .. after 3-4 days teh skin kind of dried out and it was actually pretty nice. Today I can see that there is still new skin drying out and peeling. The skin is nicccccccccce and it looks liek is getting better and better. Anyway wearing make up over it is now almost perfect. The drak patches i had and wanted to get ride off are almost all gone. Will i be using it again? not sure as it was really strong and scared to experience the same but i will use the lighetr version that i previously bought with the same seller \\&quot;pineapple pumpkin enzyme\\&quot;; yes is slower process but healthier and should not burn as much. Nevertheless, reviews are based on different types of skin so experiences will be different ... but being experienced I would also STRONGLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY recommend people to prepare teh skin ..... acid is still strong and so teh skin must be prepared.. meaning that you shoudl apply special peel cream two week ahead doing a peel so teh skin is strong enough to peel and resist. After the peel you should also apply some type of repair skin cream or treatment and use SPF20-30 creme when going out, etc ..... I must admit knowing how it works for a fact, my skin was not prepared for a peel. I will comment on my next try. Other then the burn, both delivery were pretty fast</li>
    <li> this is my first review on amazon. i had to warn you all against this terrible product. it BURNS your skin. I have dark, red, blotchy SCARS on my face. if you&#x27;re a pro at chemical peels, it may work for you but this was my first time and wow, it looks like ACID BURNS. my skin was getting better without it. save yourself the pain, go to a professional.</li>
    <li> This acid peel didn&#x27;t hurt or damage my face and I leave it on approx. 4-5 minutes for each use. I follow up with a toner and moisture cream and my face glows afterwards. I like the peel and you cannot beat the price as compared to getting a face peel at a salon. I&#x27;m glad that I tried this product. My only negative so far is that I have not seen any change in my dark sun spots near my eyes yet so I&#x27;m hopeful that the spots will improve with further use. It is still too early to tell which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME. I WAS SKEPTICAL IF THE PRODUCT WOULD MEET MY DESIRED EFFECT SINCE I HAVE NO PRIOR BLEACHING EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PRODUCTS. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION BASED ON THE OUTCOME USING THIS PRODUCT. I AM AFRICAN AMERICAN WITH A DARK SKIN. I APPLIED THE PRODUCT AROUND THE CHEEK BONE ONCE A WEEK FOR A MONTH. I INITIALLY EXPERIENCED SOME STINGING, BUT NOT AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS EXPECTED, BASED ON CUSTOMER REVIEWS I READ BEFORE ORDERING. I AM VERY PLEASED AND AMAZED AT WHAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN LESS THAN A MONTH. THE DARK UNEVEN/DISCOLORATION AROUND MY CHEEK BONE IS GONE AND TO MY AMAZEMENT, I AM ABOUT 2 SHADES LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT ON ANYONE WITH A SIMILAR PROBLEM AREA.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dark hyperpigmentation from sun damage and acne scars, and this has lightened them a little. I&#x27;m not expecting this to be what makes them go away (which is why I did a 30% TCA peel a few days ago), but this HAS given me the results I wanted, which was to make my skin brighter! This has definitely lightened and brighten up my skin, I feel like I glow now. :) I&#x27;ll be using this every 2-3 weeks I think, plus the bottle has a lot of product, I think it will last a while!</li>
    <li> all this done was make my skin glow all over. I  am going back to TCA where moles, freckles, dark sun damage actually disapear.</li>
    <li> I have done many expensive face peels at the dermatologists office and saw very little or no result for my melasma and dark skin discoloration. It was so bad that i looked like a raccoon and my upper lip was very  dark in discoloration( it looked like i had a mustache, but i don&#x27;t). This was the only product that not only got rid of it, but my skin was renewed and softer looking after only 3 treatments. Whatever you do be sure to follow the directions and only use 1 or2 times a month so your skin has time to fully regenerate otherwise it will burn your skin to the point where it will look like you got leaporacy or partly burned badly on your face. Make sure to use post op face peel ointment after treatment</li>
    <li> Works great and has helped my melasma fade.  Tingles a bit but makes my skin so soft and looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian with light-medium skin. I have a couple of big dark spots the size of the eraser on a No. 2 pencil. I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times in the last 2 weeks. This first time I used this product, I had it on for 30 seconds. The next two times, I was able to tolerate for about 1.5 minutes. I experienced tingling/burning and the spots now feel like sand paper. I&#x27;m hoping this is the start of the peeling process and new cell-turnover. I&#x27;ve noticed that the spots have lightened a shade lighter. I shall update my review in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after getting a $200 &amp;#34;facial&amp;#34; that took all of 4 minutes.  Now, I treat my skin to the same thing in the convenience of my home.  I&#x27;ve used it 6 times already and the bottle is still half full.  I let this sit on my shelf for a couple months because I never used anything like it.  Once I got around to reading the instructions (which are very good),  and used it for the first time, I realized how easy it is. Once you wash your face, it takes about the same amount of time as washing your face again.  Very easy.  I will order from this company after I use up my gel peel.</li>
    <li> Excellent, as expected</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone.  It has truly made a difference in my skin tone.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and it was so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed and the only thing it did for me was sting my face. No results, nothing. Will not be purchasing this product ever again</li>
    <li> I really like this Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel.  The first time I did it I ended up leaving it on too long (not even two minutes) and ended up burning the skin under my eyes.  The skin ended up scabbing over but it looked terrible for about a week.  This was completely my fault as I should have worked up to that amount of time!!!  Now I usually start the water as it takes a minute to warm up, apply a thin layer, and just as the water warms up (about a minute) I quickly rinse it off.  I notice my skin seems tighter, smoother, and I have been having less breakouts.  100% recommend!!! Just make sure you follow the directions and work your way UP with time!</li>
    <li> love love love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have used it for 3 months and have found the results far superior to the in salon peels that I was paying to have done. You have to be careful to stick to the directions precisely because it is strong. But the results are great.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to use this at first, but after reading reviews I decided to try it.  I was very, very happy with it from the first time.  It made my dry skin feel great and has helped me with the sun damage on my face.  Do EXACTLY as the instructions say.  I will say that you MUST use a sunscreen and stay out of the sun for a couple of days after using this peel.  I forgot and went into the sun the next day and  my face was burned.  This is a great product, but please go by the instructions and you will be very happy.  I will be buying this again.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old and starting to see the effects of sunbathing in my teens with baby oil (I cannot believe I did that!).  My cheeks are starting to show increased freckles, and I&#x27;ve got a couple of lovely sun spots.  This product rocks!  I see a noticeable difference in how dark my freckles and spots are.  It does burn a bit when you first start using it, and you&#x27;ll want to start on the low end of the recommended time, but it it totally worth the burn.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I used it on my dark spots and it did lighten them somewhat but I think I need to do a repeat.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!  I left it on a bit too long the second time I used it, but when used as directed, my skin has never looked better!  I&#x27;ll never pay $100+ for a professional peel again!</li>
    <li> I have had several professional peels over the last few years. This product gives the same results with repeated use. For the money, this is by far the best way to go if you have some time. I also like that this product does not cause the excessive peeling that I experienced after the spa.</li>
    <li> I had some freckles lightly and some age spots and I didn&#x27;t want to get laser treatment.&lt;br /&gt;This PERFECT IMAGE product really faded my spots and freckles by only one try and now I&#x27;m up to 2nd time and very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Although peeling off didn&#x27;t actually happened for me but the effect was so good.&lt;br /&gt;However my skin is quite healthy so I didn&#x27;t have any problem of irritating or having red spots as I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Kojic Acid &amp; Bearberry Extract (Professional Chemical Peel)</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that delivers professional results.  It has allowed for me to perform my peels in the comfort of my home at times that are convenient for me versus having to go to a Spa.  It also saves me a lot of money considering that the Spa will charge $65 or more for each peel.  The product leaves my skin super clean, the first few days I experience a little bit of peeling of dead skin but after 3-4 days my skin is firmer and the pores are reduced.  I highly recommend the product.  Also, I received my product within the promised shipping time.</li>
    <li> 37yr female w/ blemish prone skin and early signs of aging (wrinkles and hyper-pigmentation).  I started taking better care of my skin about 2yrs ago and was paying $125/m for regular microdermabrasions and peels at a Derm office.  I racked up over $1K in no time &amp; started searching for less expensive options.  Based on the reviews, I ordered the Lactic and 12% TCA and I absolultely LOVE these products.  They are just as good as my professional peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the Lactic peel it burned more than the TCA, but I was also more aggressive with it &amp; left it one for the max time, expecting it to be milder than the TCA. My entire face turned red, but especially under my eyes -- and they burned like crazy!  After about 2days the red turned to major brown spots that looked like muted age/burn spots under both eyes (which has never happened to me before in all my peels)! I was in a major panic and tried to imagine myself explaining to my husband that I needed several thousand dollars in corrective surgery to fix what I had done with over-the-counter peels that he told me to avoid (he wanted me to leave it to the pros!)~  Fortunately after about 4-5 days my under-eyes peeled &amp; it revealed fresher skin with less wrinkles. :)&lt;br /&gt;Now I almost look forward to my eyes browning b/c it means the product&#x27;s working (the browning hasn&#x27;t happened again after several more peels).  I now switch b/w Lactic and 12% TCA each week (1 peel per week).  I always get mild peeling about 4-5 days after each peel.  Overall my skin looks better.  The peels help with all 3 of my compliants: blemishes, wrinkles, and pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering these products for a long time and will try the moisturizer next.&lt;br /&gt;If you use these products, be smart and follow the directions (and do your own research if you want to treat your eyes!).  Remember I was use to peels when I started these, so my experiences may not be the same as yours!  Good luck!</li>
    <li> THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT ACTUALLY CORRECTS HYPERPIGMENTATION!  I have tried Olay Pro-X, Sephora Products, hydroquinone, and nothing helped with my acne scars or melasma. My dermatologist asked what I used because this is the only product that has shown a noticeable difference. I highly recommend it, but make sure to follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 50% lactic and glycolic acids. I am please with the glycolic so far (only two wks of use) but the lactic acid box looked like the sticker sku on the back was ripped off, there was no plastic cover on the dropper and there was a huge black line on the box. It looked full but I am seriously questioning the legitimacy and efficacy of this bottle and have contacted perfect image for a replacement or refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for approx 5 months now specifically concentrated on the areas of my hyper pigmentation (both cheek bones and upper lip).  I have been VERY pleased with my results, before no amount of make up could cover the uglyness of my patches and now just a light concealer does the trick.  I knew this would not be an overnight solution going in but it has been totally worth it.</li>
    <li> it helps to brighten the face and did reduce the appearance of acne scars moderately</li>
    <li> I helped my mom buy this little blottle, i had to translate them to spanish and she followed them as they say. She couldn&#x27;t be happier, and i can see the diffence, her skin looks smoother and her spots have reduced significantly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, but I had to for the Lactic Acid.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!  I have had melasma/pregnancy mask from the birth control.  I have tried for years to diminish the brown spots with everything form department store brands and drug store brands, from AHA, Glycolic, Vitamin C, etc.  NOTHING Helped at all.  I was getting desperate.  I was ready to make an appointment with a dermatologist.  I was at my wits end.  I have always had porcelain skin.  I tried this once and my brown patches are barely visible, a true miracle!!!  Granted I had many dark dry patches which were very unattractive for about a week and which makeup (dermablend) wouldn&#x27;t cover up, but once the brown dry patches flaked off, the new skin underneath was almost like porcelain.  I cannot believe how amazing this product is.  It was well worth the dark brown patches I had for a week.  Anyone having doubts should try this product.  PHENOMENAL Product.  Thank you Perfect Image for a miracle product!!!  You have the most loyal customer in Philadelphia, PA.  I will be telling everyone about this product!</li>
    <li> Gentle exfoliant. I used a baking soda rinse after to change the ph then I rinsed with cool water. The first time I used it I only left on for about 30 seconds and then added a minute more the next time.</li>
    <li> Interesting product. I have very good, strong facial skin and I do get salon facial chemical peels every 3 weeks. I just used and you can feel the product working (some tingling) and the results were not that noticable. I think once I use it up that I will remain with Z Bigatti Re-Storation Impact fruit eneyme facial mask. That product really leaves your facial skin glowing.</li>
    <li> This product was a wonderful addition to my skin care arsenal. My skin is noticeably smoother, toned with dark spots minimized. My face is much brighter and youthful.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this lactic acid 50% gel peel, so far I&#x27;ve used it twice for 5 minutes and still have not seen any significant changes in my face yet. There&#x27;s a tremendous burning sensation the second this gel touch my face with some mild redness but that goes away instantly after washing my face. My face doesn&#x27;t peel at all which is a good thing. I rate this product a 3 because it&#x27;s not causing any damage either. I&#x27;ll update you guys after completing a 4-6 week treatment.</li>
    <li> First off, I am a 39 year old African American male and I had the best experience with this stuff combine vitamin E pills, scar away and Nadinola fade cream. This past summer I developed some type of discussing sore on my face that required anti bodies to get rid of. This sore scabbed up like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. The sore  was about the size of a dime, halfway in my mustache area and halfway out. So it was noticeable, and I wanted to get rid of it fast. I wasted about $100 on Olay and L&#x27;Oreal type products, and nothing came close. So after about 5 months of trying stuff, I regretfully started using concealer until I  stumbled upon this 50% perfect imagine stuff. Here is what I did. Day 1, I put 2 drops of this acid gel directly on the dark spot and let it sit for about 3 hours. When I wiped off the gel and about 5 layers of skin, I was down to a scab again. That dark spot was a scab under several layers of skin&lt;OMG...  Next I removed all the dark scabby pieces by scraping them with tweezers. Immediately after that, I put scar away on area, followed by Nadinola. I put scar away and Nadinola on trouble area about 5 times a day, and especially at night. After 3 week ,\\&quot;NO MORE DARK SPOT!\\&quot; hahahahahahahahaha...  Note. take vitamin E pills and let new scab fall off on its own. Do Not Peel Scab! Scab may be a little dark, however, when it falls off, your actual skin will match your original skin color.  This stuff is extremely strong so be careful.</li>
    <li> Really bad product just burn my face ,nothing treat or remove ,I don&#x27;t advice any one to use it</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! With proper use results are have been very noticeable. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this once a week for 4 weeks on my sun spots and elbows and I have not seen change yet. I have been following the instructions religiously but so not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this item.  I&#x27;ve been doing acid peels with gycolic, TCA, and another I can&#x27;t quite remember right now, but this is my favorite as of yet!  I have skin that&#x27;s slightly on the dryer side and I also have adult acne around my chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after applying the peel I started to feel a tingle - not so much a &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; like I would feel with the glycolic, but more like a peppermint &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; type sensation.  I kept the peel on for about 5 minutes and simply washed it off by splashing my face with lukewarm water.  I did have some discoloration from where I had pimples, but once the dryness shed, my skin looked and felt fantastic.  Big fan of this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle and am pleased with the results so far.  My skin is smoother and more even-toned.  Unfortunately, I have hypopigmentation (vs. the more common hyperpigmentation) on my neck from a combination of sun damage and acne in my teenage years.  I have spent lots of money on professional and over-the-counter treatments with no success.  Looking for recommendations if anyone has any!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used product to grind down my face but didn&#x27;t seem to get into the base of the scar just sanding around it kind of inaffective. this stuff burns a little but it does the job. i have acne scars and my face does seem to look a slight smoother but i will continue to use this hoping it will make difference.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this but sadly it did not peel at all. Ive done it twice n layered it for a deeper peel but nothing happened. On top of that it broke me out horribly</li>
    <li> This product it&#x27;s really really good. Use it carefully even if you have experience with&lt;br /&gt;peelings. Follow instructions and stick to them.</li>
    <li> this product is very good. i use it once a week and my skin looks better than before.the product has improved my skin.my hyperpementaion is less noticable.it&#x27;s a great product.love it.</li>
    <li> I am a firm believer in exfolliation, but keep in mind this is an ACID. Its not like the over the counter stuff. use caution.I worked my way up to the higher strengths over time. And when switching a strength or type of acid, I do a skin patch test on the inner bend of the elbow where the skin is thin to guage the reaction. I usually keep the acid on about 3 min and then rinse like a maniac. I also keep a bottle of baking soda/water on hand for a quick neutralizer if needed. Afterward I apply plenty of serums and creams and nutrients to speed healing.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used a lot of peels but this was the first time I&#x27;ve used lactic acid, and the first time I&#x27;ve used a gel peel.  I have naturally oily and somewhat acne prone skin(if I don&#x27;t exfoliate REGULARLY).  The peel smells somewhat minty which is nice and I love the fact that its a gel.  Its actually much easier to work with without putting too much on your skin.  Once I finish my peel, my face is super smooth and pretty tight. Also, my skin felt moisturized after I peeled with it the first few times which is crazy, but good. lol It also helps to keep my acne under control.  If I&#x27;m about to have breakouts, I use the peel and they never come to fruition.  I ordered in Jan and used 1-2x&#x27;s a week and I have about 2 applications left.  I would probably say this is a great peel as part of a maintenance routine.  I do have some deeper marks(only a few) that I need something stronger for.  So I&#x27;m probably going to order the TCA gel peel this week sometime.  Now, I HAVE used other tca peels before so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how this one compares.  With TCA, I&#x27;m especially excited to try it in gel form because you really have to apply correctly with TCA or you can burn your skin.  Anyhoo, great product.  Definitely spa quality.  Very effective but not overpowering or harsh.</li>
    <li> Peels are great, when used in both moderation and as instructed. I periodically get chemical peels to freshen up my skin texture and complexion. It does get pretty costly though, and with all the moving around I do, it&#x27;s impossible to get on a regular regimen with a spa. So I&#x27;ve done some glycolic peels at home. They mostly clean out the pores and perform a very light exfoliation. I need something tougher, something to get past a few layers of skin to reveal the bright complexion beneath. I chose this one for it&#x27;s lightening properties. I have dry skin and much hyper-pigmentation. I&#x27;ve been trying everything to lighten the darkening spots, I use retina-A and tons of SPF. Still, nothing seems to work. I got the V peel, which did a so-so job of lightening my spots a bit, but I need something more consistent. So I got this lactic acid peel with the skin brightening kojic acid. I&#x27;ve used it about 2 times so far and I definitely seem a bit brighter. I&#x27;ll continue to use it as my exfoliant about every 2 weeks and I hope for great results!</li>
    <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great with great results!</li>
    <li> I was afraid this would be too strong for my sensitive skin, but it wasn&#x27;t!!  It has helped with my pigmentation issues caused by years in the sun!</li>
    <li> The very best for sun damage.  I have done IPL&#x27;s in past - they are wonderful, but super expensive.  This is actually a very good replacement.  Helps reduce pores, smooth skin and diminish hyper-pigmentation.  Use this carefully.  It is strong.  Better to start with less time and work your way up.  I use just 1-2x/month and really love the results.  Will not be without it.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Ok so the day before yesterday I posted that this product was weak. Well I&#x27;m wrong now! Here&#x27;s the thing at first your face is probably filled with plenty of oil (even washed). I tried the next day i exfoliated and kept it on for 4 minutes and just a little red, not much. The following day, 3rd day, I did not even exfoliate but left it on for 3 minutes, because I have been doing it back to back. But my face is extremely red and tender that it is hard for me to touch. I panicked and immediately applied aloe vera (thank God I still had left) and moisturizing cream. The burning sensation went away but I&#x27;m still hoping to see results (good ones). For now I rated 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t seen results but one thing is for sure, my advice to anyone is to NOT underestimate this product. It does the work depending how thorough you clean your face and frequent use. Please do not use more than 3 minutes, I could imagine how horrible I would&#x27;ve looked. But for now I think I&#x27;m fine. It reminds me of the time I went to a dermatologist and they did the chemical peel, which felt a hundred times worse than this. Thats why I rather go with this alternative, which enables me to control it at &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; level.</li>
    <li> I used this lactic acid once a week for 3 weeks. I have a great result from it in 2 weeks, my skin is smooth and dewy look even without any makeup on, and It&#x27;s very easy to use, I put on 30 second on my first trial, then I add another 30 second on the following week for 1 minute total. It was great, until yesterday I was too excited with my result, I got compliments from my coworker and friend, so I decided to put on 2 minutes, which it was too harsh for my skin. I got red rash on both of my cheek last night, my coworker said it looks like sunburn. It&#x27;s not too bad, I just feel my skin on my cheek is a little bit sensitive to touch. I&#x27;m sure it will get better in couple days, it just need patient. I think time is the most important factor in this process.</li>
    <li> Follow directions!!!! first time burn so much, i could only endure 30 seconds, After the second time i left it on for a whole minute, started peeling right away and boy it works!!!  couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
    <li> Perfect thank you for fast shipping</li>
    <li> I like this peel as it has a gel like consistency where others are more runny and harder to keep in place, skin felt nice and clean aftert and it did what it was suppose to do thank you</li>
    <li> I used another product similiar to this, but this is better. I have some small sun spots &amp; these spots have definitely lightened since using this product. I followed the directions exactly, and it has never damaged/burned my skin.  Right after treatment face looks fresher.  I&#x27;ve never had salon facials, so I can&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this product. It left more blemishes on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t work as described even though we take all the precautions.</li>
    <li> This product was a little too strong on my face so I tried it on the bottom of my feet. I know this is not how the product is intended to be used but it worked great! All the dry skin was easily scrubbed off with a pumice stone. I&#x27;ll buy it again just for my feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months.  I use it every 10 days or so.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin or dark spots (which was the reason I bought it) but I do like how it exfoliates.  I seem to get different results each time I use it.  It burned a little the first time I used it but then the 2nd and 3rd times it didn&#x27;t.  Then all of a sudden, on the 4th application it burned pretty bad.  I leave it on for 1-3 minutes each time and haven&#x27;t upped the time.  My skin feels really clean afterwards and it&#x27;s easy to use my pore extractor to clean out the pores on my nose.  For that reason alone, I will keep using it.  My skin is red for a day or two after and it does get dry and flaky.  I make sure to use it when I don&#x27;t have any major events coming up within 4 days.  My skin is always back to normal within those 4 days.  If you buy this, manage your expectations.</li>
    <li> I can not give you complete review because I purchased  it  as present for my niece&lt;br /&gt; and I have not recieved any feedback to this date. However I guess it should help&lt;br /&gt;with her skin problems...... Thank you .....</li>
    <li> I am an Esthetician and use this product on my clients. Well I started with myself first and loved it,got so many compliments on my glowing  skin. You can use mask,serum or creams and see results, because your skin can absorb all this stuff after this great peel.Just follow the instructions and get skin pH balancer. Will really recommend this product for people who are looking for not very expensive but effective.</li>
    <li> I get regular glycolic facials (every 5 weeks)  and this was exactly the product I was looking for to use in between my visits or if I&#x27;m broke and have to skip a month. Removes dead skin and lightens marks. Use exactly as directed.</li>
    <li> This is great for removing dead skin, I use it twice a week. It does not sting and my skin barely peels. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is great.. To have someone do it in clinic is very costly. This takes 2 minutes, then you are done. Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect price, saves you time</li>
    <li> I use this for my various sunspots and sun damage on face and body. I can&#x27;t use it too long on the face, but it has lightened my pigmentation and feels very hydrating. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> It worked but slower than I thought... The spots aren&#x27;t gone but well reduced in brightness an it got rid if my sun burn.</li>
    <li> I use this product occasionally, but need to make a habit of it.  I also use the wrinkle cream, and the two together are great.  My skin feels really silky.  Great products.</li>
    <li> This peel is very effective! I notice an immediate glow after using it. It does sting a bit, I usually can only leave it on for 30-45 seconds before rinsing with cold water. I can tell a difference right away. It helps smooth uneven skin texture and makes my pores appear smaller. I do not have sensitive skin, so I am not sure if it would be a good product for them, but for me? Its wonderful! About me:  I have dry, mature skin, enlarged pores and am always battling brown spots and fine lines.</li>
    <li> I bought this awhile ago, looking for something to help my pretty severe acne scars that I had been dealing with since I was a teenager. I still have them, but they are definitely diminished, and its noticeable. The scars were so heavy that I think expecting this product to fully remove them would have been a mistake on my part, so I was completely satisfied. I have continued to use the peel and notice my skin being clearer each time I use it. It is very strong however, so you can&#x27;t use it too often or leave it on too long. (all explained in the instructions.) Overall, I was completely satisfied, and I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a chemical peel option without going to a dermatologist and paying dermatologist prices.</li>
    <li> I love this product! After I use it my skin is so tight and fresh looking. I did burn around my cheek bones but it was only red for a couple of hours then it was great. It just looked like a small sunburn.</li>
    <li> great product unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find the cleanser that was recommended to use with it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great for weekly maintenance and to keep your skin fresh and radiant.  You probably won&#x27;t peel so don&#x27;t over apply.</li>
    <li> This is very powerful stuff.  Don&#x27;t leave it on for more than a minute.</li>
    <li> This peel does not work and most of the positive reviews are fake. I tried it the first time, left it on for 30 seconds and thought nothing of it. Second time, left it on for 5 minutes and let me tell you, I have been in hiding since then. I have a rash on my face that will not go away, the sides of my nose are burned so here comes hyperpigmentation. I am a black woman in her early 30&#x27;s, trying to get rid of hyperpigmentation and what this product did was cause me more problems. I will not buy this product again, no thanks.</li>
    <li> I  would add to the other positive reviews that it would be more prudent to use this product during late Fall -Winter time when the Sun  is less active. Using sunblock in the Summer is not much of a help because it has to be applied at least every hour when outside and 20 minutes prior, and lets be honest - sometimes we forgot to do so. On the same point- doctors do recommend to do peeling in the late Fall - Winter time.</li>
    <li> I have some pigmentation around my forehead that I was hoping to lighten with this product. I&#x27;ve used the peel three times now and have yet to see any sort of change. I get some tingling when left on for 1.5-2 mins as suggested, and my skin feels tender afterwards, but then... nothing. I&#x27;m going to continue the regiment until the bottle is gone, but so far, not too sure if this actually works.</li>
    <li> Wow this really does work its magic. I had this stupid smile crease on one side of my face, and this stuff actually helped to make it go away! Also makes your skin paler if that is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> This peel is very, very weak. Have used it 3 times for good measure and have not seen a spec of difference.  Did I get a defective product????  I should of returned it.</li>
    <li> I have a highly sensitive skin. Did just a couple of peels way in the past. Then started with salicilic acid to get the sking to get used to peeling. Went up to 30% salycilic for a month. Now am trying this one. First go-round burnt most sensitive areas around temples, nostrils, top of cheekbones. I have pigmentation spots on jaws and cheeks. These are the only areas i use the cream on now. Works wonders for the spots. Also started doing the backs of my hands for prevention. Looks good, too. I only leave it on for 2 minutes, no longer than that.</li>
    <li> Saw a difference in my freckles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever tried a home glycolic peel and had mixed results (okay the first time but burned me- leaving scars/hyper-pigmentation around jawline that&#x27;s still there after one year with the second and final use). I was a little wary to try a peel as strong as this one, but decided to give it a try. First, I have to say that I did not follow the instructions to prep with rubbing alcohol as I worry that this would leave my skin too &#x27;bare&#x27; for the peel. I experimented and washed my face with a body wash before using the first time then with a more drying bar soap before using the peel the second time. I noticed a definite difference (felt the burn of the peel more with the more drying bar soap), so counsel folks to do the first peel with a &#x27;less cleansing&#x27; cleanser the first time and work up to more cleansing/drying soaps and possibly to the alcohol prep over time. Anyway, results have been really good so far (I&#x27;ve used the peel 5-6 times, approx every week though had a two-week period where I didn&#x27;t use it as I was out of town and forgot to pack it). I have olive-toned skin and hyper-pigmentation spots from former pimples that can last for many months. Saw a lightening and general blending of these marks after 2 peels. Skin tone is overall much improved (I&#x27;m usually a little blotchy). However, heed the warnings about the sun!!! Even with SPF15 on my face (which is usually plenty for my darker skin), I was outside in the summer sun for several hours and my hyper-pigmented spots worsened again - meaning, I reversed the progress I had made and had to start over! My own fault as I should have stayed out of the sun (or limited my exposure). Besides the improvements in general skin tone and hyper-pigmentation, I noticed an overall improvement in skin texture and appearance of pores on my cheeks. The gel consistency is also really nice as it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t drip all over the place(I recommend a fan brush. Using cotton wastes a lot of product). Saw a definite decline in the 2 weeks I didn&#x27;t use it, so will be much more consistent now though twice a week is too much for my skin. Definitely a good buy and I think maybe better for olive-skinned folks than glycolic peels.cline in the 2 weeks I didn&#x27;t use it, so will be much more consistent now though twice a week is too much for my skin. Definitely a good buy and I think maybe better for olive-skinned folks than glycolic peels.</li>
    <li> I have had several chemical peels over the last several years (professionally done) and have NEVER EVER BEEN BURNED LIKE THIS. I followed the instructions and left the treatment on only a few minutes. I did not anticipate having a horrible reaction since lactic acid is generally a light peel. I WAS VERY WRONG. I LOOK LIKE I LIT MY FACE ON FIRE. it has been several days and there is no evidence of healing. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I just received this a couple of days ago. Used it yesterday and will use on a weekly basis. My friend recommended it and swears by it.</li>
    <li> Havent tried yet working my way up to after I continue to use 30% peel.  Since I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product,does double duty with fine lines and dark spots</li>
    <li> This product works very well. Must follow directions and build a tolerance. Do not leave on or use more often than instructed. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this peel on a regular basis, and everyone around me notices the difference. I highly recommend it to people who have dark spots on their faces.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t do a very good job at using this regularly (I believe it says to use it once a week), however I had dark acne scars on my cheeks and now they&#x27;re almost completely gone. As warned though, it does dry out your skin and burns/itches quite a bit. Worth it though!</li>
    <li> My fault not reading instructions well. Will keep using it because its natural.  You&#x27;ll get a burning so badly if not used correctly.</li>
    <li> Waste of my money. I have tried it for almost 2 months and no difference. It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
    <li> tried it 3x&#x27;s now (different time length) and once on my sis (she said it burned her and gave her a bubble type mark). I haven&#x27;t seem major results. other than my skin feeling smooth the next day, then back to normal. Nothing looks different, sunspots, melasma, wrinkles, pores... all the same. Last time I did it for 8 mins and it burned patches of areas on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rubbed alcohol, put Acid on, removed w/Baking soda and water. refreshed with cold water and slathered cream/rose seed hip oil. Nothing.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best at-home peels I have ever used.  The expensive peel pads and national brand peels do not even come close to the results you see with this one.  It is comparable to a spa peel.</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders on my skin. I saw results after the first use. It certainly works better than some of the other peels I have used before. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and a total skin freak. I have decent skin but went through a phase where I had a lot of hormonal pimples along my jaw line. Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t as knowledgeable about skin at the time and always picked at them, leaving lots of darkened spots. This product has definitely faded the spots enough where I don&#x27;t need to cover them with make-up anymore. It is however very strong and I definitely left it on too long and ended up burning parts of my skin to the point where they scabbed and took at least a week to heal. I also would caution not to put it directly on pimples, I made the mistake of doing this and it completely burned the entire area of the pimple and the skin surrounding the pimple. Overall a good product, my skin is probably just too young and sensitive for it.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, with some discoloration caused by old acne scars. I&#x27;ve used this peel 3x now, and it helps a lot. The texture of my skin improved, pores are less visible, brown spots are diminishing, I break out less frequently. It has a very easy to follow instructions -- at least for me b/c I&#x27;ve had peels in the past. There is no down time, just some minor peeling. I only leave it on my skin for 5 minutes, b/c I also use retinol on a regular basis. I start the retinol 2 days after the peel, and stop it 2 days prior to it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and the results; will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used this product for over a month and I am ready for review now.. Yes it is a great product on face for removing any discoloration and my skin really looks great... The product has to be carefully used, only based on the recommendations as in document you get with it. Do not scrub before or after the application and use some really good moisturizer like coconut oil or argon oil or any nice face cream with soothing effect and in few weeks your skin will be the best... I love this one and will buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and arms and it&#x27;s strong enough to give great results, but gentle enough to apply to my skin without worry.&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I have thick, oily skin that&#x27;s very sensitive and prone to breakouts, but my using this product just a few times, I was able to significantly reduce the acne scars on my face. I used to have ice pick scars and finally I have smooth skin. I still have pigmentation issues and some brown and pink spots, but it&#x27;s evened out my skin texture.</li>
    <li> Product works great! It left my skin feeling brand new.Just follow the directions on the product.I even received my shipment in a quick manner.</li>
    <li> Really great product! It doesn&#x27;t leave my face super red or dried out and my face is baby smooth :)</li>
    <li> The product is not worth it. It makes your skin looks and feels horrible for a few days and when everything heals you don&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
    <li> Burned me. Now I have a dark scar when I tried to put it over a pimple. I recommend going to the professionals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it three times and I already feel a difference. It does make the skin look brighter and more even. I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic changes but I didn&#x27;t really have any spots or anything to begin with. I&#x27;m a brown girl and I tan VERY easily so I used this to lighten my tan, and I think it did that a bit.</li>
    <li> LOve this product so much. It is really work on my skin afte ri use it 3 days and still continued to use this.  I can see a dark spot are getting lighting and clear skin complexion. LOing it.</li>
    <li> Great product if you have acne. It worked for me just after two uses but you should give a product at least 6 months before making full judgment. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Alright, real talk. This stuff hurts. It&#x27;s a burning, itching sting. But it&#x27;s bearable. You have to use it regularly to see any kind of results, and their estimate of how much is needed for a single treatment is very conservative. For one, thin layer it takes me three dropper fulls. Also the results aren&#x27;t what you can expect from a professional treatment but, for an in home product, it does what it says. I would definitely order this again, though I may try one of their other acid formulations to see how I like it.</li>
    <li> I love all their products... Winters are long here and we are in the mountains...Dry cold is hard on skin so wear lots of covering...Use this to keep the skin soft and healthy...Gets too dry and hard to moisturize.. Love how this softens the surface...I&#x27;m 62 and go back and forth between this one and the pineapple pumpkin one....this one is stronger..so beware...but the results are immediate....protect afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have used the peel four times and my skin is visibly smoother, clearer, &amp; scarring is less noticeable. Skin feels soft after use and days after. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Hurts like hell skin irritation. Useless</li>
    <li> This made my skin tighter and I felt like my skin was refreshed, the size is a great value for the money, you don&#x27;t need to use much for each application.</li>
    <li> My face has never been this soft. Lightens ugly sun spots. 1x a week For 10 min. Worth the price</li>
    <li> I have used this peel about 6 times, and had no peeling at all, no lightening of my spots and patches either.  I have a 35% Lactic Acid peel from another company, &#x27;New Beauty Solutions&#x27; and that peel worked better.</li>
    <li> used this product a few times and did not notice a difference.  Probably will just go to a professional salon.</li>
    <li> I used this peel about 6 times in the span of 2 months probably, and I noticed only a little difference in the coloring and texture of my skin. Not too much improvement over long term but I did notice some fading of scarring and my breakouts did go down quicker. Worth a shot since everyone is different. Don&#x27;t be scared to try it!</li>
    <li> I think the product was probably good but unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t use it enough times before it broke down the printed numbers on the glass dropper contaminating the product. I have contacted Amazon about this issue and hope the company offers me a replacement so that I can continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month, have applied it twice a week and my blotchy dark spots are almost completely gone!!! Ive used many dark&lt;br /&gt;spot correctors and nothing worked as good as this, was considering laser until i found this on Amazon and so glad I did 🙏👍❤</li>
    <li> With the problem spots on the face slightly clear my problem but I burn, but is not as fast as they say. I have not had the benefits shown in the product.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about doing this peel at home, but I followed the directions and researched a lot online.  As long as you are careful, you will get good results.  I have worked up to 3 minutes with this peel, but was at 30 seconds the first time.  I never get red, thought I expected to.  I never see active peeling.  However, about 2 days later I have a noticeable difference.  I maintain about once a month now.  I still have about a third left and I have been using it for 9 months.  It will probably last a full year and I am generous with my layering.</li>
    <li> Works great! Just don&#x27;t leave it on too long.....</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy a chemical peel, but I am SO glad I bought this one!  I use it once a week and my skin has never been better.  It makes my skin so smooth and extremely radiant.  A definite alternative to those expensive peels.  A must buy!</li>
    <li> I use this product for acne pots and it works really well.  It&#x27;s a little on the stong side, so please follow instructions.  I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I expected. Works well. But it is strong, use caution. Good for targeting areas of discoloration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several months ago, wanted to wait till I see results to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over last 2 - 3 years (I&#x27;m Asian and in my late 30s) I&#x27;ve had growing dark spots on both cheeks and bridge of nose.  My mustache area is starting to a dark shadow as well.  Concealer can no longer cover.  I&#x27;ve gone to 2 well respected dermatologist in the last 2 - 3 years.  They both recommend their laser services.  It would be multiple sessions at $400+ per session, for as long as it takes to fade the spots.  They are certain mine are from sun damage during my tween years.  And I agree (grew up on the beaches of Florida).  I&#x27;m sure the dermo&#x27;s treatment would work, after a lot of money, but mostly I fear it would be too aggressive for my thin skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read A LOT of reviews and documentation before I chose Perfect Image&#x27;s Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel - I proceeded cautiously, followed instructions meticulously.  First time at 30 seconds.  I now leave it on for 5 minutes, and I do it once a week.  After 4 weeks I&#x27;m seeing visible improvements.  The smaller lighter dots are gone.  The large dark ones have faded as much as 40 - 50%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s not leaving me red like I am going through a peeling process.  I am dried out, with some peeling, but moisturizer will take care of it.  Overall face is bright, spots fading at a visible comfortable rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU PERFECT IMAGE for making a product that works and offering it at an affordable price.  Thanks Amazon for amazing shipping.</li>
    <li> So I just recieved my peel in and I tried a couple days after recieving it and I really like it,I feel like it tighted my face and brightened my face. The only thing is my face did not frost is that normal? I have tried (olay) peel and my had frost on it but I don&#x27;t think it really did what this peel did as in brighten and tighten it&#x27;s kinda weird! Not really experienced with peels so any comments about my question or just anything about peels would be much appreciated! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was particularly concerned about the summer sun and its effect on my skin.  I find this product provides subtle changes while not causing burning and down days.  I&#x27;m especially pleased to see hyperpigmentation reduction.  Its definitely worth a try, if you want a peel that won&#x27;t traumatize your skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 months now. I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 times in total. It&#x27;s easy to apply, and the result is dramatically wonderful. I do feel stingy while leaving the product on the face, use a fan will help to relief the feeling. I only left it on for 3-5 minutes on my face each time. a day or two after the very first use, I noticed my face was softer, and the skin tone was brighter. I used it once per 4 days, and I can definitely see my skin tone became much more radiant, and the texture feels softer. After six application, I&#x27;ve only used about 10% of the product.</li>
    <li> This peel leaves my skin soft and makes my pores look smaller.  I have to use it only occasionally because it is powerful!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. I had a trial-and-error period at the beginning where I burned myself just a teeny bit and ended up red and flaking. But I learned that it is a powerful product, and when used correctly, it can make a big difference. I feel like I&#x27;m a little oilier on the cheeks, but I have fewer clogged pores and less sun damage.</li>
    <li> I just started using this peel and even after the first use my skin looked different.  The pores on my face looked tiny and I just looked refreshed.  I havent used it enough to see whether it helps with discoloration.  However, please be very careful when applying this acid on your face.  I followed directions and still got a burn right around my nose (I guess that area was most sensitive). I like this peel better than the 20% salicylic acid because I peel tremendously with the salicylic acid while the kojic was more of an isolated burn that I hope to avoid in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician in a hair salon and I use this product all the time. The results are amazing. I think is is better than PCA or Jan Marani or lots of other professional products that I have used over the years. It&#x27;s also very good to use on age spots on your hands. It just helps to rejuvenate and give them a more youthful look. Neck and hands are one of the first signs of aging ... this product does an amazing job. And it is also great for the decollate area .... I consider this a very professional product.</li>
    <li> I waited before providing a review because I wanted to use it for at least 4 weeks.  This is a strong but gentle peel, and it works, you will have skin shedding. I used this product on my arms to get rid of my uneven tan from the summer.  It will sting when applied, but isn&#x27;t unbearable. I experienced micro flaking as opposed to peeling in sheets.  I am very pleased with the product  and looking to try other peels in this line.</li>
    <li> It comes with directions so you  can be cautious. It is a great peel . It hardly has a scent and it is efficient due to the dropper that comes with it.</li>
    <li> i have not used this product religiously so I can&#x27;t really make a solid statement yet; however, it is a good product for sure. my face feels smooth and looks fresh the next day after applying this product. will continue using it on weekly basis to see if it will remove the acne scars that i have.</li>
    <li> It is good but not perfect as I thought before.&lt;br /&gt;You have to use it with cautions.&lt;br /&gt;Try to read and memorize all instructions as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product because besides having lactic acid as the main ingredient, it has many botanical extracts that helps with healing and calming my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this peel for a few months now and am pretty pleased with the results. I am in my early 30s and have acne prone skin with some signs of wrinkling and sun spots. My skin is softer and seems to be some what improving. This does save me time and money with chemical peels in the doctor&#x27;s office. I am eager to order the 70% peel this next go around with hopes of even better looking skin.</li>
    <li> ( I changed my rating from 1 star to 3 because the peel did improve skin tone a bit and minimized the appearance on the few acne scars that I had)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is my initial review when I woke up the next morning with an extremely red face and freaked out!)&lt;br /&gt;Ok, after using this product last night my reaction this morning was \\&quot;WHAT THE H#$@\\&quot; !!! I have previously done many peels such as glycol/lactic 60% from skin obsession with no problems to combat acne. I would have some peeling after a few days but thats it. THis product made my skin all red PLUS in a few places in the chin area the skin started bubbling and the skin jut rubbed off like 5 minutes after washing the peel off.  Not only my face is red and irritated,  to the point I cant even go in public but now I have to deal with healing the burn marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this product unless you want to spend your days in a dark room (because your face will the red and raw and very vulnerable to discoloration from them sun)  and look like a lizard.&lt;br /&gt;Your few wrinkles and/or acne spots are not worth it unless you have several weeks completely free and do not have to go out anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Four days have passed since I performed the peel. The red-brown skin which covered my lower forehead,cheeks and chin peeled of yesterday (the 3nd day) leaving pink skin underneath which is slowly going away.I still have some small reddish-brown spots that haven&#x27;t peeled. Overall I am so relieved that this ordeal is about 2/3 of the way over.  I keep my face covered in aquaphor which I think really helped with the healing process.PLus, I have been taking large amounts of vitamins A,E,C and drinking lots of green tea which helps with inflammation. I have not used any cleansers instead I just splash my face with water in the morning and night. I have not been outside for 4 days now and will probably have to ask for leave from work for the following week so I am not exposed to sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday: peel performed, skin red,hot, bubbly in several places on the chin-I am worried about the burnt areas&lt;br /&gt;Thursday; face red, still feels warm-I am extremely worried that I have messed up&lt;br /&gt;Fri: overall redness has gone down, instead it has been replaced by ugly red-brown skin -Still worried, perhaps I have permanent scarring? Should I start saving for facial reconstructive surgery?&lt;br /&gt;Sat: red-brown skin is peeling off, pink skin underneath- I am feeling much more hopeful&lt;br /&gt;Sun:pink skin has lightened a bit- Im excited for it to heal!&lt;br /&gt;Mon: skin mostly light pink, lighter than the day before. in a few places that just recently peeled it&#x27;s still a bit brighter pink. The few acne spots that i had are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after much research.  I have melasma (or chloasma, if it occurs outside of pregnancy, which mine is) and this is working to lessen the visibility of the dark spot -- which occurs, dreadfully, on my upper lip.  This product is easy to use, the instructions are simple to read, and the effects are instantaneous!  I have very sensitive skin and I tolerate it perfectly.  If you are even thinking of purchasing any kind of peel, get this stuff!  The ingredients in this (and their other products as well) are more natural and less harsh than conventional stuff.  Shipping was prompt and item arrived in perfect condition.  I will definitely be buying more . . . and other items as well.</li>
    <li> I had this smallish, but slightly med dark spot near my mouth, but not on my lips of course! Just close to the cheek area too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of makeup daily and wanted to improve my skin,so I can look decent for work you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make up for me is a time waster when you have to be at work by 6am most days on rare 8am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im so thankful I only did it on that spot just think if I did my whole face!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk about looking like a burned victim minus the fire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I left it on my face/spot for two minutes since I was new to it I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on for five or ten minutes anyway...a no no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind giving this one star...........it will peel....it will...to your flesh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it another star because it did remove my dark spot so it worked ...so well I had this bright pink spot on my face and even make up couldn&#x27;t hide. Yes coworkers stared at my face....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned to sadly embrace my acne and marks or look like someone set you a blaze. You can guess what I picked?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these great reviews.....are they real?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue my search for the perfect peel or lighter to rid me of my acne *sad face*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took about a month and some days for my face to look normal again.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using it sparingly on spots and very gradual it is hard to give this a evaluation.  But so far I am pleased at the progress and will continue treatment</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B006ZBP8NM Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Kojic Acid &amp; Bearberry Extract (Professional Chemical Peel)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this product very quickly!  In just a matter of 2 or 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;Tried it the next day and it is amazing how it works.  As I had never used this before and was a little concerned about how it would react, I only left it on for about 2 minutes.  I could feel it tingling so knew it was doing something.  I washed it off and didnt really notice to much change but the next day I could see that I had some slight flaking on my skin.  Took a couple of days to  peel off and I definitely could see a slight improvement!  Started using it once or twice a week and&lt;br /&gt;could really see a difference! My skin looked softer and not so dry!  I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it!&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had the first time, was when I took the product off I guess I didnt get it completely off the one corner of my mouth and I developed a small rashy looking thing. (I think it was a slight burn).  So be sure you rinse it off thoroughly.  I havent had a problem since the first time! I am up to about five minutes or a little longer now! I will definite continue to use this!!</li>
    <li> I followed directions exactly as written: did a patch test, cleaned skin thoroughly and then used alcohol, etc. I applied for 1 minute, a week later applied for 2 minutes, a week later applied twice - first for 4 minutes and then for 2 minutes.  The product did nothing and was a complete waste of money.  I am 58 and have always taken good care of my fair skin. If anyone has any suggestions since it seems to work well for many, please let me know.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well the Perfect Image Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel resurfaced my face after the first use!  My face hasn&#x27;t been that smooth in a number of years and the price is so reasonable!</li>
    <li> Sunspots Are actually going away! Have tried a lot of expensive products out there &amp; have finally found something that is working. I originally bought started with Perfect Image by buying the Salicylic cleanser &amp; was &amp; still am very pleased. So I figured I&#x27;d try the Lactic Acid 50 peel. sunspots faded after first use.  Will definitely be sticking with Perfect Image! Products so far have been second to none! Please develope a body wash!</li>
    <li> I know I will love it...I love the peel works fast and makes your skin look like new. Careful using this product</li>
    <li> I use this in a professional practice and have the same results as some products triple the price. After 2 peels you will see a difference in the skin texture and color.</li>
    <li> I use this peel every week ,it clears my skin and make it glow</li>
    <li> This product does EXACTLY what it claims to do! Be sure to follow the instructions carefully, it can and will burn or bleach your skin if you don&#x27;t follow the directions. 5 to 7 minutes works perfectly for me! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I waited to complete my series of 2 peels per week for 6 weeks before reviewing this product. A little bit about me: I have Asian skin and in my early 20&#x27;s. My skin is oily and pretty tough. I have been suffering hormonal acne for about 2 and a half years.  I have acne scars and some active cystic acne all over my cheeks and chin. It looked like I had a beard. It was horrible. I was very self conscious and would never let anyone see my bare face. The acne scars made my face look like it was 2-3 shades darker than my original skin color which is pretty light. I couldn&#x27;t even look at people straight in the eye because I lost all my self confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this has helped save my face! The first time I did it, I only left it on for 1 minute just to see how my face would react. I can see some immediate brightening and the next day some of my active acne had gone down and there was less swelling. I increased the time by 30 seconds after each peel until I got to 5 minutes because I didn&#x27;t want to risk burning my skin and so it could get use to it. There was no down time. It looks noticeably better and the scars are lighter after each peel. I do not break out as much and my make up goes on a lot smoother and you can barely see my scars now if I wear foundation. Please, please make sure you use sunscreen and wear a hat if you do plan to spend time outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have a long way to go but I am very happy with the results. I started out with not expecting too much out of this product because nothing had worked for me. But I am glad I gave it a try. Give it some time because you will start noticing subtle changes. I recently bought the salicylic acid peel and am looking forward to try it.</li>
    <li> I had hyperpigmentation on my skin that did not go away with microdermabrasions whatsoever! I decided to look into chemicals peels for removing post-hyperpigmentation and scarring. I got this and I have to say, it really did work but you really have to have a consistent regimen. If you don&#x27;t follow through, it will not improve. After about a month, my skin tone is much, much improved. I&#x27;m going to try the TCA 12% by Perfect-Image for other scarring problems that I have. I had some minor problems with my product, but Perfect-Image was able to resolve it for me with a new bottle. I&#x27;m very pleased with the customer service and will continue to buy their products. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> it is ok and it works</li>
    <li> I have only use it 3 times but my skin looks a little better and is so smooth.</li>
    <li> Noticed Results after the first use.  Visibly reduced hyperpigmentation that was lingering around for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is made for post apocalyptic book of eli type stuff, so I need something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying hydrochloric acid next.</li>
    <li> My skin was a little to sensitive. ..however less of the gel works great. Made my skin more even and glowed</li>
    <li> I left it on for 10 minutes. I didn&#x27;t peel and there was zero change in my skin. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.</li>
    <li> If you are not a professional or is being treated by one.  Leave this type of product alone.&lt;br /&gt;I burned my skin worst than when I started.  I have no desires to ever try to remove dark&lt;br /&gt;spots without going to a professional Medical Doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am worst off than I started.  Can anyone help me.......?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy AB</li>
    <li> Be very careful when using! If you are getting burned it is because you are leaving it on too long!! This product works well when used properly.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product. I use it alone or in DIY masks. It has brightened, tightened, and rejuvenated my skin.</li>
    <li> This product I must say really does work. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks or so and this is my very first time using something this strong on my face. I have really bad dark spots and using this product once a week really is helping lighten them. I did get a small burn on my face, but it did heal properly with the right care. I wish I would have known about this product years ago.</li>
    <li> I used this product ONCE and a month later my face still hasn&#x27;t healed. My face blistered and cracked. I&#x27;m now left with scars. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. STAY AWAY!!!!</li>
    <li> Waste of money, this didnt work at all, ive done at least 3 applications on different areas and nothing.  Made my dark marks look darker and no peeling. Ive used lactic acid before but this is crap, im so upset I thought this was going to be a promiseing product and I could feel less insecure. I used it on my under arms, knees, scar on my foot and my bikini area. Left a dark patch on my biniki area and didnt do a thing anywhere else. Forget about buying this</li>
    <li> I am still waiting for results. I not know how it suppose to work. If peel what do I do next? Don&#x27;t know if I need to buy more or not.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get rid of my dark spots and I will not say it worked 100 % but I am able to see significant difference if I use once in a week</li>
    <li> Pretty good peel. Works well on my face and gets the job done. Not as terrible as some people made it seem like in terms of the sensitivity. I&#x27;ve only used it once and definitely noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions to the tee, even did a test on my inner arm like it suggests. The test on my arm went perfectly fine, I felt no burning or tingling sensation at all. I then applied it to my face. The application didn&#x27;t feel like it was tearing apart my skin, but it was. I left it on for 120 seconds. I washed it off and the next day had rash-like bumps all over my face, and a chemical burn on my right cheek. Its been a week and I&#x27;m still healing from the effects. Never again, such a waste of 35 bucks.</li>
    <li> I like it. Pores look smaller the day after but be sure to read direction so as to not burn your skin.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect with the lactic acid peel as many things claim to do what this peel does...but this peel TRULY works. I have noticed a SIGNIFICANT change in my skin. It is smoother and I break out less often. The one word of caution is to follow the directions CLOSELY. Do not leave the product on for too long!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now and have seen changes in the hyperpigmentation I have around my mouth. It’s not totally gone but I feel like over time the dark spots will fade a lot. This was a gentle peel for me. I’ve never used peels before and was worried this might be too strong. I used it exactly as the directions say and have had no burning or any problems. I’m excited to see what the next few months bring.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product specifically for a small area of my face for melasma.  I have used it once a week over the last six weeks with a small amount of improvement.</li>
    <li> I should mention I am a 45 year old African American woman.  After reading the reviews I was really looking forward to rejuvenated skin.  I followed the extensive directions; using only for 30 seconds the first time.  No results.  Used longer each time but have not received the results everyone else has experienced.  I did manage to burn the skin about 1 inch from my eye.  I have used nearly half the bottle and have not experienced much peeling, lots of buring though.  It&#x27;s rather pricey so I will keep playing with it hoping things improve.  At this point i wont buy again.  Perhaps not the best for African American skin, which is usually not as fragile as other skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- I did finish the bottle but did not have any results.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have actually noticed no visible difference and I have used the product about 8 times. It does make my skin dry but no real peeling. Oh well. I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of different home peels...and this one is definitely a  &amp;#34;buy again&amp;#34; for me! I have sensitive skin so I need to be careful,but this product did not &#x27;over-peel&#x27; or upset my face f\afterwards. I like the lactic acid base it had less of that stinging,burning sensation when on my skin. It does not produce that &amp;#34;shedding skin&amp;#34; effect, which Is not something I want to deal with when I am in my regular work mode, but I have seen the difference of clearer skin, more even skin tone  and a brighter complexion after a total of 4 uses now.</li>
    <li> stay away from this. You won&#x27;t see any differece . It was such a west of my money and my skin. It won&#x27;t peel or do anything.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do nothing tbh. I used it exactly how what it said and got no good results. That&#x27;s my opinion.</li>
    <li> First peel I ever used and was totally worth it. Really effective at smoothing the skin. Make sure you do your research online about using this. I use a cotton pad to spread this on my face. At first, I left it on for about 1 minute. Now, I leave it on for about 3-4 minutes. I use this every 1.5-2 weeks. I have never had any irritation or discomfort for using this. I am 24 and use this for dark spots and prevention and am happy with the effects.</li>
    <li> I had severe adult acne when i stopped breast feeding due to hormonal changes . I used some topical treatement to cure acne which stopped any new acne from popping . But the treatment did not help me with the acne scars . Thats when i came across this peel . To begin with i used this peel along with the topical medication my doctor prescribed and the result was magical .All the scars faded over a period of 3 months .I recommend using it once a week as you want to allow new skin cells to generate. It is so simple to use, but it&#x27;s very important to be careful on how you prep your skin and how long you leave it on. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin normally but if i leave the peel on too long i get red blotches . Thats why i follow all the instructions to T . DO NOT USE THIS PEEL IF YOU HAVE ACTIVE ACNE .Wait till all your acne have dried out and there are no pink\red acne on your face . If you have active acne using this peel might give you more acne as this peels the top layer of skin exposing surrounding skin to active acne bacteria . These are the steps i follow&lt;br /&gt;1. I was my face with a gentle face wash . Do not use a scrub else your skin will burn during the time of peel application .&lt;br /&gt;2. Wipe the face with mild alcohol face wipe to free it of any left over oil and open pores .&lt;br /&gt;3. Use a brush to apply the peel all over the skin avoiding eyes and lips&lt;br /&gt;4. Leave on for about 2 - 3 minutes. Never leave it for too long as it might give you burned blotchy skin and red patched .&lt;br /&gt;5. Wash off with cold water and  finish with moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old and have recently developed (in the last few years) what my dermatologist has labeled as hormonally induced melasma.  After trying porcelana, a hat, meladerma, etc. I felt I was hitting a whole lot of dead ends.  No matter what I tried, every treatment failed.  In desperation I reached for a chemical peel, praying to not burn my skin.  The end result is much clearer forehead and upper lip (read: tan moustache!).  While the melasma has not completely faded away, I feel that this peel, along with a wide brimmed hat and DAILY use of 50 spf, has greatly improved my condition.  Those with sensitive skin should be diligent about reading instructions and probably do some internet research as well, as these types of treatments come with risks of damage.  I have a healthy, olive complexion that is rarely sensitive and did have some uncomfortable burns around the mouth area.  I started using this product twice a week and now use it roughly once a week and plan to possibly step up the strength with my next order if I haven&#x27;t seen total improvement.</li>
    <li> First, I am 63 and routinely exfoliate my skin. Over the years, I have used many OTC peels and medical office peels. For this product, I followed all of the insert recommendations, except the prep. The insert recommends washing your face twice followed by the use of an alcohol prep pad twice before application. My skin tends to be dry and I don&#x27;t use alcohol on my face if I can help it.  So--I didn&#x27;t wash or use the alcohol pad prior to application.  I applied the product using a cotton facial pad and waited about 45 seconds prior to washing the product off with water.  I noticed some slight tingling of my skin while using the product.  After, I used my regular face cream(La Mer).  I had no redness or peeling; but, felt my skin had improved texture.  A week later, I did a second treatment.  This time, I applied the product on my upper chest, neck, elbows, and heels---then my face(used separate cotton pads).  Waited a couple of minutes and jumped into the shower.  Loved the results!  I know that I am not leaving the product on my skin as long as other might; however, I am looking for slow steady improvement of my skin( ---and I am older!).  I am going to continue using this product every one to two weeks.</li>
    <li> I am very excited about this product and after the first use saw some very nice improvements in my skin.  I am ready to use it again and continue to build on the improvements I already saw.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have yet to use it on my face but with the advice from a nurse in the skin centre, I used it to treat my wart of the sole of my feet.  The skin flaked off a few days after use and it is no long thick on the affected area.  But do not leave it on for more then instructed.</li>
    <li> I have suffered acne since i was 13, im 29 now. This product is the only cure for my acne and scars. I purchased this about 3 weeks ago an have used it 6 time (2x/wk) usually on Tuesdays and fridays. In the past i tried accutane, retin a, microderms, 3 vi peels ($375 each peel) epiduo, retinols, oral medications...etc and NOTHING worked ive spent over $10,000 in my lifetime on products just to be disappointed  until now. When I found the Lactic peel i hesitated a bit because i was so discouraged but i thought hey what so i have to lose after all I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun so why not?  I bought this product with a positive attitude and to my surprise it WORKED!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine: i wash my face with my tea tree cleanser using my Clarasonic brush, then pat my face dry, then i follow the instructions that came with the 50% Lactic peel by wiping my face with alcohol (cotton ball) to get the excess oil off then i wait til my face is dry and apply the Peel for minutes (the peel says leave it on or 3 min but the more i use he peel the more tolerant my skin becomes so i increased the time). After 5 min i was my face for 1-2min with cold water then pat dry and apply an oil free moisturizer and SPF 55.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week i saw dramatic changes in the amount of pimples on my face they gradually disappeared and my skin started glowing. At week 2 my dark scaring began to slowing fade and skin is glowing so much that I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments. Its the end of week 3 today and i am 50% less oily i cant stop smiling often now with this glowing skin i now have a boost jn confidence and self esteem an can walk out side with just powder on with no concealer or caked up make up with I&#x27;ve dreamed of for years!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow 10/29 is week 4 and i cant wait to do my next peel, i actually look forward to the peel each 3/4 days. I will post pictures of my transformation. I hope this helps people who suffer from cystic acne, whiteheads, blackheads, scaring and discoloration like i have suffered for close to 18years.</li>
    <li> read the instructions first... and dont forget to use sunscreen everyday :)&lt;br /&gt;the treatment its slowly.. so you have to be patient..&lt;br /&gt;and be carefully with what kind of skin do u have...&lt;br /&gt;so it really works</li>
    <li> I applied this peel for more than 5 minutes first time &amp; my facial skin was burnt in some areas so badly tht I had to use lot of moisturizer for one whole week. As the skin healed,, dark spots were visible. The peel is not to be blamed for my over confidence. Once my skin was completely healed, I decided to give another try, this time only for one minute. It worked &amp; the dark spots faded somewhat in few days. I use it once a week for 1 minute &amp; have seen improvement since then. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Update on 01/14/13&lt;br /&gt;After using two bottles so far, I definitely recommend this product. The application time varies based on skin sensitivity so one needs to start with a minute &amp; gradually increase. Please remember to use Perfect Image after peel cream to get better results.</li>
    <li> I give it  3 star  it work very slowly</li>
    <li> not bad for home product</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this product and was hopeful that it would work for me.  My problem is dark spots from acne.  The product came as expected and was packaged very well, but it did not work for me :-( .</li>
    <li> I love this product; it has drastically reduced my fine lines and wrinkles, brown spots are gone. I use the peel every 1-2 weeks and follow the treatment with perfect Image hydrating masque; the peel is one of my all time favorite products!</li>
    <li> This was the 1st time I have done a peel.  My age is over 50!  If you have not done a peel before be careful At the 50% because your skin is older.  Especially in the cheek area.  You may think it is not working but it is.  The stinging to me was not at all uncomfortable which is misleading! But my skin after 1 pretty harsh peel is looking better.  I will definitely be more cautious of sensitive areas. But love the product!</li>
    <li> I See the result right away.I leave the gel on for couple seconds and rinse and moisturize right away after a week my skin look fresh and vibrant. I use every other day after that once a week.</li>
    <li> this peel performed as expected- it has been good maintenance for my skin-</li>
    <li> I used Perfect Image Lactic 50% Gel peel and it faded a very dark sun spot about an inch wide and a quarter inch long. On a face that is huge. The sun spot covered an area above and below my eyebrow and I had no idea how to get rid of it - it was very prominent. I was worried that laser would affect my eyebrows somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used the 50% lactic peel I only used it for short periods like 2 or 3 minutes and, though I could see a difference in my skin, it wasn&#x27;t that much and the sun spot remained intact. It wasn&#x27;t until I used it for 10 minutes (admittedly it began to feel hot and got a bit uncomfortable) but there were no marks or skin damage from such use after. After I did the 10 minute session a few times the large, dark sun spot has almost completely disappeared. It is not visible at all unless you look for it. I was amazed and very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did put a little extra dab on that sun spot when I applied the gel. I also stopped using the neutralizer I bought to use after. But I did take all precautions like putting Vaseline around eyes, nostrils, ears and mouth. I also followed instructions for thoroughly cleaning my face beforehand (face wash 2X and then alcohol rub 2X). I also always made sure I completely rinsed my face with cool water for a full minute (actually counted 60 handful splashes to my face, making sure I rinsed all areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. Obviously my skin type could handle the longer time. I had been using AHA brand facial lotion (8 or 10%) for many years which I felt was very good and a great value, but stopped using it ahead of using the Perfect Image 50% peel as recommended. Though it&#x27;s called a peel it doesn&#x27;t actually appear to peel skin.</li>
    <li> While this product does a great job of ridding your skin of dead skin surface cells, use cautiously regarding the amount of time you leave it on.  I am a fan of the level 1 glycolic acid peel, which makes your skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s without burning.  This product left a couple of burned spots on my face which resulted in small areas of scabbing.  No scarring occurred but that could certainly have happened, had I left the product on any longer.</li>
    <li> I have discoloration and uneven complexion, old acne scars and this has really had a dramatic improvement in my face surface.  I use it once a week for about 90 seconds.  The first time I used it, my skin did burn, but was recovered in 3 days, peeling to uncover smooth, clear skin underneath.  Best advice, keep on until you see your skin start to turn red.  As soon as it does, rinse with cool water and you will not have any burns.  I highly recommend you try this as a cheaper alternative to derm peels!!</li>
    <li> More effective for my skin than a glycolic peel. Start peeling in a few hours. Good product.</li>
    <li> Made me break out pretty bad</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Get compliments on my complexion all the time.  I have gotten my mother, sister and daughter all using it.</li>
    <li> Gives you a very clean feel in the end and a cooling always tingly feel while one ...that mens its working ...very good product !!!</li>
    <li> just okay I&#x27;ve used better</li>
    <li> *Edited July 2015: I made the below review easier to read and cut out some of the drama!  Anyway, it&#x27;s been over two years since I have been using the perfect image peels and they are a game changer for my face.  I&#x27;m still super happy with them and these peels have pretty much solved my acne and hyper-pigmentation issues.  Yay! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I&#x27;m writing this review because the reviews already on Amazon encouraged me to try this product.  I am so thankful for those reviews and for this product.  This lactic acid peel by perfect Image has been a miracle.  I&#x27;m 33, have light brown (1/2 Latina) skin and I&#x27;ve had really annoying and embarrassing adult acne the past 8ish years.  Having acne has been a nightmare.  I tried the glycolic peel by Perfect Image in November of 2012.  It was great at lightening new and old hyper-pigmentation but didn&#x27;t stop new acne from forming.  I could even use the glycolic a few days in a row and my skin didn&#x27;t seem to be too bothered by it. I bought the Perfect Image salicylic and lactic peels at the same time.  I was nervous about damaging my skin so I tried the salicylic peel first and it turned all of my active acne into brown scabs.  Not that cute, but I was willing to put up with it if my skin was clear.  The salicylic was pretty drying to the rest of my face.  A while later I tentatively tried the lactic acid peel.  At the end of December and the entire month of January I used the lactic peel and was totally surprised that it worked better on my acne than the other two peels.  **note: July 2015 I&#x27;ve used all of the perfect image peels and I still think the lactic peel works best at clearing up acne.  When I started with the peel, I used the lactic acid peels 2-3 times per week and now I use it once a week or every other week.  My skin might get one or two small zits but they are nothing compared to the drama I used to have going on. My pores are smoothing out andgetting smaller, my hyper-pigmentation is faded, and scars are slowly disappearing.  Now that my pores are smaller, there is less room for sebum to collect which seems to contribute to inflammatory acne.  It is still obvious that I&#x27;ve had acne, but I don&#x27;t look Halloween scary with bloody scabs from where I picked at my skin in hopes to make the bumps smaller.  I go out without make-up and my skin is so soft and smooth.  So yes, this stuff has been an amazing miracle.  My life has been so much easier without worrying about new painful acne bumps forming daily.  I&#x27;m so happy with this product.  Here is my typical routine.  Wash face with a mild cleanser Put on lip balm to protect lips 70% rubbing alcohol on a cotton round all over my face (*edit I don&#x27;t do this step anymore as it&#x27;s too drying) Lactic Peel, (or the glycolic) solution all over my face with a brush or just my fingertips Wait 1-5+ minutes Rinse thoroughly with cool water and pat dry Acure radical resurfacing cream Light layer of Alba 1% salicylic acne lotion Go to bed Wake up Beautiful! Image oil free 32 spf sunscreen with zinc (best sunscreen ever)  Make sure to exfoliate your skin with a cloth or a brush often too as this will help your skin to stay clear.  Good luck :-)an amazing miracle.  My life the past month has been so much easier without worrying about new painful acne bumps forming daily.  I&#x27;m so happy with this product.  If your story sounds even a little bit like mine, try this stuff.  It might help you too.  It is kind of ironic that my skin is the clearest it has ever been and my diet is probably the worst it has ever been.  I used to starve myself with different crazy diets in hoping that I&#x27;d be eliminating \\&quot;bad\\&quot; foods that were messing up my skin.  I&#x27;ve been eating nachos and drinking beer on this superbowl sunday with no worries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here is my typical routine.  I use the Acure line because it is natural and has high quality ingredients without being too pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash with Acure face wash&lt;br /&gt;70% rubbing alcohol on a cotton round all over my face and under my chin&lt;br /&gt;Lactic Peel solution on a cotton round all over face and under chin&lt;br /&gt;Wait 1-5+ minutes&lt;br /&gt;Put on lip balm (my lips get dry if I don&#x27;t protect them)&lt;br /&gt;Rinse with cool water and pat dry&lt;br /&gt;Spray on Acure rose toner&lt;br /&gt;Acure radical resurfacing cream&lt;br /&gt;Light layer of Alba 2% salicylic acne lotion or Alba 2% salicylic spot treatment all over face&lt;br /&gt;Go to bed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do take some supplements: zinc, iron, oils, DIM, vitamin D, probiotics and digestive enzymes.  I avoid wheat, meat, dairy and excessive sugar.  I drink coffee though... and beer... and eat chocolate. yumm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this Lactic peel stuff smells.  It is sort of minty.  The black letters from the dropper have come off into the solution but, the product works anyway, so I still use it.  Hopefully that won&#x27;t happen with my next bottle.  Even so, it is a minor issue.  I still have ⅓ of a bottle left, so a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m going to reorder some now.  Thanks Perfect Image for making an affordable product that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have paid it forward with my review.  Good luck :)</li>
    <li> I have been diagnosed with seborreheic kerotosis and have been very self-conscious about the spots on my legs.  I have tried many products including 35% grade hydrogen peroxide to no avail. When I read the reviews about Perfect Image Lactic 50% Gel Peel I thought, why not try this on my legs?  I have only used this twice a week for two weeks and my spots are getting lighter. I am amazed and delighted!  I will continue to use it as described until the spots are completely gone. Hopefully by summer, I can where my shorts and not feel self-conscious about my legs.  I have used this on my face as well and now I have smooth skin with a nice glow.  Thanks Perfect Image!</li>
    <li> This product came on time and if you use it once a week, you will not receive any burns but even tone clear skin; simple as that.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any results afer using this product for several weeks.  It actually burned my face on two separate occassions.  I can only stand to leave the gel on for around 30-45 seconds which may be why I haven&#x27;t seen results but I just can&#x27;t risk burning my face again.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice now.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in hyperpigmentation, but I wouldn&#x27;t really expect to after one week.  It did, however, noticeably even out my skin texture and reduce the appearance of pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was a little red after using, which quickly went away, but was pretty dry for a few days so be sure to moisturize well and use at least an spf 30.  Also be sure you read and follow ALL of the directions, even though they are lengthy.  There are many precautions you must take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things that I will note here, however, are 1. This will sting and is quite harsh for first time users. Don&#x27;t leave it on for more than 30 seconds the first time to make sure your skin can tolerate it.  2. Rinse your face very well. I had to hold my face under running water (with eyes and mouth tightly closed of course) to get the stinging to go away (if it is still stinging after you rinse that means you have residual product left on your skin).</li>
    <li> Great peel. Follow instructions for good results</li>
    <li> Gentle peel - I didnt peel much but it did revitalixe my skin and wasnt too harsh. Love this line also</li>
    <li> where it says to remove after few minutes..do it..i left on to long and boy did it peel..is better if you use small area&lt;br /&gt;i will now follow directions..im going to continue using the product as i can already see improvement in dark spots but will&lt;br /&gt;confine to small areas, one at a time..good product..does what it says..</li>
    <li> Product arrived broken.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I thought it would be.  I will keep using it to hopefully better results.  Thx bye</li>
    <li> I have had peels before and love them. This product burned my skin even though I followed the directions. I have never had a burn from a peel before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because of the great reviews. After I burned, I began looking at other peels to see if they were more gentle and I found the same reviews for other products as this product - meaning not all of the great reviews are real. After reviewing more negative ratings, most people experienced the same burn (and unfortunately had to be homebound for days in order to recover) and some noted that the reviews were not real, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only canceled an order from this company, I am returning the product. If I hadn&#x27;t noticed the false reviews, I would have kept it based on how good the product has been to so many people, but since I saw fake reviews, there is no way I can trust this company.</li>
    <li> not all it promised but has some good qualities</li>
    <li> Instant results. Makes skin so smooth. Makes your skin glow. Makes your pores smaller. Also bought some for my daughter and her acne is decreasing every day. I&#x27;ve used mine for three weeks now. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This peel was so great. Reduced scars (from 1+  years) about 40% in one use. Not much peeling - worked as more of a lightening product than a peel. Barely any burning during the application. I used a flat cotton pad instead of a brush. I recommend using twice the amount after a hot shower - open your pores first.</li>
    <li> its a very good quality peel but It lightens skin temporarily. Its the best product I&#x27;ve come across so far. I will order another one.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews of this product before purchasing it and was very careful to follow the directions for use.  I am a blonde with fairly sensitive skin, but have had no irritation or redness after using it.  I have done several treatments, on different days, that were short in duration.  I have seen noticeable results, especially on brown spots and other skin anomalies.  I fully intend to continue with &amp;#34;touch-ups&amp;#34;, as needed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and gentle on the face.  Didn&#x27;t dry my face as other products have done.  My face looked amazing after 1 day.</li>
    <li> I followed instructions. Frustrated!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I leave on for 5 minutes and I am feeling stinging and burning.. Yay..&lt;br /&gt;Wash off and nothing except redness around my nose. Slight peeling and dry the next day.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed Master Esthetician and have been using the 50% lactic acid and the TCA 15% peels for about 6 months and have seen great results with lightening pigmentation,reducing inflammed acne and acne scars. These product are just as effective as what we use in our medical spa. I would definatley recommend them. Please read and follow the directions and you will see great results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a thirty-something year-old woman with a very fair complexion and sensitive skin.  I have been wanting to try a peel to rejuvenate my face for some time.  This is the first peel I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results!  I have begun using it every other night before bed for 3-4 minutes and even my husband had noticed a change in my skin (and that was only after 2 treatments)!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Okay...so I have used glycolic acid peels before buy never a lactic...wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;Followed the directions as far as cleaning before with alcohol...got it on...and got a phone call.&lt;br /&gt;I am used to the gycolic BURNING...but this didn&#x27;t so much and I forgot to take it off for about ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed and rinsed.. was a little pink.&lt;br /&gt;Woke up the next morning with brown spots all over my face.  FLIPPED OUT! Relaxed...and left it alone.&lt;br /&gt;Next days spots were worse. Panicked qnd relaxed again.&lt;br /&gt;Day three my face peeled like a hideous sunburn..and it took til Day 5 to peel all off.&lt;br /&gt;FABULOUS skin under. No blackheads.  Decided lightening of old red acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Like I admit I was scared cause of the spots...but since...I have used this twice more...each on for 10 minutes and my skin is like a different persons skin. I am 44 and pores were getting larger...not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this goo...and will be using it for a lifetime!</li>
    <li> I have lots of hyper pigmentation on my cheeks and so I tried this chemical peel out. My first peel ever, and I have a lot of redness on my cheeks. But, within a week it cleared it up. Although it broke my chin out a bit, but other than that- just applied my second mask today. Looking forward to next week&#x27;s peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Really does work, please do some research before you apply&lt;br /&gt;-did not see the &#x27;glow&#x27; everyone was talking about, but skin is much clearer&lt;br /&gt;-only need to use a little&lt;br /&gt;-clean application due to the dropper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-strong smell&lt;br /&gt;-does break you out a little bit&lt;br /&gt;-does nothing for pores</li>
    <li> I realized that my esthetician was using this product on me to treat my dark spots. However, I was paying an arm and a leg. Now I get the same great results at a fraction of the cost and I am able to apply it to myself in the comfort and privacy of my own home. You will experience some redness and dry, tender skin the day after, but this is not unusual for a peel that is effective. After one day your skin will be smoother and have a natural glow. After several uses, you will notice the dark spots break apart into smaller spots and diminish. Only use this product when you are not going into direct sun (such as a day at the beach).</li>
    <li> I am still nursing but my acne seems to have gotten worse since I don&#x27;t have the happy pregnancy hormones anymore, so I decided (after talking to my dr) to use this product to see if I could clear up some blemishes.  I must admit that I don&#x27;t have the chance to use it weekly as I should, and also that after reading some of the other reviews I was a but worried about the sting, but I found that the burn isn&#x27;t too bad (and is slightly alleviated with fanning my face for the 5 mins) and that it really has helped to even out my skin.  In addition to the cystic acne, I have tiny little bumps that aren&#x27;t exactly white heads, and I have noticed a reduction in both the cystic and the bumps. I will buy a new one when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product have never using anything like this before.  I was a bit skeptical at first.  After the first use, I really loved the product.  My skin did not peel nor was discolored.  It made my pores shrink and my shin had a much better tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always wondering if these reviews are fake or not if I should try products out for my self.so I did and this PEEL doesn&#x27;t work had it for over a week applied this peel to my face over 5 times and no peeling hasn&#x27;t happened. Go get the real peel done</li>
    <li> I chose this lactic acid peel after reading reviews of lactic acid and glycolic acid peels. I&#x27;m middle-aged and want to start being more aggressive with anti-aging skincare without resorting to fillers, botox, surgery or other more-invasive methods. At least for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some stubborn sun spots I hope to fade. So I got the acid peel and at first, tried it for the suggested short time and rinsed it off. Okay. Felt good, skin felt really soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited a few days and did the second application for about a minute and a half. The next day, I was a little pink (like I had been in the sun) and had some slight scabbing and roughening around the nostrils, above the lip, between the eyes and below one eye. Good. I made sure to cleanse thoroughly each night with a gentle cleanser and a Clarisonic-type brush, and slathered on a lot of moisturizer morning and night. From experience I know that softening dead skin on your face makes it easier to exfoliate away. After a couple more days of this regimen, I thought the rough patches were ready to peel away, so in addition to the electric brush, I used my fingertips to massage the dead skin away from those rough areas, along with a moist cloth gently rubbed on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time, the sun spots on my cheeks started feeling raised and rough, but not ready to peel off yet. So I will continue to slather with moisturizer. Tomorrow I will do another minute on the cheeks, forehead and chin, skipping the areas already sloughed to let them rejuvenate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that with a little time and effort, this acid will do the job that a professional acid peel does. You have to help the process along with the manual efforts I did above. Since I don&#x27;t have the time to go get this professionally done all at once - especially the down time of your face being red, raw and peeling - this cheap and effective home method works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips - don&#x27;t apply too close to your eyes or lips - mytop lip bled a tiny bit with peeling on one spot, and I had a small scab below one eye where I applied the acid too close to the sensitive skin there. I will write an update after a couple more applications in the next two weeks. Hopefully I will have good news about the sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July, 2013 update: I still have the sun spots, alas. The acid  helped slightly, but I guess it is doesn&#x27;t go deep enough to get rid of the pigment completely. I  continue to use the acid as it gets rid of those nasty white comedones that I get from using sunscreen, and also prevents them from forming.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Baby soft, smooth skin. I have only ever used the product as directed and never left it on for more than 2 minutes. There is no dramatic peeling of the skin or downtime in my experience. Skin is just clear and fresh and smooth! I use this product frequently.I also purchased the TCA peel but find the Lactic Acid 50% is better for my skin.</li>
    <li> Around 10 years ago, i had a bout of very serious adult acne. I went to a dermatologist and she gave me heavy duty cleanser and medication (both oral and topical) which made my skin very dry,  thin and sensitive...and RAW!.  I was told to be very careful and not to be out in the sun and to apply SPF at all time.  I did not listen, well....i felt my skin sizzle under the sun...and literally within a month, i acquired all of the sun spots which i still have today. Please learn from my mistakes.  Shield your skin from the sun as a normal practice and ESPECIALLY if you&#x27;re using harsh ingredients on your skin!  i have tried many many many products that claims it will diminish sun spots but none worked UNTIL NOW....  This stuff works! You must read the directions and start out slow and listen to your skin.. The way i used it is I dab only on the sun spots (spot treat) once every 2-3 days and once per week i would treat the entire face.  Because the spots itself was being treated more frequently, it would look red and scaly but once it heals, you will have lighter spots. The rest of your face feels like you&#x27;ve just had a nice microdermabrasion, very smooth and glowing.  always listen to you skin/ It&#x27;s best to have gradual improvement than to be inpatient and mistreat your skin.  The longest i&#x27;ve left the solution on is 7 minutes.. this is the 5 week that i&#x27;m using this.  I still have all the spots but they are much much lighter. I will update again in another month or so on the results....Also want to add that i use SPF 15 lotions, then BB cream with SPF 42, and if i am out biking or hiking, i will add another layer of SPF 55...Also i forgot to add that after the peel treatment, i slather on coconut oil or olive oil...to help the skin heal and keep it moisturized.</li>
    <li> Mixes well with Dermalogica&#x27;s Daily Microfoliant to help brighten hyperpigmentation. My skin feels hydrated and smooth afterward. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I used hundreds of &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; products to get rid of melasma &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34;, the older that I get the worst that it gets and I do not tan my face at all. I don&#x27;t know why have couple pimples coming here and there for a while leaving me with dark marks. Is being couple months I used and I love it, it feels like does a botox, stretch your skin leaving it very shiny but not grease at all, smooths it up and starts to clear up the melasma. It tooks me couple weeks to start seen working on the dark spots but really removes them. It is a minute to apply and it does a work unbelievable.  I just ordered today the moisturizer because I know in order for a product to work you must used the whole line, can&#x27;t wait to get my cream and see the results from both.</li>
    <li> Caused blisters the scars lasted for around 10 days. Returned it and  had to pay the post . Positive reviews are misleading or perhaps fake. ..returned  all other  peels after this experience.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything super dramatic, but it leaves my skin so soft. Don&#x27;t leave for more than 3 minutes. I don&#x27;t experience any peeling but I&#x27;d like to, also experienced a few splotchy parts on my face. I also apply to my scars--not sure yet how well it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> This works. It can be a strong for the most sensitive folks, but for the mainstream who want action, this is a good product. It also comes with the original printed instructions in the box! I used it for 5 minutes the first swipe, and five more for a second swipe. My skin has not &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; as in a sunburn, but I feel, and see, a clarity that is lovely.</li>
    <li> There were so many favorable reviews - so I decided to try this product as a light peel to reduce hyperpigmentation.  I use a daily glycolic and wanted something deeper.  I am 50 and my skin is typically not sensitive. I left the product on for 1 minute.The product did burn my skin but it also caused a lot of irritation and break outs.  My skin was perfectly clear before using the product and this product caused some cyst like pimples to appear around my temples, cheeks, and forehead.  After 4 days I have some crusty skin and pimples, which I am sure will peel and go away.  I will not continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl. (Note: I&#x27;m one of those folks that if there&#x27;s a 1% chance it won&#x27;t work...I&#x27;m that one percent!) That being said it didn&#x27;t help dark spots like I&#x27;d hoped but does leave my skin very very soft! I guess it&#x27;s time to bite the bullet and see an actual dermatologist instead of trying to take the less expensive route! I&#x27;ll keep using it for smooth soft skin but not to lighten dark spots. As with everything I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon it arrived within a couple days.</li>
    <li> My skin seems a little smoother. Brown spots a little less noticeable. Will definitely rebuy this product again. Only used for less than 3 months.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle peel but still effective. It burns like a TCA peel but has no recovery time. If you have adult acne and uneven skin give it a try. One bottle can lasts months if you do not apply it with cotton balls.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot so far. With just two uses I see such a difference with black spots (hyperpigmentation) on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this peel. I was nervous to try a chemical peel at home but the fine lines and uneven skin tone won out in the end. My skin is very pale and can be sensitive. I read reviews for this and other peels and opted to try this one (some of the others seem a bit too harsh and I&#x27;m really not too interested in burning my face off). I use a Q-tip to spread the gel over my face. At first I would only leave it on for about 3 minutes but now I&#x27;ve built up to between 5 and 6 minutes (I suggest building up to this not starting here). After a few days I start to notice the skin lightly peeling (nothing hugely dramatic but it does freshen up my complexion). Sometimes I will just treat specific areas like my forehead rather than doing the entire face. I&#x27;ve also use this on spots and it works! I&#x27;m coming to the end of my second bottle and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get real--at-home peels will NOT bring dramatic results. They just won&#x27;t. The upside of that is that it is very hard (although, given some reviews, it is still possible) to damage your skin with them.&lt;br /&gt;About this peel. I&#x27;ve tried many. I am sticking to this one. I use a lot(!) of their stuff (BTW, couldn&#x27;t care much about their pumpkin enzyme peel), but this one is my fave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my skin. Mediterranean light, it is very young in look and texture (thanks mom!). After-35-looking-like-25 skin without any problems except one--my skin doesn&#x27;t exfoliate on it&#x27;s own and therefore feels extremely dry if I don&#x27;t take care of the problem.  My skin needs a BIG kick in the butt to leave my face and body. It&#x27;s been like that since I was 10. Anyway. The skin needs all the help to get exfoliated. This (although expensive) does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; USING THE PEEL ON MY FACE:I use it every third-fourth morning for 5-10 seconds on my face. It does nothing except making the very-very upper layer of my epidermis to pack its bags and leave the territory of my face, so as a result I have very fresh appearance that lasts for the next three days. I don&#x27;t have clogged pores--none, none at all, yay! (I used to, on my nose, due to the dead skin debris) and my skin is always in this perfectly glowing state. Because I keep it for such short period of time, my lower layers of skin don&#x27;t get \\&quot;the taste\\&quot; of the peel, so it is always a brand new experience for my skin to have the flash-version of the peel on it. For whatever reason, I couldn&#x27;t achieve these results by buying the 50% Lactic acid peels from other companies--I still am trying to figure out why (bc, let&#x27;s face it, 50% lactic acid can be easily bought for less money. I also love the invigorating and minty feeling of utter freshness (I think it is menthol working) that the peel application gives to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A couple of times I&#x27;ve tried having the \\&quot;real\\&quot; peel procedure with this peel. I must not have the needed skin problems to see the improvement after the long, deeper peel, with all the peeling off fun, etc. I don&#x27;t wear wrinkles or age spots so it is hard for me to say whether they would disappear from using this. I know though that I have perfect glow and literally no clogged pores since I&#x27;ve started using this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USING THE PEEL ON MY BODY: Once a week after shower I have full body peel with it. I leave it for 30 minutes (please don&#x27;t take it as my advice, I don&#x27;t want to end up being blamed if something goes wrong with you). I end up with the serious A-list-movie-star glow and texture of my body skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; RATING: I am giving it 4 stars because I wish it was cheaper or I wish the company at least offered some \\&quot;buy one get one free\\&quot; options from time to time. I go through sooo much of this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like it. Definitely works, you just have to leave it on a little longer than the directions say. (Atleast, I had to. I have some very very dark spots). Don&#x27;t give up! A little pricey but cheaper than some type of medical treatment.</li>
    <li> I love this peel.  It  is everything it says it is.  Be careful and read instructions.  By the time I had my third treatment I was able to give myself a second layer which makes it more intense...  Love it.  Will reorder it and will recommend it.....</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I am only 30 or because this product doesnt really work. I have been using it twice a week and have not seen any magical results. I was expecting glowing skin.....</li>
    <li> This product works very, very well.  However, you must be sure to clean your face well.  After cleansing, I use a cotton ball and witch hazel to give my face a once-over final cleaning before apply product with a q-tip to dry face. If your face is truly clean you will feel a tingling or even a slight burning, which will then itch a bit (but don&#x27;t scratch). I time the product very carefully. Go easy with first application because everyon&#x27;s skin is different. I purchased this product to lighten sun spots and it does work; I also have been using it around my mouth and chin area to help reduce those tiny lines...slow process, but worth the wait. Nothing dramatic, but satisfied.</li>
    <li> i have darker tone skin and so far this is working without scaring. as i know you have to sork up to it i have only been leaving it on my face for 1 min at first now up to 10 but love it</li>
    <li> I only use this product once a week and I&#x27;ve already seen a difference.  If I could get motivated to use it more I&#x27;m sure I would have a more dramatic effect.  The one thing that&#x27;s tricky is the directions say not to expose your skin to sun or makeup for 24 hours.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a little hard to find an ideal time to apply the peel.</li>
    <li> This amount of lactic acid can permanently destroy your face! I tried it a few times for a 1 minute and it worked so after a few weeks I tied the five minute recommended period and immediately both my cheeks were covered in frost, in a few minutes all the skin was removed and there was only white fat cells left, it is supposed to take months for all the skin to grow back and and gain its original color. My dermatologist said this is WAY to much lactic acid and it can leave permanent scaring when burned by it. Five minutes can ruin your face for the rest of your life so be careful.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for clearing up acne, but it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of fading uneven pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and I have used it once, but really liked it. I am a do it yourself person when it comes to my&lt;br /&gt;beauty treatments, rather than pay out so much money for the salon treatments. Just last year I paid $500 for 6 light&lt;br /&gt;face peels and this product is giving me the exact same results as the high priced treatments. I will never pay out that&lt;br /&gt;kind of money again. This product is easy and gentle to use. Just follow the instructions exactly as they read and you&lt;br /&gt;should be alright.</li>
    <li> The product is good the droplet makes it very convince and less mess, smells is a little minty like. It&#x27;s a little pricey I would try another a little cheaper brand next time.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd peel product I have ordered from Perfect Image and I&#x27;m very pleased. The product comes with thorough instructions and I&#x27;ve followed the recommendations.  I&#x27;m 37 and have fine wrinkles, enlarged pores and uneven texture and pigment.  The Lactic Acid 50% has helped gently remove the outermost dry layer of skin on my face, neck and chest with no post-peeling.  It didn&#x27;t sting or burn unless I combined it with a microneedling roller (which I use for minor keloid type acne scars.)  The other products I tried included the Glycolic Acid and TCA.</li>
    <li> It did some good in lightening the dark spots on my face, but was not as good as I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> This peel really made my face glow. I use it once a month, it works great!</li>
    <li> Love it for quick, no peel skin improvement.  I need stronger peel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30yo mixed race female who has a history of acne in my teenage years. The past five years I&#x27;ve made a huge effort to care for my damaged skin, including professional acid peels several times a year.&lt;br /&gt;After reading tons of reviews on Amazon I decided to take a chance on this gel peel. The first time I left it on my face/neck for 1min -as directed- and other than slight redness around the creases of my nose I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. The second time I used it I didn&#x27;t put any in the creases of my nose -lesson learned- and I left it on for 5min. Lots of light moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t experience any actual &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; effect.&lt;br /&gt;Wowzers! Compared to my $150+ professional spa peels this product is fantastic! I can&#x27;t believe how soft, smooth, and even my complexion is. I&#x27;m a fan for life.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for those with some experience with acid peels. I got very positive results but I could see how beginners or those with sensitive skin could fry their gorgeous face in seconds.</li>
    <li> This product has been pretty good.you can use it every week or every 2 weeks.it will give you a fresh healthy look, after peeling of course.which is a very mild flaking of dead skin cells.the burn when this is applied might require a fan to keep you cool, but it&#x27;s nothing you can tough out, I&#x27;d give it a 3-4 out of 10 as far as pain.</li>
    <li> This peel works.....but you must use some sort of a scrub afterwards as it causes your skin to flake.  I use it at night and by the morning my face is dry even though I apply a quality lotion.  Use very little as it does burn your skin a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had in office peels but this is the only one which made my husband ask me why I&#x27;m glowing! minimal peeling after but trust me it does the job! can&#x27;t wait to do my next treatment! I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again once it&#x27;s empty</li>
    <li> I realized I love journal type reviews on products such as this one so I&#x27;m going to make one myself. First I compiled all of the information relating to this product so I can get the best use out of it.  Some other products I use and recommend when using this product: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D7NGPX8 www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NWGCZ2 www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E96OZG  1. Put one full droplet on to a glass bowl. 2. Mix some cold water and baking soda in another bowl. 3. Dab your face lightly with a cotton ball with alcohol in it. (This part really stung me so if it does just hang in there!) 4. Put Vaseline around your eyes, nose, and lips. (These parts are sensitive so the Vaseline will help protect them from the peel) 5. Rub your fan brush in the peel you put earlier on the glass bowl. Make sure to get everything! 6. Brush your face with the fan brush. ( I like to start on my forehead and work my way down) 7. Leave on for 2-3 minutes (make sure you have a timer ready because if you keep it on longer your face will get burned and turn red) 8. Wash your face with cold water thoroughly 9. Wash your face with the cold water and baking soda mix (this will help neutralize any burning sensation you might get) 10. Apply lotion or moisturizer. 11. Apply sunscreen if using this during the day. If you&#x27;re doing this before bed then obviously you don&#x27;t need any sunscreen.  Week 1: I didn&#x27;t really feel the peel and I have really sensitive skin so it&#x27;s kind of weird but some people say that even though their skin didn&#x27;t peel it still worked so I&#x27;m still waiting a week even though I&#x27;m tempted to do it again!  Week 2: My god this thing actually burned this time. I could only do 2 1/2 minutes. Luckily the baking soda and cold water mix works cause if I didn&#x27;t have that it would have hurt a hell of a lot more. My skin does feel smoother but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s doing anything about my acne scars I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait a bit longer.  Week 3: I started breaking out a bit because of some medication and vitamins I was taking so I&#x27;m going to stop since its been advised not to use this product while you still have active acne. I&#x27;ll restart it when my skin calms down though.</li>
    <li> Loved it at first but then my aesthetician mentioned it was abbrassive for my skin. It didn&#x27;t really do much other than make my pores FEEL clean. I kept on breaking out. Used it for about 2 months and stopped. Maybe I need to try a different strength?</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I haven&#x27;t left it on longer than a couple minutes, but could probably go longer with it.  I don&#x27;t have any visible peeling with this, but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so that could be why.  I&#x27;m going to try leaving it on longer, but my skin does look bright and clear after using this just a couple times.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This peel works AMAZING! However if you apply it wrong it could burn your skin severally and leave some nasty scars! ONLY leave on for a maximum of 3 minutes! Apply rubbing alcohol before and a peel neutralizer. My mother saw great results I had to stop it because I am currently using Retin-A.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It leaves my skin so smooth! After the first application, my skin peeled a bit, but after that, I started using it weekly with no issues. I have fair skin with some freckles, and I noticed them lightening after the fist couple applications. I have been using glycolic peels for a long time, and thought I would give this a try based on the reviews- definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I tried it on whim. It works. My skin looks clearer and smoother. Kept it for a minute this time but will up it to 2 next time.</li>
    <li> No difference in my skin</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve bought through Amazon after doing my research. Chemical peels, if done correctly, is in my opinion much better than a physical scrub because of its ability for even application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 25 year old Asian male, and I started using this because I was starting to break out with acne. I tried salicylic acid face washes, benzoyl perixide creams, and a couple other serums, and they all helped, but this peel allows the creams to do its job more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you&#x27;re doing is basically dissolving the top layers of your skin with this potent acid. This allows any treatment or serums to be more effective because it is not hindered by the dead skin cells that are just lying on top of your skin. By dissolving the skin, you&#x27;re also breaking down the dead skin cells and the sebun in the pores that causes acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also means that you&#x27;re more prone to UVA rays since you don&#x27;t have that top layer of protection anymore, so always use sunscreen for the next couple days after the peel. (You should be wearing sunscreen every time you go outside anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of advice:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be like me and try to get a &amp;#34;deeper cleanse&amp;#34; by keeping this peel on your face for more than 10 minutes. You will regret it! I had scabs on my cheek from the chemical burn. Moral of the story: more is not always better.</li>
    <li> I bought the lactic acid peel 50% the first time while I was attending my aesthetician school. I saw improvements right after my first treatment. It worked very good on my pigmentation but also in the overall skin appearance. I have combination skin that is more on the dry side. My skin is also very sensitive and this product didn&#x27;t bother me. It really helps me a lot with my dry skin too. It Is very important you do a patch test and also is very important you use a SPF 30+ sunscreen while you are exfoliating your skin. By removing the first layer of the skin is crucial to protect it with a good sunscreen. Use a very good moisturizer too, your skin is going to need it, specially in the first 3-4 days. I also like to use a hyaluronic acid serum under my moisturizer for the first week after the peel.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working because I didn&#x27;t feel a sting like I usually do with skin peels that aren&#x27;t as strong but it definitely peeled my skin, just not as deep as I was expecting.  But I would overall recommend this product.  Just don&#x27;t be tricked into thinking that its not working if you don&#x27;t feel a tingle or sting because that&#x27;s what I did, which left me with hyperpigmentation in a couple of areas on my face because I did about 3 application passes in one 10 minute session.  But that&#x27;s nothing a few of applications of lemon juice and cocoa butter won&#x27;t fix :) But be warned!  I used it twice so far by the way. And other than the hyperpigmentation spots that I mentioned my skin looks great, but that&#x27;s also courtesy of the Professional Whitening Kojic Acid &amp; Glutathione Dual Whitening/Bleaching Soap that I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now.  Love that soap!</li>
    <li> My first time using this product ... I was expecting pain or burning sensation but so far so good. First time I put it on for 4 minutes on clean face, 2 days later no peeling little bit or redness by my chin but Its ok .</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on too long or get it near your nostrils.  I&#x27;ve used it about 4x.  A couple times for a minute and I didn&#x27;t really peel.  Aa couple times a few minutes and I peeled quite a bit.</li>
    <li> This was an absolute waste of my money!!! I just bought it yesterday and I was so excited to use it, so I tried it on after I exfoliated, and then the next morning I see even more scars on my face, but those are from the scratches that I got from the product because while  I was using it, it was just constantly burning my face. Horrible product; don&#x27;t you waste a single penny on this useless product. (By the way it says Cindy at the top, but I&#x27;m her 13 y/o son so...)</li>
    <li> Felt good and clean, but no visible results and certainly no peeling. Glow did not last either. Better to stick with a TCA peel for real results. I Will give the 15% TCA a try next.</li>
    <li> When i first put it on it started burning immediately(only mild pain). I left it on for about a minute. My face was red and irritated for a day or so after but once that went away my skin looked great. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and see what happens. Note to anyone thinking of getting this: be careful and do not leave it on long at all!</li>
    <li> I work for a Dermatologist and this product is a treatment you would receive in the office.  You must be careful and follow instructions.  Also...you must remember Sun Block!! or your hard work will go right out the window.</li>
    <li> I used different peels in the pass and the results were hopeless. This particular peel makes my skin soft and flawless. If you have dark blemishes it lightens the  appearance within couple of days . Lactic acid works very well on African Americans. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> i am a 37 yr old asian female who has acne, &amp; dark spots. I have this dark spot on my upper side of my cheek forever it seems that i have been trying to get rid of forever with alot of OTC creams from ambi, to OTC hydrocone, to garnier dark spot remover. i did so many research on line, i did the tumeric paste, to the lemon &amp; home remedy nothing worked. I even got a few items from the asian store &amp; it didnt work. so i went back to do more research on the internet cause laser &amp; professional help is not an option since it&#x27;s out of my budget. I came upon the lactic acid peel read the review &amp; decide to give a try. I did a few peels (this is probably my 5th peel) &amp; FINALLY...i did see results just recently. My black mark has deminish..but i have to say listen to your skin. dont leave it on too long follow the direction because it does burn if u leave it on to long. it will scab but dont pick on it, let it heal use neoporin if u scab. today is the 1st day that i didnt have to cover up with concealer because my dark spot has deminish quite a bit. I do need a little bit more peel but compare to before it&#x27;s got ALOT BETTER. I am more confindent now, when people look at me I dont have to hide my face anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product, not too harsh. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Having this in gel form definitely makes a difference.  It gives a more concentrated effect and works faster than liquid peels, though I do find that I get through the bottle faster.  After a few uses, I have seen improvement in my complexion and the color of my dark spots.  I only put this on my chest and shoulders, though.  I have sensitive skin, so I use a 20% salicylic peel for my face.</li>
    <li> The service was absolutely FANTASTIC! The product simply AMAZING. Perfect Image really cares about their customers. I just started using this product and i&#x27;m already seeing great results. The dark spot around my mouth started fading. My skin looks more even and smoother and feels very soft. I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t burn. I just love this product and will continue doing business with Perfect Image for sure. Perfect Image Please don&#x27;t ever run out of this amazing product. Thank you. Sincerely.:)</li>
    <li> Product is great.  Great price, very effective.  I purchased it to use for evening out out skin discoloration from rosacea.  I have used it 4 times so far and have seen marked improvement.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference/improvements in my skin.</li>
    <li> I was awaiting the first month of use to post a my review. This peeling is worth every penny of what you pay, with results so good as those you get at the spa. But be carefull in follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I prepare my skin before the application with alcohol pre pads, as I have sensitive skin I use the cold fan of my blow dryer during the application and after the peeling i use a paste with paste with water and baking soda to neutralize. My skin was very sensitive on the first application but then I prepared some cottons pads with cold chamomile tea to soothe the skin. It works! My skin is noticeably better of freckles and acne blemishes. Here&#x27;s my 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This product is very very powerful. You really need to be cautious about putting it on straight to your skin. I did that the first time and my skin had a very strong reaction to it - red and very inflamed. The next day my skin started to peel and 3 days after that I had the clearest, pore free skin I&#x27;ve ever had. I use it weekly and find that it works best if I cut it with some carrier oil - leave it on for 3-5 minutes and then wipe off. It really has made my fine lines disappear. I&#x27;d recommend  it - but do a patch test first !</li>
    <li> this has made a huge difference in my skin. i have very fair irish skin, which means i get sun spots from time to time. doing this peel once a week for 2-3 weeks has made my skin tone totally even and in perfect condition. i am thrilled with this product!</li>
    <li> This really worked.  It was easy to use, the instructions were clear, and my skin showed much improvement!</li>
    <li> This works and  the bottle is one tenth the cost of one salon treatment, and get about 20 treatments. The kojic sets it apart, as it evens the skin tone. Lactic makes it not so harsh. A grweat product, a good toner daily brings even better results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months.  This is gentle enough not to damage my skin but strong enough to make a significant difference.  My skin looks brighter and it has helped with hyper pigmentation. I would recommend giving it a try, just follow the instructions carefully to get the best results.</li>
    <li> Just okay.  I have used better.  Doesn&#x27;t really seem to do anything.  I have more luck using retin A.  Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> Very gentle but effective peel. I use it once a week and love the results!!! I&#x27;ve used other peels in the past and they were too harsh. This one is perfect. It is thick which I really like. You can add more layers as you build up a tolerance. My skin looks radiant and old acne scars I had are almost gone. Arrived very fast too!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, atlhough if you aren&#x27;t careful and leave it on too long it can cause peeling/pain.  However if you follow the directions carefully it is a great economic alternative to a professional peel!</li>
    <li> This product worked as well as a $125.00 salon peel.  I&#x27;ve used it 4 times and still have enought left for at least 8 more uses. Each used has lighted age spots and improved the overall apprearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> at the first time i applied it as instructed for 2 to 3 mins, i waited for one week but I didn&#x27;t see anything, so I applied it again also for 3 mins , i waited to see anything but there is nothing no peeling or anything that tells this thing is working !! so the third week i decided to apply it but for 5 mins , it burned my face !!!! I don&#x27;t know what to do with this thing but now i can say that this a very strong thing that i should be more careful with dealing with it :) i wish you all a very beautiful skin :*</li>
    <li> I made a mistake and applied it too soon. It made my face sore. It works just don&#x27;t get antsy like me and take your time with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months now.  It lasts forever!  I began by using it at a frequency of 2x a month.  I was worried that using it too often would harm my skin, but this is not the case.  Even after one use, my face was smoother and pores were smaller.  I no longer get facials because I feel a  home peel replaces the need.  Doing it myself also saves me money.  Recently, I started increasing my usage to once a week as I saw my hyperpigmentation would increase when not used consistently.  So definitely follow directions and use it at least once a week!  The lessening of hyperpigmentation isn&#x27;t dramatic, but it does occur.  It is not a bleach, so don&#x27;t expect it to be!  Also, don&#x27;t leave it longer than the allotted time!  It is stronger than it seems!  This is a good product that is definitely worth trying out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW I USE THE PEEL:  I apply it with a very small piece of cotton ball so as to not waste the product.  I spot treat the worse areas first, then go back to apply all over my face, then go down my neck.  After 5 min, I rinse.  I use the Oil Cleansing Method regularly to cleanse my face,  so after the peel I use a little oil to cleanse to make sure all of the peel is off.  I use a warm washcloth to remove all residue then a cold splash of water to close my pores.  After using the peel, my face feels really dry so I follow up with aloe vera gel then a little shea butter.  I find that following up in this way works wonders!  Good Luck! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried all sorts of different products, trying to obtain professional results at home. I am a long-time acne sufferer, and peels are really the only thing that help. I have found that it is better to keep up a peel regimen than use retin-a (for me). That said, this is my favorite. It is gentler than the salicylic, so I can use it more often. I don&#x27;t actually peel, which I like. I have no downtime, but just as good of results. I am ordering more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I just wanted to add that I see from other reviews that there is concern about breakouts after using the product. I have done chemical peels for years. Glycolic, Salicylic, Jessner&#x27;s, TCA, and obviously lactic. There is always some breaking out one day-three days post peel, but for me, I breakout less with chemical peels than with microderm. I think the breaking out is a normal part of the process, and is not anything that should be blamed on this product in particular. Just part of the process, in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> THE PEEL IS GREAT FOR REMOVING THE DEAD LAYERS OFF YOUR SKIN. IT LEAVES IT LOOKING FRESH AND GLOWING.  AS FAR AS THE SUN SPOTS I HAVE ONLY SEEN VERY SUBTLE CHANGES.  OVERALL, WORKS BETTER THAN MOST OF THE CREAMS SOLD OVER THE COUNTER.</li>
    <li> Omg This stuff works beauty is pain, but a pain well worth going through, I didn&#x27;t really read the instructions but I did afterwards and left the chemical longer than I should of, so Please do read instructions FIRST,be careful if you have sensitive skin, my money was well spent:)</li>
    <li> I decided to come out of the shadows on my amazon account to write a review for this product - that&#x27;s how amazing it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 20s and started suffering from breakouts after barely ever having a zit in my teenage years, save for one once in a blue moon. Now, I have patches of pimples around my chin and on my cheeks. I had no idea what to do - I changed my skincare routine, started using natural soaps and toners and moisturizers, as well as a Clarisonic Mia face cleansing brush, with few results. I also began taking fish oil and vitamin supplements, but that did not work either. A few months ago I resigned myself to the idea that my skin just wouldn&#x27;t be as clear as it used to be, and began resorting to foundation to cover up the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I randomly stumbled upon this product on Amazon one day. I was hesitant due to some of the mixed reviews, but after contemplating for a while and with my skin getting worse, I decided it would be worth a shot, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am so glad I took a chance. As per reviewers&#x27; suggestions, I prepped my skin by cleansing it, drying it and swabbing alcohol beforehand. The first time I had it on for about 2.5 minutes but since then I&#x27;ve upped it up to 5 minutes; however, I think I will be sticking to putting it on for 2-3 minutes (you might also have my same impatience I did in wanting to see results, but don&#x27;t let that guide how long you put on the product). It stings a little during the process but I just fan my face with my hand to alleviate the stinging. After I wash off with cold water and let my skin air dry so it can cool off, and apply a LOT of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results? After a week my skin looked so much better that even my boyfriend and family noticed. Not only do I have less breakouts, my scars have also begun fading. I put it on every week for 2 weeks so far. Granted, results like these don&#x27;t come without conditions - the instructions suggest not wearing makeup for 24 hours and I see why! My skin is \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; for a day or two after, which just means parts of my skin look dry from up close and putting foundation on top of that does not fare well... however it is not noticeable from far away nor is my skin peeling in large chunks as if my skin was sunburnt. To me, it is still worth the minor dryness that follows. Just take it easy on the peels and be patient - hopefully you will also see results! I am so glad to feel comfortable in my skin again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 06/23/2013 - It has been months since the last time I actually used the peel and my skin is still pretty clear, except for 1 or 2 zits that coincide with my cycle. I happened to look at a picture I took of my breakouts before using this product and the difference is amazing. Less redness, less breakouts, and less skin irritation. I plan on using it every now and then when my skin is feeling rough, but I have not found the need to. I have also been using [[ASIN:B004AI97MA Bio-oil 4.2oz]] at night before going to bed and it has really helped to fade my scars. I know this peel has mixed reviews, but if you have the money, it is worth a shot to try. This product truly improved my skin when it was at its absolute worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added my own picture comparing my skin in April to now, in June, in the customer images section: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2ZAT0X9IM9HOJ/B006ZBP8NM/ref&#x3D;cm_ciu_images_pl_linkearing makeup for 24 hours and I see why! My skin is \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; for a day or two after, which just means parts of my skin look dry from up close and putting foundation on top of that does not fare well... however it is not noticeable from far away nor is my skin peeling in large chunks as if my skin was sunburnt.

    <li> I like this peel very much.  I noticed that some of the reviews mentioned that they did not peel. You do not have to peel to necessarily get the results. Nice tingle and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting peels for about 10 years and loved getting them done at the aestheticians office, however after becoming a single mother I could no longer justify spending $150-$185 every month.&lt;br /&gt;I have had acne and post break out redness and hyper pigmentation since I was about 22. This product is great, I started out just letting sit for 2 min and since I am an experienced peeler I was able to have it on for a total of 5-10 min over time. I use a fan brush to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I get the same red glow and later my breakouts fade and flake off. Its not pretty immediately after but the following week you can see the new skin ans scabbing is minimal. I also apply hyaluronic acid after or a paste of coconut oil and baking soda, this helps to restore the PH balance and lessens the burn if you over do it.</li>
    <li> LOVE the way this product makes my skin feel...and my make-up just glides on. So far not seeing much change with the melasma or sun spots, but its worth the use just for the exfoliating effects!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid believer in peels and microderms...I chose this product to use on myself for between visits - but also to save a bit of money. I was pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t convinced this product did anything to lighten while it was peeling. Any glycolic peel will work. Maybe I will give it another shot.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 0 stars, trust me I will. If you plan on buying this product I advise you to reconsider, it will burn your skin and make it appear darker and worse than it was. It doesn&#x27;t  work , it will burn you and leave dark patches in your skin.</li>
    <li> Thank u! After reading many reviews for different peels, I decided on this one &amp; i&#x27;m so happy I did!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Still using</li>
    <li> I am a long-time sun worshiper and have searched for a magic product to erase my red patches, brown spots and wrinkles. While this product is not magic, my skin is clearer and smoother than it has been in years. The product does sting on my face, but I have had no burning or peeling as others have claimed. I use the product for only two minutes every one or two weeks and have had visible success. Although my crows feet have not diminished, I plan to purchase a second bottle and continue trying!</li>
    <li> This peel works very well, HOWEVER, you must follow the directions very carefully.  I would strongly suggest starting off very conservatively with how long you leave it on, then gradually increase your contact time.  the first time i used it for about 9 minutes and i got burned.  Now I can tolerate it much better.</li>
