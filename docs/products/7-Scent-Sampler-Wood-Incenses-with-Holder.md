<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had thought you could put these into the duraflame electric stove. you cannot, so I just use them by the stove to get smell of wood burning .</li>
    <li> Worthless to me.  I did not like the scent of these incenses at all.  To me, some had no scent - They, as indicated, took a while to start.  I consider them one of the worst purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon.  I gave them to a thrift store.</li>
    <li> We did not like the smell of these. They made the house smell bad too. Maybe we are not incense people. This is a good way to try the various wood smells to see how they work out for you.</li>
    <li> my very favourite incense ever! got my first batch of this stuff about 20 years ago in solvang, california. still have 1 or 2 bricks of the original stuff left.&lt;br /&gt;smells like a sweet camp fire, the best smell around! smokes a LOT, i use these for light smudging too. this nice sampler comes with a burner.&lt;br /&gt;one warning i will offer is that they often wont burn completely. they can go out. and when you light one, you really have to get it burning to stay lit. when you it starts to burn, the end will splay out a bit, and if you arent careful it can crumble so you just want to light the end of it, not the whole brick. its takes a bit to get used to them, they are different than commonplace incense cones and the like, but way worth it! this is hands down the best stuff i have ever found. just like nature made. if you have little unburnt pieces left, save them and you can burn them all later on a piece of incense charcoal so theres no waste. cant recommend these highly enough!</li>
    <li> Definitely pretty smoky  (I think this is a plus, but as other reviews have mentioned, it might not be the best if you prefer more mild incense). They burn fairly quickly, but the wood-smoke scent lingers in the room for several hours. If you like that bonfire/campfire smell in the air I highly recommend it. They all smell wonderful, and the holder it comes with is simple but nice (though the ash tends to spill over the edges, so you might want to rest it on top of something else).</li>
    <li> This smells just like having a fresh wood fire burning. Wonderful and not nearly as smokey as i expected. The smoke is that of having 2 normal stick based incense burning at a time.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Highly Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research shows that aromas have a powerful effect on mood and we all know it&#x27;s true.  This product gives you a palette of seven different aromas that mentally transport you to the homey hearth, the mountain chalet, southwest pueblo, or backwoods campfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We agree with all the other positive comments except one.  This kit contains more than the aromas of the southwest.  It contains many like hickory and balsam fir that are smells familiar anywhere in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product produces authentic fireplace/campfire aromas.  We&#x27;ve had many guests who thought we had our fireplace going, loved the aroma and have asked where they could get the incense themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A FEW TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;[1] Put the incense on the provided clay stand before trying to light it and use it as a handle,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[2] We have found that votive and/or tea light candles are very helpful in lighting this and work much better than a match or lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[3] We put a small dish or incense burner around the burning incense both for safety and to contain the ash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[4] Amazon offers a variety of great incense burners that work well with this product.  Here&#x27;s one we like: Country Hearth Puppy Burner With Pinon Natural Wood Incense - Incienso De Santa Fe at&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Country-Hearth-Burner-Natural-Incense/dp/B001BAL6V0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_cc_2?s&#x3D;aps&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1348509043&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2-catcorr&amp;keywords&#x3D;incense+burners+puppy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[5] VOLUME DISCOUNT - Like us you may find that you like a couple of the aromas better than others and/or you may find you burn these regularly.  If so, look for the 100 brick single scent offerings by Incienso de Sante Fe.  They are generally priced between $13.50 and $15.00 for 100 bricks which is a better deal than the mix of 49 bricks for $10 (i.e. ~25% discount/brick from $0.20 to $0.15.)</li>
    <li> Great way to see which ones you like most. I&#x27;ve  enjoyed them all with no problems.Yes, there&#x27;s  smoke but not overwhelming. They create a great feeling and scent which overrides any negative potential.</li>
    <li> Very nice incense. Easy to light, stays together while burning and has a natural woodfire smell. The only thing that is a minus for me is that I can not really detect much difference between the seven \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; in the variety pack. Maybe it is because the sticks come packed together in one box, or maybe my nose is not as sensitive as it once was. Regardless, they all smell great! I will probably reorder.</li>
    <li> I love just about everything about this package of incense.  The packaging is awesome, the scents are amazing, and it even comes with a little burner.  Personally, I have a hard time getting it to stay lit, burn for a long time, though I may be doing something wrong here.  I put one of them on the other night, not sure which one, but my friend came over and said it smelled like church in my house, but like a rustic church in the middle of the woods.  That was a cool compliment.  I love these and will buy again and buy them for friends as well.</li>
    <li> These smell great - just like woodsmoke. Because of their shape (rectangular) they&#x27;re a bit hard to light. I especially like the fir balsam, which can also be bought on its own. This is Husband&#x27;s favorite of any incense.</li>
    <li> Works as indicated...love the scents...and no ashes to haul...from the fireplace that is...</li>
    <li> It is nice and does smell like a wood fire..just a bit heavy on the smoky scent for me.  But, it  does smell like a wood fire.  They burn down fast but the smell lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas gift for my fiancÃ©e, she loves it! Perfect for someone who wants to fill their home with natural wood burning smells! No chemical smell or perfumey smell, the incense smells perfectly of nature!!!</li>
    <li> These are just a waste of money.....</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this while traveling in New Mexico.  Back in my East Coast city home, I enjoy the way this incense creates the scent of the fireplace that I lack and reminds me of the Southwest.</li>
    <li> The scents in this are amazing. I got this pack so I could decide which ones I liked the most and turns out they all smell amazing. I love the packaging too. I have been using the incense for about two days now and once you figure out how to get them smoking your set. Just work with it and be patient, you will get the hang of it. They burn out after 30 minutes but the aroma is beautiful. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this item! It makes my house smell like a log cabin burning real wood in the fireplace. Sure beats the heck outta smelling carbon and natural gas! Other “natural wood fire” incenses I have purchased were too smokey or gave me a head ache. This one is not too smokey or overpowering, and smells very authentic. I completely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This insence is awesome. Every scent smells amazing. Reminds me of being up in the mountains at a cabin. I will definitley repurchase.</li>
    <li> This incense is wonderful. I have repurchased it many times now. The variety pack is really fun because of all the different types of scents it offers. I have a friend who was complaining because he couldn&#x27;t find a scented candle that reminded him of his old log burning fireplace (long since replaced by a gas version)and I told him I had just the thing for him and promptly ordered this Seven Scent Sampler for his birthday. He was thrilled! He said it was JUST what he was looking for. He loves smelling that great scent of lovely evergreen, pinion pine, etc. while enjoying his gas fireplace. I have order this packet twice now for him as a repeat gift. These are really nice incense pellets that burn clean and SMELL GREAT! This company is also wonderful. The product comes VERY quickly and Tom always puts a little handwritten \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; in with the shipment. Very nice experience all around and I highly recommend his products. I will continue to buy from him. He has incredible variety in these great smelling incenses.</li>
    <li> nice burn and scent... will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> Great way to find the ones you like. Burn just enough to get the sense of being outdoors.</li>
    <li> brings on a new fragrance</li>
    <li> I had a great smelling incense (like incense found in church) that was purchased years ago.  I bought this sampler pack to insure that I&#x27;d find my old incense again (Pinon).  They all have a great wood smell, and a great change from the various candy-like scented offerings nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a little base for safe burning.</li>
    <li> These 7 Scent Sampler Incense do not smell like a natural wood burning fire as I had hoped... Instead, they smell like church incense and create a lot of smoke. Because they created a lot of smoke, after about 5 to 10 minutes (being 30% used) I ran the tip under water... In doing so these incense crumble into dust when they touch water and become useless as well. To my eye... these 7 Scent Sampler Incense looked to be a bunch of colored sheets of paper pressed together really tight (perhaps with some kind of incense perfume added). I think real wood burning incense should be made of wood chips/sawdust and not have any perfumes added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite incense so far is Paine&#x27;s Pinon Pine Incense which is really close to smelling like a real wood burning fire. The Paine&#x27;s Pinon Pine Incense do not smoke nearly as much as these 7 Scent Sampler incense do. However the Paine&#x27;s Pinon Pine Incense do not smell 100% like a wood burning fire... I would say they smell 85% like a real wood burning fire does. Perhaps if Paine&#x27;s made their incense with maple, apple, or oak woods they would smell 100% like a real wood burning fire. I have not been able to find real wood incense made with maple, apple, or oak woods as of yet.</li>
    <li> nice collection of fragrances.  they burn for about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Everyone  I bestow  this incense  on,  Thanks me.&lt;br /&gt;It pleases  everyone.</li>
    <li> I have a gas fireplace and I would love the smell of wood burning and this really helps out.  The pieces really smell like wood burning and fills the room with a nice scent.  They are a bit hard to light completely but they last quite a while.  Love them. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of a campfire, and with this product, I can have one inside, anytime that I want to.  I would love to see an &#x27;Oak&#x27; product to go along with these current scents.</li>
    <li> Only lasts about 45 minutes to 1 hour, but smell is good with gel fireplace just purchased for Christmas.  Just wish they lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Even though these are the scents of Santa Fe, the lovely wood smoke scent reminds me of wood smoke in the autumn air in New England when I was growing up and everyone heated their houses with fireplaces and wood stoves. Living in an apartment, I love getting that fresh, outdoorsy scent! I can&#x27;t really distinguish much between the different scents (never had that sharp of a nose), but I do love them all. Also, when I was a smoker, this is one of the few types of incense that really eliminates the foul scent of tobacco! The sticks/bricks burn very quickly and are smoky, but the smoke dissipates rapidly and the scent lingers for a long time. The sampler lasted me several weeks, and I burn incense daily. A great buy!</li>
    <li> I just bought this incense after looking for a good woody scent. It smells exactly like you have a campfire burning...comforting, warm, and relaxing.</li>
    <li> Was such a wide veray of all different woodsy smells. Reminds me of walking @Santa Fe , NM&lt;br /&gt;My favorite was the hickory and Pinon. Def would make a great gift. Was shipped out fast too !!Extra perk!!thks a lot !!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! It did take a min to get them to light, and they burn a little too fast, but other then that my house smells like camp fire. So wonderful! I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this product-I will continue to order products that I know are great.</li>
    <li> Fun to try them all out.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go along with my new fireplace insert and it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.  The fragrance is truly that of wood fire and it&#x27;s nice to have the different types of wood to pick from.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For years I searched for the smell of a real wood fire in incense, candles, diffusers, etc. Finally I found Incienso de Santa Fe &amp;#34;incense&amp;#34;. The reason it smells like wood burning is because it&#x27;s actually a brick of COMPRESSED SAWDUST, so it is real wood not &amp;#34;wood fragrance&amp;#34; perfume oils dipped on sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things people say when they walk into my home, &amp;#34;Ooooh, are you having a fire in the fireplace?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first purchase was Incensio de Santa Fe&#x27;s &#x27;Seven Scent Sampler&#x27; and I liked them all, however some are stronger, and the Fir Balsam is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this incense is that it&#x27;s only in a small cone form that doesn&#x27;t burn very long. But the scent does linger. Plus I have to buy the largest size box available because I send cones home with my guests who loved it, for their &amp;#34;fireplace&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I like every one of the scents.  I don&#x27;t have a favorite.  Purchased these along with fake fireplace logs.  When the logs are on I burn one of these.  The house smells like I&#x27;m burning a real fire...and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger like it does when I burn a real fire.</li>
    <li> A friend first gave me a box of the woodincense a few years back. I was quite pleased to find \\&quot;pinion\\&quot; incense on Amazon and have been purchasing it ever since. My husband and I are both very sensitive to sweet syrupy orders of plug ins and air freshners. We have a cat and a dog and we love the smell of the natural wood almost as if there were a fire in the fireplace--not wet dog or litter box oders.</li>
    <li> I really like the scents that are offered in this sampler. They really work well together, and if you like natural woodsy scents, these are pretty good. However, they produce a lot of smoke when you burn them, and it is a bit overwhelming. I can only keep one lit for a minute or so, and then I have to extinguish it because the room fills up with smoke very quickly.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t stay lit. I hold a steady flame over them and of the 5 I have used I have to relight them 6 times EACH to get them to smoke. Not exactly the relaxing, walk away and enjoy the scent I had hoped for. This is a shame because I tried letting them air out a week and they still wont stay lit. Finally a product with a great smell only too frustrating to deal with.</li>
    <li> Like having a campfire</li>
    <li> all sorta same, but decent</li>
    <li> I ordered the wood smelling incenses for the Thanksgiving holiday at the last minute  and they were quickly shipped by the seller and I received them in time for the holiday.  The scents do smell like wood burning and add to having the gas fireplace here in California.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Long lasting smell. Kind of smoky if you burn an entire stick at once in a small room. (Buy their little log cabin incense holder. It seems to more gently distribute the smoke, as it streams from the tiny cabin&#x27;s two &#x27;chimneys&#x27;. Looks good on the mantel, too.) When we come home now the living room already smells like the subtle aroma of a working fireplace. Just what we needed to make our electric fireplace smell real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviewers have complained of difficulty lighting these &#x27;bricks&#x27;, and disappointment at the relatively short duration of burn time. I&#x27;ve had no problems igniting them with a refillable butane &#x27;jet&#x27; style cigar/cigarette lighter. And a little of this incense seems to go a long way, so I usually dip the smoldering end of the brick in a drop of water in the sink to extinguish after burning 1/4 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight, discernible difference among the various wood scents in this assortment. I prefer the &#x27;Cedar&#x27;, and &#x27;Pinon&#x27; but wish they offered &#x27;Oak&#x27; or &#x27;Apple&#x27; firewood scent. &#x27;Alder&#x27;, &#x27;Mesquite&#x27; and &#x27;Hickory&#x27; remind me more of summer BBQ&#x27;s than a Yule log! &#x27;Juniper&#x27; and &#x27;Balsam&#x27; smell astringent and more pungent, but still remind of the hearth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also bought the &#x27;Crackling Fire&#x27; audio CD to add the missing sounds of a real fireplace to our electric log insert. These two items will help complete the fireplace illusion for all of your senses.</li>
    <li> These all smell the same to me. I&#x27;ve burned through one of each, and they all smell like a campfire. That isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but if you&#x27;re looking for some variety, I&#x27;d go with another set. The holder included is great and the wood blocks pop in securely.</li>
    <li> they dont give a real wood burning scent that I expected. Just normal incense to me. Ok for incense though.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try as an alternative to incense, in an attempt to recreate that fireplace smell I grew up with.  The smell isn&#x27;t exactly the same, but I still like it.  The more I use it, the better it seems (it has grown on me over time).  It also does a great job of freshing up the house a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included base works well, but is nothing fancy.  I like it, but it is not large enough to contain the ashes from even one use (1 brick/cone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives a nice variety/selection to see what the difference is between the different types.  The amount of bricks included is actually pretty impressive.  They lasted me quite a while.  I would def. recommend these.</li>
    <li> This incense smells really good, just like a warm fire in a log cabin.  The only reason this product gets 4 stars instead of 5, is that all of the incense smells the same.  I have a fairly good sense of smell and can&#x27;t detect much difference between any of the 7 scents in this sampler box.  The small bricks burn for about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly - Good smelling incense that reminds me of the little log cabin sticks we had when I was a boy.  Gives the house a \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; accent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for incense but the person I got them for really loved them, and the scents are less obnoxious then a lot of other scents. The cones are square which is different, but not a problem.</li>
    <li> Santa Fe New Mexico, as well as the rest of New Mexico, happens to be my favorite place in the world. Along with the amazing sky, and rich, aromatic red earth, is the scent of the Pinon trees-especially when it rains.  I ordered this product to be able to experience the wonderful scents of New Mexico. I was pleasantly surprised, not only by the quality of the product, but also by the pleasing design of the package and the enclosed incense holder. This makes an excellent gift for anyone who enjoys the wonderful smell of trees and a gift so well designed.  The 7 Scent Sampler exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in smell from each type of wood,  but collectively they smell great.</li>
    <li> I love the outdoors and I love camping and the campfire smell. I&#x27;ve been looking for &amp;#34;the right&amp;#34; campfire candle for sometime now. I&#x27;ve found a few but not quite it. So I decided to give this sampler and try and let me tell you, it is literally like siting next to a campfire! The smell isn&#x27;t to overpowering, but that&#x27;s just my opinion. I will definitely be buying more of these!</li>
    <li> It smells good, but burn long and the scent disappears quickly.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m camping everytime I burn one of these and am some relaxed loving it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on  special to see what flavors I likes..the pinon and cedar were my favorites, but they all had distinct smells. More like a fireplace or campfire scent that true perfumey incense. (great burning while using a gas/electric fireplace for authenticity)</li>
    <li> This sampler is pretty good.  Definitely creates a good Smokey fireplace scent.  The only issue I have is, it creates a bit more smoke and more of a Smokey smell then I&#x27;d like.  But hey,  it&#x27;s burning incense!  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Ok, but not great. I like the insence that came with out little log house better. Burns to fast. No bad, but not great.</li>
    <li> These do smell great!  They have the smell of wood burning, although there is some of the typical incense smell that goes along with it.  I used to buy the wood scented incense sticks from another company that were amazing, but they too changed their formula and it gave off a typical &amp;#34;incense&amp;#34; smell.  I had a hard time getting these to burn.  I had to keep relighting several times.  But once I did it burned for a long time and was a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> These are the only type I&#x27;ve found that smell like wood burning.  As others have mentioned, they do take a few seconds to light.  I have not had trouble with them standing up, though.  My only qualm is that they do not last very long.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the different choices. It even came with a little clay holder for the incense.</li>
    <li> I light one up, turn on the light of my electronic woodstove-replica heater and am transported back to growing up on the farm. No wood splitting, stacking or carrying armloads inside. No stoking the stove in the middle of the night or dumping ashes in the snow. You can let a corner catch, then extinguish, for a lighter smell. For a robust, campfire aroma, use the very tip of the flame, and then blow until the end of the incense block is a glowing ember.</li>
    <li> I got my husband the Teepee burner and he loved it so much, he wanted to try their other scents. Got him this sampler pack to narrow down what he likes. Yeah, he likes them all. These are fun and function just fine. Incense tends to burn out at times and this is no different. I&#x27;ve had no issues getting the sticks to stand up on the holder or in the Teepee. The only thing that I would suggest is to shrinkwrap each scent in plastic. Being in the same box, they tend to pick up each other&#x27;s scents. Sometimes it&#x27;s a little hard to tell the difference. I would totally buy this again.</li>
    <li> Ever since discovering this incense on a trek through New Mexico MANY years ago, my home is never without the smell of a burning fireplace, year-round!</li>
    <li> Having had a real, wood burning fireplace in the past, I really missed that wonderful wood smell, when using my electric woodstove. I bought the Natural Woodincenses hoping that I could recreate the ambiance of a woodburning fireplace, and it worked wonderfully. The incense smells so good and natural that sometimes I forget my cute little woodstove is a fake!! I noticed in other reviews that some complained of excess smoke, but I really didn&#x27;t think it was anything excessive. If it&#x27;s too smokey, just light some candles, to help dissipate the smoke. I will definately order more of this item; a good value.</li>
    <li> This wood incense will make your home smell like a campfire or fireplace. If you like that smell, you will love this incense. There are 7 different wood scents to choose from, and all are lovely. The scent is lingering, so you don&#x27;t have to burn it constantly. It also came with a little incense burner that is the perfect size and shape for this type of incense. This incense may also work well for people who are sensitive to artificial smells. Several of my family members are, and they have no problems with this incense.</li>
    <li> Nice scents, we love them.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ordered these.  I like the outdoor smells.  They need a longer match to light because they are square, but the smells are terrific.</li>
    <li> Amazing  smell . I also ordered the  clay cabin. This is my first dealing with incense.  Glad I purchased  this.  It will be very useful around the holidays  when I need that pine smell</li>
    <li> The scents in this sampler are too strong for my taste but others might like the intensity. I did like the aroma but it was much to strong.</li>
    <li> The sticks fit, push harder. I&#x27;ve never had one fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They take a while to get lit. Make sure all four sides are burning and it won&#x27;t go out.</li>
    <li> My wife and I are sensitive to perfume-based incense and scented candles. We have had no problems with the natural wood-fire aromas of this product. Smoke is not a problem, but our living room is larger than average with a high ceiling. It is a welcome addition to our electric fireplace insert.</li>
    <li> These are the closet to being out in nature as I could find. I purchase from others as well. I am happy to say this product makes my list.</li>
    <li> These are my go to incense ever since discovering these logs. At first, I was apprehensive but these really are the best. A great wood-sy, log cabin smell. The sampler is a great starter. I only wish they&#x27;d burn longer because I go through them quickly! A must for incense lovers.</li>
    <li> Truly smells like the southwest. Burning wood smell is thick all winter in New Mexico.   It&#x27;s all natural, no perfumes, and if you love the smell of a wood burning fireplace, this smell exactly like it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my apartment smell like a campfire, it&#x27;s extremely calming. I keep buying the sampler thinking I will choose a favorite and buy a box of that, but I think I like mixing it up every night. Yeah, my wife and I are hooked.</li>
    <li> This is simply great stuff. The smells are unique and wonderful.   In the hope it&#x27;ll bring back memories of the ethereal in the US, I actually bought a couple extra boxes to take to Germans who were here. It would make a great gift for any number of occasions.  My only complaint is that the tiny burner base provided is not so effective. The incense bars tend to go out easily, so I rig up a little platform of metal and place it over sand. The is one area the the company could improve on.</li>
    <li> they all smell about the same when burning.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I am enjoying them quite a lot on cool, crisp mornings.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased an item from this company, and I am continuously pleased. They offer the only scent that I have found that actually smells like a campfire! Though I am typically not one to burn incense, I found these to be pleasant and not too messy. They last about an hour, and work best for me if I light them, let them burn awhile, then light again. The scent typically sticks around for a couple of hours after burning.</li>
    <li> scent starts making you sick.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to light.  The odd shape prevents it from staying up without falling over which makes the burn to go out. The scent is ok but I prefer to buy the cones or sticks. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this incense. Each of the scents smells just like the wood it is labeled as. I am very picky as to odd &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; scents in incense, and I can detect nothing other than the scent listed. Burns evenly &amp; well in the holder provided also.</li>
    <li> I have a media console with a built in crystal fire place - burning these little bricks enhances the fire place illusion. My home smells just like a real fire place is burning wood! Pair this with a fire place sound machine (also purchased here on Amazon) and you really got a good thing going!</li>
    <li> NOT THE BEST OF SCENTS. TAKES AWHILE TO LIGHT IT AND GET IT GOING.</li>
    <li> I was quite pleased to open the box and see the assortment of scents.  We previously had a big box of incense bricks that were all the same woodsy scent.  We&#x27;re tried a few already, and are enjoying the different smells.  Each one takes you to a different place...</li>
    <li> Best natural wood incense I&#x27;ve run across, consistent high-quality and no &amp;#34;partial burns&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So all of these smell about the same and they only burn for about 20 mins. They don&#x27;t give off much smoke but what smoke does come off them burns my eyes even in a ventilated room. These really are way overpriced and I regret buying them. Just go find a stick somewhere and burn that instead, it will save you money.</li>
    <li> this sampler is awesome. The scents will remind you of chilly nights in Santa Fe or Jemez. Justwish the bricks lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Have really enjoyed the different scents with our gel fuel fireplace.  Makes it just that much more realistic and enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Having a gas fireplace, while very convenient, it lacks the warmth of a wood version. The most glaring omission to a gas unit is the omission of the wood smell in your home. That being said, these woodincence bricks fill that void perfectly. I turn on my fireplace, place the included holder on the mantle, light the little mini brick...and BAM!...wood burning fireplace, all I&#x27;m missing now is the crackling of the wood as it burns. The scent fills the house with that familiar aroma of Fall &amp; Winter I missed for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the scents included in this sample pack, I like the pi&amp;ntilde;on (pine) the most. Don&#x27;t let me mislead you, they&#x27;re all very nice and add that ambiance missing with a gas fireplace, but that one is my favorite. I had a little issue keeping the cedar bricks lit and figured it was just too moist to hold the heat, so I took them and dried them out on the heat deflector of the fireplace for a few hours and now they burn perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various scents are not overwhelming and don&#x27;t have that cheap, incense-like odor to them. They just smell like burning wood as any burning wood would smell like. They do have a nice lingering effect for a few hours after they go out. On a Sunday, I can light two of them over a 5-6 hour period and that is more that suffice to create that warm, home like feeling. When people walk into my house after I have one lit, they immediately say, \\&quot;you installed a new fireplace?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was so worth it and I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this sooner, but as they say...better late than never!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I had to come back to tell you folks how cool these are. I just went through my first Winter using them and the compliments just keep rolling in from all my family &amp; friends whenever they visit. They&#x27;re so easy to use and the cost in so little when measured against the mood they create. It&#x27;s just one of those purchases that brings a smile to your face every time you light one up. I&#x27;ve given these to 3 friends with gas fireplaces as gifts and they all think it&#x27;s the coolest thing too!hese to 3 friends with gas fireplaces as gifts and they all think it&#x27;s the coolest thing too!</li>
    <li> Seems like I&#x27;ve rated this before.  Does anybody keep track?  The scents are pretty overwhelming, but I think the ones I&#x27;ve tried so far (don&#x27;t ask me which) are ok.  The front of the box is covered in a film which has to be removed, but once off all the little pieces fell everywhere so I&#x27;m not sure which is which.  I was able to match up colors to names from the picture online (I think).  Packaging could be improved.</li>
    <li> Similar to what other reviewers have said, some of the bricks are hard to light and even once they start they often go out. The bricks are very smokey with little &#x27;aroma&#x27;, and I found that a number of bricks (which are rectangular in shape) would not fit into the incense holder which has a circular hole for them without twisting and forcing them in. I grew up in the country so was really hoping these would be a way to bring the &#x27;outdoors&#x27; home, but unfortunately it was not.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! After trying numerous &amp;#34;fireplace&amp;#34; scented candles to try to create a more realistic, cozy ambiance with my electric fireplace, I finally came across these. I&#x27;m so glad I did. They are the most accurate &amp;#34;fireplace&amp;#34; smell I&#x27;ve ever found. It smells just like a wood fire burning, and it&#x27;s lovely. I&#x27;m very happy with it. The bricks take a little while to light... almost a minute with a torch I think, but, I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them staying lit, as some others have noted. I also have been breaking them in half, as a little does go a long way with these. But they&#x27;re very easy to break, and it&#x27;ll only make the pack last longer, so perhaps that&#x27;s a benefit! I love the cedar the best so far, but have yet to try a few of the others. Overall, lovely stuff!</li>
    <li> Try this one for many nice scents.</li>
    <li> smells like burning wood ..  ok if you never been in the woods .  i got enuff wood out back to burn  you can tell them apart only if you have burned  that type wood  before</li>
    <li> Very nice, not only for Christmas but anytime.</li>
    <li> This is the best kind of incense.  Smells just like the one used in the church.</li>
    <li> scent did not stay.&lt;br /&gt;very hard to light.</li>
    <li> Purchased these at the same time I bought an electric fireplace.  They smell great and a friend liked them so purchased another set.</li>
    <li> This incense smells great and the scent does not over power the room like a lot of incense does. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Kind of stinky. Not so great. Some aren&#x27;t that bad, but I certainly would prefer good old incense.</li>
    <li> scent wonderfull scent&lt;br /&gt;the inside piece that holds the pine cone broke&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;the one before it broke also&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;half way through our burning them&lt;br /&gt;how can I get another inside piece?</li>
    <li> Yes.  Hard to keep lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the scents are very much NON-incense-y.  They smell like wood burning in a fireplace.  My nose isn&#x27;t savvy enough to differentiate  between the different woods, but they are all pleasant.</li>
    <li> I really REALLY love the scent of these incense.  Reminds me of being in a cabin, with a fire roaring, the aromas of the different woods floating around.  But, once lit and burned that&#x27;s it!  I noticed the smell does not linger at all with these so I find myself constantly lighting them.  Not necessarily a deal breaker, just something to definitely be aware of.</li>
    <li> amazing smells, great product.</li>
    <li> These are hard to light and keep going.  When they do get going they burn very quickly.  There is better incense out there.</li>
    <li> these sticks do not light, unless you use a blow torch.  And they go out immediately...a waste of money, and if you want to worry that your house is burning down, take a wiff.</li>
    <li> The price is great for 49 bricks, it will last a while. I don&#x27;t notice a big difference between the scents but that could just be my sense of smell. Saying that, all the scents are great. Smells like home, cozy, fireplace, mountains, forest, woods. It is a very natural and nice smell. The only thing I did not like is that the brick burns really fast, but the scent stays in the room for a while so that is good. Some people complain that it is very hard to light them up. While this is true, I found that a candle does the trick. I would buy this product again; great price, nice scent.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product, it is extremely smoky and the pleasant scents of the unburned product does not carry through to the burning phase. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent concept, however the product is very mediocre. Its extremely difficult to light and burns out very easily. The smell is okay and when its burning it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> maybe it&#x27;s me but I have a heck of a time keeping these lit! when they ARE burning they smell outstanding!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the scent but the &#x27;types&#x27; or &#x27;names&#x27; is pure bs. They all smell the same. Can&#x27;t tell the difference from hickory and mesquite. Smells like a fire place not a barbecue or smoker. I like the aroma just the same.</li>
    <li> Perhaps because these are sample incense bricks and  are made smaller than the regular sized product, is the reason they unfortunately do not burn efficiently??  So far, I&#x27;ve lighted about half a dozen bricks, and each one has eventually gone out long before it is designed to do so.  Ordinarily, I&#x27;d just re-light, but because of their small shape, my fingers would be in danger of lighting up, instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, believe it or not, the included incense holder doesn&#x27;t fit the product!  (I found this amazingly careless of the producers of this always lovely scented incense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Love the full-sized product though, and will have  no problem recommending it!  My first box of Pinon was just perfect!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I hoped for.  I was sceptical, but it smells just like having a wood burning stove.  Scent is very strong, and dissipates quickly once done burning, but if you want that Winter Lodge, Christmas fire smell, look no further.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like incense as a rule and I hate chemical air fresheners. But I love these. It makes my house smell like I&#x27;ve got a fireplace going or a campfire out back. The bricks are easy to use, convenient and not messy. Just place the burner on a plate and no worrying about ashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d be lying if I said these didn&#x27;t smell a little alike. But a few do stand out. The Pinyon is of course the classic. It is a very economical way to get these very unique incenses from Incienso de Santa Fe.</li>
    <li> After reading all the myriad comments on Incensio de Santa Fe, I decided that the way to try them was to get a Sampler.  I&#x27;m a big fan of woodsy scents and the thought of the smell of woodsmoke appealed to me.  While these are not inexpensive, they do smell great.  The scent of a wood fire, however, is not terribly long-lasting.  I&amp;#34;d like the aroma to last longer, but when it&#x27;s done burning through, it&#x27;s gone.  The scent when firing it up is the strongest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After burning the bricks of all the scents, I determined which ones i liked mostly for the lack of excessive smoke.  Their scents are not so much different that it was necessary for me to determine a preference that way.  All were difficult to light, and I recommend a refillable lighter or using charcoal tablets (the latter will burn through the bricks faster and create more smoke).  It includes a small terra cotta holder, but I didn&#x27;t use it much - it refused to behave and hold up the bricks.  I used a metal cone holder that came in a discount incense cone pack from Walmart that I placed in a votive holder and on a stone coaster.  Worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in this type of incense and the smell of a wood fire, it&#x27;s a good way to give these a try.  I call their use &amp;#34;putting a log on the fire.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought these and they do smell like the wood smoke.  Unfortunately, they terrified both my roommate at the time and my landlord, who she called to report a fire.  I have not used them since.</li>
    <li> Great Smell. It is like sitting beside a campfire. It is a little smoky and hard to start. Worth the effort.</li>
    <li> What a great way to have a sense of a vacation at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a cup of Awesome tea and light up this incense and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an Awesome way to end a evening especially, during the work week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovely</li>
    <li> I love these. It makes my room smell like I have a fireplace going. Very soothing scents.</li>
    <li> smells authentic and soothing.  no chemical or artificial smell. truly like a wood fire.</li>
    <li> I love these pine scents! None has a fake smell, all natural and you can even see the bits of wood in them. I only wish they came in cones rather than little rectangular blocks.</li>
    <li> This is a great variety of incense.  We burn this a lot when it gets colder outside.  It smells just like a fireplace.</li>
    <li> While this product sounds like a good idea (create the smell of a real wood fire for your gas fireplace), each of the (tiny) bricks burns for only 10 minutes or so.  So if you&#x27;re planning on settling down by the fire for the evening, you must constantly get up and down to replace the bricks because they burn out so quickly.  Yes, the odors are nice, while they last, but what is needed is, e.g., a much larger brick that burns more slowly.  This product was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I occasionally burn incense; I usually do soy candles.  We also have a fire place and chiminea, so I thought these would be nice.  I only tried 2 of the scents and they just weren&#x27;t right for me.  Each scent smells like a block of wood from Home Depot - I know these are supposed to smell like wood and are wood, but I can only describe it as being too strong of a smell and not pleasing as I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> Love all the scents!  Smells like a campfire!  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this set it&#x27;s great to have all the options. If you&#x27;ve lived or camped in the southwest, the pinon and mesquite will transport you straight back :) It&#x27;s the real deal, not full of cheap fake oils.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!  Gets you as close as you can get to real wood burning without actually burning one!</li>
    <li> Delightful! I can close my eyes and think of being &amp;#34;back home&amp;#34; in the mountains of New Mexico&#x27;s villages...... I bought these as a gift, but am keeping one package just for myself!!! I&#x27;ve always heard, though, that the best gifts we can give are those we would secretly love to have for ourselves.</li>
    <li> The title isn&#x27;t an understatement. If you use these, your home will smell like a campfire. For some, this might be a good thing. Personally, I like the campfire smell as a basenote in a scent, but feel that as an incense it falls kind of flat. I usually burn these along side a nice smelling candle to help balance the smell. They are very high quality, and I have really enjoyed trying the different wood scents but don&#x27;t see myself repurchasing, as a personal preference.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Along with the log cabin burner these are brilliant. Finally incense for someone who doesn&#x27;t want strange hippie smells stinking up the home or shop. It smells exactly like smoking wood.</li>
    <li> Just exactly what I expected and the aromas are natural reminders of the real thing. Would reccomend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> The sampler pack of incense was great and what I ordered. However, the incense burners I ordered were three log cabins and I received two tepees and a Adobe home!😢 Not at all what I ordered.😩</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve purchased these more than once and will continue to do so if they remain available.  Not the sweet or perfumed scent of most incense and candles.  Like a real wood fire.</li>
    <li> To me, all burning wood smells pretty much the same. So don&#x27;t view this as 7 scents for your home. Instead, think of it as 7 very slightly different scents that will all give your home the smell of a burning campfire. Although they mostly smell the same to me, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants the smell of a campfire in their home (which hopefully should be everyone)..</li>
    <li> I would love to have a cabin in the woods with a wood burning stove or fireplace – but I currently live in an apartment in the burbs. This is an acceptable alternative to the coziness of a real fireplace. The little bricks light easily and burn through completely. I mostly use these in the morning, while drinking my coffee or meditating. I open the windows, letting in the crisp morning air let the wood smoke waft through my living room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this with a brass charcoal burner, and it fits in there perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00XAR40OM Brass Black Screen Charcoal Burner]]</li>
    <li> I could not have found a more wonderful evocative collection of smoke fragrances if I&#x27;d made them myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings back memories of my grandparents&#x27; cabin on Bainbridge Island back in the early part of the 20th Century. The smell of freshly hewn wood: cedar, fir, hemlock, alder and pine will stay with me always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I light the incense and am immediately transported back to my early years...hearing the crackling of the wood as it burns, the slight blue haze of smoke in the cabin as we played board games or cards.  I will NEVER be without these fragrances ever again.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of a fireplace... or if you have ever been in New Mexico during the winter.. you will love this incense. It burns easily and you only need one to keep your home smelling like you have a cedar fireplace going. I am addicted to this smell and have burned it every weekend since I got it. I would definitely buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> If you like incense, especially &amp;#34;woodsy/camping/outdoor&amp;#34; scents, these little bricks are nice.  None of these scents is sweet or spicy (like the incense cones/sticks you can usually purchase at the big-box store in the craft aisle).  They are truly woodsy.  I bought this box of incense as a Amazon add-on and am very pleased with the product and the value.</li>
    <li> I guess I was looking for the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; wood incense. Created a lot of smoke that filled the room. I will use it out on the patio and it will be fine.</li>
    <li> They all smell great and . . .  well, you light them on fire and they burn. Not a whole lot more to say. The only problem I had was the stand. I would of liked it if it would of fit inside the Tee-Pee scent burner that I had. But its not needed to work, so no lose there.</li>
    <li> Great item fast shipping!!!!!!</li>
    <li> but they are very hard to light and theyre very small little stubs so they dont last lomng at all.  they do smell great though</li>
    <li> out of the 7 scents, only 2 actually smelled like burning wood. the rest just smelled like burning paper. they are very hard to light too.</li>
    <li> Once these are lit the scent is much like a wood fire. I like the convenience of my gas fireplace but miss the wood scent. This is a perfect fix! I agree that getting these little bricks lit can be a &#x27;slight&#x27; problem. This is what I do for any recalcitrant incense: Light a candle and VERY slightly put a cornertip of the incense into some melted wax. This makes the waxed portion like a candle and eases the lighting process. Mind you, just a teensy corner. Once lit the scent is great. They are small so I have no problem with the amount of smoke - it dissipates long before it gets eye watering. I have placed this on my wishlist.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite incense.  I love the woods and dream of retiring to a cabin.  This incense has a wonderful woodsy scent that lasts for several days.  If you love the smell of an autumn bonfire, this is the perfect incense for you.  I don&#x27;t recommend burning in a small room without any airflow as these are VERY smokey.  They are best in a large, well ventilated room.</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift and the recipient loved them. They came nicely packaged and even with their own holders. However I didn&#x27;t really smell much difference between them. They smelled lovely but i couldn&#x27;t tell one apart from the other honestly. maybe if you separate them for a bit so they don&#x27;t rub off on each other it would be different.</li>
    <li> If you are not sure which incense you like try a sample box!  It was ordered and arrived at my home within 48 hours just as promised!  This would make a great gift for someone.</li>
    <li> Close to the real thing. Use it when we light our gas fireplace.</li>
    <li> These produce a very nice smell.  Each one does not burn for very long, but they make the house smell like we are burning wood instead of a gas log.  I wish they burned for a longer period of time so I could give them a 5.</li>
    <li> These smell like bonfire heaven, camping, cook outs, and good times all rolled into one tiny cube.  You get so many for the great price, and it comes in a really cool little box.  You definitely need these, trust me.</li>
    <li> We own a small electric fireplace and I saw that other owners use these while their fireplace is on. These little guys smell fantastic there are several varieties in the box and they all smell authentic. The scent fills my whole house. I have since sent them as gifts.</li>
    <li> The scents take me right out into nature! The little holder that comes with set needs to be put into or on to something fireproof for safety. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> we don&#x27;t have a real fireplace and during the holidays/winter enjoy the smell of burning logs.  these do the trick.  we can enjoy the smell and set the ambiance.</li>
    <li> Smells good but they burn up quick</li>
    <li> The bricks burn very fast. The scent is very strong.&lt;br /&gt;But I like it. The scents do smell like burning wood.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product</li>
    <li> They all seem to smell the same, pulverized pine with a hint of whatever they were labeled to be.  Buy again......No.  Had piñon pine several times in the past and mesquite. These knockoffs are a big miss.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the sampler. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Ahhh...aroma therapy!  Perfect &amp;#34;mind getaway&amp;#34; for a stressful day.  Just sit back and picture the beautifully painted colors of a New Mexico mountain range.</li>
    <li> This is excellent quality. I discovered this when I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Tamaya Resort in Albuquerque. They use several varieties of this wood incense in common areas to give the scent of wood fireplaces, since all their fireplaces are gas. They used primarily pinon pine and cedar. For two days I was trying to figure out which fireplace was the wood burning one. This lights best using a butane lighter for about a minute on one end. Then you toss it into a bowl filled with sand or other sturdy incense burner. It burns for maybe 15 minutes and smells exactly like the indicated wood variety (since it is made of real, compressed sawdust of that type). Just like a wood burning fireplace, the scent lingers in a room for a couple days thereafter. A side benefit is that the carbon particles from the smoke will neutralize other odors (cooking, stale house, etc.), not just mask odors. You can combine or alternate the different varieties for your own preference. This sampler pack is a great way to try it - then you can purchase more of individual types from same manufacturer. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I love this incense. The first time I ever used it, I had picked it up at a little gift store in a rural part of California east of the Sierras. I am so glad that I can find it online.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected! Smells like a campfire, not perfume-y like some stick incense or candles, not too smokey, and the scent lingers just enough not too strong, it was perfect for our needs, love the variety of different wood smells.  Will purchase again and give as a gift</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to burn so quickly.  Scent doesn&#x27;t last.  I think it&#x27;s a waste of money. Maybe I expected too much?</li>
    <li> This is simply a great product that really takes you back to the old country feeling of sitting around the fireplace and enjoying the different types of wood smells that you get from burning fire wood.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> My parents recently installed a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; fireplace in their house, the kind that uses gas and fake logs. The new fireplace is nice but doesn&#x27;t produce the wonderful smell of burning logs that my family is used to. I figured the had to be a product out there to fix this and that&#x27;s when I ran across this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I think incense, I think nag champa. That stuff smells way too strong and fake. I hate the stuff. On the other hand these woodincenses are much different. While they can smell strongly if used in too small of a space, they are pretty much just tiny bricks of crushed wood. So when you burn them, you&#x27;re basically burning straight wood which means that the smell is the real deal. However, they do produce just as much smoke as normal incense but that shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a problem as long as the incense stays in the fireplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for real wood smells out of an incense product, this one will definitely do the job well.</li>
    <li> Love these .. they smell great.. makes the house feel like a cabin in the woods</li>
    <li> i am glad we bought the sampler so we can decide which sent we like best.  A few burn our eyes but some of them smell really good.</li>
    <li> Best winter-time incense ever! I loved this fresh wood/fireplace-smelling incense so much that I bought several more sets for Christmas gifts. Several people have since told me that they&#x27;ve really enjoyed them too. And since the quality and packaging is so good and the price so affordable, I&#x27;ll continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, wish is would last longer</li>
    <li> I first bought these about 20 years ago in Jerome, AZ (Ghost Town) - been using ever since. The original holders are long gone so I just light one and stand in an ashtray (the only use they ever get) or on a square of foil - they can leave a spot of greasy sap.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the smell - the hickory reminds me of my childhood - sweeping and burning leaves (it wasn&#x27;t a sin then) - we had several huge hickory trees out front and come Fall it was hard to wait to start sweeping and burning or toasting marshmallows.  We&#x27;d keep the nuts over the Winter and by Spring most could be whacked out of their outer shell with a good mallet.&lt;br /&gt;My memory says these bricks smell just like the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;After a recent move I found about a half of a sampler that had to be 15 years old - and they smell good as new.&lt;br /&gt;Which scent is best?  That&#x27;s your opinion - my opinion is that they all add a great aroma to any room.&lt;br /&gt;And to my smoker - just bought an indoor smoker that uses specially processed wood chips.  After about the 5th use I crumbled two hickory bricks in with the &#x27;official&#x27; chips and ... Voila! everything smelled better:  the room, the smoke, and the ribs.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint:  with my fat fingers lighting them can be ... interesting.  Check out Benedict Rock&#x27;s review for some good info.&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself:  get a sampler, throw a good disk on the player, curl up with a favored lady and a nice vin ordinaire, kill the lights -- and you just might swear the ceiling turned to stars ...</li>
    <li> As previous reviewers have mentioned, this incense has a &#x27;campfire&#x27; scent. I was unable to discern the individual scents during burning... they all just smell like wood burning to me. I perfer the Paine brand over this.</li>
    <li> These are great incense. My favorite is fur balsam in the sampler pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use electric burner (electric Bakhur), not the one for oils, but a more hot one for resins and burning incense. Typically a small piece of of a small stick is enough for a room. I powder it with fingers and spread over the burner, adding Egyptian kyphi and frankincense.&lt;br /&gt;Often I add real fruit tea - dried blackberry, wild strawberries and wild rose.&lt;br /&gt;Even without any additions Fir Balsam is best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your sticks don&#x27;t burn too well, try drying them one way or another and storing in a dry box or jar. For drying you may use a toaster, or an oven or a frying pan. Or just any warm and dry place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I find it convenient to place a stick sideways on my gas burner, so the end hands over the flame, at minimal flame, let the end become red and then turn off the gas.</li>
    <li> I burn a lot of incense and this is still one of my favorite sets. It smells amazing and reminds me of the woods. Love it. If you dont, mail them to me!</li>
    <li> Smells like a fireplace on a crisp cold night in winter. since my fireplace is not working right now, these are almost as good, they remind me of a campfire in the mountains. smells great without that &amp;#34;headshop&amp;#34; smell. My favorites are pinon and juniper, but they are all nice. and since they are strong I only need to burn half of one at a time. I use a long nose lighter which works great for lighting these when you have to hold the flame there a little longer. I love the smell of burning wood and I recommend these to everyone. I bought the cute little teepee burner and set it on a ceramic saucer and I use it on the stove top so It&#x27;s nice and safe. I love how the smoke comes out the top of the teepee, It reminds me of when I was a kid on summer vacation.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell and burn.</li>
    <li> Need to have a big room to lite in or turn on the fan on your HVAC system to circulate the smell good.</li>
    <li> Its a nice little sampler. Gives me a chance to find out what scent I like.</li>
    <li> All are nice, but like the fir scent the best ! Less smokey than others and a mild forest scent! I love Santa Fe, New Mexico so much that I taught my parrot to say , Santa Fe, Santa Fe, I love Santa Fe! I surround myself with everything that reminds me of this magical country!</li>
    <li> The bricks are really small but the scents are nice.  I have always loved the little log cabin evergreen scent incense burners and these take me back.</li>
    <li> The sampler has a nice variety of scents.  I am not sure how I overlooked that this was incense though, I bought it to scent candles so it really didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this to go with a DVD fire scene.  Actually does add to the ambiance. Fairly strong so I extinguish it after about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Way too much smoke. I feel like i&#x27;m in a smoke house. I would not recommend to anyone. Really nasty.</li>
    <li> Great.  I can&#x27;t wait until the holidays to,use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this incense to go with an electric \\&quot;wood\\&quot; stove as I thought it would create a nice effect. The incense arrived promptly and there were many bricks in the packaging. When burning it however, it creates a smoky haze so that soon, everyone in my house was clearing their throats or coughing. The incense also doesn&#x27;t slowly burn down like other incense does - it just does out after about 15-20 minutes. Strangely, the seller contacted me to see if I was satisfied with the item and I said \\&quot;no\\&quot; so they offered to refund me $5. I notified Amazon just to see if this was a regular transation to have sellers contacting me to offerpartial refunds, and Amazon&#x27;s customer service interceded and gave me a full refund. Hurray for Amazon. Not sure about this seller or their product though.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly with all bricks intact.  So far I&#x27;ve tried all but the hickory and each has smelled fantastic--though the fir balsam is my favourite.  The smoke is not too thick or caustic and the smell of the wood lingers for hours.  The holder is very convenient and easy to clean, though a couple of the bricks were slightly too large for the hole.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> We ran out of this incense awhile back and was purchasing incense from various stores.  I was so glad to find this one again.  It is the best incense we ever used.  It has a clean smell and a slow burn.  It is more expensive than the others, but so worth the extra few dollars.  And I love that it is made in USA.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would remind me of the smell of a wood burning fire. I have an electric stove that looks very authentic in my &amp;#34;home office&amp;#34;, and I wanted to add something that would add the smell of wood burning fire. I tried these 7 scent sampler and they are really fun.  It is a little hard for me to differentiate all of them (although I know there is a difference).  Also,  they are a bit smoky , so it seems to work best for me when placed in a hallway near by with rather open space.  Very authentic wood burning smells (I was surprised and pleasantly surprised at that!) I will buy them again..  thank you.  Someone else recommended the cute Holiday Country Hearth Puppy Burner which I also bought and loved.. and keeps the incense safely protected.</li>
    <li> Great woodsy scents!! Love these incense bricks- they pick up the room right away. Would recommend for anyone who likes natural scents.</li>
    <li> These blocks of natural incense smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;IF you can light them and keep the glow going.&lt;br /&gt;A butane torch cigar lighter works best.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t put off too much smoke. My one and only issue with it is that all of the scents esentially smell the same. When I purchased it I thought they would be pretty different and they might be to someone with a very sensitive nose. To me it is all the same, but that isn&#x27;t a problem as it still smells good.</li>
    <li> Since I have a gas fireplace, I miss the woodsy smell.  So I burn these and even though there&#x27;s still no crackling wood, the scent is lovely.</li>
    <li> We love the scents, but they are small and burn fast. The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRICE FOR A GOOD QUALITY OF INCENSE!</li>
    <li> Great Value for the money... I bought two of these,..won&#x27;t Have to worry about Running out of incense..... I will buy these again</li>
    <li> These smell so good. I&#x27;m pleased. They smell like a real wood burning fireplace.</li>
    <li> I love incense, but so many varieties are so over-perfumed that I can&#x27;t burn them without getting a terrible headache.  The best thing about Incensio de Santa Fe&#x27;s incense is that it&#x27;s NOT perfumed - it&#x27;s just natural wood.  Wait, no, I take that back; the best thing about Incensio de Santa Fe&#x27;s incense is that it smells so darn good.  I like to light a brick (sometimes two, one at each end of the downstairs) in the evening when we&#x27;re getting ready to go upstairs to bed.  The smoke lightly wafts up the stairs and it makes me feel cozy and comfortable the same way sitting by a campfire would do.  When I wake up in the morning, the whole house still smells like aromatic smoke, the way homes with a fireplace often smell.  The smell lasts for a good part of the day (until about the afternoon, I&#x27;d say) and I never, ever, ever, ever have any negative reactions (like headaches). Love it.  I hardly burn anything else since I discovered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sampler pack is a great deal; you get so many varieties (that all really do smell distinctly different from one another) to suit various moods (some days are better for the woods from where I grow up, some need to smell like the North Shore of Superior, etc.), different types of weather (I like the woods with duskier, earthier aromas when it&#x27;s rainy and stormy), and different seasons (I preferentially choose the piney woods around the holidays).</li>
    <li> I have been searching for YEARS to find a fragrance that replicates the great outdoors and this is it!  Wish the &amp;#34;bricks&amp;#34; were a little larger so I could enjoy the aroma longer but it does the trick!  Thanks for coming up with this novel idea!  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> «:::P:::» «:::E:::» «:::R:::» «:::F:::» «:::E:::» «:::C:::» «:::T:::»</li>
    <li> The scents, while supposedly different, all smell identical when burning. They also burn for about 45 minutes. No where near the 2 hour claim on the box.</li>
    <li> What scents you like is a personal matter. The pinion is good to me. All are good but the cedar doesn&#x27;t smell like cedar....smells like old fashioned campfire. The &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34; is stupid. Looks like it was built for another product.....BUT if I ever run out ( lot of them), I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many - this stuff is a campfire right in the middle of your living room. SUPER high quality.</li>
    <li> Great scents of different woods, what can I say. Well worth the money..Fairly smokey and they burn about 15 minutes or so.</li>
    <li> Everyone loves the smell and wonders what it is and where to get it. Especially wonderful during the holidays since it gives that nice fireplace smell. Doesn&#x27;t burn super fast either.</li>
    <li> My husband, Mr. Outdoors personified, loves the smell of this incense.</li>
    <li> I really like all of the scents in this sampler, and it was useful in determining what I will order more of in the future from this company.  The incense really does smell like a real fireplace, but has a very clean smell...NOT like the intense smell clothes and hair get from getting caught in the stream of smoke at an outdoor campfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product on Amazon for $9.30 in late Nov. 2014, and now, on December 20th, the product is selling for $15.99 on Amazon, while the Incensio website has it for $9.00.</li>
    <li> I love incense and these smell so nice.  I love the real outdoor woodsy scent.  I like the sampler because I got to compare the different scents.  Also the holder works well as long as you clean it in between use.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I love the smell of a crisp fire.&lt;br /&gt;This incense does a great job of making your home smell great without the obnoxious perfume smell of some incense.&lt;br /&gt;My one qualm is to get the incense going correctly it takes either multiple lighting of the incense, or over lighting of the incense which causes the incense to burn out very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am happy with it, just understand the small sticks rarely last longer than 5-10minutes.</li>
    <li> I have tried pi&amp;ntilde;on, pine and cedar so far.  They are wonderful--each evoking wonderful memories of cozy gatherings with loved ones.  This company seems to be very intentional about producing a quality product in every way--fair price, high quality, and meeting all the commitments they make in their product descriptions.  So glad I came across them on Amazon.  :)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these anywhere anymore and they are my husband&#x27;s favorite.  EASY to light, great subtle and not overly perfumey smell.  These burn nice and clean and have a lasting linger that is reminiscent of being in the woods.</li>
    <li> The wood smells are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Having a gas fireplace is super convenient but the smell of natural wood burning makes all the difference.  These things work perfectly and add just the nice touch.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these incense samplers for years and years. It reminds me of fall campfires and cool winter nights.</li>
    <li> Nice supplement to my gas fireplace</li>
    <li> Love the wood smokey smell these fill my apartment with!</li>
    <li> We just bought an electric &#x27;fake&#x27; fireplace/heater. One of the things that has contributed to our enjoyment of it has been these little bricks. They smell great and do a good job of making our home smell like we have a real fireplace. However, they are a little hard to light and it would be nice if they were larger. Overall, we&#x27;re very pleased.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift. The recipient was VERY happy with it. I&#x27;m not a fan of incense but found these to be far less overwhelming than most.</li>
    <li> These are pretty great. The scents are really nostalgic of being out in the woods camping or living up in a mountain town. It&#x27;s great for when I can&#x27;t get out out the house for these things, especially during the winter. The only negative thing I&#x27;d say about these is that they all smell very similar. Most of them do not have many, if any noticeable differences. Still great though and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> These incense smell terrible. They cannot be used indoors at all.</li>
    <li> As an Orthodox Christian I burn incense at my Bright Corner frequently.  My husband is sensitive to many of the traditional versions of incense, but he likes this one.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent sampler. It fills my home with the earthy, warm scent of a woodburning stove. The cedar, alderwood, fir etc, are so authentic. The delivery was speedy and the service was great! I will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> The scent is fine but the holder provided lacks practicality if not downright dangerous.  Both from the standpoint of burning yourself or the scent falling out of the holder and potentially setting a fire.  The holder needs to be made to fit the scents better.</li>
    <li> Product gives a feeling the logs are real</li>
    <li> I have tried to contact the seller several times to no avail....I have no idea of where to place the incense...there are no directions...not sure if it should be in the fire or on the side</li>
    <li> These incense are the way to go.</li>
    <li> This variety pack is perfect in choosing which sent you like best, I can say the Alder is definitely more smokey..but a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Some other reviewers complained about the excessive smoke but it&#x27;s incense, what do you expect? I half expected my smoke alarm to go off when I burned it but not at all! They have a great wood smoke scent that lingers and my husband likes the &#x27;bbq&#x27; ones LOL...the mesquite and hickory. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Burn these almost every night, multiple scents included in the kit.  Great and inexpensive incense collection - will buy more.</li>
    <li> Does not stay burning I was expecting more</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fun idea. They are very difficult to light. Once lighted they do what they are meant to do. They do burn down faster than I had hoped. I probably would not buy them again.</li>
    <li> I feel this is a great sampler and introduction to brick incense. My favorite is the Cedar. The incense holder is a bit shallow, which means the incense can topple easily. But I&#x27;m sure its simplicity keeps the cost of the entire sampler reasonable.  The bricks burn at a nice slow rate. The smoke/incense is thicker than stick incense, but not as heavy as resin incense. I would recommend getting another holder if you don&#x27;t have something you can use besides the little holder that is supplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because it lights and burns well, stands on the burner well, and does a great job of masking odors. But, personally, I don&#x27;t like the smoky smell of a burned campfire in the house.&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried this type of incense, and must have missed all the reviews that said \\&quot;woodsmoke\\&quot;! I imagined it would smell something like sandalwood but with other tree \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;. When I opened it, the smell was nice, but after lighting it and seeing and smelling the billows of smoke, I was struck by the irony that some people want this when there are also products advertised on TV (that I have used) to remove the smell of woodsmoke from the home.</li>
    <li> The blocks of incense are too big to sit in the provided incense holder. The blocks are square, the holder has a small round pit where the block of incense is supposed to sit. Try to put the incense in the incense holder, and it topples over and makes, at best, a strongly-scented mess and, at worst, a structure fire. Pretty lame for a bundled product. As far as the scents, they are fine. But I bought this set to get a matching incense holder, and the holder doesn&#x27;t hold. Total fail.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sampler hoping I would find a wood incense scent that I liked. They mostly just smell like a smoky fire. The only ones that seemed distinctive at all were the cedar and mesquite. I much prefer the Paine&#x27;s Fir Balsam incense to any of the scents in this sampler. I won&#x27;t be buying any more Incienso De Santa Fe. If you are just looking for the smell of smoke you might like these, but I was looking for the distinctive scents of the various tree resins. The Paine&#x27;s has the hint of that sweet pine resin smell you get when you crush some fresh pine needles between your fingers.</li>
    <li> These are a great alternative &amp; have a stronger campfire, native smell. They burn really well and stay solid as they turn to ash. The great part is that they come with a terra-cotta stand.</li>
    <li> THIS SAMPLE BOX IS GREAT.  THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT RATE IT AS 5 STAR IS I THINK THE HOLDER COULD BE BETTER, EVEN IF IT COST A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS.</li>
    <li> Like the odor, but sampler is to short</li>
    <li> My mother always gave us Mesquite and Pinion incense for Christmas. I tried this sampler because I LOVE the smell of wood (it really does smell like a wood fire). I didn&#x27;t care for a few of the other types of wood, and will go back to the Pinon and Mesquite. If you like the other types of wood, I&#x27;d still recommend it. The company that makes it has been around for many decades, and always has a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> they burn a tad too quick. Is it worth 10.00? Yes. Would I order it again? Yes. All in all I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great sampler of different woods; however, they burn up quickly. It did make a unique stocking stuffer and it is a complete set which included a holder to burn the incense.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. My only issue is these seem to make my face burn. I&#x27;m an incense junkie and I know that that&#x27;s not a normal reaction. So maybe I&#x27;m allergic to the scents in them or the actual product or who even knows. Either way, I can only occasionally burn these. But, when I do, they smell so much like my beloved campfires. It brings back great memories of summer and camping with my family. I loved them but the itching makes it only an occasional thing. I dont&#x27; recommend these to anybody with allergies to grass and certain plants seeing as maybe that&#x27;s what is causing the reactions.</li>
    <li> Honestly i think these are over priced. I was missing a couple of &amp;#34;bricks&amp;#34; in my package btw these &amp;#34;bricks&amp;#34;  are only about 11/4&amp;#34; in hlength and my opinio, is these are just compressed saw dust. Iall the scents are the same. And they DO put out alot of smoke and burn for appx 10 minutes. Im not impressed at allout 1</li>
    <li> I like these. You really have to get them burning in order for them to keep burning, but I love the smell of burning wood, so I really do like them. I will be buying more as I really like the variety of smells.</li>
    <li> This is the PERFECT gift for the holidays. Great value. Great scents. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t last long. However, it is a sampler so this is more of a compliment than anything. I will be buying more. I LOVE the Fir Balsam!</li>
    <li> Bought this product to mask the smell of ventless gas fireplace. After reading the reviews I was concerned as to how strong the odor may be. After lighting the first piece of cedar I was pleasently surprised. It does burn complete within less than 10 minutes. However the amount of scent that is realeased is perfect it isn&#x27;t to strong but enought to last for a few hours and not overpowering. Very happy with this product. I plan to buy a couple more as gifts</li>
    <li> I gave these away as small Christmas gifts... I planned to keep one for myself but they were all gone!</li>
    <li> Good for finding out which smell you like best.  Unfortunately these little blocks don&#x27;t burn longer than 5-10 minutes.  I would rate it higher if they burned a little longer.</li>
    <li> These are awesome, I love the real fireplace scent.  Everyone who visits my workshop ends up ordering some.</li>
    <li> So we live in a small New York apartment that of course doesn&#x27;t have a fireplace. My ingenious solution? Did you know that Amazon Instant Video has a couple good fireplace and campfire videos?  With the video going, sound turned up to hear the popping and crackling of the wood, and one of these incense sticks burning, maybe a candle in the window or something, and it&#x27;s so freakin&#x27; homey in here, it&#x27;s amazing!  Had friends over for dinner with this all going on, and we mocked it a little (we are from New York, after all), but mostly, it was great.  Recommended for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want or can&#x27;t have the mess of a fireplace.  (Soot and smoke was not too bad--didn&#x27;t need to clean up, smoke alarms didn&#x27;t go off.)</li>
    <li> Was nervous at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure of the quality or anything, but it met and surpassed my expectations.  I love these so much, and I love the different scents you can choose from. And the spiffy box!  Grew up with balsam fir, so this was perfect for me.  Will 100% buy again once I use my current box up</li>
    <li> A little bit too strong for me.</li>
    <li> Love how all these smell.</li>
    <li> Love the different scents in the variety pack. Will definitely be buying more from this company. Changed my view on incense forever, and now a lifelong lover of incienso de sante fe</li>
    <li> These smell good and have alot of different wood scents to choose from. I would definetly buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Every fall, a lot of stores used to sell little boxes of natural wood incense similar to this. When my children were young, I always stocked up in the fall, so that the first crisp evening it was cool enough to light the gas log, the house would smell pleasantly like we had a wood burning fireplace. And then one year, all the stores that previously carried natural wood incense replaced that product with an assortment of perfumed, scented sticks that are so not my style and didn&#x27;t smell anything like natural wood. A couple of times I came across &amp;#34;fool&#x27;s incense&amp;#34;: little blocks of compressed sawdust that resembled the old natural wood incense until you lit them: they crumbled and emitted a definite chemical scent. I despaired of ever finding the real thing again, until I saw this product on Amazon. It was sufficiently inexpensive that I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Each variety emits a clean, subtle, natural wood scent. Pinyon is my personal favorite, but I recommend the sampler to anyone, because it&#x27;s terrific to have a number of scents from which to choose. And I can&#x27;t begin to say how many people say to me in cool weather, when I have the fire going and a couple of sticks of this burning, &amp;#34;Your house always smells so good!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> During the recent polar vortex-laden winter we had, I burned these in the house to remind me that there is a place where the sun still shone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, I very much appreciated the different scents each type gave off. The aromas were pleasant without being perfumey or overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love these incense! If you like the smell of burning wood or the smell of a campfire, then you will love these incense. They are of great quality and one of best incense I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> These are fun and smell just like a real fire.</li>
    <li> This will sound silly since this is incense, but these are very smoky and the scents were so similar when burning that they were not very identifiable.  Neat idea but we were not so impressed.</li>
    <li> Im glad i got this sampler. There is only one scent i dont care for. Got it fast, when burning a brick it lasts about 2 hours. I like this company a lot.</li>
    <li> I discovered these on a trip through New Mexico several years ago. As a life long lover of incense,  I&#x27;m always on the quest for the perfect scent.  Since I found these,  I&#x27;ve never purchased anything else.  I love the smell, which is just like wood smoke. They burn well and stay lit.  The holder they come with doesn&#x27;t always hold the incense well due to size differences, so I just have a dish I use and set the log upright for burning. Whenever I have company over,  they always want to know what incense I&#x27;m burning and they end up taking some log home for their own.  It&#x27;s a frequently requested Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> These are really nice gives us the scent of a real wood fire but no mess or heat of fireplace use. Reminds me of when we lived in Flagstaff AZ in the woods and all the wonderful smells of the pines,junipers and pinion tree Fast ship and great pricing.</li>
    <li> Not really what I wanted. Looking for real pine scented incense. Remember that aroma at my grandfather house many years ago.</li>
    <li> These really are as good as everyone says.. I think it&#x27;s really wood that I&#x27;m burning lol, but it smells good. Def a campfire.</li>
    <li> WOULD RECOMMEND. All the scents smell the same to me, but I enjoy it as does my hubby who says it reminds him of the hill stations in northern India. Smells like a wood lodge. Perfect for wintertime. Probably would not use in summertime.</li>
    <li> The 7 scents are wonderful and when lit while burning a gas fire you believe that real wood is burning!</li>
    <li> Burns far too quickly &amp; unevenly! &amp; has almost no smell to any of them!</li>
    <li> I use this incense when I&#x27;m burning canned flames in the fireplace.  convincing.</li>
    <li> They have a wonderful scent but can easily overpower a large room if a window isn&#x27;t cracked. I have two dogs whom took to hiding to get away from the strong smell. They do tend to smoke a bit so I just place a jar over it and let it go out naturally. Then I can re-lite when ever.</li>
    <li> Be aware that not everyone likes the smell of burnt wood. But if you do this will be great for you. Although it is a bit hard to get it started because if you don&#x27;t get the whole top glowing red it will put itself out prematurely. Great sampler pack!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance and long lasting incense.</li>
    <li> The incense hold included with this product in inadequate. The incense bricks are not square on either end and quite difficult to stand up in the holder, particularly when the brick is lit.  Most times, even though the brick was lit and glowing when placed in the holder, the brick stopped burning requiring re-lighting on an even smaller brick and then trying to re-stand it in the holder. The aroma is good when it stays fired up and smoldering but the frustration involved was not worth the reward for me. Disposed of.</li>
    <li> I have a gas burning fireplace and always miss the smell of fresh burning wood, but living in a high fire danger area I don&#x27;t trust the ability of my chimney to hold in all flying embers.  This does the trick.  With several scents and a small clay holder it works pretty well to satisfy the desire to smell wood burning</li>
    <li> I really like these.  Funny thing though, the little piece of wood, that is the holder,  for the incense is round. The incense is square. Other than that. really nice.</li>
    <li> These are so super cool. I only wish the individual bricks were bigger and lasted longer. I have an electric fireplace and when I burn these while the fireplace is one it totally adds to the experience.</li>
    <li> This sampler is perfect.  I&#x27;ve spent many nights around the campfire with best friends in all parts of the country and these scents bring me back.  If you&#x27;re thinking about it, do it!</li>
    <li> Holder is pretty worthless but you can get around that.  The scent of different types of wood is spot on. Loved this in the winter. I used with the electric fields heater I bought on amazon and it was so nice in winter, felt like I was cuddled up to a real fire. Scent is intoxicating. True wood smells.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these incense!  The aroma is natural and clean (a huge change from the brand I usually buy).&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers are put-off by the &amp;#34;difficulty&amp;#34; to keep the bricks lit, as did I until I made a simple realization: just blow on it.  It&#x27;s 100% natural with no accelerants or chemicals mixed in to help it burn.  There are no &#x27;punk sticks&#x27; (made of god-only-knows-what).  And yes, it is a brick... not a cone or a coil or a whatever.&lt;br /&gt;Really - GREAT incense!!!</li>
