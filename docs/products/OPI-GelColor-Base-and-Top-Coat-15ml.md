### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works perfectly</li>
      <li>These items are the best when it comes to gel application.  </li>
      <li>Loved it!</li>
      <li>Works great after you learn how to apply it.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and make your nails look great!</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved OPI products and these</li>
      <li>I thought this was like the kind in salons</li>
      <li>OPI really is the best on the market.</li>
      <li>Great product, thanks!</li>
      <li>This gel is great really works.</li>
      <li>These are the easiest top and basecoat to apply because the texture is easy to work with and they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shrink&amp;#34; like some brands do.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products for a salon quality gel mani &amp; pedi in the comfort of your own home :-)</li>
      <li>I find after 10 days I get lifting at the edges even when I cap the free edge.</li>
      <li>I love just as much!</li>
      <li>I used them for the first time today and was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails at home and find OPI to be far superior to other products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big nail person but this product has inspired me to my nails more often.  </li>
      <li>Lasts much longer than Shellac but much longer to soak off.  </li>
      <li>These appear to be the real deal</li>
      <li>Use the gel basecoat, dry in lamp, use your normal nailpolish, let it dry very good, use the opi topcoat and dry in lamp.</li>
      <li>They came nicely packaged and protected and also arrived earlier than expected.</li>
      <li>and they work as expected under my Sensationail light.</li>
      <li>They last pretty well - for me about 10 days, for others sometimes 2 weeks or so.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just planning for the extra time now because totally worth it to last longer for me.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not a big nail person but this product has inspired me to my nails more often.  The nail polish does not chip. YAY!!!</li>
    <li> I thought this was like the kind in salons so I bought it and the dryer for my wife. It isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
    <li> Go with Sally Hansen.  I got OPI brand because they&#x27;ve never let me down before, but their gel polish is terrible.  It stays on a week, tops.</li>
    <li> This gel is great really works. Takes a bit longer then regular polish so don&#x27;t be fooled after it dries though its waaaaaay stronger and muuuuuuuuuch shiner and lasts allllllllllot longer!!! yippie</li>
    <li> This is professional grade base and top coat.  With this I can get my polish to last at least a week if not more.  OPI really is the best on the market.</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks! Works perfectly</li>
    <li> Loved it! Easy to use and make your nails look great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two sets - one for my mom and one for myself. These appear to be the real deal and they work as expected under my Sensationail light. These are the easiest top and basecoat to apply because the texture is easy to work with and they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shrink&amp;#34; like some brands do. I&#x27;ve used them with a variety of brands for the colors. They last pretty well - for me about 10 days, for others sometimes 2 weeks or so. I find after 10 days I get lifting at the edges even when I cap the free edge. Overall, I like this top and base coat though!</li>
    <li> You also can use this base and topcoat with normal nailpolish. Use the gel basecoat, dry in lamp, use your normal nailpolish, let it dry very good, use the opi topcoat and dry in lamp.</li>
    <li> Good product.  It does leave a sticky residue that must be removed before continuing.  Works great after you learn how to apply it.</li>
    <li> These items are the best when it comes to gel application.  I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails at home and find OPI to be far superior to other products.</li>
