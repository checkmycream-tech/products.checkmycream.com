      <li>Was cute nice and pretty</li>
      <li>I read a lot of reviews saying that this broke easily.</li>
      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would break easily</li>
      <li>The brush part comes out of the plastic part every 3 brushes which is probably an easy fix if I glue it</li>
      <li>But since it doesnt affect the quality of the item its fine</li>
      <li>The wires bend when snagged on a knot in my wigs, so they easily come free without tearing my wigs..</li>
      <li>A super sturdy brush for my wig!</li>

      <li>This is a nice brush for both real hair and wigs.</li>
      <li>Love my brush broke on the first day it broke with my using it on my wig.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It took a little more hair out of my wig than i would have liked but over all pretty good.</li>
      <li>The product itself is good; but I think the wig I had was too cheap and too long for this to be beneficial.</li>
      <li>But thanks to this brush i was able to fully take care of my wig.</li>
      <li>really well :3</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a hassle than a help really.</li>
      <li>Good for synthetic wigs but after a month the teeth started separating from brush and bending this way less than most</li>
      <li>Not to mention it came quickly in the mail</li>
      <li>It is a wig brush but works super well for doll hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This brush is very gentle on my wigs. It came in black and looks just like the picture. Not to mention it came quickly in the mail</li>
    <li> came apart easily and the wires bent badly</li>
    <li> Tangles my long wig, no matter how much I try and be careful with it. Maybe it&#x27;s just the wig, I&#x27;unno. It&#x27;s not my favorite, but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
    <li> great product ands easy to use.</li>
    <li> Really useful. Don&#x27;t brush your scalp with it! Ouch!</li>
    <li> Finally got to use it on one of the wigs I gotten, because it came arrive tangled up. But when i was using it, some of the bristles got bend easily and still had difficult trying to get knots out.</li>
    <li> The brush seems to function. As other reviewers pointed out, the metal bristles are very wobbly in the rubber mounting (base) and tend to yield rather easily.  On the other hand, it does remove tangles in a costume wig.  I was surprised that it does function.  Just not sure how long it&#x27;s going to last.</li>
    <li> Its a good brush. Every once in a while it pulls away from the handle. I put a drop of superglue on the rubber. Works great!</li>
    <li> works for brushing the wigs</li>
    <li> Ouch. No tips on the metal bristles.</li>
    <li> good price, works as intended, light weight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Like this comb. I use it on my own hair.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Worked great for my wig, it&#x27;s curly and long and it didn&#x27;t snag or anything would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great Quality brush!</li>
    <li> This is ok, but the foldable Revlon one is much better quality.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. This brush is justed what I needed for myy</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with an extra long wig that I had; but it didn&#x27;t really work. The product itself is good; but I think the wig I had was too cheap and too long for this to be beneficial.</li>
    <li> Its nice, small, teeth bend so it doesnt rip through the hair that bad and it does a good job at untangling knots.</li>
    <li> Super cheap and came super fast!  It said it was coming Friday but instead it came today (Tuesday). It came in red and packed very safe, it&#x27;s super sturdy and works on Ball Jointed Doll wigs, as well as human wigs. Definitely a good purchase!</li>
    <li> It was 2 weeks late it came a part fast bet can be put back together I would bye again</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, so for the price, it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;The top four bristles were extremely loose before even using it (right after taking it out of the package) and I wound up taking them out with a needle-nose because they would&#x27;ve caused a problem (and even aside from that would&#x27;ve been useless) when using the item. I think this may have been something with when it was shipped, getting tossed around. Not a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;You have to be very careful when using it anyways, or other bristles will loosen up just the same.&lt;br /&gt;If I had paid more for this I&#x27;d&#x27;ve been disappointed, but this is kind of what I expected to get so I can&#x27;t really complain.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very fast, just a few days after I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR &#x3D; Generally described, the plastic is cheap and the bristles will loosen easily but a brush is a brush and for the price and how fast it got here, it&#x27;s alright, as long as you use it carefully.</li>
    <li> I got this cause i have a wig that has been tangled longer than i can remember. It did its job</li>
    <li> For how cheap this is you should get it. If you like to wear wigs for cons, cosplay, fun, etc. then invest in a wig brush. I wish I had sooner. I have a 30 inch curly purple synthetic wig and although it&#x27;s gorgeous after one wear it got majorly tangled. I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my day to day hairbrush so I bought this and it worked like a charm. That wig has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Normal wire brush! great for finishing. :)</li>
    <li> My wig brush came in red. It doesn&#x27;t pull tightly on real hair or synthetic hair. I use it on both my wig and my real hair. This makes styling easy and was utter necessity with my first wig which i received yesterday. I bought a very long wig and those tend to tangle. But thanks to this brush i was able to fully take care of my wig. I still am not sure if it breaks down easily, because mine seems pretty sturdy. The only problem was that there were problems with the shipping. It ended up in Los Angeles, CA and i live cross-country. I immediately called Amazon Customer Service and they provided the best care and were able to fix my situation by contacting the seller themselves. All-in-all it was worth the small extra wait.</li>
    <li> Works well, no complaints. The wires bend when snagged on a knot in my wigs, so they easily come free without tearing my wigs.. Good.</li>
    <li> Its great for the price but its a little harsh for wigs. Other than that it is a good little brush</li>
    <li> Came in a little late and was not in very good quality. It was really small and broke after some gentle use.</li>
    <li> Works for my purposes!</li>
    <li> Nice simple wig comb. It has loose teeth though but it does the job. Just don&#x27;t be extra rough with it.</li>
    <li> Fell apart upon first use, but 5 stars for quick customer service.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, sturdy and works wonderful on my winter wig.  Fluffs and de tangles my wig, I get so many compliments on my hair it&#x27;s fantastic.  I&#x27;ve started using it on my real hair and it fluffs it too.  Really can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> Shipped right away and got to me within a week. It&#x27;s really light and easy to use! This is perfect for getting tangles out of wigs!</li>
    <li> This brush is pretty good. I was expecting the wires to be a bit more stiff and was slightly dissapointed to find out how much they move around (if that makes any sense). The brush gets the job done though. I personally use it to brush out my wigs and it does just fine, but when it comes to more difficult knots I find myself turning to use a wire dog comb I have.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig brush; it does what it says it does. It isn&#x27;t meant for your hair, but I guess it can be used if you don&#x27;t have a sensitive scalp like me. Now I won&#x27;t have to worry about a tangled ratty cosplay wig!! :D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great wig brush but the only problem I have with it is the bristles r not as stiff as I thought they would be but still it takes all the tangles out with ease</li>
    <li> its a brush, it brushes hair both real and fake. it does its job of untangling unruly locks. and its blue.&lt;br /&gt;(meeting word count)</li>
    <li> great and works very effectivly if your ooking for a wig brush heres a great cheap one</li>
    <li> I love this little brush.</li>
    <li> The styling of my hair has been made easier thanks to this.</li>
    <li> The bristles are a little more flimsy than a regular brush, however, this assists you in not damaging the wig you&#x27;ve been using it on. It&#x27;s somewhat sharp, so I don&#x27;t recommend using this on your head, though it does do that just fine as well. Perfect, and you&#x27;re in no need to spend anymore money a wig brush.</li>
    <li> Works great for my wigs! It isn&#x27;t harsh on the fibers and it detangles like a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Mine came in black. Interestingly, other reviewers got different colors! Not like it matters haha.</li>
    <li> I love this! it arrived on time! Its very good for wigs and extensions, its sturdy and cushioned under the wires! Highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I use my regular round rubber brush on it.</li>
    <li> When combing one of my wigs to get a few stray knots out the bottom part of the brush broke. That isn&#x27;t very bad, considering it could have been my fault. It is a thin part of the brush and I might have been holing it too tightly. The actual brush part works fantastically, though! It gets the knots out of the wig without damaging the wig.&lt;br /&gt; My only complaint is that it is a different colour than the picture. It is red instead of blue, why is that?</li>
    <li> It does what it is suppose to do. Brush wigs. Took about 3 weeks to get here. Thats the reason for 4 stars</li>
    <li> This was great. First of all, it got to my doorstep early. Instead of getting it on July 31st, I got it on July 25th. When it came in the mail, I was surprised but super happy. I had been waiting for something like this to see if it was so magical to brush Maticuss Wreck out. (You&#x27;ll read about that later.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up and I clearly didn&#x27;t know how thick three rows of bristles were. It was a super skinny brush and at first, I was debating about returning it but I decided to test it out anyway. It brushed out two of my wigs beautifully, giving them a great texture to them. I then decided to use it on my own head. The bristles were sharp but I was careful and made my hair feel and look very silky. Next, I decided to try it on one of my worst wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have to tell you, this wig is SOOO bad, I even made a nickname for it: Maticuss Wreck. I named it that because it mats and it has made me cuss when trying to untangle it. My normal hairbrushes can&#x27;t get this so I tried it out. After a hard battle for almost two hours, the wig was almost completely brushed. On one side, it looked very smooth and on the other, it looked very frizzy. I still have many mats but this was so awesome! I could never have wished for a better brush! Even after Maticuss, none of the bristles were missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this day, I still use my brush. A downside to this is that this brush doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s made for brushing wet hair. You&#x27;re better with using a typical hairbrush than this one. However, that really doesn&#x27;t get to me. As long as it gets rid of my dry mats, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this brush didn&#x27;t come in blue. It came in more of a red, kinda like they Crayola color pencil red. I personally find it a very pretty shade of red and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 I do recommend.</li>
    <li> Brush works wonderful after applying gorilla glue underneath the brush teeth so that it doesn&#x27;t slip out anymore.</li>
    <li> Bristles come out and petty crappy. But it works at least</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews saying that this broke easily. It got here within a couple days and hasn&#x27;t broken so far! It unsnarled all my wigs and works great. If you have a wig I&#x27;d highly recommend getting this brush</li>
    <li> Good little brush for the price but mine was missing a couple of the plastic coated tips on the wire. It should still work ok though.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush for both real hair and wigs. It took a little more hair out of my wig than i would have liked but over all pretty good.</li>
    <li> did not like at all britles are flimsy even for wigs</li>
    <li> Bought the brush for my long cosplay wigs. Works very well but it came damaged. The wired bristles were in every direction but right. I had to take my time and put them back in to place. Other then that it&#x27;s cheap nice brush for wigs.</li>
    <li> A super sturdy brush for my wig!</li>
    <li> The brush itself is a very decent product but because it was packaged in a flat envelope instead of a boxwhen I received mine it was broken into piecestherefore I am quite dissatisfied with it all</li>
    <li> Best tool for wigs. I got one for home &amp; one for my purse.</li>
    <li> works good im glad i bought it my wigs were starting to look like a rat lived in them</li>
    <li> Bought for a doll brush. Kinda small and the wires kept being pushed inward. It was a cheap price to help get the job done.</li>
    <li> The rubber part with the bristles pops out at times, but for wig care this type of brush is a necessity.</li>
    <li> Wow it got here on time and everything. My brush is a lilac purple as opposed to the blue that is in the picture. But since it doesnt affect the quality of the item its fine</li>
    <li> works pretty good. its not too bad :D</li>
    <li> My only problem was the actual bristles kept falling out.</li>
    <li> This brush saved my wigs.</li>
    <li> Its perfect for untangling wigs. Love it~!</li>
    <li> Very nice! I like it a lot</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and a great value&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Bought this for &amp;#34;American girl&amp;#34; type doll. It is a wig brush but works super well for doll hair. It was less expensive than the brush American Girl sells. I would recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> Good brush for the price</li>
    <li> Good for styling your wigs.</li>
    <li> Impressed by the fast delivery. ♥ And works well with my wigs so im happy~!</li>
    <li> Using this for my cosplay wigs definitely helped me out a ton. It&#x27;s handy and can fit in your bag just in case you need it on the spot. Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would break easily so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> arrived broken in half, was not worth sending it back</li>
    <li> Awesome brush,brushes the wig easily and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out</li>
    <li> Its really easy to brush through real hair and wigs, but the bristle things do kinda bent a little. Its pretty good though!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my cosplay wigs and was greatly disappointed! The first time I tried to brush it through, it came apart! It looked like it was put together with children&#x27;s glue.</li>
    <li> Great for brushing my bangs!</li>
    <li> got here REALLY early wasnt expecting it for another week. its a REALLY good price</li>
    <li> This brush came packaged well, and worked well on my natural hair and my wig. The only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s not made very well... The brush itself is in two pieces, the main part and the back. If you hit a rough spot, the pieces close to the end may separate like mine did. Granted, it hasn&#x27;t BROKEN, I just need to superglue the ends back together. And also, yes, the bristles are a little sharp, but I have a sensitive scalp and it didn&#x27;t hurt me at all, just be gentle when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came in red, what&#x27;s up with that? (Not that I mind!)</li>
    <li> Good for synthetic wigs but after a month the teeth started separating from brush and bending this way less than most so it is cheaply made..in this case u get want u paid..i remember shipping was good it arrived a week after i ordered it</li>
    <li> Pictured blue, received red. Doesn&#x27;t matter to me just advising.</li>
    <li> I  came pretty fast, and works really really well :3 I highly recommend to use. Expecially if you have those pesty long wigs.</li>
    <li> I should have gone with a bit more of an expensive brush. This one, as soon as it hits a tangle in my wig, the rubber pops out from the plastic handle and I have to force it back in to be able to use it. It&#x27;s more of a hassle than a help really.</li>
    <li> It falls apart real easy and it&#x27;s cheap feeling wouldn&#x27;t waste your money. It works good for wigs althrough I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is very simple. This is a good quality wire brush. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything other than wigs though, as the bristle&#x27;s are sharp! Arrived in good time.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT LIL BRUSH TO HAVE ON HAND.</li>
    <li> The only part I don&#x27;t like is that the end breaks easily but, it is better than an actually hair brush (for wigs anyways).</li>
    <li> The recorder has clear sound  and is uncomplicated for seniors like me. I really like the little recorder.lt saves me time by recording  my market list.</li>
    <li> Great for synthetic hair!!</li>
    <li> Actually came in black to my surprise haha. But works great on my cosplay wigs. The pins sink in sometimes</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly what was needed. It fit perfect in my purse without being bulky. It actually reduces excess shedding and works great on wig kinks.</li>
    <li> It arrived two days before the delivery estimate datez but when I opened it, the brush was broken at the bottom.</li>
    <li> i use the brush on my real hair and it works really well. easy to clean and great price for the brush.</li>
    <li> Love my brush broke on the first day it broke with my using it on my wig.&lt;br /&gt;But before I knew it they sent me a other one.</li>
    <li> Was cute nice and pretty but I almost got a red one of a brush like this but got this because it was blue it arrived the color black.</li>
    <li> As soon as I started to use it, the bristles started to come up from the brush. If you don&#x27;t mind pushing them back down into the comb, then it&#x27;s fine but it&#x27;s annoying. It does do a good job brushing, just comes loose after use.</li>
    <li> I had a very tangled wig that had been sitting in my room for months on end.It was my favorite, and how tangled and ratty it looked made me not wear it at all. I bought this and smoothed out the kinks and tangles, and it look better then I expected it to.</li>
    <li> Product look exactly like photo.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Love It .. Gets All The Tangles Out My Wigs!!</li>
    <li> Broke after a few uses</li>
    <li> Nice should have come with comb as well.</li>
    <li> Is a decent brush, but the inner pad thing came out entirely, and continues to do so every time I use it.</li>
    <li> The brush part comes out of the plastic part every 3 brushes which is probably an easy fix if I glue it but I&#x27;m lazy.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The bristles are extremely flimsy, but it works okay with my wig.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a year now and it just broke. So for the price great quality! Lasted a long time with regular use.</li>
    <li> I was about to throw out this wig until I received this brush! During chemo I needed a wig, my co-workers chipped in and helped me get it, later I began to notice how matted up the back underside would get everyday!  It formed knots from nothing, and they were difficult to get out.  After washing it once I pulled hair out of it trying to undo knots, I tried round brushes, normal brushes, a pick - nothing worked like this 3-Row Wire Bristle Hair brush - it works like a charm without pulling hair out!  Yay!  I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> pulled most of the hair out of my wig...</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. The recipient loves it though</li>
