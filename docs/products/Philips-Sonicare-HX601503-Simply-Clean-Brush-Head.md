### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect product and the price is always better on Amazon!</li>
      <li>These are a great value compared to purchasing them anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>Great buy at a great price</li>
      <li>Love this toothbrush but need to buy heads for it throughout the year, and Amazon again seemed to have the best price around.  </li>
      <li>Good price, good product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit nice and snug on my Philips  Sonicare holder, but it stays on, that&#x27;s what counts, and the price is very good!</li>
      <li>Much better than the knock-offs I tried.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing is to have extras.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise they&#x27;re okay.</li>
      <li>They function as they should and do not break and pop off easily like some brush heads I&#x27;ve purchased online.</li>
      <li>Fit well.  </li>
      <li>These fit my system.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing like the original.</li>
      <li>I wish that all products would become more reasonable.</li>
      <li>The right product for the right price!</li>
      <li>I tried a few of the newer versions that claim to do great things</li>
      <li>First one I used seemed to become dislodged from my Soicare after just about a month of use</li>
      <li>Overall though, love this toothbrush and like these toothbrush heads.  </li>
      <li>It cannot be that much to make these.</li>
      <li>but they all felt much rougher</li>
      <li>Gentle on the gums and quality built</li>
      <li>I think the mark up price is ridiculously high though.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything on the packaging that said if they were soft or super soft brush tips, so that is my only gripe on this, as when the brushes are first being used they seems to be a bit stiffer and harder than what you would expect from a new toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>They seem like they should work without any problem and they cost quite a bit less than most other places.</li>
      <li>These snap on tight and the brushes last so much longer than the off brand.</li>

    <li> Never buying the off brand again</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad batch? These have stray bristle strands that were not cut and are longer than the rest. You wouldn&#x27;t think one or two longer strands would be an issue, but I could feel it when I brushed. Otherwise they&#x27;re okay.</li>
    <li> Saved a ton of money getting these off Amazon, almost about 1/3 of the price if I remember compared to Target and Walmart.  Love this toothbrush but need to buy heads for it throughout the year, and Amazon again seemed to have the best price around.  The heads seem a little stiffer or harder than my past Sonicare brushes, but nothing that won&#x27;t keep me from brushing.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything on the packaging that said if they were soft or super soft brush tips, so that is my only gripe on this, as when the brushes are first being used they seems to be a bit stiffer and harder than what you would expect from a new toothbrush.  Overall though, love this toothbrush and like these toothbrush heads.  When the time comes again to buy another package, my guess is I&#x27;ll be making this purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of these already and have no complaints. They seem like they should work without any problem and they cost quite a bit less than most other places. First one I used seemed to become dislodged from my Soicare after just about a month of use but I haven&#x27;t had the same problem since.</li>
    <li> Much better than the knock-offs I tried.</li>
    <li> These fit my system.  My favorite thing is to have extras.  I think the mark up price is ridiculously high though. It cannot be that much to make these. I wish that all products would become more reasonable.</li>

    <li> These are the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; head for the Sonicare elite.  I tried a few of the newer versions that claim to do great things but they all felt much rougher and I didn&#x27;t like them.  Sticking with these from now on.</li>
    <li> Great buy at a great price</li>
    <li> Fit well.  Great price.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit nice and snug on my Philips  Sonicare holder, but it stays on, that&#x27;s what counts, and the price is very good!</li>
    <li> Gentle on the gums and quality built</li>
    <li> Perfect product and the price is always better on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Good price, good product.</li>
    <li> What a F--king Brush Head !!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like the original. These snap on tight and the brushes last so much longer than the off brand.</li>
