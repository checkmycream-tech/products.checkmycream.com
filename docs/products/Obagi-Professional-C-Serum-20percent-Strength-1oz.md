    <li> Great stuff😀 Amazon is quick to deliver. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I love it !  Great stuff  I get compliments on my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it and I am 51 years old .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time and have no idea if it really helps, but I&#x27;ve been told by a number of sources that it does.&lt;br /&gt;anne</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome if your skin is blotchy.  It really evens out your skin tone and texture fast.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. Its great for your skin. Will continue to use and purchase. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I swear by it!</li>
    <li> It does a wonderful job of nourishing your skin &amp; makes it glow. Use regularly.</li>
    <li> I have used Obagi 20% C-Serum for years. I love how it makes my skin look and feel!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel and look like silk.  The color and feel changed within days.  Love this serum!  I use it along with all the other facial products and sun screen.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Obagi 15% for a few months &amp; loved it &amp; had no problems with sensitivity. After seeing great results of disappearing age spots, renewal of sun damaged skin &amp; wrinkle smoothing I decided to move up to the Obagi 20%. I have only used for 2 days &amp; have seen even better results. Please take note I do not have sensitive skin. I started with the 10% and gradually moved to a stronger %. I trust the company I purchased this from because the serum comes exactly as discribed. I have recommended this product &amp; seller to family &amp; friends with confidence. I&#x27;m 61 &amp; spent years in the sun and this product has absolutely  improved my skin! Make sure to wear sunscreen when using this product in the morning!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Arrived in excellent condition.  It makes a big difference in healthy skincare and a must on my list.</li>
    <li> I started using Obagi Professional C Serum 20% about 2 years ago.  My first compliment came from a much younger family member soon after I started this product.  That&#x27;s when I began paying more attention to my skin.  I noticed fewer lines and my skin looked so much healthier. I won&#x27;t go without it now.  As soon as I&#x27;m half way finished, I order another bottle.  When you&#x27;re in your 60&#x27;s and find a product that works, get it!</li>
    <li> It dried out my skin so badly after one week.  I had to stop using it.  I would like to return this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 years now and I do notice a difference in my facial skin. I usually wash with an exfoliant and then apply this to a clean face. It absorbs quickly and smells nice. I wish that I could say that it took &amp;#34;years&amp;#34; off of my face, but I do not think so. Maybe my skin would have been worse if I did not use it. I am going to continue to use it regardless because I like it.</li>
    <li> The Obagi C burns my face.  I have been using this product for 4  years and love it.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a knock off product or what the problem stems from.  I won&#x27;t be ordering from Amazon for this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It really makes a difference if used as instructed.</li>
    <li> I use this for more than 3 years. I like it very much!</li>
    <li> Used it for years. Makes your skin feel soft and looks good. Love it.</li>
    <li> Came imediately..very pleased..thanks</li>
    <li> Been using the serum for a while and very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I can tell such a difference when I use this product with fidelity.  The investment is worth the glowing skin you have after you have used it for a while.  I highly recommend it.  It was recommended to me by a cousin who is an RN in a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Excellent price!  I had stopped using this because it was so expensive.  I was happy to find it here on Amazon for a much more affordable price.</li>
    <li> While not as potent as other serums I&#x27;ve tried, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it going rancid on you.</li>
    <li> This really works well, I put this on before I put on my face lotion and it helps it to absorb and work better. This little jar isn&#x27;t even half way gone and I have had it for 3 months.</li>
    <li> I heard a well known TV show doctor recommend Vitamin C serum for the face, although he did not endorse any certain product, I found this at my dermatologist for double the price.  I decided to look online to see if I could find it cheaper.  Amazon came through!  I use it am and pm.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to remark about long term results, but it feels like it&#x27;s tightening my skin.  I use moisturizer on top of it, too.</li>
    <li> love this product. thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using 20% Obagi C serum for close to a year. I&#x27;ve started with 10% then 15% and my skin got accustomed to that level and I moved up to the max - 20%. It&#x27;s working fantastically even yet. If you&#x27;ve not used the Obagi C line before, I would recommend starting with the 10% and working up when results begin to fade.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the real product.</li>
    <li> I think it has dramatically helped by skin.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and the price is great....paid twice this much at Plastic Surgeon&#x27;s Office - will purchase again</li>
    <li> I am exceedingly pleased with this product. By using Retin A and the Obagi serum, the texture of my face is continually transformed.</li>
    <li> I love this product its my third time buying it, my face looks great!!</li>
    <li> Kind of itchy after i</li>
    <li> I was getting from my dr. office. But the last bottle did not seem to help. And the C was already yellow.&lt;br /&gt;This was clear!!!!  I really love the price. Thanks for fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This product is one that I use all the time. The product is greasy, not the true &amp;#34;OBAGI&amp;#34; 20% serum product.</li>
    <li> Arrived even earlier than expected! Great product!</li>
