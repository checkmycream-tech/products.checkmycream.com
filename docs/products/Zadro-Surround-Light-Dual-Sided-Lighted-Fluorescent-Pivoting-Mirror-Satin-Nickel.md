      <li>Zadro Surround Light Dual Sided Lighted Fluorescent Pivoting Mirror, Satin...</li>
      <li>I am so happy that I found this because I use daily all time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This design had become available after my purchase, so I</li>
      <li>I like the light and the 10X or 12X</li>
      <li>I had bought a cheap lit makeup mirror, and found that it while it did the job, there was room for improvement.  </li>
      <li>Light stops working after 1 year.</li>
      <li>The seller was also very proactive to make sure I was satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Also, the light is super strong and adjustable.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!,,,</li>
      <li>She was very surprised and loved it right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>I love this mirror, it does cost more, but I know that after buying a \\&quot;make do\\&quot; mirror eventually I would have bought this one in the end anyway, so no wasted money in this regard.</li>
      <li>The center mirror is great and</li>
      <li>It was very packed to safe shipping.</li>
      <li>As is, I keep thinking about how much I paid for it :).</li>
      <li>Good look trying to incline it to the front, it won&#x27;t stay, will bend back again.</li>
      <li>Wife loved it, was a present for birthday !!!</li>
      <li>This is really a full 5 star product</li>
      <li>it is exactly what she needed!</li>
      <li>Magnificaiton is a little too magnified, but it works great.  </li>
      <li>Been looking for a mirror like this that is large enough and lighting is good.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey but we&#x27;ll worth it</li>
      <li>Spendy but worth it.</li>
      <li>but you get your moneys worth.</li>
      <li>The died mirrors have not proved very useful, but I like the mirror so much, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
      <li>It took a little getting used to because it is very close, but now I LOVE it!!  </li>
      <li>Really does the job!</li>
      <li>It looks so pretty on my vanity.  </li>
      <li>the magnification is more than enough.  </li>
      <li>You get what you paid for here, and it is very well worth</li>
      <li>I use the regular mirror for most make-up and the amplified side for eyes.</li>
      <li>Today I finished using it for the first time</li>
      <li>I bought an extra bulb for it based on some other reviews that i read, but so far it&#x27;s working great for her!  </li>
      <li>and I most definitely recommend this product very highly.</li>
      <li>The mirror, as a whole, is more substantial and solid.  </li>
      <li>I looked at the ones in the box stores, I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but it did narrow down what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It is well-made, pleasant to use, and works for most of the things you might think of in terms of doing make-up or drying one&#x27;s hair, although it is a bit tricky to see the back part of your head, because the left and right \\&quot;wings\\&quot; of the mirror are relatively small (well, it is a table mirror, after all).</li>
      <li>The 10X magnification is too much for me.  </li>
      <li>she really wanted something she could use to do her makeup and eyebrows,</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s very helpful seeing the sides of your face while applying makeup.  </li>
      <li>and they really allow you to see the sides of your face.</li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey, but the 10x/1x magnification is GREAT, particularly if your vision has decreased a bit, if you wear eye make-up or contact lenses.  </li>
      <li>the price - highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this mirror, worth every cent.  </li>
      <li>They sent out a &#x27;new&#x27; one.  </li>
      <li>Same exact issue.  </li>
      <li>But at the same time She is scared of it because of the 10x you can see everything especially the lil marks..its a lil pricey but worth every penny</li>
      <li>The mirror is flexible, but it bends easily to the back, because is heavy.</li>
      <li>but no other one I have owned</li>
      <li>Side mirrors are kind of useless, but i&#x27;d rather have them on the mirror than not.  </li>
      <li>the lighting, as always is superb, but the side mirrors are worthless because the center mirror is not designed to pivot vertically.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This mirror is huge and you&#x27;ll see more than you probably want to! Make sure you have a spacious area to put the mirror on...the magnification is more than enough.  It is a real mirror, not the inexpensive kind with the cheap film over metal.  Really does the job!</li>
    <li> Been looking for a mirror like this that is large enough and lighting is good.  This fit the bill for sure!</li>
    <li> I had another Zadro mirror that broke (it fell and broke).  This design had become available after my purchase, so I this time I had the opportunity to buy this model.  It&#x27;s great.  The mirror, as a whole, is more substantial and solid.  The dimmable feature is super, and the side mirrors are a great feature.  It is a bit pricey, but the 10x/1x magnification is GREAT, particularly if your vision has decreased a bit, if you wear eye make-up or contact lenses.  I&#x27;m happy I made this choice.</li>
    <li> The 10X magnification is too much for me.  By the time I get close enough that I&#x27;m not blurry or upside down, I can&#x27;t use my makeup brush.  I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> This mirror works for me. I use the regular mirror for most make-up and the amplified side for eyes. The died mirrors have not proved very useful, but I like the mirror so much, I don&#x27;t care. The light is very bright and doesn&#x27;t glare at all.</li>
    <li> I had bought a cheap lit makeup mirror, and found that it while it did the job, there was room for improvement.  This mirror is it!  Adjustable lighting, side panels for a good profile view, and folds up for easy storage.  Definitely worth the money!,,,</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife.  She was very surprised and loved it right out of the box.  Uses everyday.  Recommend for husbands to buy for their wives.  They&#x27;ll love you even more.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she just loves it!  I bought an extra bulb for it based on some other reviews that i read, but so far it&#x27;s working great for her!  she really wanted something she could use to do her makeup and eyebrows, etc since she is a student and trying to save money.  She raves about this mirror for everything it does for her, including all the money she&#x27;s saving!</li>
    <li> Piece of junk. Ordered one and every time the mirror was flipped up or moved, the light went out.  Sent it back to the manufacturer.  They sent out a &#x27;new&#x27; one.  Same exact issue.  My wife clicks the thing on and off 50 times a morning to get it to work, if it does at all.  I&#x27;m getting her another mirror this Christmas, and taking that one behind the shed for the beat down.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror and wanted to use it for a while before reviewing it.  This mirror is wonderful, the lighting is true and I am able to do my makeup so much easier with the 10x magnification.  It took a little getting used to because it is very close, but now I LOVE it!!  The side mirrors make it very easy to apply blush and bronzer.  I would definitely recommend this mirror, worth every cent.  The seller was also very proactive to make sure I was satisfied.  I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many smaller or trifold mirrors to apply makeup and this is by far the best makeup mirror.  Magnificaiton is a little too magnified, but it works great.  Side mirrors are kind of useless, but i&#x27;d rather have them on the mirror than not.  The mirror folds up nicely on my makeup counter so I dont have to hide it.  Shipping was quick! Think I received product the next day!.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken. Ok lighting but not what I had in mind</li>
    <li> Light stops working after 1 year.</li>
    <li> This well lit magnifying mirror is of excellent quality with no distortion and it has very useful side mirrors for seeing your profile from both sides. It was very packed to safe shipping. You get what you paid for here, and it is very well worth the price - highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> It is an expensive mirror. The other day I saw in Costco a similar mirror for only $20!!! I paid around 80 for this one...The mirror is flexible, but it bends easily to the back, because is heavy. Good look trying to incline it to the front, it won&#x27;t stay, will bend back again. I like the light and the 10X or 12X it has... side mirrors are regular.</li>
    <li> This mirror seems to be very expensive to me, but I must admit I do not have any complaints. It is well-made, pleasant to use, and works for most of the things you might think of in terms of doing make-up or drying one&#x27;s hair, although it is a bit tricky to see the back part of your head, because the left and right \\&quot;wings\\&quot; of the mirror are relatively small (well, it is a table mirror, after all). You can trick it into showing you the back part, is the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom line is I would be perfectly happy with the mirror had it been under $100. As is, I keep thinking about how much I paid for it :).</li>
    <li> I hesitated to purchase mirror because of limited 90 day warranty. Regardless of that. I have really enjoyed the mirror . The adjustable height was vey important. The sides were not as important but they really come in handy for blush placement. Great product. I would definitely say buy it if your looking for 10x mirror.</li>
    <li> Best on the market . Spendy but worth it. Elegant mirror. I can put on makeup with no problem seeing.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love it.  The lighting is very good, the magnification is incredible, &amp; the side mirrors are an added bonus. Do not even worry about the cost, it is more than worth it. I have bought &amp; used the box store brands for years &amp; I wish I had known about this years ago, it would have saved me a lot of money. The quality of the stand is very nice.  I love how the lighted mirror is able to be closed up when not in use and the side mirrors pulled in - giving a very nice image sitting on the dressing table. This is really a full 5 star product and I most definitely recommend this product very highly.</li>
    <li> As a bifocal ridden woman I couldn&#x27;t see to put on my make up. I complained to my optometrist and he told me to get a 5x make up mirror. I looked at the ones in the box stores, I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but it did narrow down what I wanted. I saw this mirror and knew it was the one. I broke down and bought it, it came today and oh my ... it is so nice and I was shocked at what I missed when I was putting on my make up. Today I finished using it for the first time and it was like the difference between night and day in the job I did. I love this mirror, it does cost more, but I know that after buying a \\&quot;make do\\&quot; mirror eventually I would have bought this one in the end anyway, so no wasted money in this regard.</li>
    <li> This mirror is top of the line. Extremely convenient with the outlet on the base. The light is super bright and the finish is beautiful. Pricey but you get your moneys worth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Zadro mirrors but this one has a huge design problem.  The center mirror is great and the lighting, as always is superb, but the side mirrors are worthless because the center mirror is not designed to pivot vertically.  I&#x27;ve had other tri-view mirrors that pivot vertically and they really allow you to see the sides of your face. Sadly this one does not.  I hope that Zadro will eventually realize this and will make a design change. They&#x27;ll have a winner on this one if they do.</li>
    <li> wow pricey but great...Zadro Surround Light Dual Sided Lighted Fluorescent Pivoting Mirror, Satin...over a hundred bucks but no other one I have owned has ever compared to this one good investment.</li>
    <li> If you are contemplating buying this -- do it!!!! This mirror is wonderful.  The best mirror I&#x27;ve owned by far. It is huge, sturdy and well made.  And it&#x27;s very helpful seeing the sides of your face while applying makeup.  Also, the light is super strong and adjustable.  It looks so pretty on my vanity.  One of my favorite purchases in a while!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife....what would a man do with a makeup mirror? She was impressed by this mirror...it is exactly what she needed!</li>
    <li> This is great one to keep. I am so happy that I found this because I use daily all time.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find this quality for wall mounting mirror with extend arm.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful and sturdy.  The magnification side is hardcore though.  I can&#x27;t use it too long without it messing with my eyes.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll see things in this mirror that will scare you! It&#x27;s the best mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s pricey but we&#x27;ll worth it, I&#x27;ve had several mirrors and none compare to this one!</li>
    <li> Wife loved it, was a present for birthday !!!</li>
    <li> got this for my fiance..she loves it with the control lighting and with the side mirrors. But at the same time She is scared of it because of the 10x you can see everything especially the lil marks..its a lil pricey but worth every penny</li>
