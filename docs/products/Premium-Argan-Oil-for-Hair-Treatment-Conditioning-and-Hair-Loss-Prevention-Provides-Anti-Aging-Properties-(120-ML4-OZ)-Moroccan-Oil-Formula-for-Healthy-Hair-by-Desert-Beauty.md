<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very excited to use this product but whem i got it the whole bottle had leaked out in the package and got all over my other items shipped. I was very disappointed i was dying to try this.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. It makes my hair soft and shiny. I also have seen growth in my hair.</li>
    <li> Fabulous hair with this product.</li>
    <li> This is much different than any morrocan oil I&#x27;ve tried in the past. A little goes a ling way. It really moisturizes the ends of you hair and makes it feel super soft. I have naturally fine and wavy hair and this leaves it feeling silky with out feeling heavy or oily. I feel like I have finally found the product that will help protect my ends and leave my hair looking great! I did receive a discount of the list price, thank you!</li>
    <li> i love this product. I&#x27;ve used different argan oils before and this one is by far the best</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great, and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> I  love this. This is the best product I&#x27;ve bought so far from amazon.  This product is thick and  rich in texture but does not weigh down your hair.  If you are african  American and you are transitioning from a big chop, this is the product to use. It grows your hair and stops breakage.  It also has a decent  smells. Love it</li>
    <li> Great smell &amp; leaves hair soft.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I did receive a discount on my purchase for this review.</li>
    <li> Iv always used this stuff but I really enjoy this brand.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! Bought this as a gift for my GF and she just loves it, i can actually see the shine and the difference from before and after she uses the oil, and i am a typical man so... :)&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Absolutely excited about this product! Thank you.</li>
    <li> So far I am not impressed with this product. No appreciative difference!</li>
    <li> Once again I have snagged a winner! T left this one overnight, washed my hair in the morning and didn&#x27;t need any conditioner to take the FlyAway&#x27;s or coarseness of that creeping Greg hair! Does double duty as a moisturizer on my neck and stubborn wrinkles. I snagged this at a reduced price....lucky me!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and it&#x27;s an amazing  products!!</li>
    <li> Works excellant on my hair. Leaves it feeling smooth and looking shiny</li>
    <li> I love this oil the smell is pleasant as well. My hair has grown a little as well plus I mix it in my shampoo to enter my hair shaft then close them up with my conditioner. You should buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this before but always heard great things I had to try it myself... After only a few uses I feel my hair feeling softer. I&#x27;m loving this product my hair is loving it toO</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down like it so far</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product so far. It smells great and my hair has been so soft and silky. At first I was reluctant about putting an oil in my hair but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily at all.</li>
    <li> Used this on my cousin. She has straw like hair and it make it visibly smoother and it felt smooth as well. I&#x27;m sure after a few uses, she will have silky smooth hair for sure! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Received my Desrets Virgin Argan Oil and I love it! The Bottle has a squeezable lid so you can squeeze the right amount of oil you want. My hair is so soft and healthy and I can see where it&#x27;s definetly  helping my dry scalp to. My daughters have been using it up to and love how soft it makes their hair and it easy for them to comb</li>
    <li> LOVE argan oil! Does wonders for my color treated hair! Also a pretty good price and size compared to those I&#x27;ve seen in salons and drug stores :)</li>
    <li> Having a thyroid issue my hair stay dry.  I washed my hair and placed this oil on my hair and for the first time it didn&#x27;t  look dry and brittle.  This oil is amazing just after one use. I was offered this product at a reduced price however,  this is a unbiased  review and it is solely based upon my usage of the Desert  Beauty&#x27;s Moroccan Organic Argan Oil. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this as a discounted product and I can&#x27;t be more than happy I got this. As soon as I started using it, I already feel the difference in my hair. It&#x27;s smoother and silkier. I don&#x27;t get tangles after showering anymore. I really like how it has improved my hair&#x27;s quality. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! It has a mild, pleasant scent to it and it&#x27;s weightless. Compared to other oils I have used on my hair, this oil is is the best. My hair is shiny, moisturized, and smells great every time I use Desert Beauty Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! I got this for my daughter to try. She has a medical condition that dries her hair &amp; skin, this product has made a big difference in only a few use, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Makes my hair look and feel amazing</li>
    <li> I really like this product it makes my hair feel so soft and silky. I would definitley recommend it to someone with damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair very silky. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great! And doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy at all</li>
    <li> So far, this product has worked really well. My hair is soft, shiny, and feels healthy, and it smells great.  Also love that it&#x27;s all natural with no chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have long hair already, but it falls out in clumps.. this is perfect</li>
    <li> I recieved my Argan Oil in just a couple days after ordering and am in love with the product! I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I am sure glad I purchased it. I love how it smells and how it makes my hair smooth and shinny! My hair just seems healthier when I use it. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This has to be placed on dry clean hair to work. But it really hydrates your scalp and has a very nice aroma to it. It&#x27;s not overpowering scent but pleasant. It also helps your ends from breakage and makes your hair look very soft and smooth. I found that after a week or so using it my hair was less tangled and I had less hair falling out. My hair looked more healthier than usual. My hair also didn&#x27;t look so faded from all the shampoo I&#x27;ve been using for dandruff. Technically now it almost doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. It&#x27;s a great product I would definitely recommend to stressed mothers around the globe. Try it. You will definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This oil is very nice because it was not \\&quot;oily\\&quot; LOL.... I know it makes no sense, but when I use it on my hair it is not weighing down my hair or making it look wet to thick and oily. The oil smells great. It&#x27;s a good size, it&#x27;s lasted me a long time and it makes my hair look and feel more healthy. It takes away frizz. Very simply, it does what it says. I was concerned with the smell, but that was very natural as well.  Definitely a recommended product, the manufacturers sent it to me to test and review and I it has become my \\&quot;staple\\&quot; in hair care because if I don&#x27;t have time for blowdrying my hair thoroughly, I use this and my hair is not out of control.</li>
    <li> I had to give it to a friend as it was a bit heavy for my hair. I think would be great for ethnic hair. Seemed to be well made product and nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product as a deep discount. Normally, this isn&#x27;t something I would have ever thought to try but it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve tried so many &amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34; products that do nothing but the moment I put this in my hair, I knew it was different. A little goes a long way and it took the frizz right out of my hair. It made my hair so silky and smooth. I will definitely be back for more!</li>
    <li> got the product for a gift and they loved it.&lt;br /&gt;arrived fast and the person i gave it to was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great so far!  Can&#x27;t wait to see long term results!</li>
    <li> This product is definitely making my hair grow!</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil!!! This product is amazing!! It makes my hair soft and manageable.  It controls the frizzys also!!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, smells  good and didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome and it smells great. I have curly hair and it works so well in so many ways. Defiantly a must have!</li>
    <li> From using this product, i have noticed my hair become softer, and shiny. Looks to be healthier.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells really nice. Leaves hair very soft and shinny. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so i can&#x27;t say anything about it making the hair grow yet</li>
    <li> goes on smoothly on my hair!</li>
    <li> I received a huge discount to review this product from snag shout and I only paid a dollar! I love this oil it leaves my hair so soft and less frizzy. My hair is super curly and thick and I have never found a product that I love until now I would definitely buy it again!!</li>
    <li> wow im so inlove with this product because it made my hair so shiny without the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; look. I was so excited to try and test it out today and it didn&#x27;t disappoint!! My hair is black and dull, but it made it more shiny and manageable! My husband noticed it too without me pointing out to him. Love it</li>
    <li> Great, I love it. Smells great and feels great, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
    <li> This product stopped my hair from breaking and made it shiny again</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair- and so far after a few days of use, I feel that Deser Beauty&#x27;s Argan Oil has really improved the condition of my hair. The first night I used it- I ran a small amount through my very dry and knotted hair. The result was incredible- I could&#x27;ve just gone out without even brushing my hair. My hair was smoother, had better movement, and looked healthier after the first use! I was a little worried that it would make my hair look greasy- so I tried it at night before bed, but as I said- I could&#x27;ve left the house and looked better than that morning when I had gone to work. I plan to continue to use this product in hopes that it helps me to keep my hair healthy and maybe even provide more body. I am very impressed!</li>
    <li> received  and use immediately, love it</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have greasy hair and this doesn&#x27;t make it anymore greasy and it does leave my hair super soft. I did receive this product for free for my review.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It was a little thicker than I thought it would be but works great. I was trying to find a replacement oil for the expensive oil I use at night and I think I have found it.</li>
    <li> Although this product has argan, jojoba and coconut oils, it&#x27;s first ingredient is CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, which is silicone. The product performs well, smooths the hair cuticle, leaves it soft etc. But if you are expecting 100% oil, this is not the product for you. While cyclopentasiloxane may not be the most toxic additive on the market (EWG rates it a 3), there are plenty of other pure oils out there. If you are not needing a product that is 100% natural however, this would be a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to test it out on my hair as I&#x27;ve been in the market for an oil that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down while also giving it a natural glow. This product didn&#x27;t fail. I have thick course curly hair and used it to add a little shine, by the next morning I still had the shine I wanted along with bounce because my hair just feels so light. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So I have used this for about 2 days now and it has left my hair extremely soft and leaves if heathy looking. I would buy again</li>
    <li> to start off the packaging is so very pretty. Smells amazing and the smell tends to linger in your hair for sometime. I have starte dusing this in my daughters hair which is super long and extremely curly. It has work wonders with all the snarls and frizzies she gets. no more tears from her when brushing her hair :) I do like the fact that it isn&#x27;t an oil that is heavy so won&#x27;t make your hair look greasy or feel weighed down. I did recieve this product for my unbiased opinion and I assure that all thoughts are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something to help with dry ends or to polish you look you have found the perfect solution!! Not only will it leave you hair feeling amazing but it won&#x27;t leave your hair with that greasy feel or look!! Great smelling. You only need to use a small amount it goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> Iv have used it a couple time now and I already see a change. I love it!! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product my hair is super smooth and I only need a tiny bit</li>
    <li> I have to say, I didn´t believe at first that it would be weightless. I was kindof expecting some oily feeling, but since I have been working in extremely cold temperature for a while now, I needed something for my hair. First time I put it on, I was surprised. Not only does it absorb perfectly, but it also instantly gave a feeling of fullness of my hair that I hadn´t felt in quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, one thing that MUST be clarified is that this is not only argan oil. There is also a combination of chemicals and other oils that I didn´t really look into. So far it works so I will give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It really does keep my unruly, frizzy hair under control. I have to experiment what amount to use. Too much and it&#x27;s looking greasy. Too little and my hair looks frizzy like fright night. I like the shine it imparts to my hair. I see less hair shedding because this product helps to untangle my hair after washing it. After straightening my hair out with tools, I needed a wee amount added to my hair to prevent frizz from developing again. I have yet to see hair growth though, since I have only been using this for a week. Also, I have been using other products, such as minoxidil and essential oils that I can&#x27;t truly attribute any hair growth that I will see to this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Light weight!</li>
    <li> I like it so far. The only problems I have are it leaves too much oil on the initial place I touch my hair, and the coloring has to be thoroughly washed off immediately. It does seem to work for the most part.</li>
    <li> I use this to hydrate for my sun kissed skin during the summer as well as to moisturize my face and hair. Works awesome on my dry ends!</li>
    <li> Always use every day, my hair looks shinny &amp; healthtly.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I have been using it in the evenings and have noticed my hair is silky smooth and looks healthier.</li>
    <li> I usually buy the brand from walmart but thought id give this product a try.  It works just as good as the brand from walmart  i use.  When i apply it to my wet hair and then let my hair dry on its own it doesnt look oily it looks healthy, the brand from walmart it looks a little oily.  I gotta love my straightener but this product made it a little frizzy and the walmart brand did not.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a week but like how it makes my hair feel. It is softer and shines. I also put it on my face before I go to bed, my skin feels very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this oil its light, it smells great and a little goes a long way....</li>
    <li> I like the smell, shine, hair looks better. But the hair at the roots look a little greasy. At the moment I did not see hair growth. I use this tool only a couple of weeks. I hope to see better results later. I think more will order this oil.</li>
    <li> Good product and nice customer service</li>
    <li> Pretty good, not oily . Price is cheaper than the one I bought</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle and didn;t notice any growth.  I can say that the oil is light, smells good, and has a great consistency, which means it could be used all over the body.  My hair looked more  groomed and healthier when used.  I just didn&#x27;t see any new hair growth.  I&#x27;d purchase it again though, it gets 5 stars as an every day moisturizer, took a star away because the hair growth properties  weren&#x27;t immediately seen in my situation. I do know that clean, well moisturized hair should eventually facilitate new growth,</li>
    <li> Makes my hair extremely soft to the touch and helps with fly aways. There&#x27;s no oily leftover look at all.</li>
    <li> My hair consists of natural curls and waves. I need something to control my frizz. This is a nice light oil without any heavy scent. I purchased this at a promotional price to evaluate and I am pleasantly surprised. I have tried several Argan oils but most leave my hair dry and greasy looking. A little goes a long way with this. I put a few drops on my finger tips and run through my hair for best results.</li>
    <li> Perfect oil that has a vast variety of uses. You can use it on your hair in a lot of ways. If your hair is dry, you can work it through your ends when they become fried. Drip some into your shampoo or conditioner bottle. Or just pour some into your palm and work through your hair when it&#x27;s wet after a shower. Women can use this as a basic facial treatment, works well at night time morning before you apply makeup. Great for dry cuticles, or any patch of skin that&#x27;s dry. Very nourishing and moisturizing for the skin, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother-in law who loved the smell and what her hair feels like after. The only problem is that she had trouble reading the fine print on the bottle though. Minor problem. Good product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have relaxed hair and sealing my ends after moisturizing I have to seal, a process I learned during research for healthy hair.</li>
    <li> i got this at discounted price. i like it how my hair feel soft and shiny after i blow dry my hair. my daughter use this too..thanks</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! My hair feels so much thicker! 😊</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have fairly thin hair prone to getting oily when I use products, but I still want it to have some sleekness and shine (and less frizz on humid days). So far a  drop of this in my hair does the trick without it getting super oily!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy  I feel my hair soft I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I will never use another argan oil except for this one!! AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!! I have extremely hard water!!! EXTREMELY! And with this my hair is so soft an managlable!! I also have naturally very oily hair! And it does not make my hair oily at all!!! It soaks in instantly! Helps to de tangle!! It&#x27;s just so amazing I can not say enough good things!! My hair looks and feel so amazing! And you only have to use a small amount for your whole head! My hair is down to my waist and about medium thickness and a quarter amount does it!! Great amount for the price!!!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this oil. I have fine, dyed, damaged, Asian hair. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different oils and deep conditioners but they all left my hair looking greasy or it just didn&#x27;t do very much for my hair. My hair usually looks like I got struck by lightening since my split ends and fly aways are always sticking out in every direction, leaving my hair very frizzy. This oil is super light but it leaves your hair feeling and looking nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I shower, I squeeze out about the size of a quarter onto my palm and rub my hands together and run my fingers through my towel dried hair. I then brush my hair with a boar hair brush to spread the oil around. I either air dry or blow dry and then run a little more oil through my hair afterwards to get all the fly aways down. Oh did I mention it smells great too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been so smooth, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments that I haven&#x27;t gotten in years! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I will never use another argan oil except for this one, with this my hair is so soft an managlable, I highly recommend my hair is in love with this, Thank you Amazone.</li>
    <li> Luv it more than the other,  feels great to my hair. Luv the smell of the product. Most definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair oil. I have tried many other hair oil but this one is BEST.My hair can be dry and frizzy. Not with this stuff. I add a little bit - and regardless of weather I dry or leave my hair wet - it looks great - never grease. Smells awesome too. In the higest humidity my hair does not frizz. My hairdresser says my hair is in great contition - despite coloring. Its a very high quality argan oil and the most imporant virgin argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly recommend this product with no reservations.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell much....seems ok but not amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product to leave a review that reflects my true opinion.</li>
    <li> This works great! It smells nice and my hair is so soft after using it.</li>
    <li> Hi guys,  I got this oil for my wife (black African lady), after two days of using it, her scalp itches so much that she is not even being able to use it anymore,  but she loves the smell,  the way it makes the hair soft and all that.&lt;br /&gt;Any idea what to do to avoid the scalp itching that much, or any other oil for hair growth anyone can recommend? Pls help!</li>
    <li> Strong perfume smell and did not help with preventing hairloss</li>
    <li> I love love this product. It makes my hair feel soft. I also love the smell of it when I apply it to my hair</li>
    <li> love it for my 60 + year-old highlighted, dry and lifeless hair. Now hair moves beautifully, not greasy at all. Towel dry hair, a dab of oil, blow dry, gorgeous hair! Skip the blow dry -- still looks great.</li>
    <li> Holy crap this stuff works way to well!!! I havent had a haircut in over 6 months and my ends were starting to look tattered and messy...time for snip right? Well I have been using this oil for about 4 days now and my hair looks amazing!!! split ends are practically gone and it is sooooo smooth.&lt;br /&gt;my hair has always been shiny and straight but with this it looks polished and wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is amazing too :)</li>
    <li> This is a magnificent product!! I cannot express in a few words how good is this oil. My mother has 80 years old and within just one week her brittle hair feels like silk and it is not falling or breaking anymore. I am using it as part of hair growth system I need feels sleek to the touch and easy to apply.  No wonder this product is a five star rated item!!  Another great proof of the quality of this Argan oil is that a little bit goes a long way.  I would recommend to use gloves to apply it to avoid the hands to absorb a percentage of the amount required  I would recommend to use gloves to apply it to avoid the hands to absorb a percentage of the amount needed to make it work..This is a wonderful product and its worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil now for several weeks.  I have slightly curly hair that can become frizzy and dry very easily but this has helped keep it silky and smooth.  It has been nice to rub into my cuticles as well.  I love the smell and am happy with my purchase.  This would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few argan oil products and anything that is argan oil is fantastic for your hair. This product even smells nice- not bad smelling like some of the others I have tried. I love the bottle it comes in. The box is very classy and the presentation is really nice. The stopper idea is great too because I don&#x27;t have to worry about it spilling out over everything before I even open the box. The argan oil comes out brownish color and I apply it as a conditioner after I wash and towel dry my hair. I have even stopped using my regular hair conditioner and am using this Desert Beauty&#x27;s Premium Virgin Argan Oil instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long (below my shoulders) and thin and I get it colored often so it seems even after having it trimmed, my hair still gets split ends fast. It usually looks dry and dull. Now with this argain oil, my hair has come to life again. My hair is so much brighter, healthier and no more frizzies. It also seems to control the split ends. I was asked to test and review this item and give my honest opinion of it. I highly recommend this product for anyone that has hair that needs some help and brightness. I love it!</li>
    <li> I really love this oil. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair Grady and it does have a really nice smell. I put it on after my blow outs and keeps the frizzies away.</li>
    <li> Works great. Great Buy. Makes my hair feel soft. My hair was very dry and damaged. Now after using this my hair looks and feels nice.I would highly recommend this for people  losing and people with dry split ends and damaged hair.The oil can be applied to both dry and damp hair.You only need to put  2-4 drops of oil into the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> This product leaves any hair soft and smooth. I received this today and it just so happens that I had friends over. We had a hair party and tried this. Every one had different hair problems and color. We all were left with amazing hair even after blow drying and curling. I have thin oily hair and I was afraid it would be greasy after but it wasn&#x27;t.  I am definitely going to buy this again since we used a lot out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this product before and i absolutely love it! Leaves my hair soft and silky with no sticky residue!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Omg i can&#x27;t bear the smell of this product, it doesn&#x27;t smell anything close to Argan oil. so the texture is a silicon based like many conditioning  hair products does, it contains lots of good oils like jojoba oil, coconut oil and many more so overall a good conditioning products but not a pure Argan oil only. i received this product at discounted rate for reviewing purpose, these are all my personal opinions. so if guys don&#x27;t mind the smell, then try this conditioning product.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair really soft, nice packaging, would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I have gray hair which I color constantly.  This makes my hair frizzy, coarse and dry. From the first application of the oil my hair is softer with an unbelievable difference in texture. The other night I put it in my damp hair before bed and put my hair in a bun on top of my head with a scrunchie. When I woke up I took the scrunchie out and ran my fingers through my hair. Then I added pea size amount of oil to my hair and scrunched it in just a little. The result was fantastic! I had soft beachy waves and my hair was done for the day! I absolutely love this oil! Another great thing is the way it is packaged. It has a stopper inside so you do not have to worry about the bottle leaking.  Great product for shiny healthy looking hai&#x27;</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! It has helped so much with hair loss and is non greasy. I have very course long hair that I color regularly, this is the only product that has helped.</li>
    <li> Desert Beauty Premium Virgin Argan Oil is a great product, my hair is lackluster and is really dry but with a couple of usage my hair appears to be shinier and more manageable, I like the way the oil smells, it is pleasant. I got this product at a amazing price with a promotional code and I would highly recommend this oil, as it has being working well for my hair care needs.</li>
    <li> The product arrived earlier than I expected. I waited for a couple of weeks before I write a review to see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the smell and it makes my hair shiny/soft, works like a charm, must try.</li>
    <li> I like using Argan Oil in my hair daily as I use a flat iron and it dries out my hair. It is so easy to use and makes my hair shiny without the greasy look. I use a bit just out of the shower because it allows my hair to brush out easily. When I go to flat iron I also apply a little more so that when I straighten it does not fly away or get frizzy. It is easy to wash out with just regular shampoo. The box is sufficient for multiple uses and a little goes a long way. It moisturizes and promotes healthier hair growth without weighing down the follicles. *product received for my unbiased opinion*</li>
    <li> This Argan oil helps the hair really well. It makes your hair nice and soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed. It doesn&#x27;t leave your head damp and heavy. It also smells really good. This is a great product for healthy hair growth.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I Love this product it is exactly what I needed. This oil is so light you won&#x27;t feel like you are using an oil treatment at all. As a retired hairdresser I am still interested in products and the right oil treatment is not easy to find. This one is professional grade quality and I am getting excellent results. I intend to keep using this product from now on.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works great for all your hair product needs really a great product ! A+++&lt;br /&gt;i was given this at a reduced priced to review this product and was completely pleased with it !</li>
    <li> Nice product, fast shipping. Need some time to see if it works, but so far my hair is healthy and moisturized. This is a great product for pool and beach season</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this Argan Oil and the way it makes my hair shine. Totally worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of Argon oil, call me naive, but I am extremely glad I have my own now. I have used it a few times, both in my hair/scalp, and on my very dry skin. As far as my skin goes. It is like night and day. I went from dry, itchy, scaly skin, to now having smooth, and soft skin. Baby bottom soft I have been told by friends.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to my hair and scalp. It is a turn-a-round that I could have never anticipated. Not only is my hair much healthier, but so is my scalp. One of the most wonderful things that has happened, (as if all that isn&#x27;t amazing enough), is that my hair is no longer falling out!!!&lt;br /&gt;All of the above wonders accursed while only applying a very small amount each time. This oil is good for anyone with skin and/or scalp issues and I would recommend it firmly.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine an he doesn&#x27;t weigh it down</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels in my hair, moisturized but not greasy. I normally have very dry hair that has been badly breaking. This feels so good.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, dry hair that is prone to split ends and frizz. I have not yet found any product that helps with this, most leave my hair too heavy or oily looking. I constantly have to wear my long hair in a ponytail or bun to hide the frizz. But after using this product I am amazed at how well it has tamed my hair and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use it on dry hair first thing in the morning. I run a few drops through my hair, concentrating on the ends. It smoothes my split ends and leaves them soft and silky for the rest of the day. Then I massage the oil through the rest of my hair and the result is shiny and healthy looking hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On damp hair, I apply the oil throughout and roll my hair into a loose bun to air dry. Afterward I let it down and I have beautiful, soft waves that are shiny and so gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is not heavy at all, it absorbs quickly and has a great fragrance to it. Afterwards I rub some into my hands and nails; it works great as a cuticle moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you have fine, dry, frizzy or lackluster hair. It works with both wet and dry hair and will leave it so soft and moisturized. And the generous sized bottle will last a long time!</li>
    <li> This seller went above and beyond! Would highly recommend! First product damaged, Seller IMMEDIATELY shipped replacement!  Love the product! Makes your hair so soft and silky smooth without using a lot of different products to get the same results.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great for hair and skin. Recommended for all skin types.</li>
    <li> I love argan oil andandually use a different brand but I had a coupon and decided to use this brand. This stuff is great. I have really long hair with average thickness and I use it after I wash my hair. I put a little pool in my hands and rub them together, then run it through the bottom half of my hair. It helps keep my hair soft, moisturized and managble. I like the way it smells too. Love it!</li>
    <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a high quality argan oil and I have used about 10 different brands so far. It smells great and will keep your hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I had tried this but in a sample size at Sally&#x27;s a while back and I loved it! It left my hair so soft and shiny. I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for this and I finally found it :) Can&#x27;t wait to use this in my daily beauty routine :) I&#x27;ve tried it, I loved it and now I&#x27;m excited to use this! I received a discount promo code for this product and all the opinions are of MY OWN and I WAS NOT influenced or told to say anything in this review. I simply just love Argan Oil and I can&#x27;t wait to use this everyday :)</li>
    <li> Love this... Got it on promotion and just love it, it really worked great. After only a couple uses I could really see a difference.</li>
    <li> Great product, however seemed to leave my hair a little too greasy looking.</li>
    <li> i absolutely loved this argan oil and what it does to my hair. i live near the beach and my hair is so unmanageble at times but this oil got it under control. it is great for taming hair frizz. and you see the difference just after couple of days. you aplly the oil to dry clean hair and it makes your hair look beautiful. Argan oil isn’t greasy at all because this oil can be easily absorbed by your hair. Also, it can even shorten the time by which you blow dry your hair.  Not to forget the fact that it will surely nourish the hair and you will love the results once you have tried it even for the first time. I can&#x27;t get over the difference it makes. i recieved a discounted sample to test and review.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is the Best! I used it on my daughters hair and right away I could see the difference. It looked healthier and more shiny. It also made her hair very soft. Thanks</li>
    <li> Smells great! Very lightweight and silky to the touch. Left my hair feeling moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This is far from being organic.  There is no organic certification on the box or the bottle itself any where.  Also first ingredients is : CYCLOPENTASILOXANE which is known to cause cancel on lab studies w/ mice.  I can&#x27;t believe Amazon is letting you get away w/ this.  Ingredient is covered with bar code label which prevents user to take a closer look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Love the product. I have only been using this product for a few weeks, but I have been pleased with the results, 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> My hair is shinny and thicher after using product.&lt;br /&gt;Fr. Jude, S.J.P.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. My three year old has a very dry, flaky scalp and fluffy hair. The first time I used it on her, the crusty flakes on her scalp started falling off, leaving smooth and healthy skin behind. It was nothing short of amazing. I used it on myself and it took me 1/2 the time to blow dry my hair. I am biracial and have fine but very curly hair that is dry at the ends and prone to outrageous frizz. This smoothed my hair but did not make it greasy even though I used way more than what is recommended. This is my new favorite product and I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> leaves hair greasy and heavy</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST Argan Oil I have ever used! If you are looking for a product that with make your hair look and feel so much healthier, this is it! I HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone and I will be a lifetime costumer!!</li>
    <li> It seems like a mediocre product that I see no benefit in.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell which I like. You can&#x27;t even tell you have it in.  I found it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair though. I will keep using and revise feedback if anything changes</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Desert Beauty&#x27;s  Premium Argan Oil. Since I got this product I use it every day.  It keeps my hair looking shinny, healthy and soft. All you need is a few drop  to massage/ comb through your hair to keep it shinny all day. It leaves my hands soft and smelling good as well</li>
    <li> I have been using this for only a few days and there is a noticable difference! I rarely used products that stay in my hair, other than shampoo and conditioner. So i never really use any types of leave-in conditioner or other products that you put on dry hair because I get nervous that it will make my hair look greasy. In just a few shorts day this product already has my hair looking healthier and feeling great! Since using it i havent felt the need to straighten my hair (i have straight hair but use a straightener to eliminate frizz) since this helps with frizz and makes the hair look silky. I will definitely be continuing to use this product and recommend it to anyone looking for a product to help with overall hair health!</li>
    <li> Left my hair super soft, not greasy</li>
    <li> This product came in sooner than I expected and gives great shine and moisture to my hair</li>
    <li> I liked this item.My hair extra  dry.It helps.It smell nice.The best part is natural.I dont want to use chemical product anymore.! Fast shipping also. I have received this item in a promotion Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wow!! That&#x27;s my first impression of this product. I&#x27;ve used 3 other Argan oil products, all of which were high end, and this is hands down my favorite. I have curly/wavy hair that is fine, not thick like I feel like many Argan oil products are geared for. When I used other products they were very thick and heavy, which looked really gross on my fine hair. This product is amazingly light and silky. It also smells devine! Just the slightest sweat fragrance. I now use it on my hands and my legs. It reminds my so much of Victoria&#x27;s Secret super model dry oil. Love it!</li>
    <li> I would normally use a product longer than 2 weeks before writing a review but this Argan Oil is so amazing I couldn&#x27;t wait. I did purchase this product at a reduced price to intice ratings but I will honestly say than when I finish this bottle I will GLADLY pay full price again! I have told all my firneds about it! My hair has become so soft and shiny in the last 2 weeks my fiance has commented unpromted on how great it looks, I have even had strangers in the store comment on how shiny it is. This has never happened to me before, my hair has always been pretty plain dirty blond. I have never dyed it but it has alot of sun and ponytail/bun style damage. I have noticed a big difference in its strength and resistance to hair tie crinkles since using this product. I would normally never use a oil based product in my hair but just a few drops smoothed through wet hair does the trick. This product has been a true beauty miracle! I can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair looks after I have used it longer. Truly recommend it!</li>
    <li> i love love the smell of this is so amazingly good and the plus is that a great conditioner booster, it leaves my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have long hair down to my waist, and normally I grow it out, cut it off, and donate it to locks of love for wigs for children with cancer, However, I am getting married in a few months and wanted to continue to grow it out. My hair is very thin and dry towards the ends. I have tried Desert Beauty&#x27;s Argan oil and I enjoy using it about twice a week. It helps keep my hair hydrated and a lot easier to comb through. I have noticed my hair looking healthier and shinier than it ever has before. Argan oil is proven to make hair softer, silkier and shinier. It is the ideal hair conditioner, and it can even help to treat split ends and tame frizzy hair. Using argan oil to condition your hair is extremely easy. It can be used as a conditioner after shampooing, as a leave-in conditioner after showering, and as a styling aid. Due to its ability to tame frizz and give hair shine, argan oil is also commonly used as a styling agent. I use mine as a styling agent, it makes my hair more manageable and adds a healthy, attractive shine to any hair style I can create.  This is an ideal step to add I have added to my daily routine after blow-drying. I just rub a few drops of argan oil over my palms and then comb my fingers through my hair to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for my unbiased opinion and I assure that all thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> Other than a good smell I haven&#x27;t seen other difference in my hair so far. I didn&#x27;t realize this but majority of positive reviews are from those who received a discount to write a review. It just seems a little concerning and I wish I had noticed this before buying this product just on the five star ratings.</li>
    <li> Hair loss reduced dramatically .</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super soft and doesn&#x27;t leabe build up. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Amazing product! It&#x27;s not greasy, mu hair is soft and it smells amazing..</li>
    <li> I have been using the oil for a few days now and so far I really like it.  My hair always smells great after use.  Maybe it&#x27;s all in my head but my hair already feels smoother. I only need to use about a quarter size  to cover my hair.  I will keep testing and update this review if my opinion changes but so far I really like.</li>
    <li> I have been using different types of Argan oil for about a year now but have been switching brands because I could not find one that will do the trick and not leave my hair greasy and weighed down… until now! THIS IS THE PRODUCT YOU WANT FOR YOU DAILY HAIR CARE ROUTINE! I have been using it on both wet and dry hair and results are AMAZING! I have very thick frizzy hair and my hair is finally soft, easy to comb and style, frizz free and looks amazing. And all this in less than a minute a day!</li>
    <li> So far my hair has been really good to me. It&#x27;s light weight on my hair and helps it from looking dead at its ends. &amp; it smells good too !</li>
    <li> I was born with dry hair. And, in the southern, summer humidity, my hair tends to frizz and/or just be lifeless. I have literally tried mousses, gels, sprays, hot-oil treatments, deep conditioning treatments, etc., etc. What&#x27;s more, I color my hair so.... just one thing on top of another. I was sent this product as a sample (so I could see the packaging primarily) and decided to give it a try just for the heck of it since it was specifically made for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the instructions, I put 3 drops in my hands and began to rub them together. I&#x27;d just washed and dried my hair and the sight of this orange oil smeared all over my hands made me nervous. Be Warned: It Looks Very Greasy Right Out Of The Bottle! I lightly began to work the argan oil through my hair (I started at the crown of my head and the back then went to the front just in case it did turn my hair into a mess - lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No greasy residue. No oily feeling hair. I was just standing there in front of the mirror smiling. I couldn&#x27;t believe something this easy (and inexpensive) could work. Within about a minute or so, my hair was soft instead of coarse, It was shiny instead of dull and the frizz was gone. Later that same day, I laid out in the sun for a while. Typically, if I&#x27;m out in the sun, my hair just gets horribly dry. It was still as soft as it was when I put the oil on hours earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 days now and - supposedly - the longer you use it, the better the results you see. I&#x27;m thrilled right now! My hair holds its style better, looks healthier and is just so soft. I&#x27;m officially a fan!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Love the packaging and the texture!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried all kinds of oils and different products for my hair.. and the only one that made my hair feel amazing and light was Desert Beauty Argan Oil. LOVE the packaging,LOVE the scent of the oil, High Quality Product Totally Recommended..</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves hair super soft. Not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> very good product.smell good very helpful</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Makes my hair not so frizzy and tames my fly aways!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I got this product for my wife who is experiencing hair loss post maternity. She has been using it for a week now and seeing improvements and will update my feedback in next few weeks.</li>
    <li> This take great care of my hair- excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> It works great!  The hair is so soft and manageable after using the argan oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my hair has grown or not, but it is a lot healthier looking. I use this every other time I was my hair before I blow dry and it makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I really, really liked using this oil. I have natural hair not treated with chemicals. My hair tends to soak up oil and moisturizers. This worked great as a sealant after I&#x27;ve washed my hair. It left my hair feeling silky throughout the door. My daughter used it for her hair as well. She said she like it much better than the previous brand we use to use. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a really good argan oil.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:311d7a2122f11eba18fbafaff00472ef]]This is my first time to ever try Argon Oil.  I saw a show recently on TV where a stylist was talking about using it to really add moisture to hair and make it have such a healthy appearance.  I have very dry, naturally curly hair that has a coarse texture.  I am also rough with my hair because I blow dry it everyday and either straighten or curl it.  Because I use a lot of heat products on my hair, it is always very dry.  I was super excited to try this.  The first couple of times I used it, I could already tell a difference.  I use about a dime sized amount twice on my hair when it was dry.  The oil is an orange color and smells GREAT.  I could not believe the difference the first time.  My hair had a completely different feel to it.  It was softer, smoother than when I typically blow dry it.  So after using it just on dry hair, I decided to try it on wet and dry hair.  So I used a dime sized amount on my hair when it was still wet and then again once it was dry.  I could not believe how different my hair looked and felt.  Typically when I blow dry my hair, I get this nice huge puffy mess. But with this on my hair before I dried it, it really made a difference.  I will continue using this on my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as a sample to test and share my opinion.</li>
    <li> This winter has been especially rough on not only my skin but my hair also. My hair is a mess and I like to wear my hair natural since it is curly and well I am a bit lazy on the hair front trying to give it a break from the flat iron and blow dryer. I have found that while my hair is thick I have a lot of damage to it. The weather and styling has dried it out horribly this winter so I was looking for something that would help before the warm weather hits. There are so many things I need to get together before summer hits. Anyway when I found this at a great price and given the chance to give my opinion on it I jumped at it. I have heard all the benefits of Argon oil and thought I would see how it worked out for me. So far it has only been a couple of days but my hair doesn’t feel as horrible as it did before I started using this product. There is nothing worse than walking around with a frizzy mane of hair; at least if it is healthy it looks a lot better. Of course I know I am due for a cut but overall my hair is looking better which is what I was hoping for. The ends that were dry don’t feel as dry and my hair is starting to look like it did before I gave up during the cold weather. I am happy with this and it doesn’t take a lot so my hair doesn’t have that oily look to it. I like it better than the coconut oil that I usually use and I haven’t found any build up. All around I am loving this and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is one of my favorite skin care products and I use it pretty much daily as a moisturizer. I have extremely sensitive skin and so lotions and soaps break me out in hives and burn against my skin. I even have problems with shampoos and conditioners just running down my body when I rinse irritating me. This hair oil is really great because even though it Does contain a few chemicals that upset my skin it stays only on my hair and doesn&#x27;t touch my skin. It leaves my hair incredibly soft and manageable and smells fantastic! My hair breaks easily and I have split ends really bad from coloring and blowdrying my hair on a regular basis. After only a few days of use I&#x27;m already noticing a nice shine and real softness and its much easier to work with. I can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;ve used it enough to give my hair some repair and strength. The bottle is 4oz and will last months since I&#x27;m only using it every other day. I apply it after my shower while I&#x27;m still standing in the tub and run a small dab ( maybe a little more than a quarter size) through the tips and body of my hair. I wrap it with my hair towel and let it sit for 25 minutes or so and then rinse. The results are fantastic. Shiney and beautiful hair! So glad I tried this! I did receive my bottle free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinions using this oil.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product. It works as it was described.</li>
    <li> Very Very nice. I would definately pick up this product. I have longer thick brown hair and I was nicely surprised how much I noticed the softness and controlability in my hair! Summertime humidity take a toll on my hair but, just this small amount that I used made a huge difference! Great price too!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to try this out I had to straighten my hair the first day and leave it down to try this out. It smells really good and I like that it is all natural virgin argan oil. I really had to keep smelling my hands because it smelled so good. I was so thankful I was able to receive this item for a fantastic promotion. I really like all the advantages it says this product will give to my hair. I love trying out new hair products, The bottle and the packaging look so fancy and expensive looking. Made me hair feels really soft. It also looked shiny and healthy. Even my fiance said my hair looked really nice. He was sitting next to me and smelled my hair and he said it smelled really good.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it. My stylist loves it!</li>
    <li> gives great unique shine to my hair that i was seeking, but i couldnt stand the fruity flowery smell, what if men wanted to use it?&lt;br /&gt;id suggest if the company can make an unscented version or male version of this? otherwise it pulled off everything else.</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent! it makes my hair soft, shiny and bouncy and people now ask me  what I am doing  with my hair and I tell them  so they are going to buy some too.</li>
    <li> I have a very dry hair and used to try different products to make it more alive.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for the last month and my hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product! High quality.</li>
    <li> Looks good. Been a week. Will update the review next month.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I saw a difference after only 2-3 days of using. Makes hair soft, shiny, and healthy. It smells great, not sticky at all or too heavy on my hair. Product arrived very promptly. I also love that it&#x27;s all natural with no chemicals, and not tested on animals! I absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy way to improve the look, feel, and health of your hair.</li>
    <li> Had already bought it before.&lt;br /&gt;really like it</li>
    <li> smells really good...feels light in hair...easy to style after use didn&#x27;t make hair oily at all!!</li>
    <li> I am totally in LOVE with this product. My hair usually falls out by the handfulls after washing and my hair is always so super dry that I only wear it in a pony tail. After using this product in a matter of days I have seen an improvement. My hair is less dry and coarse and very little hair loss if any. I cant wait to purchase more of this product. I will tell everyone an anyone about this product. It is beyond amazing</li>
    <li> Wow this is absolutely the best hair oil I have used in a really long time!! So far Ive used is a few different ways.  I used it once when my hair was damp and then styled as usual.  and the other time I used it on my dry hair after I styled it.  Both times, it left my hair feeling silky smooth! Kept my hair frizz free all day.  My hair looked so shiny and much more healthier! Im really impressed! After putting the oil all over my hair, I took the remaining oil in my hand and rubbed into my cuticles. My hands felt to silky soft afterwards.  I definitely recommend this amazing product!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking oily. I have thick medium textured hair and I put this on damp hair and it helped keep that moisturized softness that you get just before your hair dries out. But my hair never dried out. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It smells great and helps to detangle my hair without feeling greasy and oily.  Works great on wet and dry hair.  I have given samples to co workers and they love it too.</li>
    <li> Has completely changed my hair! So soft, not oily or dry as it has been the last few years. A must try if you need a hair treatment!</li>
    <li> I have used other oils in the past but this one is the best.  It left my hair smooth and helped with the frizzes.</li>
    <li> Love how when I used it for the first time my hair was so shiny. Looks healthier</li>
    <li> It was wonderful! It made my hair healthier and shinier &amp; also made my nails grow faster when massaged into my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I Must say, that after a large number of financial costs and many hair products that did not work , I can recommend the Desert Beautty Premium Virgin Organ Oil.&lt;br /&gt;the product definitely worked beyond expectations and I certainly will use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a hair product with high quality and that really works.</li>
    <li> I have been growing my hair out for the last 2-3 years, which means extra care. Now I have long, wavy hair, and lots of it, which can make it hard to keep it healthy and strong, especially in below-freezing temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several brands of argan oil to help me keep the length and ends nourished and fight frizz in high-humidity, and though I am willing to spend a bit for a good product, I found that most of them were not worth the price: the hair was just oily, but didn&#x27;t really seem nourished. There were no flyaways, but I also had to shampoo more often, which tends to dry out strands - so i was reaching the opposite effect from the one I was shooting for. Also, several brands (including the over-hyped, overpriced one with the blue labele, you know the one) have an unpleasant sticky texture and have added fragrance, which I don&#x27;t like because I have a sensitivity to synthetic fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about a week my hair seems more nourished, and that slightly wavy texture that has been driving me crazy has somehow morphed into those relaxed &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; I have been trying to get for a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair oil for about two weeks now and I absolutely love it! I tried many different hair oils in the past, including some China-made Argan oils, and they all left my hair oily and weighed my hair down. But this leaves my hair shiny and bouncy without any oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin fine hair and have never been able to get those frizzy ends under control but this oil works amazingly on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on dry hair, just a few drops at a time, and my hair is manageable, doesn&#x27;t get tangled and looks and feels soft and shiny all day long. The scent is also great, but not overbearing like in many other products.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this oil on my cuticles as well, making them soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this oil again and recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> Omg this oil is the best oil ive used on my hair, the smell is wonderful and my hair is do soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> The product is magical when I use it! My hair is thick and very wavy, but after putting a small amount on my damp hair, drying it, there wasn&#x27;t any hair flying around afterwards and typically there is. The company is also just as magical. I didn&#x27;t know how to remove the seal on the bottle so I emailed the seller. I received directions almost immediately. There was also a follow up email to make sure I had gotten it off and if everything was o.k. WOW, WOW, WOW . . . I just wish that every business would give this kind of service with amazing products!!!</li>
    <li> the smell is great and it works well.  I never give reviews, but felt this one really deserved it.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair and my son&#x27;s. Also noticed my hair dries faster when blow dried. Good stuff-I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;(Works in wet and dry hair ! I do both)</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan Oil in my hair for several months and I love how it makes my dry flyaway hair more manageable. This is a great product and I would purchase it again. I massage my scalp on a regular basis with a bit of oil applied to my finger tips. I do have some new growth along my hairline where it has been extra thin in the last few years. My hair has always been extra dry and moisturizing shampoo and conditioner never seemed to do much for my dryness. Argan oil has made such a huge difference in my hair and my skin! For a long time I thought Argan oil was just a new product with a lot of good things said only by the manufacturer after using it for several months I realize it does work wonders!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry brittle, frizzy hair and this oil really helps.  It made my hair look and feel healthy.  Plus it helped to tame the frizziness.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I often struggle to find a hair product that produces the shiny and healthy look without making my hair and scalp feel oily. This product however achieves that and more, my hair has never felt or looked better!</li>
    <li> The Deserts Beauty argan oil does magic on the most crazy hair! I received this particular product to test for quality purposes, and have decided it is without a doubt my favorite so far! My hair is thick and frizzy and now my hair is finally soft.</li>
    <li> Loved it - it worked wonders! It left my hair feelinggn smooth and non frizzy!</li>
    <li> Has worked great for me. My hair is not breaking off like it was and it not kinking up.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is good but think a little too pricey</li>
    <li> I love it.. it does work&lt;br /&gt;it keep your hair soft and shiny  :)</li>
    <li> I just started using.  So far so good! I will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I would 100% recommend and was totally worth the price...my hair grew 4 inches in 2 weeks and have 2x thicker hair than I had before</li>
    <li> My hair is baby fine in texture and I color it every so often. For people with this type of hair, you know it is hard to have it looking great all day long, and coloring it just makes it brittle and dry. It is also hard for me to find products that do not weigh my hair down and still perform as it should. I&#x27;ve been using a Moroccan Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner for my hair recently, as people I know have been raving about argan oil and how great it is, and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular winter though has been really harsh on my hair, as the air has been dry and bitter cold. As the day goes on, I could use a little something to help it stay nice the rest of the day as well. Desert Beauty&#x27;s Moroccan oil has been a great addition to use to help my hair look it&#x27;s best all day long, and keep it protected from the extreme deep freeze outside. Especially on the ends that get frizzy at times half way through the wind blown days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the clever design for the pretty bottle of the argan oil, with a plug that sits on top of the bottle but under the cap to prevent leakage until it arrived to my house. The instructions say to remove the plug, but I actually like it on there, as I can feel safe sticking this in my purse to use on the go, without putting it in a plastic bag fearing it will spill all over everything. Loving the results, and that a few drops goes a long way for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for the purpose of inspection and reviewing.</li>
    <li> A little heavy but ok. Works well in the hair. Hair cuticle feels smoother. Will need to use for a longer period to really see how hair&lt;br /&gt;uses the oil. Hair is fine. Very fast mailing! Packaging a little flimsy but item was ok. Stopper under the cap is really needed if the&lt;br /&gt;packaging/mailing used is  the postal envelope. I think a box would be better.</li>
    <li> I am always on the hunt for a great oil, I love oils, especially ones for your hair. When I came across Desert Beauty’s Premium Virgin Argan Oil for an outstanding price I thought I would try it out. I always have a hard time finding oils for my hair that don’t ruin my shirt or my pillow case. My hair goes down to my waist so its hard to avoid it from touching anything. Well when I received my oil, I noticed right away that it looked different, it’s a little thicker. So I tried it out before I went to bed, putting an old pillow case on, and when I woke up, not only was my hair so soft, I mean really soft, but my pillow case and sheets, even my shirt, was free of oil stains!! This is a product I would recommend to anyone with any hair type. It made my hair feel so amazing!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only recently heard about the benefits of using Argan Oil.  I have thin curly hair, with a lot of damage from pulling it up every day, so I was so happy to have the chance to try out the Desert Beauty&#x27;s Argan Oil for a great deal.  After just a few days of using it, my hair looks healthier...it&#x27;s shiny, my curls look more pulled together, and it just feels like it&#x27;s working its magic!  I love the subtle scent of the oil as well...and the feel of it on my hands is nice.  I like that after applying it to my hair, I have a little leftover on my hands to rub into my cuticles and the rest of my dry hands.</li>
    <li> Light weight no added odor. Conditioned well no added grease or oiliness.</li>
    <li> I really like this because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily.</li>
    <li> My order has arrived safely and in good condition.such a good product.</li>
    <li> I am an African American with relaxed hair.  My hair sucks up all moisture products.  Since I was given the opprunity to review this product at a really good price, I thought I would give it a shot  My hair LOVES this stuff.  It comes in a very large bottle and I am able to use about a nickle size for my hair.  It really seals in the moisture without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I have grown very fond of Argan Oil, for so many different reasons. When I was offered to test this product during a promotional period, I accepted with excitement, and couldn&#x27;t be more happier paying the great price.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil can be used for dry skin, hair, nails - anything that needs that extra TLC moisture. I prefer to use argan oil for my naturally curly hair. In my experience it helps with the frizz and keeps it at bay. It also takes that dull dry look away, and adds shine. It&#x27;s always so hard to get my curly hair to look healthy because of what frizz does to it. I love this stuff!!! Have recommended this product to many of my lady friends. A+++ product - highly recommend,</li>
    <li> Omgggg makes your hair sooo soft and no frizz amazing I love love love going to be buying more!! Just in case ;)</li>
    <li> I ordered for stopping hair fall and hair growth&lt;br /&gt;But this is not working out</li>
    <li> A little anxious and panickrf about my thinning hair loss - I tried Argan Oil for Hair Treatment - Love this produde - seeing less and less hair loss and leaves my hair soft.  I have colored, treated hair The company is also the best I have ever purchase from - I;m not sure if they are small, family owned, but they sure act like it!  Personalized Care.</li>
    <li> My hair has stopped falling out. I use it after washing my hair and after drying it with blow dryer. Instantly I felt my hair soft and shinny the first time I use the oil. I will by it again.</li>
    <li> We are in the hair business where we work with many client&#x27;s. We received this Argan oil and we first noticed the packaging which was pleasant to the eyes.  We tried this product on our hair and then the clients.We noticed how soft our hair was and it also had a soft pleasant smell. We overall loved this product and would certainly purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Bought before, worked great ! So bought it again</li>
    <li> Very good quality argan oil, its not greasy. I have fine, dry hair that is prone to  frizz and split ends. This product is good at taming my frizzy hair and helps with my split ends.</li>
    <li> I have really thick long hair and it is always dry regardless of what i use, i got this and it has certainly helped from what i have noticed so far (had it for a few days) It is promising!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and every two months I&#x27;m constantly cutting my split ends because I get them quickly. At the moment I&#x27;m tired of cutting my ends and I use this oil to treat my split ends. This products smells great and also leaves a beautiful shine on my hair. Right now I have split ends I did not cut it because I want to use this product for a good month before I make the decision. I love the way the oil leaves my hairs and its loom beautiful and shiny. I will definitely purchase another bottle when I&#x27;m done with this one!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it! Nicely packaged, scent is great and most importantly, she’s happy! Recommended!</li>
    <li> I got this product as a present for my wife and she absolutely loves it! We have a shelf full of hair oils in our bathroom and this is the only one she is using, saying Desert Beauty&#x27;s is the best.&lt;br /&gt;The product is beautifully designed and well packaged, looks and feels very professional, looks even better than in the photos. The bottle is a hard plastic bottle in very good quality and looks very prestigious.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the wife recommends it, saying it did wonders for her hair. And for us guys, an easy gift for our loved one ;-)</li>
    <li> Desert Beauty&#x27;s premium oil is AMAZING! My hear looks unbelievable, even better than after a trip to my hair stylist, and my finger tips never looked better. Perfect gift for people you really love.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair oil I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I stopped using conditioner on my long thick hair and use this instead.  It smells great and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  If only I could get my daughter to stop stealing it from me!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I LOVE this product! My girls and I all have mixed hair (black and white) and we have a very hard time putting oils in our hair. We either find them leaving our hair super oily with lots of residue or not oily enough. This product is a must try for anyone. I put it in my daughters hair and for one it smelled wonderful, and two the next morning when she woke up her hair looked great. Her hair was shiny and full of volume. This is important to note because her hair is very frizzy, we like the volume in her hair and most oils weigh it down and it looks really oily. That is not the case with Desert Beauty&#x27;s Premium Virgin Argan Oil. Her hair had the perfect amount of volume and shine and no oily or product residue. I will be purchasing this from now on and using it in all three of my daughters hair, as well as mine.</li>
