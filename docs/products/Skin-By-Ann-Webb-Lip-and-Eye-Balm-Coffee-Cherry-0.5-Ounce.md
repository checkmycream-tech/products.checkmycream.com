      <li>send you does not and is like cheap lip balm because it does not have the hemp oil but does have a lot of&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I liked the older, listed product because it</li>

      <li>Super silky feel.</li>
      <li>My order arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I loved this product in the past.</li>
      <li>lips become more dry when I apply this.</li>
      <li>The product I purchased at Whole Foods about 3 years ago said \\&quot;Coffee Berry with Hemp Oil\\&quot; and did not contain ANY beeswax.  </li>
      <li>I went to refill this at Whole Foods today, and found out they&#x27;ve stopped carrying this line.  </li>
      <li>that I wonder if it does any good to my delicate eye area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>smell is overtly strong and for some strange reason,&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
      <li>/&gt;(I tried several popular eye roller balls (due to its practicality) but their ingredients were&lt;br /&gt;flimsy</li>
      <li>this item arrived today at my home and not only is the content not the same as the original.</li>
      <li>Although the old version of this product has the listed ingredients on this website, the new one that they&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a certain smell to it, it&#x27;s definitely not coffee or cherry maybe from the oil used, I can&#x27;t quite put on my finger on that smell.</li>
      <li>I purchased this reading the raving reviews and because of the natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it is just old and no longer usable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the old one that I technically ordered but was sent a poor replacement version whose ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is actually flat and I am left wondering if it is really the product that was advertised.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately the ones I purchased within the last year from whole foods and now amazon are more like glue sticks.</li>
      <li>This product was not new, as the scent was not the same as a new lip balm in the same product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, but when I received the past two tubes they were dried up and the tubes were defected and didn&#x27;t dispense the product.</li>

<li> I never used the previous version people used but like this a lot.</li>
<li> It was almost dried out.</li>
<li> but they are often to heavy for my skin.  </li>
<li> Product is rancid and almost dried out.  </li>
<li> The part that turns to raise the balm for distribution on the lips is broken and will only untwist.</li>
<li> I agree with other reviewers that the formula has changed, and what&#x27;s being sold here is not nearly as good.</li>
<li> Too Bad Ann Webb is dropping it from their line-no other product like it on the market that you can use for your lip area and eye area.  </li>
<li> (It doesn&#x27;t smell bad...</li>
<li> I just hate anything scented)  </li>
<li> Very disappointing!</li>
<li> This is horrible as well</li>
<li> my skin should be flaking off and looking terrible.  </li>

    <li> Wonderful for under the eyes and as lip balm. Smells amazing! Super silky feel.</li>
    <li> This is horrible as well</li>
    <li> Love this Lip Balm. It is great to use under lipstick!  All Ann Webb products meet or exceed my expectations!</li>
    <li> Although the old version of this product has the listed ingredients on this website, the new one that they&lt;br /&gt;will send you does not and is like cheap lip balm because it does not have the hemp oil but does have a lot of&lt;br /&gt;beeswax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the old one that I technically ordered but was sent a poor replacement version whose ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunflower Seed Oil, Beeswax, Jojoba Seed Oil, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Cocoa seed butter, Echinacea Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Chamomile Extract, Eyebright Extract, Coffee, Grape Seed Oil, Spearmint, Vitamin E, \\&quot;Flavor\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this can actually be made of almost half beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am not a vegan although I think it could be healthy if you do it correctly and I liked the older, listed product because it&lt;br /&gt;felt way better on my skin with the hemp oil than all of this beeswax.</li>
    <li> I went to refill this at Whole Foods today, and found out they&#x27;ve stopped carrying this line.  So, Amazon to the rescue.    I will say that I did not love the scent at first.  It took a while to get used to.  And I&#x27;d still prefer an unscented version.    (It doesn&#x27;t smell bad... I just hate anything scented)  HOWEVER.  It deals with my super-dry skin in a way NOTHING else has.  Which is saying a lot, since I&#x27;ve tried everything.    It&#x27;s January, freezing-- my skin should be flaking off and looking terrible.  But it&#x27;s fine!</li>
    <li> WARNING.... this item arrived today at my home and not only is the content not the same as the original. The part that turns to raise the balm for distribution on the lips is broken and will only untwist. THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH! I am so disappointed not to have my favorite balm to use. Shame on Nutraceutical Corp.!</li>
    <li> I love this product, but when I received the past two tubes they were dried up and the tubes were defected and didn&#x27;t dispense the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this reading the raving reviews and because of the natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I thought its a wonderful concept since I don&#x27;t have to dab an eye cream or a gel in the middle of the day&lt;br /&gt;for my eye area to stay moist under California sun.&lt;br /&gt;(I tried several popular eye roller balls (due to its practicality) but their ingredients were&lt;br /&gt;flimsy that I wonder if it does any good to my delicate eye area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will gain more wrinkles around the eyes trying to glide this stick around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;So, I ended up tapping the balm around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves residues which ruins my foundation as well.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is overtly strong and for some strange reason,&lt;br /&gt;my lips become more dry when I apply this.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, I like the size and the moisture properties however. There&#x27;s a certain smell to it, it&#x27;s definitely not coffee or cherry maybe from the oil used, I can&#x27;t quite put on my finger on that smell. There&#x27;s some sort of \\&quot;skin\\&quot; that forms over the top, it&#x27;s not unpleasant and I still use it but I probably won&#x27;t repurchase this again.</li>
    <li> Most amazing product but always sold out !!</li>
    <li> Product is rancid and almost dried out.  It is waxier than before and develops an unusable &#x27;skin&#x27; that has to be peeled off before use.</li>
    <li> Love the product which my Whole Foods no longer stocks. I use it to get of dryness under eyes and on lids. My order arrived quickly. This works great for lip or eye area.</li>
    <li> This product was not new, as the scent was not the same as a new lip balm in the same product.  The scent is actually flat and I am left wondering if it is really the product that was advertised.  Either that or it is just old and no longer usable.  It was almost dried out.</li>
    <li> great in the winter when my skin is more sensitive</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers that the formula has changed, and what&#x27;s being sold here is not nearly as good. The product I purchased at Whole Foods about 3 years ago said \\&quot;Coffee Berry with Hemp Oil\\&quot; and did not contain ANY beeswax.  It was creamy and lovely.  This version says \\&quot;Coffee Cherry\\&quot; and beeswax is the SECOND ingredient. Imagine trying to smear room-temp beeswax around your eyes. Boo.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gluten free lip balm and it works amazingly well. I never used the previous version people used but like this a lot. I do not use it under my eyes, so cannot comment on that but as a lip balm it keeps my lips from drying out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of year around my eyes and on my lips at night. It works great! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and my son uses it during the wintertime on his lips.</li>
    <li> I loved this product in the past. Unfortunately the ones I purchased within the last year from whole foods and now amazon are more like glue sticks. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Too Bad Ann Webb is dropping it from their line-no other product like it on the market that you can use for your lip area and eye area.  makes it so easy.  I like it because it works and does not break out my face.  I have a big problem with products breaking out my face after about 4-6 weeks of using it.  Ive been using this for 2 years-not 1 break out from this.</li>
    <li> Was A Present for Christmas It was a suprise and She thought it was a Very Good Bargin on the internet And She liked it Because she Useses it all the time</li>
    <li> I use the Ann Webb Lip and Eye Balm every morning on my lids, under eyes, and lips.  I&#x27;ve tried other eye creams/gels but they are often to heavy for my skin.  This is perfect because it gently hydrates and gives a slight dewy glow when applied.</li>
