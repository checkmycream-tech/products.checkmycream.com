<li> BECAUSE TIPS AREVERY NARROW EVEN THE LARGE TIP.I</li>
<li> but they don&#x27;t last long</li>
<li> So I would not re immense if u don&#x27;t like long nails!!</li>
<li> I received them earlier than expected and there was no damage.</li>

<li> I painted them black on the tops and red on the underneath side.</li>
<li> Company sent wrong item but as soon as I emailed them, they quickly corrected it.</li>
<li> I tried to thick it up some only last for about 1 week</li>
<li> a little too long</li>
<li> No need to cut them down.</li>
<li> Too sharp, too small.</li>
<li> but the length is a little longer</li>
<li> I am a former cosmetologist and I have to say that these stiletto tips are incredibly thin and flimsy</li>
<li> I had trouble when I was putting them on</li>
<li> a waste of money I contacted the seller they were no help at all........</li>
<li> 2 stars, because I ordered CLEAR artificial tips....</li>
<li> i put these on myself even though i am not very good at putting on acrylic nails.</li>
<li> They are a little thin than I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
<li> Over half of them broke!!!</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered some Acrylic pain and powder and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before I put this bad girls to work.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
<li> to hard to attach fake nail to client fingers</li>
<li> too thin and the fittings not stable , slips off clients nail not sturdy.</li>
<li> poor quality product .</li>
<li> which was really disappointing.</li>

    <li> CHEAP FLIMSY hey but it came on time. guess thats good.</li>
    <li> I had trouble when I was putting them on they are very flimsy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my fault, these are JUST tips!! I thought the were actual stiletto nails so pay attention when you read stuff</li>
    <li> too thin and the fittings not stable , slips off clients nail not sturdy. poor quality product . to hard to attach fake nail to client fingers</li>
    <li> The nails look very cheap when you put them on its very to get them to stay on they pop off no matter how many times you buff and prep the nails a waste of money I contacted the seller they were no help at all........</li>
    <li> I got these and at first I was so excited until I tried to use them. Over half of them broke!!!</li>
    <li> i put these on myself even though i am not very good at putting on acrylic nails. I painted them black on the tops and red on the underneath side. I also had them down on my nails more and not as close to the tips because they were so long and i didn&#x27;t want to cut them. i also have tons of them leftover.  it was much cheaper than getting a manicure from a salon. They were a bit flimsy and would bend easily but they did not break.</li>
    <li> great product, great price....they are longggg ppl. but what tips arent? wore em once so far ppl loved them, lots more nails for lots more ideas.</li>
    <li> Too sharp, too small. Took WEEKS to be delivered.</li>
    <li> These nails are great stiletto shape but the length is a little longer then I wanted. This is a quick fix since I can just cut them and then the shape makes it easier for me to have rounded edges.</li>
    <li> a little too long but that&#x27;s okay! I just cut them</li>
    <li> It took a while before the nails came but it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered some Acrylic pain and powder and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before I put this bad girls to work.&lt;br /&gt;Mine were pretty durable. I glued them on my hands and left them on the entire day (a day I was home all day) Just to see how they&#x27;d hold up and they did pretty good.</li>
    <li> title says it all. i still use them for the purpose i got them for, which is cosplay.  i have painted them black and they look awesome with my costume.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of stiletto tips, but they are as described &amp;&amp; work great.! i recommend for those who love long, pointy nails</li>
    <li> I am a former cosmetologist and I have to say that these stiletto tips are incredibly thin and flimsy which was really disappointing. They&#x27;re manageable so far but they don&#x27;t last long and you&#x27;ll need a powder that you swear by if you want these to last longer than a week.</li>
    <li> Very nice nail tips!!</li>
    <li> THE TIPS ARRIVED EARLIER THAN EXPECTED.NOT SATISFIED BECAUSE TIPS AREVERY NARROW EVEN THE LARGE TIP.I WAS SENT DOUBLE THE SAME SIZE ON A COUPLE OF THE SIZES.WILL USE ANYWAY.</li>
    <li> I tried these I really like them But you have to find a good powder to put on them I tried to thick it up some only last for about 1 week But I will continue to hear them</li>
    <li> Not what I was hoping they&#x27;d be, wound up tossing them out.</li>
    <li> they are very nice, They are a little long but they are still good! They are a little thin than I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter not knowing that I had purchase some previous, but that was fine. My daughter loved them anyway. I received them earlier than expected and there was no damage. Now my daughter has enough nails to practice and become an expert with applying stiletto nails. Thanks.</li>
    <li> These nails look rounded in the picture thats why i ordered them but when i recieved them they were pointy. I didnt get what i payed for</li>
    <li> Nails are the perfect size, length and width. No need to cut them down. Perfect to keep as stiletto or cut the tip off to make coffin tips. Company sent wrong item but as soon as I emailed them, they quickly corrected it.</li>
    <li> 2 stars, because I ordered CLEAR artificial tips....they sent me white. I&#x27;m using them, but not for what I purchased them for.</li>
    <li> the clear stiletto tips were exactly what I was looking for. they stay put and are very sturdy to use acrylic powder on. they will last me a very long time :)</li>
    <li> The nails that I received were not clear stilleto nails.. They were square tip very low quality nails.</li>
    <li> I love these nail tips so much! They are long and beautiful. It saves time having to shape regular tips.</li>
    <li> They turn foggy when I put the glue I&#x27;ve never seen that with any other nails but other than that I loved</li>
    <li> Are great for doing the new pointy nails and look great the only thing is they are a bit long and if u cut u would have to reshape your self back to pointy! So I would not re immense if u don&#x27;t like long nails!!</li>
