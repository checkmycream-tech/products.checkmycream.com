<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> just received this product today Nov. 10, 2014. Excellent product. No harsh ingredients. THANKS!!</li>
    <li> Stains the skin well, but doesn&#x27;t adhere well to coarse facial hair.</li>
    <li> They have great customer service, I put this product on many times but still couldn&#x27;t get my gray spots to turn black with this product. They respond to any problems you have very quickly, and shipping was amazing fast.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Manly Guy Jet Black works well. After experiencing bad facial burning and swelling from Just For Men (JFM), and not being a big fan of my gray facial hair. I reluctantly decided to try Manly Guy. It was a very good decision. After following the mixture instructions, I put the Manly Guy paste on for about 2 hours. I had immediate results with no burning, itching or swelling. This chemical free, all natural product is the best hair coloring product out today. The only negative thing I can say about this product is the dirty bong water smell when you ad the water. But the smell washes away when you wash up. I get about 6 to 7 colorings per order which makes it very cost effective. Shipping was much faster then the quoted time. Its a good product with a good price. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great product and it works for well for my skin and hair. I have tried others and this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> It works. I did nit get the skin irritation I got from other brands.  It just take longer to do the while process.</li>
    <li> I found this product did not work for me followed all the instructions color fail in one day the only thing good is no irritation but that&#x27;s not important if the color want last  will.</li>
    <li> Was not satisfied at all left in for 2 hours and gray still was not cover but it is what it is</li>
    <li> I like this henna it even though  it is messy  because it is 100% natural it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin unlike other hair dyes do</li>
    <li> A person has to be patient what with all the wait time.</li>
    <li> I love it,I&#x27;m 46 and I workout every day and after I start using it,it change everything not just in shape but dark and handsome piece. KG, Go bills</li>
    <li> Takes to long you have to leave it on your face to long other than that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Too messy, When dries it hardens and to wash out could be little pain when hair being pulled. Last for a week.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Bought this for my boyfriend, he was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff was truly a let down. I used it a total of 5xs. It, at no point, made my beard black. My beard actually took on a couple other tints of purple and green, oddly enough. I needed something natural and thought this would do the trick based on the reviews. I was thoroughly disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Just takes way too long for it to work. Plus it dye your skin before it dyes your actual hair. In addition, you have to wash your skin multiple times to get the dye off.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and IT DOES NOT WORK.&lt;br /&gt;Its false advertising and its instruction very confusing, its not a product that needs to be on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on several times and followed the instruction exactly as stated and it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not watch the Youtube video for this item its false...&lt;br /&gt;Do not wast your money...........&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK...........</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to Just For Men because it burned my skin badly. This all natural dye was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This product made skin rashes on my neck and ear area.  I only had it on for 30 mins and soon after I washed it off my face started to itch. I didnt even get the desire color that I wanted.  I will not be odering this product again.</li>
    <li> I was surprise that this product actually works. I&#x27;ve tried all of the others including Grecian, just for men and others. All burned my face. Horrible experience. Manly guy is perfect, no burning, itching rash or oozing. Finally IV found the perfect product for beards. At least for me.</li>
    <li> This dye is complete garbage! the dye for this product doesn&#x27;t even hold for a couple of days let alone six months</li>
    <li> The perfect product for afro-hair. No mess of messing up one&#x27;s shirt or the bath tub.&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea of a natural product, chemical free.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I had a serious reaction to Just For Men after using for 6 months then I tried Natural Instincts and had the same reaction. So I tried this natural prod for my beard only and at first I mixed and left over night it didn&#x27;t work. I mixed up a fresh batch using a little warm water and fresh lemon juice following instruction... 1 TBs hennna and a little warm water and juice. Left on for  1.5 hrs and perfect!  Just shaved 5 yrs off my age! Tks.</li>
    <li> this an excellent product. wish I had found it sooner. It is an effective way to color grey without chemicals. I have use this product for several years and no other dye that I have used comes close to it.</li>
    <li> Great product. No chemicals, no dye, all natural.</li>
