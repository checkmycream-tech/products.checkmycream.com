### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I opened the package and was quite impressed with these masks.</li>
      <li>but besides that i think this is a very good product.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I loved it!</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re great quality</li>
      <li>love the feel to it and fits perfectly around my face.</li>
      <li>I am so impressed by these masks that I intend to purchase more of these to use here on the farm and while riding a motorcycle.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as a particulate mask, but easier to wear.  </li>
      <li>For the cost your not losing anything if you buy them and don&#x27;t find them to be as good as I find them to be.  </li>
      <li>not, it&#x27;s not like good when i thought before the things come</li>
      <li>Anyway I am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>I was beyond pleased, these are light and perfect &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>I wear one while riding my motorcycle which is easier to use then a kerchief around my face and a lot more effective.</li>
      <li>but if I needed that level of protection I would use a 3M 95N. What I use them for they are more then effective.</li>
      <li>but it it fits me just fine!</li>
      <li>You can also dampen it and it will trap dust even better.</li>
      <li>The mask does keep me from inhaling most of the dust though, which is a plus.</li>
      <li>mask seems to be of better quality than the one sold in Dr. Leonard&#x27;s catalog for&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love these mask.</li>
      <li>Maybe better for children and females.</li>
      <li>I believe this has to do with the fact that the top of the mask doesn&#x27;t conform to my nose like a disposable mask would.</li>
      <li>and I love how they look on my face.</li>
      <li>Oh and they look pretty good too.</li>
      <li>mostly in our (ages) 50&#x27;s and up.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Breathe Easy Tea and Buteyko Method to control my asthma...to be continued.</li>
      <li>These fit me perfectly although I don&#x27;t have a really big head or anything</li>
      <li>It fits perfectly and the quality isn&#x27;t that bad the stitching may not be the best</li>
      <li>it probably a medium-sized head, and it fits fine.</li>
      <li>The fabric itself is fine, although I have not tried to wash it yet.  </li>
      <li>However, I think these would be a great fit for a female or a child.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t fit my face.</li>
      <li>Do not let the price lead you to believe that they must be cheaply made because they are not.</li>
      <li>30 to 40 percent larger, and they would have been great.</li>
      <li>I also use it in my potter&#x27;s studio when I clean up.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it, i thought it was one feel good and big but</li>
      <li>Now when I get on a plane I can have my hands free and my nose protected, smile.</li>
      <li>long as I breathe in warm air, I&#x27;m able to walk 2.10 miles to get to my destination or</li>
      <li>I love this , its great for me because im asthmatic and it covers most of the cold air that needs to be covered away from me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun for cosplay, which is the purpose that I purchased it for.</li>
      <li>Fit really nice :) my only complaint is that when they came they had a very strong toxic smell to them and it made me dizzy.</li>
      <li>This is comfortable to wear and does a decent job of screening out pollen when doing yard work.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small (but it still fit okay), the part that goes around your ears isn&#x27;t sewn very well but its pretty OK for the price</li>
      <li>Not stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, decently made and shipped reasonably quickly.</li>
      <li>but really they were worth the money.</li>
      <li>My spouse is a very normal sized individual -- 5&#x27;9&#x27;&#x27;, 170lbs, w/ a slim face (although the crown of his head is fairly large) -- and these straps don&#x27;t fit his face.  </li>
      <li>Nice quality they weren&#x27;t long enough for me but great for a small adult or child</li>
      <li>I consider myself to have a pretty normal sized face</li>
      <li>I purchased 2pcs thinking that I would give these a try but not expecting much.</li>
      <li>simple and sweet.</li>
      <li>Masks in New condition and work very well</li>
      <li>Material is decent.</li>
      <li>Not for full sized people, unless your ears are far forward on your head, and you have a tiny face.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, sew two together, and get a new cord to hang them on your normal sized face.</li>
      <li>but I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>I am an adult, and</li>
      <li>The item is a bit small and the item isn&#x27;t 100% sewn neatly, but it arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>and when i see at the webside and that&#x27;s looks really cheap and not really good.</li>
      <li>My head isn&#x27;t large by adult male standards, but it is definitely a small item</li>

<li> i was a little disappointed in the stitching, it&#x27;s not bad but it looks like it could have been better.</li>
<li> but I can see it lasting me a long time!</li>
<li> and I must stretch it a bit to get it to fit around my ears--and is uncomfortable.</li>
<li> This is for kids size XXS.10inch long.</li>
<li> Smaller than expected.</li>
<li> its not as described photo was for an adult size mask but measurement is for a small child, I bought 4 pcs</li>
<li> just as expected.</li>
<li> Seller not willing to give refund.</li>
<li> its great for going out in cold weather especially if you cough when you breathe in cold air like me!</li>
<li> The sewing is quite messy, and it is definitely on the small side.</li>
<li> After reading some reviews I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t fit my face because it&#x27;s not that small</li>
<li> Even with the mask on I am still blowing black out my nose when I get home.</li>
<li> Be careful if you don&#x27;t have a small size.</li>
<li> and it is slightly tight, though not to the point of discomfort.</li>
<li> They practically pull his ears all the way forward when worn, which is obviously not comfortable.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m letting them air out for a few days to try to get it out.</li>
<li> The mask was to small and tight</li>
<li> In NYC, that cold winter air is a problem for New Yorkers with cold-air induced asthma.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have a problem with smoke and usually walk around with a cloth over my nose.  </li>
<li> I am not sure how they would fare in a laboratory testing for effectiveness</li>
<li> Too small, not recommended for adults</li>
<li> It&#x27;s obviously not amazing quality.</li>
<li> so it is hard to take the masks seriously.....</li>
<li> Poor quality and rather small.</li>
<li> The quality of the mask is not good.</li>
<li> Poor construction.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The mask was to small and tight</li>
    <li> The quality of the mask is not good.</li>
    <li> Child-sized. Not stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, decently made and shipped reasonably quickly. Would have given 4 stars if adult-sized.</li>
    <li> its not as described photo was for an adult size mask but measurement is for a small child, I bought 4 pcs none of it can be used. Seller not willing to give refund.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it, i thought it was one feel good and big but not, it&#x27;s not like good when i thought before the things come and when i see at the webside and that&#x27;s looks really cheap and not really good.</li>
    <li> These are definitely not for adults. The ad is misleading that these are for adults!</li>
    <li> The fabric itself is fine, although I have not tried to wash it yet.  My biggest/only gripe about this item is the fact that the slings on the side that attach to your ears is pretty small.  My spouse is a very normal sized individual -- 5&#x27;9&#x27;&#x27;, 170lbs, w/ a slim face (although the crown of his head is fairly large) -- and these straps don&#x27;t fit his face.  They practically pull his ears all the way forward when worn, which is obviously not comfortable.  However, I think these would be a great fit for a female or a child.</li>
    <li> Poor quality and rather small. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is comfortable to wear and does a decent job of screening out pollen when doing yard work.  I also use it in my potter&#x27;s studio when I clean up.  Not as good as a particulate mask, but easier to wear.  You can also dampen it and it will trap dust even better.</li>
    <li> Children&#x27;s size in children&#x27;s packaging. I didn&#x27;t realize that, but too inexpensive to return.</li>
    <li> Definitely for the wee folk, or Japanese teenagers. Not for full sized people, unless your ears are far forward on your head, and you have a tiny face. Otherwise, sew two together, and get a new cord to hang them on your normal sized face. 30 to 40 percent larger, and they would have been great. Oh, well.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2pcs thinking that I would give these a try but not expecting much. I opened the package and was quite impressed with these masks. Do not let the price lead you to believe that they must be cheaply made because they are not. I am so impressed by these masks that I intend to purchase more of these to use here on the farm and while riding a motorcycle.  I am not sure how they would fare in a laboratory testing for effectiveness but if I needed that level of protection I would use a 3M 95N. What I use them for they are more then effective. I love these mask. Oh and they look pretty good too. I wear one while riding my motorcycle which is easier to use then a kerchief around my face and a lot more effective. For the cost your not losing anything if you buy them and don&#x27;t find them to be as good as I find them to be.  Give these mask a shot.</li>
    <li> The item is a bit small and the item isn&#x27;t 100% sewn neatly, but it arrived very quickly. My head isn&#x27;t large by adult male standards, but it is definitely a small item and I must stretch it a bit to get it to fit around my ears--and is uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> A+++ for fastest shipping and quality!</li>
    <li> These fit me perfectly although I don&#x27;t have a really big head or anything but they&#x27;re great quality and I love how they look on my face. I think I&#x27;m going to do a painting on one of them for a project but really they were worth the money.</li>
    <li> The sewing is quite messy, and it is definitely on the small side. Be careful if you don&#x27;t have a small size. I hand-washed the new mask before wearing it, and the water was really black. ..</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s obviously not amazing quality. But it does do its job. I don&#x27;t recommend this for people who have bigger faces. I consider myself to have a pretty normal sized face and it is slightly tight, though not to the point of discomfort. Maybe better for children and females. I have also realized that when I hand washed it, the color seemed to drain.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t fit my face.This is for kids size XXS.10inch long.</li>
    <li> simple and sweet. just as expected. love the feel to it and fits perfectly around my face.</li>
    <li> In NYC, that cold winter air is a problem for New Yorkers with cold-air induced asthma.&lt;br /&gt;As long as I breathe in warm air, I&#x27;m able to walk 2.10 miles to get to my destination or&lt;br /&gt;shovel the snow in front of the house.&lt;br /&gt;This mask seems to be of better quality than the one sold in Dr. Leonard&#x27;s catalog for&lt;br /&gt;$4.99. When you add shipping, handling and insurance, the final price is about $10-$11.&lt;br /&gt;Here the price is 2 masks for $2.88 and the shipping is covered in the selling price.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a total of 4 masks for a total of $5.76.&lt;br /&gt;With 4 masks, I can rotate them and wash them.&lt;br /&gt;In NYC, we have a growing problem of adult-onset asthma...mostly in our (ages) 50&#x27;s and up.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Breathe Easy Tea and Buteyko Method to control my asthma...to be continued.</li>
    <li> I got these in a hello kitty package..... so it is hard to take the masks seriously..... Of course it does say FASHION!  I use the masks at work where there is a lot of dust. Even with the mask on I am still blowing black out my nose when I get home. I believe this has to do with the fact that the top of the mask doesn&#x27;t conform to my nose like a disposable mask would. The mask does keep me from inhaling most of the dust though, which is a plus. People were complaining about the size but it it fits me just fine!</li>
    <li> I have a problem with smoke and usually walk around with a cloth over my nose.  I knew about these mask but didn&#x27;t know where to get one.  I asked at my nail salon but they wouldn&#x27;t sell me one.  I should have know to look on amazon !  Anyway I am very pleased with my purchase.  Now when I get on a plane I can have my hands free and my nose protected, smile. Thank You !</li>
    <li> As soon as I took it out of the package and tried it on the strap broke.  U get what u pay for I suppose</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small (but it still fit okay), the part that goes around your ears isn&#x27;t sewn very well but its pretty OK for the price</li>
    <li> Masks in New condition and work very well</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected. Material is decent.</li>
    <li> Poor construction.  Masks were not seen properly</li>
    <li> Fit really nice :) my only complaint is that when they came they had a very strong toxic smell to them and it made me dizzy. I&#x27;m letting them air out for a few days to try to get it out. Otherwise, I loved it!</li>
    <li> not one size fits all</li>
    <li> I love this , its great for me because im asthmatic and it covers most of the cold air that needs to be covered away from me.</li>
    <li> Nice quality they weren&#x27;t long enough for me but great for a small adult or child</li>
    <li> i was a little disappointed in the stitching, it&#x27;s not bad but it looks like it could have been better. but besides that i think this is a very good product. its great for going out in cold weather especially if you cough when you breathe in cold air like me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fun for cosplay, which is the purpose that I purchased it for. I am an adult, and it probably a medium-sized head, and it fits fine. No problem.</li>
    <li> Came with two! I was beyond pleased, these are light and perfect &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Too small, not recommended for adults</li>
