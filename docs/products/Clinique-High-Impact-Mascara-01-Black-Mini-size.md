    <li> Do Not buy make up on Amazon.  It has given me multiple eye infections</li>
    <li> I like , just thought it would be bigger, is small and helped me a lot to give volume to my lashes</li>
    <li> very dry，like somebody used it before or it&#x27;s been stocked a long time after it produced. It&#x27;s not as good as I expect before.</li>
    <li> Item shows as delivered but it was not.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I prefer the small &#x27;sample&#x27; sizes (more like a deluxe sample, they last me 2-3 months and I wear 1-2 coats of mascara a day) because they last just long enough til the brush starts to dry out. I think they&#x27;re a better deal than the full size, which runs $16-17... Fast shipping &amp; great product! Definitely will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Does not clump.  Good quality</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara! It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off, and I have really small eyelashes and this really makes them look good. It&#x27;s relatively cheap compared to other high quality mascaras. I&#x27;d recommend this :)</li>
    <li> Nice and handy. Exactly what I wanted. No problems at all. Beautifull as all Clinique procducts.&lt;br /&gt;would order it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> It works nicely.  I use it with one other mascara and it works great, no smudging or smearing.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a natural looking mascara. If that is what you&#x27;re looking for, then look no further.</li>
    <li> i love this product... it&#x27;s amazine, I like this product because I suffer from allergies and is the only one that does not give me allergies in my eyes!</li>
    <li> Great mascara. I&#x27;ve tried lots of brands; this is not clumpy and does not end up under my eyes by mid-day as other brands do.</li>
    <li> surprisingly not impressed, it&#x27;s clumpy. I like Clinique and was glad to find this mini wand to carry along, but it is clumpy just like revlon or loreal&#x27;...too bad.</li>
    <li> It does an alright job on lashes, very crisp and clear but if you love digging the mascara goopies out of the corner of your eyes daily then this is the mascara for you! I expected better, even cheap cheap mascara doesn&#x27;t give me those goopy strings anymore so why does this expensive stuff do that?</li>
    <li> Clinique is a great company. I can&#x27;t use a lot of their products though but this I can because it doesn&#x27;t bug my eyes like other mascaras. Even its a Mini, it doesnt take too much to get the look you want either. Great buy, for a GREAT price.</li>
    <li> I will stick to the Clinique naturally glossy mascara. This one was clumpy and irritated my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Think this must either be a counterfeit or just old...clumped like crazy.  I threw it out after one use...</li>
    <li> This mascar is really nice , it really is high impact . But very easy to clump . You have to make sure the wand doesn&#x27;t have to much product on it or else it will for sure clump</li>
    <li> The black is very dark which I love and I can get length , thickness and colour for my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Great product. Got here super fast.</li>
    <li> It does not do enhance the eyelashes as much as it advertises. I would try the sample size first before spending the money on the larger size.</li>
    <li> ძალიან კარგი ტუშია.წამწამებს კარგ მოცულობას აძლევს და კარგადაც აგრძელებს. დაბანისას ადვილად შორდება. რეკომენდაციას ვუწევ...ყველას გირჩევთ შეიძინოთ.  .სრულიად დაიმსახურა ხუთი ქულა. მიყვარს ეს ტუში</li>
    <li> Favorite mascara! I have sensitive eyes and this is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t bother me. It looks great on and doesn&#x27;t clump. Lashes are still soft after applying too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara</li>
    <li> great in small package</li>
    <li> recomendado 100% me encanto era lo que queria me riza las pestañas como lo esperaba, compre desde venezuela, original es pequeño</li>
    <li> AvERY VERY CUTE IT CAME QUICK AND WAS BOXED WELLI RECOMMEND TO ALL GoD BLESS + AND pEACE : )</li>
    <li> This mascara is perfect for me, it compliments my eyelashes wonderfully. I would not buy a different brand after using this one. You should give it a try, I highly doubt that you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my female friend. She was very happy. She said it is a good product</li>
    <li> my teenage daughter loves it, guess thats enough for any mother - buy it and try it. glad i did</li>
    <li> Great quality and great price without out having to go look&lt;br /&gt;for it!  This is my favorite mascara.  Always buy this.</li>
    <li> This mascara wand is great!  Separates lashes and coats well.  Perfect for find lashes.  I recomend this product in both the mini or regular size.</li>
    <li> Sucks really bad. Maybe the formula is off. I had one before at Macy&#x27;s. This one at Amazon burns my eyes and smears so bad.</li>
    <li> Love clinique. Bought this in the store and plan to stick with this mascara as long as I can get it!</li>
    <li> I like that it was compact and intense black.  The only thing is that it was runny. Like, I put it on and then it&#x27;s still wet and then I end up with it on my lower lid. It&#x27;s runny.  And it looks like I had too much on my eye.  Not sure how to explain it. So what I do is remove the excess, almost removing all the mascara from the brush.  If I don&#x27;t do that, it will run and it will look like I have racoon eyes.</li>
    <li> This mascara often comes in gift bags (given by Clinique usually for purchases over $30.00). In general, I wait until Clinique has one of these bonuses (probably twice a yr.) I buy some regular price makeup and get a whole bag of goodies, which usually includes this mascara. In general, I love the High Impact mascara. It stays nicely on my eyes for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t come off easily by itself. (My worst part about mascara is when it gets all over my face during the day.) This mascara stays put. It also lasts for a very long time -- even the mini one. If you&#x27;re the type of person who throws out mascaras often due to bacteria contamination, then the mini should suit you perfectly.</li>
