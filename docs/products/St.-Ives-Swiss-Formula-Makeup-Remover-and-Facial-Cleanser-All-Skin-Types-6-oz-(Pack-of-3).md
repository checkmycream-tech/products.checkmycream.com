      <li>I don&#x27;t completely understand why a company that has an excellent product changes it for improvement sake and ultimately compromises the original product.</li>
      <li>I have used these two products for years and loved them but the company who makes them either discontinues the item or changes the product and or packaging, they become unavailable and then when you find them on a site like this they are different and don&#x27;t work as well as the original product.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon for having this product available!</li>
      <li>Loved this product, and have just used up my very last tube of the St. Ives Make-up Remover &amp; Cleanser</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have found this to be the best facial cleanser for me.  It is non-drying, non-irritating and does not leave a film.  I have been unable to find it in 2 local towns, and was pleased to find it on-line.</li>
    <li> Too bad that St. Ives lies and says it is still sending this product to stores, when, in actuality, it is not and consumers are forced to buy from other sources in bulk. It&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;ve used it for years.  And I have tried to replace it, but there is no replacement. Get with it St. Ives and start stocking the stores again</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many, many years and I just love it. It is no longer being sold in retail stores so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. The fact that I got free shipping and was able to use my Discover Card cash back bonus made this a wonderful experience. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Ives makeup remover for over 20 years.  I was told that it is no longer being manufactured after not finding it in stores.  Even an online drugstore doesn&#x27;t have it anymore.  I was sooooo thankful to find it on Amazon.com!!!!  This product removes all eye makeup, even waterproof mascara.  I can rub it right onto my eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or make my eyes bloodshot.  No other product has worked this well for me.  I wish we could petition Unilever to continue manufacturing it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this great product for many years and it cleans my skin and leaves it moisturized.  It does not seem to be available in retail stores, but the price on Amazon is much more than I have paid in the past.</li>
    <li> Awesome face cleanser that I can no longer find it in any stores. Works great to remove makup and keep my skin looking great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why St Ives stopped making this product. it was perfect. great makeup remover, didn&#x27;t sting my eyes. Tissue off then rinse. So simple.&lt;br /&gt; Now they have added an apricot product, tough on your skin, tougher on your eyes. Bad move for St Ives.&lt;br /&gt;somebody sold somebody a bogus idea. Amazon was the only place I could find the St. Ives Swiss Formula. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Can not find this in stores anymore.  Love the way it removes eye make up and does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product!  For some reason St. Ives has decided to take it off the market.  I hope when I need to reorder I will be able to find more.</li>
    <li> This is a product that my mother has been using for years. Since you can no longer get it on stores I found this online. Although what I received was a st. Ives product it isn&#x27;t exactly what is pictured. The stuff has camomile added etc... Thankfully my mother still likes this but I do recommend that the seller change your picture to what you are actually selling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave three stars because it did come very fast and it is still a good product. It is also a good price and worth it. Just like I said before, please change the picture</li>
    <li> I started using this product years ago. Suddenly, I could not find it anywhere.  I am so glad that once again this gentle cleanser is in my possession. This cleanser does not burn your eyes when using it in the shower and gently takes off all of my eye makeup while cleansing my face, as well. I have recommended it to people for years!!!</li>
    <li> best cleanser ever. After the washing my face, I felt my skin is very moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I am little bit dislike a scent, but it is OK.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. I could not find it the stores anymore. I was so glad I found it on line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly ten years and I love it.  The problem is that it&#x27;s difficult to find, so I was glad to see sellers here at Amazon.  You can spend a lot more money for similar products, but I&#x27;d just as soon be economical in my purchases.  PLUS St. Ives does NOT do animal testing -- an important factor for me.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product &amp; time frame I received it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this facial cleanser for two years!  I am delighted&lt;br /&gt;Amazon stocks it and ordered 3 tubes!  I received in two days and love the way my skin feels once again.  It&#x27;s the only facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or dry out my skin.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Product VERY difficult to find in any store/pharmacy etc VERY happy to order it on-line.  Always meets ALL my expectations! Enjoy</li>
    <li> Everything was good.  No surprises.  I have used this product for years and love it!  Glad I was able to find it!</li>
    <li> I have used these two products for years and loved them but the company who makes them either discontinues the item or changes the product and or packaging, they become unavailable and then when you find them on a site like this they are different and don&#x27;t work as well as the original product. My personal history of the product performance is what prompted me to make this purchase. I don&#x27;t completely understand why a company that has an excellent product changes it for improvement sake and ultimately compromises the original product.</li>
    <li> Update:  I am in the market now for a product that is not going to break the bank.  Shame on Amazon for selling this at such an outrageous price of three for $99.  Ridiculous price gouging for a discontinued item.  Shame on St. Ives for not paying attention to its customers to bring it back.  Moving on to better things............I have faith I will find it too.  Judy  (No longer an avid user).&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for probably 20+ years.  I am disappointed to learn that St. Ives has discontinued this product and will no longer be able to get it.  It was by luck that I went on Amazon.com to find it and bought a bunch.  I&#x27;m sure my face will fall off when I run out of this stuff?  LOL&lt;br /&gt;Avid user.  Judy</li>
    <li> Sorry to see this has been discontinued.  Love this and it was so good to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Hope they bring it back.</li>
    <li> I also use the facial sheets, but I am old-fashioned and I also like to use a cream cleanser from time to time.  As long as it is available, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives Swiss Formula Makeup Remover and Facial Cleanser!  It is very gentle and effective--removes all traces of makeup (even mascara!) and leaves your skin so soft.  Has a great fragrance.  I assume it is no longer made since I can&#x27;t find it on St. Ives website, so was grateful Amazon still has sellers!  It is more expensive than what I paid in Walmart and other discount stores, but well worth the extra expense!</li>
    <li> I tried these makeup remover cleansing lotions years ago in Miami and just loved them.  I had been trying to find them on Long Island since that time, and finally found them on Amazon (as I find everything on this site!!).  They are absolutely the best.  I have sensitive skin and this cleanser is easy on the face, removes eye makeup beautifully and leaves my skin soft and radiant.  Thanks you, St. Ives, for great products.  I also love their facial scrub with apricot grains for the once a week exfoliation!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product but it appears that it is no longer available in any stores.  Has St Ives discontinued this product? My wife was very happy that it was still available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using them for  foreveeeeerr, they don&#x27;t make my eyes cry.&lt;br /&gt;they are hard to find, they stopped selling them at walmart.</li>
    <li> This can&#x27;t remove all my makeup. I can notice I still have some of my foundation and eyeliner left on my face after I used it. This product is probably good for skin, but there is no point if it doesn&#x27;t work as a &amp;#34;makeup remover&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Order was packaged appropriately, mailed in a timely fashion, and product was exactly what was ordered.  I love this product for thorough makeup removal and especially mascara removal.  I&#x27;ve used $38.00 that don&#x27;t hold a candle to makeup removal like this St. Ives product.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed the product can no longer be found on store shelves, as it was less costly, but thanks to AMAZON.COM, I was once again after 4 months, able to purchase my favorite makeup remover product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and will continue using as long as it is available and I can purchased it.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite face wash. It never breaks me out, it&#x27;s super gentle, and it even removes non-waterproof makeup like a champ.  St. Ives claims no animal testing too, but I don&#x27;t know the policy now that Unilever acquired it. It&#x27;s about four dollars at the grocery store, but all our local ones stopped carrying it...fortunately, it&#x27;s pretty cheap on Amazon, and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser and delighted that it is on Amazon since it is not in stores anymore.  Very gentle but thorough cream cleanser that gets makeup off and doesn&#x27;t strip the skin. Please keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> I looked for makeup remover that I liked better without finding anything.  This is the best product for the money.  It can&#x27;t be found in stores any longer so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  If you follow the tips of beauty experts and leave it on for a minute to 90 seconds it removes all makeup including waterproof mascara.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 15+ years and love it. It gets all kinds of makeup off, doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes and isn&#x27;t greasy or gritty. Washes off clean and leaves my skin soft without residue. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere on the shelves. It has been discontinued. Used to pay less than $3.00 for a tube and it lasted a couple of months. Was happy to find it on amazon. Hope St. Ives changes their mind and it comes back. There are so many great beauty products out there this has happened to. Sign of the times I guess.</li>
    <li> While it works well to remove makeup it does not lather up when applied to face- stays more like a lotion consistency. It would be good for sensitive skin but I was looking for something that would be better at facial cleansing.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Doesn&#x27;t wash off makeup at all.  As a regular face cleanser it leaves your skin somewhat oily and slick - doesn&#x27;t feel refreshing at all.</li>
    <li> It was priced too High, it was only $3.59 at Wal Mart. I have used St.Ives about 15 years. great</li>
    <li> My favorite facial cleanser !! want it back!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least  10 years and I love it . It&#x27;s great for removing eye makeup. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so am happy I can still buy it through amazon.</li>
    <li> I was so happy with the arrival of my product.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find St. Ives Makeup Remover in the stores anywhere so Amazon came to my rescue!!  I love this product and have used it for years.  Amazon delivered very quickly!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product to cleanse my face. It is so smooth &amp; feels so good; not easy to find tho, could only get it&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon. Used to buy it at Walmart but they no longer carry it. Thank you so much for stocking this product.&lt;br /&gt;It has made me very happy for many years &amp; I was so afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it any more. Can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;stand those scrub cleansers, they make my skin feel awful... love the smooth creamy skin cleanser by St. Ives.&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much...</li>
    <li> Wish I could find more of the St Ives Swiss Formula Makeup Remover &amp; Facial Cleanser.  I have search high and low for this and can not find it anywhere.  I am using my last tube and don&#x27;t know what to do next.  All the St Ives Cleaners now have scrub beads that irritate my face.  Let me know if you have anymore of this.</li>
    <li> This has always been a very good product, taking off makeup or daily dirt and grime. Yet it also does not dry out your skin. Highly recommended.  What really surprised me is that I ordered this yesterday, and it was delivered today! So, great, fantastic service from this seller.</li>
    <li> It was just what I had expected.great product for people of my age.would be willing to recommend this product to all my women friends</li>
    <li> Have used this item for years.  It is getting harder and harder to locate in the stores in my area.  Recommend this to anyone who refuses to use soap on their face - not oily or drying.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> This facial cleaner got good reviews and the price was reasonable so I decided to give it a try but I&#x27;m not happy with it. It doesn&#x27;t remove all your make up and after washing your face with it..it leaves a weird residue on your skin. I had to use other facial cleansers to clean my skin after using this. My skin didn&#x27;t feel fresh and clean..bummer</li>
    <li> I wish they haven&#x27;t discontinued making this, I love it, feels great and smooth !!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20 years and nothing is more gentler in taking off my makeup. I am so upset its been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and like it better than many much more expensive cleansers.  Have not been able to get it locally recently so was especially pleased to find it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been using this product for years. It does not burn my eyes or cause my face to break out. Excellent makeup recover and facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> the cream is too thin...dont like it</li>
    <li> This is something my wife uses everyday and Amazon is the only one that sells it. It is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. But I will not be held hostage by the sellers and their overinflated prices. I guess it is their right according to the philosophy of supply and demand, but shame on the manufacturer for not asking us how we felt about their product.</li>
    <li> Loved this product, and have just used up my very last tube of the St. Ives Make-up Remover &amp; Cleanser (I&#x27;d bought two 5 pack packages on Amazon a few months ago).    If you&#x27;d like to tell Unilever to bring the product back, you can email them at:  [...]</li>
    <li> If you have skin allergies or your allergic to different things this is a great cleanser and has no sent so it won&#x27;t irritate your skin straight forward cleanser love it</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. My dissatisfaction has to do with the seller and the three random pieces. This product must be discontinued by the manufacturer because it has become very difficult to find even on the internet which has resulted in excessive pricing. I have been buying this product for more than 10 years. I used to purchase it between $2.50 and $3.00 per unit. This purchase was from a private person who seems to have found individual units who grouped and sold them as a threesome. The packages were different designs in a box loose. I was skeptical as to how old each unit was and they were clearly all bought separately by her at various times. I have a concern whether any were used. This is my dissatisfaction. On top of that, she price gauged at a whopping $15 each. I have kept her return address label in the event that there is an issue when I use any of the units.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup remover but I have dry skin and is perfect for me because removes all the dirt and makeup without any problem and no fragance that damage my eyes.  I love it and the price could not be better.  But is for dry skin not oily skin!!!! I have been using it for a long time and still continue ordering it!!!! Is the best to remove heavy makeup!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT AND  GLAD THAT I FOUND IT ON  LINE, AS IIT IS DISCONTIUED AT THE STORES. MY SISTER BOUGHT 9 TUBES.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic, gentle, value priced facial cleanser that used to be available in stores and can no longer find. Have tried many other brands at all price points but this is still the best! Thanks to Amazon for having this product available!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad. I bought six of them.  When they run out, I&#x27;ll find a replacement .  Hope it&#x27;s as good!</li>
    <li> why can I find this in stores anymore. It is the only thing my skin likes. I hope these three tubes last forever. this stuff really is the best. !ST IVES!! MAKE MORE!!</li>
    <li> As an esthetician I will share an opinion...&lt;br /&gt;For the amount of time a cleanser spends on the face, it need not be fancy or expensive, only effective.  This product delivers two things:  removes makeup (yup, awesome on eye makeup too), dirt, and oil &amp; leaves the skin balanced (neither oily, nor dry).  Plus, it manages to do it without irritating you or your wallet. Put your money toward something that will spend time on your face, like a moisturizer, spf or serum crafted to achieve something throughout the day.  I have tried tons of products over the years and this one is Golden!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years - love it!  Sure glad I found it - My stores don&#x27;t have it anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the most gentle, yet effective, face cleanser!  Everything else I&#x27;ve tried has caused my skin to break out.  The sad, sad part of the story is is that St. Ives discontinued this so buy up whatever is left.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes. Been using it for years. So sad to see it get discontinued. At least I have enough to last me for quite some time!</li>
    <li> Used it for 25-30 years ....  Very upset it is disappearing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this make up remover for years.  I love the way it takes makeup off without drying out my skin.  Would recommend using this for everyone.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find locally.  Thanks for great product</li>
    <li> the BEST!!!!  I love this product.  It leaves my skin soft and moist.  Very gentle and easy, does not dry out.  I cant find it in the stores anymore so thankfully Amazon has them!!  I will be ordering them again very soon!</li>
    <li> Cleans off makeup well.  I use a cotton pad to wipe off eye makeup after applying, then wash off face with water.  No smell, no stinging eyes.  I have used this product for years.  Received on time.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed a makeup remover.  Let&#x27;s be clear.  This is NOT makeup remover.  It is a cleanser.  If it IS a makeup remover, it is too dense and does not adequately remove eye makeup without tugging.  And it does not remove waterproof mascara at all.  I now have 3 of these sitting in my closet because I don&#x27;t need a cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for years, and I have never been able to find a better product.  It does a nice job of removing makeup without drying out my skin.  I have sensitive skin, and I have never experienced a problem with this product.</li>
    <li> So sorry this is being discontinued. It&#x27;s the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> You need to bring this item back!!!!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite cleanser/makeup remover. Smells pretty, cleans gently, leaves skin fresh, soft &amp; clean :)</li>
