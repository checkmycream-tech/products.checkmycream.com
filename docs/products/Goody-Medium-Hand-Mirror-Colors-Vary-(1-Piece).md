<li> Also slightly smaller than expected.</li>
<li> Call it slightly lazy if you will, but it saved me from having to go outside of my home to look for a similar item.  </li>
<li> a little smaller</li>

<li> The reflective surface is roughly 4 in tall by about 3 1/4 inches wide at its widest point</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a large stylist&#x27;s mirror like you might be expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> Received it in black.</li>
<li> Just don&#x27;t drop it on a hard surface or treat it too roughly</li>
<li> but is too small for what I needed.</li>
<li> Small crack in the mirror at the bottom.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s so small.  </li>
<li> A small, handheld mirror that isn&#x27;t deformed or going to break in your hand.  </li>
<li> But, it is a small mirror.</li>
<li> Everyone used to have them, but now they&#x27;re hard to find except on Amazon!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This is a very small hand mirror.  </li>
<li> I found a few remaining ones on Amazon with no color choice, but I was desperate as over the years, I would drop them on the bathroom floor and they would break.</li>
<li> poor discription.  </li>
<li> Mirror quality is not great.</li>
<li> Not happy.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s still sticky and irritating.</li>
<li> It did have one of those horrible stickers on it though, that leaves a lot of nasty residue.</li>

    <li> nice size for almost any use.</li>
    <li> Not was I was expecting. Mirror quality is not great. It works but I would buy another one!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a standard sized hand held mirror.  I read the description to this item which says 8 5/8&amp;#34; medium handheld mirror. So I thought it was exactly what I was looking for.  However when I received it 2 days later it was tiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great for traveling bc it&#x27;s so small.  The whole item measures around 8 inches in length and the mirror part itself is about 3-4 inches in width.  Decent product just a lot smaller than expected.  Would be helpful to buyers if the description stated something like travel size mirror or something to that effect.</li>
    <li> Great Product Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> poor discription.  actual mirror is small and flimsey</li>
    <li> a little smaller then I thought it was</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected and mirrored on one side only</li>
    <li> This is a perfect size for what I needed! It fits wonderfully when packing a small toiletries bag to go on vacation.</li>
    <li> Perfect sized, decent quality.  I use it for cutting my own hair.  Received it in black.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted for looking at the back of my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at Amazon.  Call it slightly lazy if you will, but it saved me from having to go outside of my home to look for a similar item.  It saved me from having to This mirror is very economical.  I needed the mirror specifically to check the rear of my hairstyles.  It is perfect!</li>
    <li> This mirror does the trick...since the only thing a mirror has to do is produce a reflection. Its your basic plastic and glass mirror. It&#x27;s compact, somewhat sturdy and cheap. That&#x27;s all you could ask for.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror. Just the right size. It did have one of those horrible stickers on it though, that leaves a lot of nasty residue. Thankfully it wasn&#x27;t on the mirror surface, just the plastic back. But it&#x27;s still sticky and irritating.</li>
    <li> IMPORTANT: 8.625 inches is the length INCLUDING the handle. The reflective surface of this mirror is only 3.75 inches high and 3.5 inches wide. I thought 8.625 inches was the size of the reflective portion. I was pleasantly surprised because this smaller mirror fits better in my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real-glass mirror is resistant to scratches (better than plastic), but this means it could break into sharp pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction seems good.</li>
    <li> I love these mirrors.  Lighweight and easy to use.  Everyone used to have them, but now they&#x27;re hard to find except on Amazon!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller! FAST shipping, HIGHLY recommended! Thank you! AAA+++</li>
    <li> Great mirror for the price. It&#x27;s not as big as a full size mirror and makes it easier to store in a drawer!</li>
    <li> Good little mirror but is too small for what I needed.</li>
    <li> solid construction, and it&#x27;s a mirror - it reflects light. Don&#x27;t know how much there really is to say about it, except that the measurement given is height of the whole thing, including handle... not the mirror area itself. The reflective surface is roughly 4 in tall by about 3 1/4 inches wide at its widest point</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s an inexpensive hand mirror, but NO, it&#x27;s not green. It&#x27;s black. Plastic. Looks very cheap, and not at all like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a green mirror for our high school&#x27;s Wizard of Oz production (the beauticians of Oz), and I will have to paint this to make it work. Not happy.</li>
    <li> Just picked up today from the front desk. Small crack in the mirror at the bottom. Also slightly smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not as large as I thought it was but it will work.  The pictures on Amazon need to be better so you know exactly what you are getting.</li>
    <li> One important thing I wish I had understood prior to purchasing was the 8&amp;#34; 5/8 measurement is vertical, not horizontal.  Mirror is tiny.</li>
    <li> Nice and small and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Frankly, this was a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; to bring up the amount of the purchases to qualify for free delivery.  As mirrors go, I find this one too small for the bathroom and too large for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is a very small hand mirror.  The 8 5/8\\&quot; is the entire length of the including the handle.  The mirror would be okay for traveling.</li>
    <li> Does what it was intended for, I use it to lighten rooms light by candles in my one room cabin high in the Alaska Wilderness during the long long nights when I lay cradled in my thermal sleeping bag and read thrilling tales of 1930&#x27;s pulp science fiction magazines and fall asleep dreaming myself the hero of multitudes of damsels in distress somewhere in the universe. (It&#x27;s a well made mirror, I liked it).</li>

    <li> This mirror does the job and was a good price.  It&#x27;s made a little better than the mirror I picked up at the local wally world.</li>
    <li> Mirror is of a nice durable quality. Just the right size to see how my hairdo looks from the back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect little mirror for me to travel with</li>
    <li> I returned this because it was really flimsy and the the mirror was warped and much smaller than what I was expecting for the width.  Basically it looks like the junk you find at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> i know the size is in the description but the 99 cent store sells this mirror and a slightly bigger one for - well 99 cents.</li>
    <li> The over all size of the mirror is 8 5/8&amp;#34;, not the viewing area. I was expecting a larger mirror to arrive, and was surprised by the tiny one that did. Works great, not green mine is more of a beige.</li>
    <li> Nice little mirror to keep in the bathroom.  I use it to check the back of my hair every morning.</li>
    <li> Decent hand mirror, affordable price too. Though the color was not green</li>
    <li> The mirror is very high quality. But, it is a small mirror. The reflective area is about the size of the palm of an adult hand. It&#x27;s not a large stylist&#x27;s mirror like you might be expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a low rating to get the attention of the seller and potential buyers. The seller should put something in the picture to show the scale of the picture and therefore the size of the item. Seller, please advise when it is fixed... I will update to a 5 star rating when the picture is fixed since it is a high quality item for people who want a small mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a handy mirror to have in the bathroom. It&#x27;s not too big or bulky, just the right size.</li>
    <li> This is a simple, small, hand held mirror that I use in my bathroom. My local drugstores used to carry them in many colors, but no longer. I found a few remaining ones on Amazon with no color choice, but I was desperate as over the years, I would drop them on the bathroom floor and they would break. This mirror is the right size for use in my bathroom. They do not have a magnifying side, they are just a simple, hand held mirror.</li>
    <li> Not much to say really.  It&#x27;s what I expected at a good price and it came on time packaged well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you would expect to get for the price.  A small, handheld mirror that isn&#x27;t deformed or going to break in your hand.  Just don&#x27;t drop it on a hard surface or treat it too roughly and it will serve its purpose for years.</li>
    <li> I needed a new mirror at the barber shop and added this to my order from my phone without reading the last review.&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing from tip of the handle to the very top, is only the size of my hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a basic mirror at a basic price. Nothing more to say.</li>
