<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Read great reviews and how good it smelled, but only smelled it when I put it on and never again afterwards, don&#x27;t see a difference after using it</li>
    <li> Only used once. So far so good.</li>
    <li> actually，I don&#x27;t like this smells very very  tropic coco-vanilla perfumes，but ogx keratin oil is very effective hard to get something like this frizz free hair serum in Japan. you&#x27;d know it feel smooth to obsess with finger-combing anytime.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this product!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is rich of a blend of coconut and cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;I literally couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my hair!&lt;br /&gt;My hair turned from beaver brown to a vibrant brunette with a few sprits and a good combing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair actually grew an inch in a week from this.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, am definitely suggesting this to my friends!</li>
    <li> This oil is great! Makes my daughter hair shine!</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this as an after spray to add some shine to my dull hair but I was NOT looking for my hair to look as if I dumped a bucket of vegetable oil on it, even with just 2 sprays near the ends.   I typically LOVE OGX products but this one I could do without. Chi makes a much better product.</li>
    <li> Its WONDERFUL... its not oily or heavy! It smells GREAT... and doesn&#x27;t have a residue. I have used it on my hair and my human hair wigs and it&#x27;s wonderful on both.</li>
    <li> Liked it but didnt love it .smells great though. Nice for the price</li>
    <li> This is great for my hair. I love Organix brand, it makes my hair like silk and it&#x27;s amazing. Love the shine the simmer oil gives my hair. Warning: a little goes a LONG way. So use NO MORE than 2 sprays, and from a good distance away from your hair, otherwise your hair will look oily and in need of washing.</li>
    <li> have been using this oil for two years now .....could not ask for more lasts a year for me as it requires very little amount of application ...brings life to hair shiny healthy looking hairs.</li>
    <li> This gives my red hair so much shine, and people compliment on it!</li>
    <li> This stuff smell amazing and makes my hair so shinny! I would repurchase this and recommend it to friends! Love</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this confusing it for the Organix coconut milk. I did not like this. It made my hair feel dry and I didn&#x27;t see much shine. My daughter loved it however and used it every morning after she beach waved her hair.</li>
    <li> Smellls so good and it does help my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It also smells nice.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my hair smooth and shiny. Don&#x27;t put too much for it will just make your hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> This I love for my Keratin Treatment Collection. I love it that its good sleek and the size is very good. Thanks to the seller. Got it at a good time.</li>
    <li> Would have a fit if I could not find this product anymore. Please, always have it. Shine and smell is fantastic. Lots of people sell their products as one thing but this company delivers +++</li>
    <li> The reviews for.this product puzzle me. Pictured above is a finishing spray, not a whole system. The back of the bottle says \\&quot;use as a finishing spray. Spray evenly on hair for radiant, glossy glow all day. Can also apply to towel dry hair for extra moisture\\&quot;. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this finishing spray for a while and love it. The smell is heavenly...vanilla. I have fine straight hair and it can get greasy looking with too much product, so I mist it in the air and brush through with a boar bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand there is a whole keratin system, but THIS product is not that!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, it&#x27;s light, airy, smooths the hair, nice light scent.  Softens and gently straightens.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> it leaves my hair shinny and soft. My hair is so dry I use it everyday - I spray on the ends and it also has a great small - doesnt leave my hair heavy - i love it</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shinning! I love it and Wil buy again</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really pretty and soft. Only draw back is if you get acne really easy it&#x27;ll break you out along your hairline. Other than that it works great!</li>
    <li> Smells really well and works nice in your hair.</li>
    <li> If you have thick, wavy hair like I do this product makes it so smooth and easy to style. I always have fly-aways in my hair, but ever since I&#x27;ve used this I don&#x27;t have any problem with them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this if you have my hair type since I cannot speak for anyone else&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I tried the Organix Keratin Treatment and I bought this to help maintain it. My hair is super smooth, shiny, soft, and smells great. I use this after straightening my hair. I spray some on a brush and then brush my hair. You can reapply it during the day without looking too greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a mere 2 days and am entirely happy with it. I applied it after my shower, focusing on the ends of my hair where I have the most damage and in the morning I noticed a major improvement after straightening my hair. After straightening, I misted all over, running my hands through my hair to distribute evenly and then sprayed additional onto the ends and had super soft hair all day without any greasiness. The smell is amazing with a tropical scent and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> I used to use Garnier Sleek and Shine Sleek Finish 5-In-1 Serum Spray on my very long color treated hair. It did make my hair shinier, but it also made it look a bit greasy at times. It didn&#x27;t really do much for my split ends at all. Then I found this product. After using this two times, I took my stock up supply of the Garnier product and handed it all to my teenage daughter. I need something that really helps hair look healthy and helps with split ends. This does the job 10 times better than what I had been using and I don&#x27;t get that weighted down oily feeling when using it. My daughter doesn&#x27;t have a split ends issue, so the Garnier is fine for her. However, my needs are a bit more intensive so this is the product I will be using going forward. Plus I love the way it makes my hair smell. I use this combined with a flat iron spray by the same company and my hair has never looked healthier.</li>
    <li> i like it! It does what u expect from the product. The delivery was on time n was packaged properly.</li>
    <li> because I think my hair isn&#x27;t as strong as it could be. I noticed a difference in shine as well as texture (my hair is really curly) after the second use. And it smells soo good!</li>
    <li> i love it  my hair become good</li>
    <li> Moisturizes my hair and gives a nice sheen to my thick natural coarse. Also soften and detangles my hair. I use it daily and you only need a few sprays. This product has a nice clean fragrance also.</li>
    <li> Smells great but I&#x27;m not sure it does anything special to my hair itself that other cheaper products too. I have long thick hair and doesn&#x27;t really control frizz much or give me that smooth look.</li>
    <li> i love it.  make your hair shiny but it has a strong smell to coconut, i guess you should expect that since is made of that ingredient too!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this made my hair shiny or better in any way.  I now use Argon oil only and it works.</li>
    <li> Dont really oil my hair that much but it has a very nice smell..</li>
    <li> not to oily. great on her scalp.</li>
    <li> not work I don&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and as expected.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair shimmer nicely, just try not to spray in too much or your hair will look greasy.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how good this product is !!! I have very long chemically damaged blonde hair that is additionally puffy and wavy. After year and years of tryinf literally almost everything on the market in terms of harid care products (both cheap and high end) I purchased this intrigued by the good reviews. All it takes are a few spritzes on wet hair (not dry hair though, it must be wet or at least damp) and Tah-Dah! You don&#x27;t feel the effect instantly, it&#x27;s like a surprise after your hair dries. My hair has become incredibly soft, silky, smooth and managable. Something I haven&#x27;t felt in years! As this was my first OGX product purchase I am now rushing off to buy some more from this Keratin series. Ans it smells delighfully too! The smell is very strong at first but then becomes just right. This product gets five stars, I would give it six if I could!</li>
    <li> Feels good on my hair</li>
    <li> Love this. It makes my dry coarse hair soft, shinny and frizz free.</li>
    <li> It did help to keep my very long hair straight and frizz free. I like the fragrance. I think the pump is too tight for one handed operation, especially when your fingers are already oily from spreading the product through your hair.</li>
    <li> The product is really good and arrived fast. I just did not like the smell.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Smells great, not greasy, helps with fly-aways and humidity.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works well on my hair and smells good.</li>
    <li> Hair stays soft and shinny throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love this I have other product for Organix. Helps the frizz and shine your Brazilian bundle hair without putting build up on hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps a lot to tame the frizzes</li>
    <li> Little goes a long way</li>
    <li> The best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I normally use only salon products.  But this product is just as good if not better than any other Keratin Oil I have tried on the market, and I&#x27;ve used many.  Price is awesome too.  Hydrates and closes cuticle without leaving hair oily.  Love it.  A Keratin must have.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. i did a keratin treatment and using this product to keep it straight.</li>
    <li> WOW! So when I first sprayed it on I thought it left my hair looking really oily and greasy.  I went back to the mirror just moments later and the greasy look was gone and my hair felt great and smelled great too.  So happy I found this product thanks to other customer reviews.</li>
    <li> smells great and softens my hair.</li>
    <li> I have course, thick curly hair that is very cry and dull. a few spritzes of this works wonders and adds shine to my hair! I use it in conjunction with this brand of shampoo and conditioner and conditioning mask and these are by far my favorite products ever!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and provides a really nice shine to your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gives my hair a healthy shimmering look without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells fantastic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard tons of reviews on Keratin oil so of course I had to try it myself &amp; I must say that this is the best oil I have EVER used on my hair. My hair is a little longer than shoulder length &amp; can get tangled if I don&#x27;t brush it often. I sprayed this oil on my hair &amp; gently rubbed it in &amp; brushed it through &amp; WOW, it went right through without struggle! It also kept my hair from tangling for the remainder of the day! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Use this lightly to give shine between washes.  Avoid the roots, spray the mid to end sections.  Looks frizz free and gorgeous every time.</li>
    <li> this is the most light hair dressing and so shiny.. you will live our. I love it. and so inexpensive. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have very thick long coarse dry hair, I used this product with a flat iron. I now have silky beautiful hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for this for YEARS!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  It is really hard to find in stores now so I&#x27;m glad I can order from Amazon.  It smells great; reminds me of the beach.  Makes my hair shiny, soft and controllable with flat iron; great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m beyond mad. Opened the package to oil everything.  The package had my see&lt;br /&gt;Cell cases in it. Now I ordered oil only to have none once it gets here  .</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> My hair loves this stuff and I love the smell!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  a good product, but it leaves a smell of coconut oil in my hair for a while. If you don&#x27;t mind the faint odor, you&#x27;ll really like this product!</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  It really makes my hair shine, and brings out my highlights!</li>
    <li> This is a healthy, non-greasy way to add shine to your hair and reduce frizz.</li>
    <li> excellent in every way</li>
    <li> This is one of the greatest products I&#x27;ve ever utilized!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so shiny and smooth! Plus it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> spray bottle leaked and does not spray</li>
    <li> Excellent product to use daily on dry hair. Shipment was fast too.</li>
