      <li>I have purchased several additional bottles for family members and they love it also!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Magnesium Oil has many benefits beyond what it&#x27;s done for me so far.  </li>
      <li>Once I received this oil, I put it on right away.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that Magnesium isn&#x27;t well absorbed by the digestive system.  </li>
      <li>I really like it so far and will continue to use more each day.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I ever used Magnesium oil.</li>
      <li>I used it first as a sleep aid.  </li>

    <li> I had really sore muscles after working out and was pleasantly surprised with the difference it made in recovery of my muscle cramps and recovery time. In the beginning it felt a bit itchy and warm, but I actually enjoyed that. This went away within a couple of minutes. Great product, really like it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever used Magnesium oil. Well, I have to say after a couple of days using it I could significantly notice a relief in my elbow...will continue to use this oil because it&#x27;s oderless and actually works!</li>
    <li> We are still in the beginning stages of using this to help with some sleep issues. What I can tell you is that this stuff BURNS.. I mean really burns if your hands are at all dry or if you have the tiniest paper cut. I found that mixing it with a little bit of carrier oil helped a bit but beware.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have purchased several additional bottles for family members and they love it also!</li>
    <li> Well packaged. As a deodorant it is the most effective product I have tried. As a sleep aid, it is also very helpful. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This magnesium oil ultrapure spray comes in at 10 ounce bottle, 300 ML&#x27;s and includes a free e-book. It&#x27;s great to be sore muscles, Cramps, restless legs, joints, headaches and migraines and other bodily aches. With over $300 functions requiring magnesium this minerals considered one of the best natural remedies. To be applied on the skin transdermally  for the most effective way for the body to absorb magnesium and to regulate the biochemical reaction in the body such as muscle nerve function. I work with the child is autistic and has cerebral palsy and after a bath I do his exercises and I have been rubbing this into his legs and it&#x27;s made doing his physical therapy a lot easier .</li>
    <li> Just started using it and I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> great stuff makes a real difference, real good for you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a member of a Facebook group, Magnesium Advocacy.  I know my magnesium levels are low and when I tried taking one form of magnesium, it didn&#x27;t agree with me very well.  I wasn&#x27;t aware that Magnesium isn&#x27;t well absorbed by the digestive system.  It&#x27;s much more difficult to absorb if you are low in vitamin D, lack in gut bacteria or have other issues.  I am low in Vitamin D and have gut issues. I&#x27;d read about Magnesium Oil in this group, that it might be a better option, and had considered trying it.  I was given the opportunity to try MAG Essentials Magnesium Oil at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.  This is my experience so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it very long, but it HAS made a difference.  I&#x27;ve had muscle spasms in the area of my shoulder blade for the past five days.  There was no discernible reason, nothing I had done (to the best of my knowledge) to cause this.  I&#x27;ve sprayed Magnesium Oil on the affected area and it appears to be helping where muscle relaxants, pain killers, and laying on a heating pad wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium Oil has many benefits beyond what it&#x27;s done for me so far.  I highly recommend doing personal research and looking into the Facebook Magnesium Advocacy group I&#x27;ve mentioned.  The group has people who are knowledgeable about Magnesium, it&#x27;s benefits, and they often post research on this subject.</li>
    <li> Very GOO:D!!! Great product for a really great price.</li>
    <li> work great i have knee and shoulder pain and this work fast and last long</li>
    <li> Works well as a massage oil with the addition of a calming affect. I&#x27;ve been using this on my feet before bedtime and do think it has helped relax my restless legs. Is slightly sticky after you rub it in, but does soak in pretty quickly. No smell or odor. Bottle is a very generous size. I received a discount on this item in exchange for a review. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Doing a great job working on my tight stiff neck muscles that cause my Migraines.  I have been using this Magnesium oil for about a week and spraying it onto my neck for tightness and to help with my Migraines.  I have not sprayed my whole body yet, I want to start slow.  The oil sprays just were you want it and does not leave a very oily or sticky feeling.  It has been helping with my neck muscles and I think it is helping keep my Headaches, Migraines at bay.  I think it has helped with my neck and plan to keep using it.  I really like it so far and will continue to use more each day.  I think it is a great product to get my magnesium in and would recommend.  This Magnesium Oil seems to be of good quality and the bottle is huge.  I will post some pictures.  I did receive this at a discount my honest unbiased opinion and would recommend.  Also. Maxine&#x27;s with a free ebook.</li>
    <li> It seems every time I find a product on here with stellar 5 star reviews it Always has been a free item or discounted item for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review. Every other similar product that people have to buy with no discounts has lesser stars. I am so glad this site is cracking down on this practice. This product is not for me the best one is from the Dead Sea and is more concentrated. Not for me.</li>
    <li> This oil does not have a scent, it rubs in very well into the skin and works amazing! I can immediately feel it working. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy at all. It does come in a spray bottle so it&#x27;s super easy to use. I really love it! I did receive it a discounted price to review.</li>
    <li> This is a great pure oil! I love the effect it has on my sore muscles.&lt;br /&gt;I apply after my bath and sleep like a baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times I used it, it would sting a little.  However that doesn&#x27;t occur any longer.  Maybe because I don&#x27;t have soo many toxins as I did in the beginning.</li>
    <li> Found it to help relieve soreness.  Had Stem Cell Injections recently which left me sore in areas.  After sufficient time to heal the puncture, have been spraying with it on spots of injections.  Soreness is almost totally gone.  Also spraying bottom of feet at night, helps you sleep so much better.  Am a firm believer of Magnesium use.</li>
    <li> My personal trainer told me about magnesium oil and I decided to give it a try. I used it for my sore muscles and cramps I always have after a good workout. I felt a small tingling sensation however no burning or pain. About 15-20 minutes after application i saw a little white residu on the places I sprayed the oil. I knew this could happen, it&#x27;s depending on the type of skin one has. I rinsed it off with a washcloth after 15 minutes. And the results? Well, my muscles were indeed aching a lot less than normal. Plus, i noticed I had a very deep sleep. Up until now i am sold!</li>
    <li> I bought this magnesium oil at my local sportschool and used it for the last two weeks. I love spraying it on my feet before going to bed because I really sleep better after using it. I can recommend it to everyone. I didn&#x27;t test it for my sore muscles,  but hope it does its magic for that as well. On the ebook, I was impressed by the content that gave me lots of insight in the benefits of this mineral.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read a bit about magnesium oil but wasn&#x27;t sure how much of a difference it would make.  I can tell you that this stuff is wonderful!  I used it first as a sleep aid.  To my amazement, I had one of the most deep and refreshing sleeps that I&#x27;ve had in a very long time.  I bought a second bottle to share with a friend who always has sleep issues and he is amazed as well.  I have since used it for muscle relief after an intense workout.  The results haven&#x27;t been as dramatic as its efficacy as a sleep aid, but the difference in muscle soreness is noticeable. The complimentary e-book is also very helpful.</li>
    <li> The spray is great, no odor and it is not sticky.  It does burn at first, but I have sensitive skin, first use, it was bad, it gradually is getting better the more I use it.</li>
    <li> What the heck is magnesium oil? I still don’t really know, and I’ve used it. But it’s kind of awesome. I decided to test this simply because I’ve taken edible magnesium powder before, and been impressed with its calming and soothing powers. This stuff is as confusing when you get it as when you order it. It’s colorless, odorless, it’s an oil in a spray bottle, and it tingles when you put it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maker suggests applying it to sore muscles, rubbing it into the bottoms of your feet 20 minutes before bed for restful sleep, and just generally spraying it on yourself. Okay? Well ....it works! It really does help me sleep well without feeling at all drugged when I wake up, and I’ve used it several times on my right arm which is always sore from too much computer use and it reduces the soreness within about an hour. I was wound up, tense and anxious today and that made my stomach tense and sore. I sprayed some on my stomach and rubbed it in, and again within an hour the pain and tension was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don’t know what the blazes this stuff is, but I like what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> This gave my husband and I an awful rash within a few hours of trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also had leaked all over when I received it.</li>
    <li> I have been really benefitting from this Magnesium Oil Spray. I work out a lot and get sore muscles constantly. Once I received this oil, I put it on right away. After waiting only a couple of minutes, I felt the my soreness go down a little. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for what I call shaky leg (aka restless leg syndrome) lol.  I just spray it on my feet and in a matter of a few minutes things calm down so I can sleep.  I had another brand of magnesium oil and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  Love this stuff!!</li>
