<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This lipstick is not creamy like the other mac lipsticks I bought. It may be because I&#x27;ve never used this one and it needs to worn in, but I like my matte lipsticks a bit on the dry side. They tend to stay longer that way. I loved the color, it was a nice dark maroon color. It&#x27;s not an every day color for me, but it looked good. I am very pale skinned with red hair and I was glad that it looked good on me.</li>
    <li> This color has just been released again as part of the &#x27;Rocky Horror&#x27; collection.  The only difference is the packaging.  This is a&lt;br /&gt;nice deep burgundy color when applied.</li>
    <li> 😬😬😬😬 not what I expected</li>
    <li> Amazing! Love it! Perfect color!</li>
    <li> Love the listing don&#x27;t wear it as often as I thought I would</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color ! I&#x27;m a fair brown skin tone . the color compliments me . It&#x27;s not a red color it&#x27;s more of a orange/brownish color if applied enough it&#x27;s beautiful for the fall!</li>
    <li> Was sceptical initially but went ahead and bought I have no regrets whatsoever as it is as good as one purchased from Mac store. Smells very nice like any mac lipstick and I&#x27;m happy. Shipping was quick 😀</li>
    <li> This lipstick is not discontinued, it is permanent! I am a MAC artist:)</li>
    <li> The best lipstick I&#x27;ve ever owned, bar none. Makes me look like a pinup girl. I&#x27;ve lost my stick, so next paycheck I&#x27;ll be buying another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes wonderfully with my ginger/blonde features. They need to undiscontinue it post-haste.</li>
    <li> It requires lip liner. Very smooth and makes lips feel silky and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love the color so much. It really says &amp;#34;sin&amp;#34; whenever I wear it. It;s so dark, so red, so luscious and so hot, all at the same time. I love the perfect mate texture too that lasts all day. I only have to reapply about 2 to 3 times. Love it!</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware. I am a die-hard M.A.C consumer, so when I saw this on sale, I was really excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be safe, I contacted M.A.C cosmetics&#x27; consumer care division inquiring about this Amazon retailer. The retailer is NOT a M.A.C account. M.A.C therefore has no control over this account&#x27;s product quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is an excerpt of the email I got from M.A.C&#x27;s consumer care unit:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Products sold to our authorized accounts are genuine M.A.C. Amazon is not one of our accounts and we have no control over the merchandise that they sell. Further, we have no way of knowing how they obtained our products. In this circumstance, we are unable to assume responsibility for unauthorized representation of our product.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> As someone who is always wearing MAC, my favorite product of theirs is the lipstick. If you are not familiar with MAC note when looking at the lipstick whether it is matte or not. This product is matte. I like matte finish because I like wearing a lip shine of some kind. It&#x27;s  all personal peference.&lt;br /&gt;Eryn Olstad-Fischer</li>
    <li> This is the color I have been looking for.......perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. It is the exact same color when you paint your lips, and it stays on.</li>
    <li> those bitches that work at Mac don&#x27;t deserve you&#x27;re money it&#x27;s a retarded brand and they think they are better than everyone don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Shipping was great. Product was as I expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice knock off.  Color is nice but it looks very dry once applied. Rubs off real fast.  Not long lasting color</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!! I will purchase more Mac lipstick in the near future.</li>
    <li> this its a amazing color perdurable and smooth im love it great seller im higher recommended</li>
    <li> I love this shade.  I just wore it to a show I played (I&#x27;m a singer in a band) and got a lot of compliments on it.  It&#x27;s a beautiful shade of dark maroon, almost bordering on deep purple.  It has a matte finish which I like a lot.  The quality is good.  This seems like an authentic MAC product so the quality is there.  It was not used or anything like that and was new when opened.</li>
    <li> Perfect matte finish...no distorted texture like some of the cheaper drugstore brands.  Beautiful dark color!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Its beautiful and stays on long.</li>
    <li> Love it! It was delivered on time, and it was packaged safe and sound!</li>
    <li> Love the color and the texture and quality are great</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick. Get compliments every time</li>
    <li> way to dark for my complexion</li>
    <li> The product is overpriced and it&#x27;s label is misleading since the Mac Online store still has it for $16. I tried to do a return, but they wouldn&#x27;t let me. Very disappointing,</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes this product thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Perfect shade for my lips! I always wear this in work and it looks really great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that color what I saw in online</li>
    <li> Great product! It even came in a cute pink mesh bag :) and it got to me faster than I thought!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color last a long time as well</li>
    <li> Love it. As soon as I saw it I fell in love with this lip stick!! Got it on time can&#x27;t wait to have my make up done. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This color IS NOT discontinued... It&#x27;s sold at the Mac Counter</li>
    <li> This item is not discounted. I work at MAC and we sell Sin everyday $16</li>
    <li> This lipstick is awesome!!!! Love love love the color!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say besides the fact this is the best lipstick ever. It also arrived sooner than expected</li>
    <li> This color is the bomb. Very consistent with the color shown. Last a long time. If you are a purple lover this one is it.</li>
    <li> Mite my expecteshin I like it</li>
    <li> Very nice lipstick only need to apply after eating.</li>
    <li> ONE OF MY FAVVVVVVVVVVS . I really love this color rfor fall and winter. looks great and gives you that edgy look</li>
    <li> I would buy this color again</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this buy! GORGEOUS COLOR!!</li>
    <li> Love love loveeeee this color!! This will most definitely be a repeat purchase!</li>
    <li> Very nice color must have to add to your MAC or lipstick collection. I have no complaints and I think it works well with many shades. I am a deep chocolate and it looked beautiful on me.</li>
    <li> Loving the color. Fits with my complex</li>
    <li> Color is true and it is very nice lipstick.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful! Why the heck did they discontinue it? Well whatever. Love it!</li>
    <li> not a discontinued color. I actually just got on MAC.com. Love the color though. Wore it to my senior prom 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, I just bought this from a MAC counter at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, dark, goes on smooth and creamy. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased (the first got left in a hot car for a week).</li>
    <li> Product is beautiful! Came super fast! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I belive this is bootleg lipstick woth a MAC label. Don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
    <li> Love love love the color! It is a very nice matte finish but can be a bit drying,  so make sure you moisturize your lips really well before using it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Bring it back!</li>
    <li> Just a heads up this color has not been discontinued and its 16 on the mac website</li>
    <li> Love Mac Glad Amazon carried it I didn&#x27;t have to deal with Mall crowds, got a great price, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
