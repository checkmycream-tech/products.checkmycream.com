<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The oil is very good and works well when blending with essential oils. The pump on the bottle sticks and shoots a stream of oil at your hand and splatters if not careful. You cant just pump a small amount or drops like other pumps.</li>
    <li> great product, works well</li>
    <li> Works perfect with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> just started using, it appears to be doing a good job of cleaning my skin</li>
    <li> Convenient but outrageously expensive</li>
    <li> Good price for this size bottle of oil. Works well in conjunction with essential oils.</li>
    <li> May not be their fault, but packaging soaked when arrived.  Sent back.  Haven&#x27;t looked to see if i got my refund yet honestly.  Product may be great, i wouldn&#x27;t know, but 3/5 bc if it was an amazing product they sure need to screw the caps on better!  The bottle was not broken, so that was all i could figure, and the bottle was as near empty as possible......</li>
    <li> easy pump style makes filling my glass roller jars for essential oils a breeze. perfect for what I needed it for. no issues with the pump at all</li>
    <li> Love the mess free, one hand friendly pump bottle, oil seems to be great!</li>
    <li> I never bought any other fractionated coconut oil, so I have no way to measure this particular brand against others. However, the oil seems to be a good oil, the price is reasonable, and the dispensing bottle works nicely.  I have purchased at least 5 bottles of this oil over the last several years, and been happy with each purchase.</li>
    <li> Great as a carrier oil for Essentail oils.  I also use it to make my own &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; baby wipes.</li>
    <li> Great to use with mixing essential oils.  The pump is nice for getting the right amount in  my other bottles.</li>
    <li> Love it and will buy it again but I agree with previous reviewers- please get the labeling for NON-GMO &amp; organic approval. Would be nice to have that assurance as stated in its description.</li>
    <li> Great oil but mostly I love that it has a pump. Makes it super easy to make roller bottles with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> The oil is wonderful. Works great with essential oils. My only problem is the pump. There&#x27;s something not right with it. It won&#x27;t pump the way it&#x27;s suppose to and squirts all over the place. With a good working pump, I would give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The bottle is much taller than old design. I keep in a cupboard,so i like the slightly shorter height. But product is great as usual.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of this purchase.  The description is exactly what it said it would be.</li>
    <li> The package came in quickly and just as I expected. The quality of the oil appears to be good and I am pleased with this product. I have not cooked with it yet, only used it with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Used as a carrier oil for essential oils, I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  Leaves NO oily residue.</li>
    <li> The product it self is fine, but the pump it came w/ didn&#x27;t fit the bottle. Part of the reason I bought this one was for the ease of use.</li>
    <li> Good price, Good delivery time.  The fractionated coconut oil is excellent for my uses and very versatile.  It comes with a pump that makes it very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and is what I was expecting it to be.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and the fact that it&#x27;s in a pump!  I use it to dilute essential oils on my daughter every day and it seems to last forever!</li>
    <li> Did not like this oil - just was not very pliable too greasy</li>
    <li> love it!  on my second bottle.  I use it to make my own essential oil roller blends</li>
    <li> Great product - already recommended to friends who have purchased. I use it as a face and neck moisturizer and a massage oil - it is light, fragrance free, and perfect for my needs!</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and absorbs quickly. Perfect to put into perfume roller with essential oils. Price is reasonable and was packaged well. Good quality pump and looks nice out on bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to mix with the Monoi de Tahiti oil I am using as a body oil because I wanted coconut oil that remained fluid and did not become solid at room temperature.  I like using coconut oil as a body moisturizer but it became a pain waiting for it to warm and become liquid before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed 1 ounce of Monoi de Tahiti Oil with 3 ounces of this fractionated oil, and it worked like a charm!  My body oil remained fluid and I never had to heat it.  Next I plan to try a 50/50 mix so that I can get more of the fragrance from the Monoi oil.  If it remains fluid, I will be a very happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all this is a great product for those who love to use coconut oil as a hair or body moisturizer.  It seals in moisture just as well as the coconut oil that hardens at room temp, but far easier to use.  And it&#x27;s great for mixing with other oils for those naturals out there who like me, like experimenting with oils for the hair and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an update, the 50/50 mix worked very, very well for me.  Also, while I see that other&#x27;s have had issues with the pump, for me the pump has worked perfectly.  Perhaps the company is having quality control issues with their supplier?</li>
    <li> Great oil-mixes well as carrier-</li>
    <li> ordered 2 bottles-- the contents of 1 leaked out entirely, soaking the shipping box.  The box arrived in a clear garbage bag because it was soaked.  Initially I thought the box had sat in a deep rain puddle!  The leaked bottle had no silver seal to protect the contents from leaking, and the other bottle had a loose silver seal but thankfully the lid was on tight.  I have an issue with broken seals, since this may be a tampered or old product.  Accidents happen, but I don&#x27;t like that the seal was missing from one and loose on the other.  Something&#x27;s fishy....</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  It just soaks to your skin after a shower.  I will get more when this runs out.  It turns your skin sooooo much smoother and silky soft.</li>
    <li> Bottle has lasted me a long time. I loved that it&#x27;s organic and I use it for all my essential oil blends. I will certainly repurchase this one.</li>
    <li> This is good for my very dry face. Plus for the price you get quality and quantity. Would buy it again</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own &#x27;massage oils&#x27; using different essential oils, and to also use as a carrier oil in diluting &#x27;hot&#x27; oils or oils that create skin sensitivity.  It also works great in the use of capsules as a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> I love using this oil.  It seems to be clean and of good quality.  I plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product . Nice pump bottle and it came exactly as described.  It is perfect to use with my essential oils .</li>
    <li> Same high quality of other organic brands I have purchased with bonus of having a pump for easier dispensing. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this for back massages. The pump makes it convenient so you don&#x27;t have to get the bottle greasy when applying. Good product.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time! I love having the pump on it, makes it so easy to use! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great for massages and a carrier oil</li>
    <li> I am happy with the quantity for the price versus some other vendors. Lablel looks homemade, so I do question the quality and source. The pump is much easier to deal with than my other bottle that seeps all over. I do have to be careful to press the pump gently as it will shoot oil across the room. A little is all I need to dilute Essential Oils.</li>
    <li> Good quality, love the bottle</li>
    <li> Great price. Great product. Four generations of users in our family :) Including all the men! We will be buying this non-stop.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make &amp;#34;owie spray&amp;#34; with essential oils.  I used this fractionated coconut oil as the carrier, as that&#x27;s what the recipe calls for.  Then while making foamy soap, I ran out of vegetable glycerin, and used this in a pinch instead.  It actually worked better!  Could also use as a massage oil.  I recommend this, and I like it because it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> Use this as a carrier oil for essential oils and use it in my hair when it gets snarls in the winter.</li>
    <li> Works as a great carrier oil for my essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://mydoterra.com/tiffanyconrad</li>
    <li> Nice size and easy to use when mixing with esstential oils or for a massage. I would recommend it for your use.</li>
    <li> Oh, I just love this.  I  use it for an all over moisturizer after the shower.  I have what I call alligator skin on my arms, which I guess is just years of sun damage.  No other  body lotion made a dent in it -- my skin was basically the same after use as before, and I&#x27;ve used some expensive stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this stuff on a message board, and my skin has made a dramatic turnaround.  The only drawback is it does take about 15 or 20 minutes to be absorbed by the skin.  I have worked around that by putting a washable throw on a chair and sitting on it for a few minutes before I get dressed to let the oil sink in.  Probably not for those in a hurry, but if you have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin like mine, it is worth the few extra minutes it takes to have dramatically improved skin.  I added a little teprenone (an anti aging ingredient)  to it,  and it is just perfect.  Coconut oil has some very healing qualities.</li>
    <li> Love this! It&#x27;s so soothing on my skin mixed with lavender &amp; frankincense. It&#x27;s not greasy &amp; soaks right in.</li>
    <li> The price is great compared to others.  I really like the product and use it often! I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I use this oil for everything! I like it a lot because it is multi purpose. The one start drop is due to the fact that the pump is so annoying! It shoots the oil far away so I have to keep cleaning the areas around the place I keep the oil and just be very careful when using it.</li>
    <li> The oil is great, but the pump is &amp;#34;wild.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s very difficult to determine where it&#x27;s going to squirt and that has caused a lot of stains!</li>
    <li> I love that this oil is so nice and clear... no aroma, it blends in to the skin wonderfully with the essential oil I work with. I would have given this product 5 stars, but I wondered, is the product actually organic?  The bottle states &amp;#34;100% pure organic&amp;#34; however I do not see any certification labels.  What I found out about making organic claims is as follows:  .it&#x27;s not enough to simply claim &amp;#34;organic.&amp;#34; You must make sure that the product is carrying the certified USDA Organic Seal.  No matter if it&#x27;s a food or a cosmetic, labeling and marketing an agricultural (ie, plant-based product) product as organic or 100% organic without certification is illegal. I did email the company Earth&#x27;s essentials, and I will let you know what I find out! Of course I would feel much better if the product is actually organic because it is very nice...</li>
    <li> Best carrier oil! Love it!</li>
    <li> Came quick. Love the pump top. Perfect for use with my essential oils. I will purchase again when I need more.</li>
    <li> This is s nice non-scented oil.  It does not leave a greasy feeling.  I would definitely reccommend it for massage</li>
    <li> Love the pump.  If you are looking for the alternative to the less messy- this is it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil as a base with essential oils for a few weeks and it works great.  I also use it on myself and my baby in place of lotion and it works wonderful.  I will buy more soon!</li>
    <li> Shipped well (no leaking as others report).  The pump works great. It doesn&#x27;t have a coconut smell either which is nice for being a carrier oil.  I love using this oil with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Love that it has a pump since I use it like lotion. Very well priced.  Will buy more later</li>
    <li> Love this oil...fast shipping.  This is my 2nd bottle</li>
    <li> Very nice oil.  I like the container and pump</li>
    <li> Love the pump and ease.</li>
    <li> Bought for the wife and she uses it daily and almost ready for a reorder</li>
    <li> The oil itself is great. Unfortunately it did not come with a pump as stated and is super runny (as fractionated coconut oil should be) so it gets all over the place every time we try to use it. The fact that it came with a pump bottle was actually the deciding factor for me in purchasing this particular brand over another, so it kind of backfired for me. Trying to figure out a good solution for this as other pumps I have tried do not fit the bottle... :(</li>
    <li> I love this oil in a pump. It does pump fast, so you have to watch it. Works great with essential oils. There is no smell to oil so it picks up the essential oil you use.</li>
    <li> Only need to use a little bit and it goes a long way</li>
    <li> Perfect for so many, many things!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Fractionated&lt;br /&gt;Means it has less&lt;br /&gt;Of the good junk in there but works real great for butt lube</li>
    <li> This kind of coconut oil is the best!  I use it to moisturize my skin and hair/scalp and to take off my make up.  It is non-toxic such are mineral oil which will affect your eyelashes!  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Love the pump and that it is organic at a great price!</li>
    <li> Great oil, good quality. The pump is very convenient and easy to fill roller bottles.</li>
    <li> I started using this a few weeks ago and wondered how I have lived so long with out it.  Works as good on my skin and eyes and the expensive face creams I have used.  I use VERY LITTLE on my hair and no fly aways and shiny. They best part is you dont smell coconut and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and perfect for perfume making!</li>
    <li> Love the squirt top - very handy</li>
    <li> I like that this has a hand pump, but be warned that a lot comes out.  A little goes a very long way with this oil.  Too much and I turn into a grease ball.</li>
    <li> excellent product, exactly what I needed, quick delivery from seller</li>
    <li> I use this oil for everything.  It works great as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> wonderful high quality oil!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality coconut oil in very convenient pump perfect for diluting your essential oils.</li>
    <li> Smells earthy/like a plant- was hoping either unscented or coconut but no.</li>
    <li> I like this oil to use for diluting essential oil.  It has no scent.  I like getting the amount of oil for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is the pump kinda sticks.  It&#x27;s very difficult to get only a small amount out of the pump.  You really get a handful overflowing of oil or none at all. One of the main reasons I got this particular oil is because of the pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;So I fixed the problem by putting the coconut oil in an empty Palmers skin therapy oil bottle with the pump dispenser.  That makes it much easier to get a smaller amount of oil I want.  Overall, the oil is good, but I&#x27;m not gong to pay extra money for the pump dispenser again.</li>
    <li> Dilutes and combines well with my essential oils. Even good on its own to run into my feet for a quick massage.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE and SIZE...SOOOOO Convenient!!!...and odorless!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superb for diluting essential oils for various uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handy pump simplifies filling both dropper and roll-on vials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump comes separately from the container, which I consider a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used in skin care creams and will be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to contact Earth&#x27; Essentials and suggest they indicate date of processing and an expiration date for this product.</li>
    <li> Highly reccommend this company.  Superior quality oil, the pump works well for massage.  I particularly appreciate the new clear label, it looks clean and professional.  I have switched from Biotone products to ordering only this oil for massage since first finding it last year.  Washes out of sheets easily without staining.</li>
    <li> There is barely an scent. I use this as a moisturizer. I also use this with essential oils. I like the packaging too. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I definitely like the pump bottle this comes in.  I use fractionated coconut oil for oil pulling for my teeth &amp; my face a few times a week.  It works well as a moisturizer, too, for my hands, arms, legs, etc.  The skin absorbs it well.  This oil is perfectly fine, but I rather liked another brand a little more.  This brand is a little thinner.  So, I&#x27;ll probably get that other brand next time and use it in this great pump bottle.</li>
    <li> This is another example of the item is what is. Fractionated Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly what I was looking for and the price was perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful carrier oil for essential oils as well as great to use as lotion!  It has such wonderful health benefits!  I love the convenience of a pump.  It is much better to have a pump then not...I have had both.  So easy to fill roller balls and mix with essential oils for quick application.  There is no smell and the oil absorbs nicely on the skin.</li>
    <li> Good stuff...great carrier/massage oil...good alternative to traditional lotions...</li>
    <li> I find it a great sexual lubricant (when not using a condom) as well as for massaging. Long lasting enough, eventually absorbs without residue, or easily showers off if that makes you feel better.  Fine, high quality.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Use my FCO all the time to mix essential oils.</li>
    <li> This makes diluting my essential oils SO much easier!!!  I really love the pump feature and it fits right into the 00 capsules as well.</li>
    <li> I like the larger bottle with the pump so that I can easily and mix with essential oils or make other recipes for personal care.</li>
    <li> This oil is pure and in an easy pump bottle. It came on time and in great condition. I will reorder when out.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product</li>
    <li> LOVE it.  I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils and it is awesome</li>
    <li> My wife uses this for essential oil roll-on bottles and has no complaints.  A quarter of the cost of name brand oil.</li>
    <li> I love using Earth&#x27;s Essentials Organic Fractionated Coconut Oil-16 Oz. Pump Bottle-USP Food Grade  It makes blending my oils so much easier!  Wish I had found this years ago.  I am always making all different types of oil blends for friends, customers, and family.  We make blends from anything dealing with colds, muscle aches, head aches, skin problems, and so much more.  Fractuanated coconut oil is so easy and can penetrate into the skin so easily.  Great for everything imaginable!</li>
    <li> I love this as a carrier for essential oils, to make my own foaming hand soap or just to smooth on a dry patch of skin. It feels so good, absorbs into the skin quickly so it doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue and I love the light coconut scent you have from it - not too strong so you smell like you just slathered on tanning oil, but light &amp; fresh. For it to be organic, its a great price too!</li>
    <li> Love this oil and dispenser!  I use it on my body instead of body lotion.  Smooth and luxurious!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time,as described .</li>
    <li> I love this FCO and use it for all of my essential oil rollerballs!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping - product as described - would buy from again. Use for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use bottle - very convenient!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says...</li>
    <li> Works great as a massage oil and carrier for essential oils. Product is exactly as described. Love it!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly...exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This Fractionated coconut oil is very nice, mixes well with the essential oils I use daily.. The pump bottle makes it easy to fill my small roller ball bottles... Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great for diluting essential oils. It lasts me awhile!</li>
    <li> I looked around and priced the organic fractionated oil and this price is excellent. I mix this with the DoTerra essential oils and it works great.</li>
    <li> Nice oil. Absorbs quickly.  Not greasy. I had been using DoTerra&#x27;s fractionated coconut oil before &amp; I will say DoTerra&#x27;s oil is far superior but rather pricey.  I&#x27;d rather save my money for their medicinal oils vs just the carrier/massage oil.  This is a great second.  Like other reviewers I do recommend spending a buck or two to gwt a different squeeze bottle or pump bottle though.  This bottle will squirt oil across the room.</li>
    <li> I love this large bottle for all my essential oil dilutions.</li>
    <li> Use it for essential oils. Love this</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  It&#x27;s very smooth and odorless and has made my children&#x27;s skin very soft.  I also used this FCO to make a diaper cream with beeswax.  It&#x27;s pretty awesome.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have very dry skin in the winter.  I use it in place of my lotion.  A little goes a long way. Not greasy.  Rubs in very well.  I put my clothes on right after.  I even put a little on face once a week.  I do not have any problems with the spout on the bottom.  I will buy again.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but worth the price.....</li>
