      <li>Very good quality, I recommend  someone to get this, just time the wax that you add to your face, or you can peel off your skin on your area of hair.</li>
      <li>Awesome deal and good quality.</li>
      <li>so I can not give a great review of this products quality.</li>

      <li>its really good.</li>
      <li>Good strips.  </li>
      <li>Delighted with price.</li>
      <li>Good buy.</li>
      <li>I had mistaken this for another product, that has good grip.</li>
      <li>Good product and meets my need effective and inexpensive in price</li>
      <li>If you are into waxing then you should keep tons of these strips handy.</li>
      <li>I already had the wax machine I just needed more papers.  </li>
      <li>It takes more than a  month to receive your order.</li>
      <li>More of the strip and wax stayed on my leg than hair was removed.</li>
      <li>The strips works better with creme wax, the strips removed all of the hair, these strips work better than the muslin strips.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s because they seem to be more like paper towel</li>
      <li>Took almost a month to arrive and that was the better part.</li>
      <li>i love it, the Price its fine</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.</li>
      <li>It gets stuck on your skin so when you pull it out you easily get bruises on your skin..</li>
      <li>Its shape is easy to use</li>
      <li>The material is smooth and is easy to pill of.</li>
      <li>These strips removed hair easily and pain free.  </li>
      <li>If u know how to do it with cheap wax strips its completely fine.</li>
      <li>This seems cheap.</li>
      <li>These are extremely cheap products and do not remove wax.  </li>
      <li>so I have to cut them to fit.  </li>
      <li>they where so cheap they tore when I waxed.</li>
      <li>great quailty product with fast shipping, will definitely purchase again</li>
      <li>Inexpensive (less than $2) and great supplement to use with any hair removal wax.  </li>
      <li>as far as I know they are fine!</li>
      <li>I received it, that&#x27;s what counts right now, thank you.</li>
      <li>These strips are very large</li>
      <li>They help him and the cream goes on smooth but as far as waxing I will never touch them again!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>Works well with the wax I use and much more affordable than buying locally.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Also, it is a great amount of it, it could last for long</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s a pretty good quality cotton paper since it is not easy to tear apart.</li>
      <li>this very well, thank you very much</li>
      <li>Nice white strong strips, wax comes off clean, and can reuse if doing a small area.</li>
      <li>They really work well</li>
      <li>It was so much more than I expected.</li>
      <li>It came from China (I think) and shipping was relatively fast.</li>
      <li>They are way softer, they don&#x27;t grab as much hair or stick to the wax.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say they are really a hit or miss.</li>
      <li>They work okay, but they are not gentle.</li>
      <li>Got to be more careful!!</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more since the strips that come with the removal wax are always not enough.</li>
      <li>For a simple product like this there&#x27;s not a whole lot to say other than they do a good job and are a decent price.</li>
      <li>If you wait to long the strip will come right off with no wax.</li>
      <li>I blame myself that did not look at the description clearly.</li>
      <li>Would purchase again but not wait until completely out</li>
      <li>arrived on time, bigger than expected, that just means they will last longer since i can cut them up :)</li>
      <li>At first I was skeptical about purchasing these strips because of the price, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>You have to put a thin layer of wax, apply the strip while rubbing it fast and hard to make sure it sticks, then ripping it off quickly after applying.</li>
      <li>The price is right and the strips can be cut down to the size I need.</li>
      <li>something that has to do with depilatory but does the job-dies however, like most of these papers leave residue behind</li>

<li> Item is exactly as described shipping took a little longer than expected.  </li>
<li> These Last Long.. Still Have Some</li>
<li> You get used to the proper way of using them to make them work for you but keep in mind it won&#x27;t work every single time.</li>
<li> I can use it for a long time, I think.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re almost like long cotton bandages.  </li>
<li> The only down side was that it did take several weeks for delivery from China</li>
<li> I know I won&#x27;t run out for a long time!</li>
<li> use to wax myself and I&#x27;ve been doing it for a very very long time already...</li>
<li> Rough compared to others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> such wasted of money</li>
<li> but I expected that as this product was coming from china</li>
<li> Product as expected.</li>
<li> /&gt;I threw them away, it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of a return for $3.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used these strips for a few years.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Waste of my money.</li>
<li> please don&#x27;t waste  </li>
<li> These strips are thick and heavy, I would recommend these strips to anyone who do waxing.</li>
<li> You&#x27;re probably thinking (as I did) that these will be that almost paperlike thick waxing strips that usually come with waxing kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I thought there was wax on the paper,kinda sucks since I don&#x27;t have wax.</li>
<li> These wax strips are not good for waxing at all.  </li>
<li> These strips are in very poor quality and not suitable for waxing.</li>
<li> When they arrived and I opened them, I was actually confused, thinking, I didn&#x27;t order bandages.  </li>
<li> They are some weird, flimsy material that will shred and stay stuck to your waxed body part.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The name/description is deceiving. They are just fabric strips, nothing else. Took almost a month to arrive and that was the better part.</li>
    <li> Great value!!! And delivered on time!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. I already had the wax machine I just needed more papers.  They really work well and I am very happy with the price and not having to go search through the stores for them.</li>
    <li> I was my arms and bought these as they are a great deal. STrips works well and are a great price!</li>
    <li> this very well, thank you very much</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s came on time but very bad quality</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s because they seem to be more like paper towel then wax removal strips. I was waxing my eyebrows with the strips that came with the pack and then I used these to see the difference. There is a BIG difference. They are way softer, they don&#x27;t grab as much hair or stick to the wax. It came from China (I think) and shipping was relatively fast.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, bigger than expected, that just means they will last longer since i can cut them up :)</li>
    <li> Great price! Should last me for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if you can &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; something that has to do with depilatory but does the job-dies however, like most of these papers leave residue behind</li>
    <li> It takes more than a  month to receive your order.These are really in very very poor quality and don&#x27;t work for waxing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Rough compared to others I&#x27;ve tried. They work okay, but they are not gentle.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, I recommend  someone to get this, just time the wax that you add to your face, or you can peel off your skin on your area of hair. I know it was done to me in a beauty salon, unfortunately.  But this is good just time the wax application. read your wax instructions that you use with this material. its really good.</li>
    <li> very bad dn use it.&lt;br /&gt;its like thin paper. ...nthng came out</li>
    <li> I need a hair removal wax which comes with glue. But its only a simple tissue. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> the shipping takes a while but I loved them !! the price and quality is amazing !</li>
    <li> These strips are not for waxing. They were too cotton like. More of the strip and wax stayed on my leg than hair was removed. I ended up using them to removed nail polish.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Works well with the wax I use and much more affordable than buying locally. I will order these again. The only down side was that it did take several weeks for delivery from China so I will need to plan for that when ordering.</li>
    <li> I received it, that&#x27;s what counts right now, thank you.</li>
    <li> It was worse quality not good disappointed</li>
    <li> These strips are in very poor quality and not suitable for waxing. It&#x27;s like bandage paper, don&#x27;t buy these strips.</li>
    <li> These wax strips are not good for waxing at all.  The quality is bad, they start stripping and doesn&#x27;t wax all the hair.</li>
    <li> So how can you wax with paper? I had mistaken this for another product, that has good grip. This tears off, and is a very tiresome product.</li>
    <li> Very nice. I bought some waxing paper from a different company and they where so cheap they tore when I waxed. These ones do the job. No issues.</li>
    <li> this product was received as promised and in a timely manner, I ordered the like from HongKong in error; waiting forever it seems.  Got to be more careful!!</li>
    <li> horrible very messy grrrr i hate this product  such wasted of money please don&#x27;t waste  your money stay away for this</li>
    <li> These are the worst wax paper I&#x27;ve ever used !!! Really bad quality , and the paper gets stock on your skin!!</li>
    <li> I like it. The material is smooth and is easy to pill of. Also, it is a great amount of it, it could last for long</li>
    <li> I had never waxing before, and when I decided to give it a try, I went online and I saw this. I thought it is the waxing paper that come with some wax on it. In fact, it is just a pile of cotton paper. I blame myself that did not look at the description clearly. I guess it&#x27;s a pretty good quality cotton paper since it is not easy to tear apart.</li>
    <li> This product works well for my needs.  These strips are very large so I have to cut them to fit.  I may look for a smaller size.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about purchasing these strips because of the price, but I&#x27;m glad I did. It took almost a month to receive the item, but at the same time I didn&#x27;t know that the item was located in Hong Kong. The strips works better with creme wax, the strips removed all of the hair, these strips work better than the muslin strips.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;the strip s  fallas apart and you emd up with pieces of it stuck on you/wax when you are pulling them off.</li>
    <li> For a simple product like this there&#x27;s not a whole lot to say other than they do a good job and are a decent price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve used the paper yet. It was so much more than I expected. I know I won&#x27;t run out for a long time!</li>
    <li> Horrible quality!&lt;br /&gt;I use to wax myself and I&#x27;ve been doing it for a very very long time already... I never get hurt when doing it, BUT, after I bought this strips, I hurt myself while I was waxing... The stripes don&#x27;t come out as they should! It gets stuck on your skin so when you pull it out you easily get bruises on your skin.. I put it in the trash can.</li>
    <li> gave to my hairdresser....  as far as I know they are fine!</li>
    <li> horrible quality, i don&#x27;t think this is even product tested.  it sticks to your skin and leaves wax residue.  it also causes bruising</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews on here about these strips being horrible. I&#x27;d say they are really a hit or miss. You get used to the proper way of using them to make them work for you but keep in mind it won&#x27;t work every single time. You have to put a thin layer of wax, apply the strip while rubbing it fast and hard to make sure it sticks, then ripping it off quickly after applying. If you wait to long the strip will come right off with no wax. Like I said, hit or miss product.</li>
    <li> Will continue purchasing, work great.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and very cheap. Works great for me!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> It did not work well for pulling the wax off. I don&#x27;t know why but the wax did not stick to the paper.</li>
    <li> I can use it for a long time, I think. It is easy to use. Its shape is easy to use</li>
    <li> If you are into waxing then you should keep tons of these strips handy. They are medium-quality but for the price, what&#x27;s there to coplain about? They are workable.</li>
    <li> These Last Long.. Still Have Some</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. Nice white strong strips, wax comes off clean, and can reuse if doing a small area.</li>
    <li> It takes a month to receive your order.  They are not paper strips.  They are some weird, flimsy material that will shred and stay stuck to your waxed body part.</li>
    <li> my order come on time which made me really happy. at first i though it was going to get lost , because it was a small item, but it didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> These are just horrible for waxing but my husband loves to use them to apply skin cream for razor bumps. They help him and the cream goes on smooth but as far as waxing I will never touch them again!</li>
    <li> This product its perfect for my skin i love it, the Price its fine, i recommended to everybody i will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal and good quality. Shipping took a while but I expected that as this product was coming from china</li>
    <li> excelente producto, cumple con mis espectativas y lo más importante es que es un buen precio por la calidad y la catindad</li>
    <li> Strips fall apart. When pulling strips off when waxing, portions of cloth rip off onto wax leaving wax on skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips for a few years. These strips removed hair easily and pain free.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re probably thinking (as I did) that these will be that almost paperlike thick waxing strips that usually come with waxing kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not.  They&#x27;re almost like long cotton bandages.  Gauze-like.  When they arrived and I opened them, I was actually confused, thinking, I didn&#x27;t order bandages.  Then I realized I was waiting for my wax strips to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw them away, it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of a return for $3.  I would not even try to use these for waxing.  You can tell the wax would seep through, and get stuck, and residue from the strips would end up on the skin.</li>
    <li> I only used this product once so I can not give a great review of this products quality. They seem to be durable and can get the job done.</li>
    <li> Its does the job, not too bad. If u know how to do it with cheap wax strips its completely fine.</li>
    <li> The price is right and the strips can be cut down to the size I need.</li>
    <li> works like it is supposed to.  However the shipping took about a month to get here.</li>
    <li> great quailty product with fast shipping, will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> This seems cheap. When i try to use it, it just tear off. Total waste of money. I had to just trash them.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as described shipping took a little longer than expected.  Would purchase again but not wait until completely out</li>
    <li> Removal wax strips are great. I cut them according to what I am using them for. These strips are thick and heavy, I would recommend these strips to anyone who do waxing.</li>
    <li> These are extremely cheap products and do not remove wax.  The wax actually rips the strips and then you get to pull off both the paper and wax by hand.  Horrible doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe them.</li>
    <li> Good product and meets my need effective and inexpensive in price</li>
    <li> Product as expected. Delighted with price. Don&#x27;t but if in a hurry though. Took about 4 weeks to ship.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive (less than $2) and great supplement to use with any hair removal wax.  Will definitely buy more since the strips that come with the removal wax are always not enough.</li>
    <li> I thought there was wax on the paper,kinda sucks since I don&#x27;t have wax.</li>
    <li> Good buy. Just disappointed that the product I ordered to go along with this was not sent.</li>
    <li> Good strips.  They were worked well and I had no problem with them ripping.</li>
    <li> China item. Enough said.</li>
