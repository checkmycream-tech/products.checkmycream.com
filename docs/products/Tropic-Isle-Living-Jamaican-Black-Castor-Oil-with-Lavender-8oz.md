<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this and was pleased with the packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over a year now, I still like it; however, it did not come with a free applicator as the email I received stated.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews about this product before I decided to use it myself. I definitely see why so many people love this product. It does a great job of sealing in moisture in your hair. I also own the normal JBCO, which is also a great product. But this one has a somewhat nice fragrance to it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over the smell and thickness of this product</li>
    <li> LOVE CASTOR OILS. AND I LOVE LAVENDER A LOT. SO THIS IS VERY GOOD TO ME AND MY HAIR LOVES IT.</li>
    <li> This has helped the pain in my hands and I got some for my mom and it has helped  hers too ..we both have arthritis</li>
    <li> I tried this because I heard good thing about it. I was skeptical about the scent and the moisture factor. But I was quickly turned into a fan. The lavender smell isn&#x27;t too over powering and fades lightly during the day. Also the moisture for my hair is amazing. I also mixed a little into my conditioner and my hair is the softest it&#x27;s been since I started going natural and since after my big chop. And the moisture last! I just started using a little bit for scalp massages so I can&#x27;t wait to see if it helps improve growth. But even if it doesn&#x27;t if you need moisture this is it. I can&#x27;t wait to order again and the shipping was fast for standard this will be my moisture staple. Now it is thick consistency but a little really does go a long way. I love this product.</li>
    <li> The company shipped the product fast.  The oil is not as thick as the home health castor oil.  So it makes it easier to oil your scalp with.  So far I love it.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical so I bought a 4oz to start.  I wished I would have gotten the 8 oz because this stuff is the best.  My hair is not shedding like crazy anymore.  It feels so soft all the time and my ends aren&#x27;t splitting as much anymore.  I started using this in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  They have the driest hair in the world.  Now its more manageable.  It&#x27;s not a cure all but you see the difference instantly.  I mixed it with the Aphogee essential oils  (i had half a bottle left and I needed an applicator bottle)  The smell is a little tart at first but it goes away within a couple of minutes.  If my hair stunk, trust me, my husband would have told me! This will remain a part of my regimen.  I wash my relaxed 4b hair once a week with aphogee moisture shampoo and ovation shampoo. Then I put ovation cell therapy on my scalp, shea moisture deep treatment masque and JBC all over.  Sit for 30 mins (did the overnight thing once and my hair was solid as rock-not in a good way)rinse, ovation rinse, rinse again, oil my hair with JBC and seal the ends with pink lotion (oldie but a goodie). I seal the ends daily and apply JBC to my hair every other day.  I&#x27;m APL (armpit length) on my way to waist length!  I&#x27;ll update in a month.  Be blessed! and happy hair growing!&lt;br /&gt;p.s I&#x27;ll be switching to Mega-tek when ovation is done. TOO expensive but it works!</li>
    <li> The product is great but there is no big difference in the original jmb castor oil. Even though they added lavendor to tame down the smell, the smell is the same. The regular castor oil is cheaper and contains more castor oil so get that one</li>
    <li> Great for my hair. My parts are more narrow and not wide and its only been used for about 3 weeks.  Good product!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say I prefer the original JBCO.  Being the \\&quot;kitchen chemists\\&quot; that I am, I could&#x27;ve made this myself.  Bigger isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
    <li> I have not seen results but showing possibilities.</li>
    <li> I am the biggest skeptic...but this product is AWESOME!!! Yes, it did cause my scalp to itch when I first started using it, but I kept using it since the website said to keep using it to improve scalp health.  After a few weeks, the itching stopped, my natural 4b hair (which always feels dry and \\&quot;crunchie\\&quot;) is incredibly moisturized, and last but not least, I kid you not, my hair grew almost an inch in less than a month of use!!! I recommend to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I used JBCO for my natural 4B hair. This product is effective at sealing moisture in the hair after a good LOC method, but it very heavy. I would only use it on edges and to &amp;#34;slick down&amp;#34; hair for a ponytail.</li>
    <li> Great brand! Provides superb moisture and conditioning. I use this mostly in a deep conditioner with coconut oil or as pre-wash treatment since my hair is fine. Otherwise it can be a little heavy, especially on straightened fine to medium hair.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if people expect dramatic and immediate results when it comes to products they use on their hair or what? With consistent use and careful hair management practices, this product has aided in growing my naturally kinky hair, longer and stronger than it&#x27;s ever been. The product smells great with the Lavender. The unscented JBCO takes getting used to due to the smell but now I enjoy the smell. It has a very thick consistency so a little goes a long way. The bottle should last a very long time. Using this product paired with a no heat, moisture intensive, careful handling regimen has been the key to great hair growth.</li>
    <li> This product by far is gospel for me. Love the coconut mix as well this stuff is like fertilizer my napps are growing faster than ever.</li>
    <li> Love it...I use this on my hair as well as my.daughter hair</li>
    <li> Received early &amp; started using immediately in addition to the emu oil.  Bought for my thinning edges &amp; Im already feeling tingling. Not sure if it works just yet but will return after a month to give review on hair growth progress.  It doesnt smell as bad as most of the reviews I read.  Has a unique smell but nothing that lingers around.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> Although the oil is very thick, I have never used a product that left my hair as lightweight and soft as this oil. I apply it at night and when I style my hair the next morning it is super soft, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot, a little goes a long way. This is my new staple product.</li>
    <li> I became a JBCO acolyte years ago and I&#x27;m never turning back. I definitely appreciate brands that offer it mixed with scented oils like lavender. As much as I love JBCO, I&#x27;d rather not walk around smelling like BBQ. I recommend this to everyone: natural or otherwise. Dilute it with some water if you have locks and just spray it on your scalp, or mix it with your other hair products, maybe your conditioner. Great for hair growth and for softness.</li>
    <li> I use this for my daughters edges to help them grow. It as really made a difference in her hair growing around her front edges.</li>
    <li> Item came before it was expected to get here which I love. The actual product has been great. I use it to condition my hair and help my eyebrows grow back and I think I&#x27;m seeing results already. I have been using it consistently for about two weeks.</li>
    <li> Amazing and fabulous .. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am currently wearing individual braids and I use the JBCO on my edges to help grow them back. It is actually working; I can definitely see hair where there was very little or none at all. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I use this oil overnight and then shampoo my hair in the AM.  Makes my hair really shiny and soft.  Will buy again as soon as I finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I love how healthy it keeps my scalp and 4b hair. I will definitely buy from this seller again in the future. Shipping was QUICK and my item arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> It smells lovely and i love the thickness. A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Just started using the Lavender but like Black Castor oil.</li>
    <li> Okay so I just found out about castor oil 2 months ago. i swear by this oil i tell everyone about this oil .my edges were gone i mean bald and i have tryed every oil, dr.miracle everything that says its going t grow you hair and edges (so much money wasted). but this stuff moisturizes like nothing else it really gets me on the reviews when people talk about the smell is horrible because all the hair products that smell good and drowned in fragrance that is horrible for your hair But i swear by this and will be a life long customer</li>
    <li> Loved it! Definitely would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love the dual usages of this product. I would looking for a product to address hair care needs for my daughters. It is a bit thicker in consistency than what I would normally use on their hair but is great for hot oil treatment. Additionally, I like the bonus of being able to use it for joint stiffness, aches, and pains.</li>
    <li> I received my JCBO on time and intact.  This castor oil is dark brown and thick but easily absorbs into the skin. To those who are debating between the lavender scented versus the unscented castor oil, be cautious.  The lavender scent can be overpowering initially, but once you use it in your mixtures and such, the scent is not so bad, and it doesn&#x27;t linger long.  Other than that, this oil is great.  I use it in my leave-in conditioners and to oil my scalp to combat dandruff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about two weeks, and it&#x27;s really too early to tell if it&#x27;s working or not.  It does have a thick consistency, so I would suggest buying an application bottle to apply to scalp. A little goes a long way, the smell isn&#x27;t strong(which I love). I apply to scalp once a week, and my temple area daily, it keeps my scalp moisturized.  I would by again.</li>
    <li> I found this product in a forum about a year or so ago.  I have been using this ever since!!! I have been \\&quot;natural\\&quot; for about a year and a half, and I must say, this product has grown my hair completely out! I had a baby fro when I first cut my hair off, now it is back length, working on arm pit length. My hair has never been so soft and thick. I only use this, shea butter (rarely) and Triple strength growth lotion by Doo Gro, and my hair has never been better. I recommend to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is great for scalp stimulation which can add to the conditioning and thickening of hair. I use it by applying it to my scalp twice per week. It is a heavier oil, so be careful with how much you actually use.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle oil!  It really smooths the hair cuticle and gives it a long-lasting shine.  My hair is soft and bouncy and it doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.  The fragrance is awesome and so much better than plain black castor oil.  The shipping is excellent too!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Jamaican Black Castor Oil for about 2 years, since I went natural. I have 4c hair and using it along with coconut oil and water keep my hair well hydrated</li>
    <li> I bought this to apply to my scalp for hair growth, but it worked great for exzema!</li>
    <li> I am a natural woman.  I have been using this product for a few years.  I love the smell and the benefits to my hair which used to be extremely dry.  I found this on Amazon for a better price than in the beauty supply.</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love this product! I Have used it before and was very excited to be getting the big bottle.</li>
    <li> It works and the scent is more pleasant.</li>
    <li> This product works as a good oil base for dry  hair. As far as it making your hair grow I can&#x27;t attest to it.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff. The smell wasn&#x27;t as off putting as the regular oil. Worked very well on my hair. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!! Bought this a few years ago when my family and I moved to NC from NJ. I am African American with natural 3C/4A hair.  I have Hyperthyroid and also Graves&#x27; Disease. Among many horrible symptoms, associated with Graves&#x27; one of the symptoms is extreme and horrible hair shedding. When I used this, along with eating a lot of salmon and exercising, this allowed my hair to grow much healthier. I already have thick hair, so I didn&#x27;t need it for that reason, but I did need this to allow my hair to grow and stay healthy enough to not snap and break whenever it did reach a nice length.  I don&#x27;t mind the scent of the castor oil. It&#x27;s not strong to me at all and it actually goes away through out the day/night, whichever time you use it. I can&#x27;t wait to start using this again, because no matter what I do for my hair: deep condition, co-wash, moisturize etc, my hair will always be in a fragile state because of my auto immune disease. This is just one thing that helps keep it strong as much as it can be.</li>
    <li> This product is awsome.  It made my hair feel really soft and silky.  I also use it on my skin, eyebrows and lashes.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT FOR DRY HAIR</li>
    <li> This oil lasted nine months. Kept my hair very moisturized and stimulated my hair growth, when used on its own.  I have mixed the oil with other oils that I have used and it provided my hair great definition when I created twists out on my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! After trying regular old castor oil, the lavender scent is much preferred. The formula seems to be the same as the regular one, and even though the scent can be strong, it seems to fade away pretty quickly. I use this in conjunction with two other products and couldn&#x27;t imagine not using it. It is a little thick and can be heavy on the hair, so I only use it as a scalp treatment and a sealer on my ends. A little bit goes an extremely long way, so I know this bottle will last nearly forever! My scalp and hair is noticeably more healthy than it was prior to using castor oil. I hope this product is available forever because it is such an important part of my hair care routine!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It has grown her hair tremendously.  I also use the Jamican castor oil shampoo, conditioner, protein conditioner, and leave-in-conditioner on both of our hair.  This is a great line of products!</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been natural for five years and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually keeps my hair moist and soft. I have thick hair and I have struggled with dryness my entire life. A little bit goes a long way. I use it to moisturize my scalp and my ends, and to mix up my own leave in conditioner. Unbeatable at under $10.</li>
    <li> This has been very helpful with restoring my edges after having Senegalese Twists.  It also works well on my cuticles.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just received this product. I just love it.  Will use all the time. Instant results for dry skin!  Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week after washing my hair. I make a mixture of coconut oil, shea butter and lavender Jamaican Black Castor oil and twist my hair. This keeps my hair moisturized until the next hair wash. I have gone from brushing with my Denman and having a fist-full of hair come out to a quarter-sized amount of shed hair coming out. I&#x27;m 42 years old and my hair has grown and thickened so much since I started using this a year ago.</li>
    <li> Not what  expected, to heavy. I will try using it for joints as a rub.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! This had made my hair &amp; eyebrows grow!!!</li>
    <li> I read so many rave reviews about this product that I could not wait to use it. Man people really do over exaggerate on many of these natural products. This stuff just sits on top of my head waiting to fall off onto my neck, shirt, towel, whatever is available. It does not seep into my hair. I will try to mix it with other products and see if it works better as an ingredient and not alone.</li>
    <li> im natural and i love the shine this product gives and the moisture i do not use this product for anything else but hair</li>
    <li> REALLY FAST SHIPPING. MAKES MY HAIR REALLY SOFT.</li>
    <li> I have a spot in the crown of my head that stops growning at a certain point and this helped it grow past the usual length. Is also helped my scalp from stop itching so much.</li>
    <li> The lavender smell is very prominent. It almost covers the smell of the castor oil. The smell does not stay too long though. I love this product for my hair and scalp. My hair has grown so much AND my mom&#x27;s edges are growing back so fast after years of wig comb damage. Definitely a staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Video Review:[...]</li>
    <li> I have been using this in my hair for a few months now and hoped it would help my hair grow faster and thicken up the areas that were thinning, but I have not noticed either of these things happening.  I will continue to apply in hopes that it just needs time.</li>
    <li> USUSALLY BUY THIS FROM THE HAIR DEP BUT WAS ON AMAZON SO BROUGHT IT HERE ITS AN AMAZING PRODUCT .</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair loves it but sure to use it lightly. I use it to moisturize my edges as well as for hot oil treatment. The best!!!</li>
    <li> recomended by a friend product used for hair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;excellent service and deliverly&lt;br /&gt;Ordered product for my daughter in law, she is overseas.&lt;br /&gt;She likes to lavandar sent.</li>
    <li> This castor oil isn&#x27;t as thick as JBCO.  I use it to oil my scalp.  My problem area is my crown.  Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair is feels thicker, moisturized and it&#x27;s now growing.</li>
    <li> Works great with thick hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT, I will definitely be ordering more when I run out. A couple of friends of mine have been using it as well as myself, we have all seen some improvements in areas where our hair was thinning, just massage it into the scalp a couple of times a week....and you dont have to use to much, a little goes a long way...very happy cause my 4C hair has been very dry</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;Cons the smell gives me a headache had to mix other fragrances with it.</li>
    <li> It is doing exactly what I was told it would do.  I am glad I listened to the suggestion and made the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!! I will definitely be purchasing some more bottles very soon. I love the way it makes my hair feel and it has grown since I started using it in February.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT AND JUST NEED TO USE IT MORE LOL</li>
    <li> This is second bottle of Sunny Isle JBCO and it&#x27;s strange that this one does not tingle my scalp as the first bottle I used. So I&#x27;m wondering if it is the real thing or if there is something missing from the ingredient. I sure do hope it works well with the second bottle. Is anyone esle experiencing the same problem?</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this product and suggest that I try it for my mother. My mother hair is growing on top and getting thick, anyone with hair loss should try.</li>
    <li> I love this! The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. It really helps my hair overall, including my edges. I would recommend this and I will be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> As previously stated in a review on ORS Edge Control, all of my edges broke off/came out. I was solely using coconut oil for a while, but then I switched up to using Elasta QP Olive Oil &amp; Mango Butter as a moisturizer and using JBC to seal. It&#x27;s not a miracle solution, but I can attest to these two products being ESSENTIAL in restoring hair I loss and retaining hair I have. I highly recommend JBC in lavender because the smell is more tolerable (less smoky than the original) and despite being extremely viscous, if applied appropriately for your hair type and you wash your hair weekly, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d love the results. it&#x27;s an awesome part of my newfound hair regimen, no matter what I moisturize with, JBC will ALWAYS be my go to sealer.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s shoulder length natural hair, which tends to dry out. This product is thick, I mix it with a little water in a spray bottle. I use a drop of it mixed into my face moisturizer. No breakouts either. The smell is strong, but once you start seeing results the scent will be forgotten.</li>
    <li> Just trying to understand the benefit. It makes my hair soft but I don&#x27;t see any re-growth to a thin area of hair. I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this again. Bunch of Jamaican hokey-pokey nonsense. lol. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my SisterLocks...it makes my scalp feel moisterized and makes my hair grow.  I no longer have dry scalp issues since using JBCO.</li>
    <li> A great moisturizer for dry hair; it silkins your hair, makes it feel happy.  My hair is thick and wooly and can be quite dry; but not anymore.  The black castor oil is the answer for anyone who suffers from dry, brittle hair.  I love this stuff.  Will not run out; will be buying more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I mix it with sulfur powder to treat my thining areas which resulted from wearing wigs while allowing my hair to become too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent source for beautifying and protecting your thick wooly hair.</li>
    <li> This product is not good for my daughter she has a sensitive scalp and it makes her scalp peel, I&#x27;m going to use it for myself, my sis uses it for herself and her children with no problem.  No worries about the review, everybody can&#x27;t use everything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick and the smell puts me a little off. Despite that a little oil goes a long way. I comb my hair out with some awapuhi moisure mist this apply this before I braid my hair down. I wake up in the morning and my hair is so soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Packaged really well; survived a transatlantic flight from the US to Kenya.  It does have a strong smell but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant. Absorbs well into the scalp. No residue left over on my locs.</li>
    <li> Will definitely purchase again. Gave a bottle to my aunt and she loved it as well.</li>
    <li> I am using this to re-grow my thinning hair. I have wavy, frizzy, hair. Many reviewers are of African American descent, but this product is not isolated to any demographic. Here is some feedback/how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Overall, I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;2. I use a dropper to dispense it, though it&#x27;s thick, the dispenser works.&lt;br /&gt;3. I sleep overnight with it.&lt;br /&gt;4. I use No. 4 Clarifying Shampoo (which is excellent) to get it off my scalp&lt;br /&gt;5. Then I condition my hair with Amika Conditioner (daily use)&lt;br /&gt;I do not think this product improves the shine of my hair, but it is helping my scalp. Be sure to massage it into your scalp and try not to get too much onto your hair. It&#x27;s my second month of using it and I will def. finish the bottle. Rosemary Oil + Grapeseed Oil treatment made my scalp stink. Not this, not at all. Lavender is a good add-in, smells ok.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It is thick and the smell is not bad. I use it on freshly washed hair and also on my ends when I do my twists.  If you have not tried Jamaican castor oil you must...you will never go back.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I use it for my hair and scalp and it works great for sealing moisture and scalp massages. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Try it on natural hair or skin. The product will keep you skin soft and supple. I prefer this product on my face.</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  my hair is growing like crazy. it also softened my hair. its pretty thick but love it</li>
    <li> This is my third or fourth bottle! My hair loves this oil!!! I will definitely continue to order the lavender JBCO because I love the smell over the original fragrance.</li>
    <li> love it, It was an easy process, high marks all around, highly recommend and will buy again... keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> This product is great for damaged hair that has been colored, blown dry and flat iron to death. To make a long story short, It&#x27;s great for overprocessed hair and for keeping your hair in optimum condition.</li>
    <li> Just received it and still waiting to see how it works.  It does mosterize my hair as it should. thanks.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after researching the benefits of castor oil, as I am on medication that has caused some thinning around the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference since I have been using it for approximately a month now. Although the oil is quite thick, it dissolves into the hair and scalp well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product was fairly priced and received much sooner than expected.  One should read up on its many uses---a friend recently was introduced to it for arthiritis.  She was pleasantly surprised that it also allowed her to have a restful sleep !  Holistic is the way to go !!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I read on the internet of women having success using it to help start the re-growth process.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about two weeks and I absolutely love it, it makes my hair &amp; scalp feel healthy, it soothes itching and it smells good.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this oil. I read several places that JBCO could have a bad smell so I ordered the Lavender one. It smells great! The oil is a bit heavy alone so I mix it with EVOO. It is great!</li>
    <li> This product is really good for sealing in moisture on natural hair. The lavender scent masks the natural scent of the castor oil.</li>
    <li> very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Loving this and just got it</li>
    <li> this stuff will make your scalp ITCH ! I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now , I can NOT keep my hands out of my head. Idk why almost none of the reviews mention how itchy it is. But anyways. You&#x27;re supposedly suppose to mix this oil with olive oil or coconut oil to reduce the itch. Ill try. But warning you guys, this stuff is freaking itchy &amp; its annoying.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my daughter.  She loves it.  Wanted me to try it so I bought it. I love it too. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product was purchase to use in an oil mixture for my hair.  It was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product twice, but thus far I like the moisture it gives my hair and the softness.</li>
    <li> Came on time. I&#x27;m happy. I got this to help with my scalp condition. I used it but I have cotton pillowcases(online buying satin now) to help with moisture staying in my hair and the oil on my scalp. When I wake  up the oil has soaked out of my satin bonnet onto the cotton pillowcase. So once I get the satin pillow cases I will be able to retain the oil on my scalp and see how well it works then..</li>
    <li> Great, my hair feels softer after using this along with water and other essential oils. The scent to me is perfect and although is a bit strong at first, it shortly subsides as it is absorbed into your head.  I will definitely be buying another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! part of my weekly natural hair regimen when I deep condition. A little goes a long way and the texture is thick compared to regular castor oil. Love the Lavender scent</li>
    <li> After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to try the black castor oil product. I was familiar with it having grown up in the Caribbean. My hair is thinning as I age, so I&#x27;m hoping this thickens it. I started off using it as a deep conditioner, but am now putting it directly on my scalp as a day-to-day moisturizer. Let&#x27;s see what happens after about three months of use.</li>
    <li> After battling breast cancer, I was searching for a product that would help me regrow my hair.  Initially, I purchased this product because I read that it helps to strengthen the hair follicle, and stimulates hair growth.  After  using this product for approximately 4 weeks, I noticed my hair regrowing thicker and stronger than it ever was in the past.  I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that this product also relieves arthritis and bursitis pain.  It did not take away my pain completely, but it did provide some relief.  The consistency is thick, and the color is dark brown. The lavender makes this product smell better than the original. Overall, I give the Lavendar Jamaican Black Castor Oil 5 stars.  I will definitely be continuing to repurchase this wonderful reasonably priced product (8oz for $10).</li>
    <li> This oil smells wonderful and works very well at moisturizing my dry hair alone or in home made hair products. Did I mention it smells great.</li>
    <li> I use this on my natural hair when I&#x27;m doing the LOC method and I use a damp throughout the week when my hair is getting a bit dry.</li>
    <li> I swear buy this stuff. This is truly the only castor oil I buy and I use it all the time. The lavender scent makes the smell bearable and the thickness of the oil is great for my hair. The glass container is a little tricky if you&#x27;re traveling but if you pack it carefully it will be fine. It&#x27;s a great, effective product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> good for hair! miracle in a bottle.  Cannot live without it.  I would recommend to anyone who has thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Use on my hair, skin, and for aches. Very good product. Very think and the smell isn&#x27;t too pungent. Worth the price</li>
    <li> I first purchased LJBCO last May and I always keep a bottle on hand. I use it every other day on my medium length locs. My locs drinks it up and it leaves them so soft and moisturized. Would highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I just recently started using this oil in my hair, I have mixed it with olive oil and will massage into my scalp at night, leave on with a shower cap overnight and wash in the morning. I like the smell and the consistency isn&#x27;t sticky since I&#x27;ve mixed it with olive oil. My hair is softer and shinier, but it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s actually helping to promote growth, that&#x27;s why only 3 stars for now.. Will likely continue using and purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I use this product for all of my Do It Yourself beauty and hair care needs and it works like a charm! I cook with it as well. So far no issues!</li>
    <li> I expected it to smell like at least a hint of lavender. It smells completely like ashes, I guess I will stick to making my own.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it</li>
    <li> Love this oil!! Now I don&#x27;t really care for the lavender scent but it is defiantly better than the original of the JBCO. I do use it about 2/3 times a week and it defiantly has helped with the thickness of my hair! A bottle usually last me about 6 months. A little goes a long way. But I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Oil is very strong i have to dilute it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! And smells good too. I used it 3 times a week for the past 3 months and my 4c type hair grew an inch and a half!! It&#x27;s so soft and thick too! It resolved my dermatitis too on my scalp and face. It absorbs well without being greasy. Great for people who have problem skin. Just a little used on your skin or scalp and more generously on the tips of your hair to keep it moisturized.This is my 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> I just received my castor oil yesterday, so it&#x27;s too soon to give a proper review of it. I just wanted to give my review on the smell of it scince a lot of people are making such a big deal about it! IT SMELLS FINE..all i can smell in this is the lavender! If you enjoy the fragrance of lavender, then you&#x27;ll love this! This oil is VERY thick, so you will need to thin it out with another oil like vitamin E or jojoba oil. I thinned mine out with vitamin E oil &amp; it&#x27;s a perfect consistancy now! Dont let all the negative reviews about the smell stop you from getting this!</li>
    <li> Love the way this smells you can really smell the lavender...smells alot beetter than regular Jamican Black Castor Oil, no smokey smell... Will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
