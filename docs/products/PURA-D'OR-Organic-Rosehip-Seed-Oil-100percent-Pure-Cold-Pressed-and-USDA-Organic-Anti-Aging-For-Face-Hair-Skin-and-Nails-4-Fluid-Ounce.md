<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product! I can&#x27;t even begin to explain the difference in my skin. The quality is wonderful. I love using it and will continue to order from Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old schooler who still likes to bake in the sun.  I know it&#x27;s not good for my skin but I like to have a coppertone tan.  I try to make up for it by using really good things on my skin that help the damage that occurs when I lay out.  This one is phenominal!  It has made my face look less leathery so of course, I look a little younger.  I feel better about my time in the sun now that I have this super fantastic Rose Hip solution.</li>
    <li> What a rare find!  Moringa Seed Extract is a rare luxury you don&#x27;t often find in a moisturizer.  It is an exotic extract that is a very potent antioxidant so it is fantastic for rejuvinating the skin.  Along with the Rose Hips Seed Extract and other goodies in this solution, I am amazed that it does not cost more.  It is well worth the purchase.  I use it regularly and always keep a good stock just in case they ever run out.</li>
    <li> I have used other Pura d&#x27;or products and know that they are a good brand.  When my teen-age daughter begin to experience acne, I knew where to turn.  She wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the idea.  She said it was &amp;#34;old lady stuff&amp;#34; and wanted to use a popular acne cream she saw on television.  I read to her what was in the one she wanted and told her the dangers of the chemicals.  She agreed to try Pura d&#x27;or Rose Hip Seed Oil instead.  It has been several months now that she has been free of acne.  She has actually recommended this product to her friends.  She doesn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;old lady stuff&amp;#34; anymore, by the way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Rosehip Seed Oil at night on my face (before going to bed) for about 6 months now. I can&#x27;t tell you the different quality in my skin - it glows! This oil is light, and does not clog pores. My skin is clearer, smoother, and firmer. I wish I had switched from chemical-laden moisturizers a LONG TIME AGO. Also, my husband has a severely dry scalp, and uses it on some of his dry patches. He says it has done wonders. We will keep buying this product!!</li>
    <li> This produc is excellent for acne and skin problems.  It got rid of the redness immediately and now is clearing away the acne.  I am sure it will also help the scars.  It is as excellent as it is advertised to be.</li>
    <li> smells awful!! Have been using it for weeks and not sure i see anything different with my skin.</li>
    <li> My skin condition is caused by a medical issue that makes my scalp flake and burn and my skin gets bumps and itches.  I have used Pura d&#x27;or Gold for my scalp and now am using their Rose Hip Oil for my face.  I am happy with both and they are clearing up my problems.</li>
    <li> the oil itself is a great value and high quality, but i found that i was allergic to it and couldn&#x27;t use it.  i still would highly recommend this brand, especially the argan oil (which i use everyday).</li>
    <li> I have a problem with acne on my back.  I read the ingredients of this product and also the quality in which it is made like being cold pressed and non-filtered.  I hoped it would work for my back and I was not disappointed.  It worked great.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have with this Pura d&#x27;or is that it is a bit pricey.  But it works like a charm.  I am looking younger and my skin is much more radiant and healthy so I don&#x27;t mind paying more.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Got this to put into my homemade lotion bars and it&#x27;s perfect!!! Nice bottle and great to measure from!! Not too greasy, will even try as a face moisturizer!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry skin, this is my third bottle, great moisturizer</li>
    <li> I bought this as a deal and really did not expect the results! I am pregnant and my skin was feeling super dry, now I have a super smooth skin like never before, and it does not look oily at all! I don&#x27;t know how, but its amazing how it works! I am also using it to prevent stretch marks. The smell is subtle and won&#x27;t bother you. I even feel the fine wrinkles are not so noticeable! Great product!</li>
    <li> Nice oil, but has a really fishy smell.</li>
    <li> Rosacea is downright embarrassing.  Then, when you get embarrassed, it gets redder.  I have suffered from Rosacea for years and had never found a thing to help until this Rose Hips product.  It cured my blues and my red face.</li>
    <li> I have learned that balancing the Ph of my skin is crucial to having great skin.  Unbalance skin Ph can cause acne and aging and other problems too.  The body in general needs a Ph balance or you can more easily catch diseases and get cancer. So, I wanted something organic to balance my skin.  I found this online and ordered it.  It came to my door very fast and I use it regularly.  I am happy to be balanced and my skin looks balanced, not oily or dry.</li>
    <li> The fact that this Rose Hip Seed hails from Chile is so cool.  Chileans were actually the only ones who knew of the power of Rose Hip Seed until fairly recently.  Their complexions are beautiful and they tend to hold their age well.  I am really impressed to find out where the Rose Hip Seed in this product comes from.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of roses, BUT this does not smell like roses. The smell is like cod liver oil! Not worth cost and time of sending back. Disappointed in smell and texture of oil , maybe expired?</li>
    <li> I live in Colorado and have for 7 years.  My family lives in Texas.  We were planning a family reunion and I realized just how much I had aged.  The cold, dry air was not being kind to my skin  in Colorado and I had hit fifty as well.  I had to do something quick so I looked around and checked many products out but ended up with this one because it has tons of great ingredients.  It worked better than I had hoped.  I am now looking forward to the reunion and not dreading it like I was.</li>
    <li> Natural Retinol Acid is fabulous for aging skin and is the key ingredient in this Rose Hips Oil, other than the Rose Hips Oil, of course.  Natural Retinol Acid is Vitamin A which makes skin beautiful and young.  It has made my face and neck look years younger.</li>
    <li> Born with a dark birthmark on my face, I have always hated the way I looked.  Then, I got acne.  Even when I grew out of the acne, the scars remained.  I really never felt good about myself and I have tried everything imaginable.  In the past few years, I have limited myself to only trying organic solutions and ones with no harsh chemicals.  That narrowed my choices down for sure.  A few things I tried work just a little bit but not that much.  I ended up trying this one because I saw their website and noticed what great ingredients were in it.  OMG!  Almost immediately my acne scars began to smooth out.  They weren&#x27;t near as deep and I think that may be from the collagen production this product stimulates.  I am not real sure though.  Then, after almost 3 months of using this, I saw that my birthmark was getting lighter.  It seems to fade out more and more each day.  For once in my life, I am liking the way I look.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I saw that this Rose Hips Seed Oil helped promote collagen and noticed all of the other beneficial ingredients in it so I thought I would give it a try. It&#x27;s amazing and works very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a fan when it comes to putting oil on my face. So when this package came, I was a bit hesitant to use Rosehips at first because I thought the oil would run all over my face, like other products I have tried, but I was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the bottle, the first thing I had noticed was the smell. It was not unpleasant but it did not smell of perfume either and so I was okay with that! When I applied the oil to my face, I was surprised because in less than a few minutes, the Rosehips oil was absorbed on my skin and the oily feeling was not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I extremely liked that! However, the most remarkable thing happened the next day because I woke up when I felt my husband touching my cheek because he noticed something was different. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m now an avid fan of this amazing miracle oil.</li>
    <li> Great product this really moisturizes my skin! Love that it&#x27;s 100% organic. Must buy!</li>
    <li> Need I say more? This is so smooth it will make your skin slippery in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen noticeable differences in my facial complexion just after 2weeks!</li>
    <li> I never thought that I would use any other skin care product other than the ones I have. I have used tons of skin care products. I normally go for plant oils or herbal oils that are organic and have less chemicals because I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;When people told me about Rosehips and how this was used by Orlando Bloom&#x27;s wife, then that made me interested. I have always liked Miranda Kerr&#x27;s fresh young-looking face. So I thought of trying Rosehips for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I did some research first before I bought this product. I learned that Rosehips is good for sensitive skin, for eczema, for acne and some have blogged about it as being a natural remedy for Botox. So with all the amazing benefits that I had gathered online and from the raving reviews here, I have no doubt that my skin will be as fresh and bright as Miranda Kerr&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Right now, after using it for barely less than a week, I have felt a dramatic change in my skin. I have added Rosehips oil to my skin care line. I usually use Aloe Vera cleansing gel in the morning and at night. I then use my Jojoba oil toner which is great for sensitive skin. After which I use Rosehips oil on my face, like 2 drops and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;After 5 days of using Rosehips, I saw that my skin was softer and smoother to touch. My cheeks started to have this pinkish glow every morning. Now, I&#x27;m a huge fan of Rosehips!</li>
    <li> This is a great value for the amount of rosehips seed oil. I have started using this mixed with Argan oil and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I received another bottle about 2 weeks ago and I am pleased to update my review. The pump worked this time. My skin feel well hydrated and not oily at all after a few minutes. I am perfectly able to do my make up about 10min after applying the oil. The packaging is great by the way.   I was very excited to receive this product. It arrived promptly and very well packaged. Unfortunately I received a bottle with a pump that does not work. I did try it once after unscrewing the cap and dropping some oil on my fingers but because the oil is so rich it would make a mess if I were to try to use it like this. I will be returning this bottle and hoping that the replacement works like it is supposed to do.  I was satisfied with the quality of the oil itself. The one time I used it on my face and neck I noticed that even though it is quite thick it is easily spreadable. Don&#x27;t be fooled (like me) to think that because it says &amp;#34;Rosehip&amp;#34; it will smell like a rose, it doesn&#x27;t but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. I will update this review when I receive the replacement and have been able to use it a little longer.</li>
    <li> i bought this for a friend who swears by it! very affordable price. she claims it is good for day and night usage. Very moisturizing for the face. and i have noticed her face has cleared up very well.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews before because I haven&#x27;t being impress by any product before, I use rosehip seed oil for about 6 months ago and I like how it help my dry body and face skin, I got run out of the one I use before so I didn&#x27;t use for a couple of days and I got this painful rash on my face wen I was looking for my usual rosehip seed Oil I find this &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;or &amp;#34; organic rosehip seed  on sale so I ordered it, wow I really love this brand in 2 days all the red painful rash in my face was gone,&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this rosehip seed oil brand for body and face skin.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product. I&#x27;ve been using Rose Hips Oil as part of my daily skincare routine for a while, but this is my first bottle from Pura d&#x27;or. The consistency is lovely and sinks right into my skin. The typical rose hips smell is there, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering and it goes away really quickly. If you haven&#x27;t used Rose Hips Oil before, it isn&#x27;t stinky, but it isn&#x27;t exactly fragrant either. I kind of smells like vitamins, if that makes sense.  My only complaint would be that the bottle didn&#x27;t appear to be full. The level of the oil only came up to 3/4&amp;#34; to 1&amp;#34; below the base of the bottleneck. I&#x27;m not sure how much product that would be volume-wise, but when so little of this stuff goes a long way, it may add up to quite a bit. Overall, i like this product. I love that it is USDA Organic. Especially since it&#x27;s going on my skin!</li>
    <li> I love the way this oil feels on my skin, however, the aroma is not the best. It took some time for my skin to absorb so I couldn&#x27;t lay my head on my pillow for awhile. My face is smoother to the touch and I anticipate more softening with each application.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my face and around my eyes.  I also mixed some with some other oils and Shea butter to make an amazing balm.  This helps soothe small skin irritations, moisturize my skin, and does not irritate my eyes.  The oil itself is very nice, but the bottle and pump top squirt out too much oil.  I mainly use my mixed balm so this isn&#x27;t much of a problem for me.  However, when ever I want just a little straight from the bottle, it always dispenses too much.</li>
    <li> The oil is amazing after a hot shower I put it on while my skin is still wet.  I  use it on my face and hands multiple times a day. The smell is different but were all getting use to it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I have very sensitive skin along with psoriasis on my hairline. Purador Rose hip seed oil is so gentel and moistureing. Non irretating I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very good for dry skin during windy days.  Smell not so good but it&#x27;s fragrance free which I like.</li>
    <li> I think there was a mistake when bottling this product, I got fish oil nstead of rose hip seed oil.</li>
    <li> This rosehip seed oil works very well for my combination skin. I combine it with a few other oils as an am/pm facial moisturizer and it does not leave my skin greasy or break me out. A little bit goes a long way and it even works well for me under my makeup.</li>
    <li> My skin cannot tolerate chemicals in skin care products.  I read that this Rose Hip Oil did not have chemicals and used a natural preservative.  I absolutely love it and will use it forever if possible.</li>
    <li> I would like to recommend it to anyone who has a problem with thin skin and a saggy jawline.  It must be the collagen or perhaps one of the essential oils but it is really firming my face.</li>
    <li> I recently started Oil Cleansing, and I learned a lot of it from www.minimalistbeauty.com.  I began the process of eliminating toxins from my life...my skin, my food, my hair products and so on.  I started using pumpkin seed and jojoba oil for the oil cleansing, but it was not clearing up my acne, and they were both drying me out.  So I started cleansing with pumpkin seed oil and then using the Pura d&#x27;or USDA Pure and Organic Rosehip Seed oil.  I just left it on my skin over night or under my gluten free make up when I chose to wear that. The dryness and the acne cleared up within a week, and my skin is smooth.  I like the smell. It is earthy and natural smelling.  Also, you only have to use a tiny bit, so I think the bottle of oil will last 6 months at this rate, possibly more.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the first of the year.  I was hesitant to purchase it because it seems everyone says their product is \\&quot;this and that\\&quot; but none are all that great.  I put it on my face the day I got it and twice a day ever since.  It has helped lessen my wrinkles and added firmness to my face.  I am hooked on the stuff.  It lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is even mentioned in the advertising of this product but it does not have petroleum products in it.  I have recently become aware of how harmful petroleum products are for the skin and how many products are made with them.  Vegetable glycerin takes the place of petroleum products in this Rose Hip Seed Oil.  It will not clog your pores and it is fine for all skin types because it will not make your face oily or greasy.  I really like that and love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Mother Earth fanatic.  I save the whales and protest agains GMO too.  But nevermind my personal views, the point is that for any product to live up to my standards is rare.  This one has and I am singing its praises.  Pura d&#x27;or Rose Hip Seed Oil is a step or two above the rest.  The Rose Hip Seeds are from Chile.  Why?  Because they have the best!  They are cold pressed and unfiltered.  Why?  Because that makes for a much better oil.  The ingredients are of the best quality and you can tell when you use it.  I am pleased to support this company when I purchase this fine product from them and you will practically never hear me say that.</li>
    <li> I go to the salon to have my nails done every two weeks. Sometimes I forget to remove my nail polish after 15 days and I guess this was what triggered my nails to become brittle. I tried other products but they pricey. Luckily, I found Rosehips oil and I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s affordable and effective. Since I have been using it for my nails, I no longer experience brittleness. My nails are thicker and harder than a sea shell. LOL!</li>
    <li> I love it! I can already see a difference in my skin as far as blemishes. I also put it on my four year old daughters skin because she has extremely dry skin, it doesn&#x27;t irritate her whatsoever. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I read in a magazine that Miranda Kerr uses Rosehip oil at night on her face and looking at her flawless beautiful skin, I figured it would work on me too.&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the bottle, I noticed that it had a weird smell. I thought to myself that this might be the case because it&#x27;s organic and pure.  When I applied Rosehips oil on my face, it was fast-absorbing and it didn&#x27;t have that sticky feel at all. I have used other herbal oils but most of these were heavy on the skin. Rosehips didn&#x27;t make a sticky mess on my face.&lt;br /&gt;In less than a few minutes of applying Rosehips on my face, I felt a bit of tingling sensation and then the softness just started to fill up my entire face and it felt soooo good that I almost cried...with excitement!&lt;br /&gt;Of course! I have never experienced such softness on my skin before and this was quite amazing. Even after one application I could feel that my skin was rejuvenated with all the vitamins packed in Rosehips oil. I will continue to use this and will post another review upon buying my 2nd bottle soon.</li>
    <li> I have a confession to make. I never really wanted to use Rosehips because the smell was sort of funny but since my boyfriend gave me one as a monthsary gift, I had to use it because I didn&#x27;t want to hurt his feelings. We&#x27;ve been going out for more than a year now so when he heard about Rosehips from his sister, he just bought me one. He thought I would like it.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to hurt his feelings, so I acted as if I really loved it. However I was wrong about the product. The moment I applied Rosehips oil on my face, I was astounded with its soft and creamy texture. The consistency of Pura d&#x27; or&#x27;s Rosehips blew me away. It was perfectly light and non-greasy!&lt;br /&gt;I never thought that an herbal oil could be this nice to the face. I have never tried any plant oils in the past, so I&#x27;m using Rosehips for the first time and the results on my face are simply breathtaking.&lt;br /&gt;On the first week that I started to use it, I started noticing that my pimples were slowly healed. The redness from the irritation had disappeared and my skin was clearer.&lt;br /&gt;I just use like 1 to 2 drops of Rosehips oil on my whole face because I didn&#x27;t want the whole bottle to run out right away. I usually do this before I sleep after I do cleansing and toning. The next morning after I look at my skin in the mirror and I&#x27;m in heaven. My skin always this rosy glow that I never use my expensive BB Cream anymore!</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this product on a amazon lightening deal. Glad that I did! The rosehip seed oil has been awesome on my dark circles under my eyes and leaves my skin super soft. I have been using it for about a month and live in ND, it has done wonders for my dry winter skin. I will continue to order this product! Without breaking the bank this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I color my hair a lot and it soon became dry,frizzy and brittle. A friend of mine from dance class had first used this product and she now has amazing hair. She recommended that I give it a try and so I did. I&#x27;m now an avid fan of Rosehips oil because after less than a week of using it on my hair, the dryness has diminished and my hair looks shiny! I just use a few drops of Rosehips oil after I take a shower and right before I go to bed. Just as simple as that and now my hair is back to life! I no longer use shampoo but I only use a conditioner and Rosehips oil everyday. I have learned from a salon professional that using shampoo everyday is bad for colored hair and so I try to avoid it!  Thanks to Rosehips oil, my hair has never looked this good before!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and have been using it twice a day for about a week on a scar over a year old and 3 of then that are almost three months old.  The newer ones are fading very nicely the bigger surprise is the old scar had decreased in redness significantly.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Having applied this product, twice daily for only a week, it does seem to reduce the appearance of fine facial lines and nourish the skin.  It is USDA organic and 100% pure rose hip seed oil and the scent is not pleasing but tolerable. The application of the product is made somewhat difficult, since only a predetermined amount of oil is dispensed with each depression of the top, and I find that to be more than I need for one application.  It is a product I will likely add to my daily regimen.  The price is reasonable.  If the above issues could be resolved, this product might be a 5-Star + one.</li>
    <li> The oil itself is good quality, however its smell is really unpleasant. I contacted the seller and they did not want to have the item returned stating the smell is due to the fact that it is all natural and without additives, they suggested I should have used it for 30 says and see. Having used it, I can say the product is good, the smell is not.  I have used another organic rosehip oil, available also on Amazon, that has a much pleasant aroma and is quite good as well.</li>
    <li> I always use rosehip seed oil, I got this as a present. since it is in a nice packaging I just displayed it in my room.when I saw this again in my room I thought I should try this. when I opened it it gives a smell of a rose and I love it, then after applying it  my skin felt soft and my hair is shinier. this is better than my first oil so I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Good packaging. Like the dark green glass bottle. Oil is lovely</li>
    <li> I was on the verge of having a facelift.  My aging face was out of control and I was not ready to throw in the towel and look old.  I am only fifty.  I searched online for a remedy and found several I liked but narrowed it down to this one.  I liked the fact the Rose Hip Seed Oil is cold pressed and that they include Grapefruit Seed in the mixture.  I was quite happy with the product, the look, scent and texture and am pleased with the results as well.</li>
    <li> I had crow&#x27;s feet and needed something gentle enough to put around my eyes.  I am not sure if this formula is actually advised for the eye area so do be careful if you use it as I did but let me tell you, it worked within 6 weeks to drastically reduce the little wrinkles and the eye area is a really tough spot because there are no glands and it gets really dry and can get very wrinkled.  Extremely please with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an 18 years old Filipina american  that Like&#x27;s to go to beach regularly.. last month we&#x27;ve go to beach for fun and I got a sun burn, my friend recommend me this product and said that I should put this to my sun burn 2 times a day after taking bath. then I said to my self \\&quot;there&#x27;s nothing happen if I&#x27;ll try it\\&quot; so I&#x27;ve tried it and I got really surprised when I saw that in just a week my sun burn got off my skin.. I&#x27;ll recommend this product to those in need!</li>
    <li> I know when I see a good product. I was looking for a Rosehips oil product and found this one from Purador at a good price, so I grabbed the deal and bought one for myself and one for my daughter who has acne.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 43 and my daughter&#x27;s 18 but we both loved Purador&#x27;s Rosehips because it&#x27;s not greasy and it does not have that heavy, sticky feel. The oil is simply absorbed right away. Aside from having wonderful skin benefits, Rosehips oil is also good for the nails.&lt;br /&gt;So now I have a two-in-one product that gives me gorgeous-looking skin and fabulous hard nails. Isn&#x27;t that a wonderful deal? All these amazing benefits at a price anyone can afford. How could I say no that? Thanks Rosehips for making my life easier. This product from Purador rocks! It&#x27;s the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a month since I started to use Purador and the results are truly amazing. I have fresh, young-looking skin that glows every morning when I wake up. Who wouldn&#x27;t want to wake up to that???</li>
    <li> I will never stop using this oil because it has caused new hairs to grow all over my head where they did not grow before. It is amazing. My hair was thinning more and more each week, but now it is actually growing. I also had dark acne spots on my face that have nearly faded away. This oil is amazing!</li>
    <li> I genuinely like this product. It is a pleasure to use and makes my skin look and feel good. I even like the earthy smell. I particularly like the screw pump top of the bottle which makes this oil very easy to dispense and then lock to prevent spills. Love that it is from nature!</li>
    <li> I like this oil, I find this oil is kind of thin compare to other rosehip oils, but overall this is a good oil</li>
    <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, the smell is strange. Slightly fishy and/or like vitamins. I even tried adding lavender essential oil to mask the smell and it didn&#x27;t work. It is also too strong to use on my face, it got irritated after a few days. I&#x27;m back to using the Argan Oil by the same company, which works great.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. It changed my face for the better. I have rosacea and this product has helped to even out my skin tone and reduce my acne. I love it, and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great value.  I&#x27;m a big rosehipseed oil fan.  I&#x27;ve tried many.  This on is as great value.  It&#x27;s a bit heavier than others I&#x27;ve tried but when used at night you wake up with beautiful glowing skin.  It doesn&#x27;t break me out and my skin is so soft.  I think it&#x27;s a bit heavy for day at least for my skin.  If you have dry skin this will be a dream.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!After one week ,my scared become smoother.Love it!!!</li>
    <li> If we don&#x27;t save the earth, there will not be one.  I recycle and do all I can to help the future generations and do not purchase items that are destroying the rain forests.  This is a great product and it represents integrity.  Yay!</li>
    <li> great product  love what it does to my skin, helps my acne and scars and keeps my skin nice and moisturized without feeling oily, Will defiantly buy again</li>
    <li> I have adult acne.  My doctor suggested that I use a topical Vitamin A that also had extra antioxidants in the mixture.  I found this one and it is super.  Got ird of the acne right away and has made my skin totally clear.  Yay!</li>
    <li> Too greasy that it is not pleasant to use. Makes my face all shiny.    I can use this on my legs and hands without problem but face is a NO NO!    Good use for my scar on my legs from falling off my bike. It really lighten up the scar</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this product. After reading several good reviews, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It works. I have been using this product on my face for five weeks and my skin texture seems to improved.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and how they shipped it to me i just got it but i feel like its gonna work so ill update</li>
    <li> I gave this product a couple of weeks to give it a fair chance. Price, packaging and delivery were all good, however the actual product is nothing like rosehip seed oil I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I specifically purchased this brand because another claimed it had changed it&#x27;s formula and I wanted my rosehip to smell, look and act like the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not authentic rosehip seed oil, it is odorless and almost colorless and does not behave on my skin the way actual rosehip oil behaves. In order to appeal to a more broad customer base it has removed everything wonderful, natural and authentic. I only gave it two stars because it didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction on my skin. I&#x27;m inclined to believe it&#x27;s just repackaged vitamin E oil (my opinion)</li>
    <li> I used this as a moisturizer after applying your PURA D’OR 20% VITAMIN C SERUM WITH HYALURONIC ACID.  It enhanced my skin feeling well moisturized.  With Rose Hips naturally high in Vitamin C also, I think the duo a perfect skin treatment match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also softened the skin on my elbows!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  It is reasonably priced and works remarkably well. My skin is soft and moisturized after using it morning and night. I apply a sun screen over it to protect from the sun and the 2 work together to make my face extremely hydrated. I would highly  recommend  this product.</li>
    <li> Purador has great products and this rosehip seed oil does not disappoint.  It came in great packaging so no leaks too!</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels and looks hydrated and healthy.  Don&#x27;t care for the fishy smell but is worth it how my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something for your acne, this is a 2 in 1.  It gets rid of current acne and heals the scars you already have going on. Get it.  It&#x27;s real good.</li>
    <li> So a complete stranger just told me what a pretty, clear complexion I have.  I bought this Rose Hips Oil about 2 months ago because my face was anything but clear.  It was bad.  I am as happy as a girl can be to hear such a compliment and wanted to write in about it.</li>
    <li> Got acne?  Get Pura d&#x27;or!  End of story!  Well, almost.  It&#x27;s the Rose Hip Seed Oil in the little green bottle with a gold label.  It is a little pricey but it&#x27;s the best ever!</li>
    <li> This formula is working marvelously as an anti-aging solution.  I use it as a moisturizer, twice daily, and I am seeing my fine lines and wrinkles disappear.  I have also noticed some age spots have faded.  Thanks so much, Pura d&#x27;or, for this excellent formula!</li>
    <li> Great product! I love that it&#x27;s 100% organic and it really moisturizes the skin. Must buy!</li>
    <li> bad smell, wont buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great oil at an awesome price. Makes my skin feel silky :)</li>
    <li> I extremely love this oil, it reduces my dark spot and wrinkles, I wear only the Organ Rosehip Seed  oil at night and also use at day time under my make up.  My dark spot is almost gone after 1 week I&#x27;m using this product, and the wrinkles look much less than before, my skin is so smooth now.  My husband and I also like the smell. I highly recommend this product to all my friends and my co-workers and I will keep continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle of pura d&#x27;or Organic Rosehip Seed Oil because it absolutely produces results!  I&#x27;m a 60 year old skin care product addict and I&#x27;m always researching the latest in skin care technology.  In the oils area:  after trying Argan Oil, Sea Buckthorn Berry Oil, Emu Oil, etc., none of which lived up their promise on my skin, I found Rosehip Seed Oil and decided to give it a try.  Pura d&#x27;or is the first one I bought and I was very impressed with the results.  For the first time in my &amp;#34;skin oil trials&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t break out, the oil didn&#x27;t stink, and voila! Wrinkles on my face, especially around my mouth (I purse my lips a lot, a bad habit I&#x27;ve been trying to break) but also the even worse wrinkles on my neck have been greatly diminished and I am so thrilled!  At 60, there&#x27;s nothing short of surgery that will lift my face and neck, but people always judge me to be at least 10 years younger.  Not all attributable to this oil, but it sure does help more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  I bought another brand of the oil a while back and it was awful, left a yellow residue and smelled horrible.  Side note:  I use hyaluronic acid serum, vitamin C serum, peptide serum, SPF 50 moisturizer and this oil.  I use the oil on my body, too, and seal it in with over-the-counter moisturizer.  My skin loves it!</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or rose hip seed oil is just wonderful. It smeels so good and it feels light on the skin. My face feels nourish and amazing. I just love this product.</li>
    <li> I use this every am and I love what I see....skin texture, pores are less visible and skin just looks brighter.  I will continue to make this part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this oil. She says it makes her skin silky smooth with a very hydrated feel. She&#x27;s used it by itself and mixed with other oils and says it&#x27;s a great product to keep on hand when skin is in need of an extra dose of moisture.</li>
    <li> I have applied this Pura d&#x27;or Organic Rosehip Seed oil a week on morning and at night. It&#x27;s so amazing. My post acne scars are faded.</li>
    <li> I use this every night before I go to sleep.  My skin in the morning looks and feels hydrated</li>
    <li> One of the best products ive ever used. Pura d&#x27;or, it beyond the best brand. I will never use another brand.</li>
    <li> Good product works really good!</li>
    <li> I was embarassed of my adult acne.  It made me look like a very old teen-ager.  I found this organic cure online and ordered it.  It came right away and was packaged very nice.  It smells fantastic and has so many really great things in it.  I thought it would probably work and it did.  I am very happy that in only one month, my acne has cleared up.</li>
    <li> I would recommend the rose-hip oil to anyone. My skin tone and texture improved within a few days of using it. Thank you for a high quality product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see the results it claims.  I like argan oil better.</li>
    <li> A lot of products claim to be organic but if they aren&#x27;t certified organic, better check &#x27;em out!  This Rose Hip Seed Oil by Pura d&#x27;or is certified organic.  That means it has no pesticides or GMO.  That alone sold me on this product and the way it worked on my facial scars proved it.  Could not be more pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewer who said this product is too greasy for facial use. Am going back to NZ Fusion Botanicals rosehip oil, which is almost instantly absorbed by my face.</li>
    <li> great products with this seller!!!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing overnight a felt a big difference. If this is Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, what was I buy prior? I brought a bottle from a Vitamin retailer which works nothing like this oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this organic rose hip seed oil for my combination skin for almost a month. I have noticed my acne is clearing up and I honestly look 5 years younger. So worth the money! I will order again and again!</li>
    <li> This review is from my girlfriend. She really enjoyed using this product, and recommended it to all her friends for acne treatment and moisturizing. We started seeing good results after just four days of use. It helps reduce breakouts and reduces blemishes and scarring a little. Its been two weeks and she&#x27;s loving this product. Along with the pura for argan oil, which she already loves, she exclaims that her complexion has improved a lot with excellent moisture and reducing the effects of acne. Will continue to evaluate the rose hip oil with prolonged usage. The pricing is fair, I&#x27;ve seen Korean cosmetics sell for double the price for the same oil.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few rosehip oils but would give this one the highest rating. It smells great-natural- and it is very oily whereas the other ones that I&#x27;ve tried are very watery.</li>
    <li> I was having problems with oily blemishes and thought fight oil with another oil, how does that work? Well i guess it has something to do with balancing the skin with a vitamin E rich oil instead of oil glands with impurities. well however it worked, my face has seen the results. less breakouts, clearer pores, and softer skin.</li>
    <li> Sounds cliché but not all Rose Hip Oils are created equal.  This one is a stand up brand.  The Rose Hip Seed used is straight from Chile and is cold pressed which makes it a much better quality and helps it last longer.  It is not filered either.  Plus, it&#x27;s organic.  It is a top notche product and I am enjoying using it with excellent results.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful oil with a Achilles heel: It is a bit too thick! So if you like your oil to be thin, use argan oil instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you like it thick for your skin type, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Rosehip</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am in my 70&#x27;s and I heard about pura d&#x27;or, Rose Hip seed oil and I have to admit I was a little surprised after I used this oil.  I have always had nice skin...but after using this oil for just a week, I noticed the wrinkles around my mouth and eyes really softened a lot. I have used other oils from QVC, they were good.  I have used these oils for 5 yrs or more.  I noticed that my face was never as soft or as smooth as when I tried pura d&#x27;or, Rosehip Seed Oil.  My husband even noticed the difference.  I ordered another bottle for my granddaughter.  Going back for more oils. ❤️</li>
    <li> My skin was getting really dry and rough when I turned forty.  I saw this Rose Hip Seed product online and decided to try it.  It made my face really soft immediately, soft like a baby&#x27;s behind.  It seems to have made it more supple too.  The Aloe Vera is another really good thing it has in it that has helped my skin too.  I get heat rashes very easily and on really hot days, I put extra on for good measure and it seems to be preventing the rash so far this summer.  I will keep using this without a doubt.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> To get great skin, it has to regenerate.  Old skincells have to sluff off and new skin cells take their places.  When you don&#x27;t have enough collagen in your system, your skin does not regenerate very well.  The older I get, the more I notice that I am lacking collagen because my skin is sagging and it is not new skin growth at all.  It looks dull.  I saw that this Rose Hips Seed Oil helped promote collagen and noticed all of the other beneficial ingredients in it so I thought I would give it a try.  It&#x27;s amazing and works very quickly.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this oil, not a huge fan of the rose smell, but my skin did feel softer after using it.  Would buy it again</li>
    <li> He really didn&#x27;t mean it bad but my husband commented that I looked old.  I am outside a lot and the sun has really aged my face.  I needed a soluton to get rid of some wrinkles and to give my skin health and softness.  I am using the great product that I really love.  It protects my skin from being damaged any further and is making is softer and fuller too.</li>
    <li> I used to have an entire array of beauty products that took care of dry skin, skin discolorations, and wrinkles. Now, and one little bottle, I have something that takes care of all of that. I have been able to free up so much space in my beauty cabinet for other things. I have also been able to save a lot of money. This one little bottle is a lot cheaper than all of the stuff that I used to buy. Keep up the great work Pura d&#x27;Or, your vitamin C serum is just awesome!</li>
    <li> I used to carry around the lotion with me to help me take care of my dry skin. Pura d&#x27; Or&#x27;s vitamin C serum is about three times the cost of the lotions that I used to purchase. At first, this seems like it would be a really bad thing. However, I used to go through a larger bottle of lotion and about a week and a half. I have had a small bottle of this for three months, and I still have a little bit left. This product is a great value for your money, and if you have bad, dry skin like I do, this is a godsend.</li>
    <li> I have just had my third baby.  At six months I started using this product on the stretch marks I had from my other two.  I was hoping to prevent getting more and I did but also it began to fade the ones I already had.  I am continuing to use this even after having my baby and it is really helping.</li>
    <li> I am an attorney in my mid-forties.  I have had deep acne pits for most of my life due to acne as a teen-ager.  I planned to one day have a procedure on it but just never did.  I stay pretty busy,  My wife, I think, worries more about it than I do.  She purchase this Rose Hips Oil product for me to use twice a day.  I did.  I am so glad I did!  My pits are not as deep now and not red at all like they used to be.  Guess it&#x27;s an open and shut case.  Rose Hip Oil works!</li>
    <li> When I learned that Rosehips was a natural remedy for pimples and acne, I did not think twice about buying it. I am in my 2nd week of using Rosehips oil and my pimples are no longer visible. In fact, my skin is no longer red from acne. The scars have diminished and I feel a whole lot better now when I look in the mirror. I used to suffer from acne a lot and I&#x27;ve tried many skin products. Most of these brands were rather expensive. So, when I saw that it was quite affordable and natural, I bought one right away! Now, I&#x27;m enjoying clearer skin than ever!</li>
    <li> This product by Pura d&#x27;or is most excellent!  It has made a wonderful change in the complexion of my face.  It also has diminished some wrinkles I had around my lips.  The ingredeints are fabulous.</li>
    <li> Essential Fatty Acids are a must for healthy skin!  Add in Vitamins C and A, Rose Hip Seed Oil, Aloe Vera and Grapefruit Seed Extract and you have one wonderful solution for aging.  It is packed full of great vitamins and minerals and I feel great about using it, like I am actually healing it, not just masking the problem.  I have even started putting it not only on my face and neck, but on my hands too and I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> Rose Hips Seed Oil by Pura d&#x27;or is the best of the best.  I have tried a good share of expensive organic anti-remedy solutions.  Some I have continued using and others I did not like at all.  I love this one!  It is my favorie moisturizer and I use it along with a few other anti-aging solutions.  It worked right away to moisten my dry skin and is helping on my fine lines and wrinkles too.  I am told I have a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; about me.  Ha!  I am in my fifties and I am glowing.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product because it gave my skin a radiance and healthy glow. everyone i know notice it. i&#x27;m happy with this and in fact im in need to order again..</li>
    <li> this product is actually just a gift to me so i don&#x27;t know what benefits it will give to me, I just use it as a moisturizer to my face and body and I also use it to my hair because I love the smell, sometimes I put some oil to my hair brush, so when I brush my hair it will give my hair a soft rose smell.. because of this my hair is always shiny and bouncy.</li>
    <li> Rose Hip Seed Oil is pretty miraculous stuff, if you get right down to it.  It cures a lot of ailments and is an effective remedy for aging skin and also for acne and acne scars.  I even use it on burns and insect bites and on my sunburn this summer too.  It&#x27;s gentle enough that I have put it on my grandchildren for bites and sunburns too.  It&#x27;s organic and has no chemicals in it so it&#x27;s safe for all.  I could talk about this great stuff all day long!</li>
    <li> I use nothing but high qulity skin care products.  I could not wait to try this one out because of the Rose Hip Seed Oil, Aloe Vera and the Grapefruit Seed Extract.  I have used all of those but never in the same solution.  I am amazed at how my face is glowing with health and I look years younger too.  Everyone is telling me that I look great and they are asking what my secret is.  No secret.  I tell them.  Why wouldn&#x27;t I?  It&#x27;s really fantastic and I just want to tell everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and I&#x27;m using Rosehips for my acne problem. I have had this problem since highschool and I&#x27;ve tried various brands and several natural remedies but this is only one that works for my skin. I thank God that I&#x27;m not allergic to it and that it&#x27;s cheap! LOL. This oil has given me amazing results with just a few weeks use. I also have changed my diet along with using this skin remedy. Plus, I sleep early at night and have cut hours on gaming time. So altogether, after three weeks, my acne scars were no longer visible and my skin was soft to touch!</li>
    <li> I have eczema, on my arms the most and I get a prescription cream for the problem which is like putting noxzema on which is great for sunburn pain relief but not for eczema. This Rosehip oil is so much easier to apply and works just as well as my prescription cream if not better. It does not smell like roses but the smell is not bad just different and goes away after about ten minutes. I have been using this for over a week and will continue to use it. It is not a cure but it is just as good as any relief I have tried including emu oil. Also it just takes a little of the oil to spread out over a good part of skin so will last a while.</li>
    <li> I have ordered three bottles of this oil.  I was so happy with the first two that I sent this to my boyfriend&#x27;s house in Arizona.  When I opened it to use it, this bottle had a horrible scent like something rotten and I had to toss it.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> After one month of usage I can say this is not an overnight miracle for aging skin.  I don&#x27;t believe there is such a thing when you are talking about rebuilding skin layers  It takes at least a month to see those changes as I am starting to see now.  What I did experience within just a day or two was a nice glow and the appearance of reduced pores.  The moisturizing effect was amazing considering how very cold it has been and the dry indoors environment.  This oil absorbs quickly into skin and never leaves your face feeling like it has been smothered.  Don&#x27;t forget your neck and decollete.  Start using it now and you will be ready to wear all your pretty summer tops with confidence.</li>
    <li> When I saw that this product had not only rose hip seed oil, but grapefruit seed extract in it too, had to have it.  I bought it for facial scars due to acne as a teen but when I saw what all it had in it, I knew I would use it for much more than that.  Proud to say that my scars are looking much better and I believe it is making my face look healthier too.  I actually put it on my entire face and it is making it look so healthy.  Cannot beat this great mix!</li>
    <li> When I found out I was having twins, I knew I had to get something extra good for stretch marks.  My sister recommended this Rose Hip Seed Oil and showed me where to order it.  I began putting it on my tummy twice a day.  I have twins now but very few stretch marks which is amazing.</li>
    <li> My combination skin can be tricky when choosing an anti-aging regimen.  I break out easily yet my skin simply has to be moisturized.  This Rose Hips Oil is wonderful because it does not clog my pores but it moisturizes my skin and leaves it so soft.  It seems to be dripping some years off my looks too.  I am happy, for sure.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because when the Rose Hip Oil is imported from Chile, cold pressed and not filtered, it HAS to be superb.  Not to mention, it is organically grown and contains no harsh, harmful chemicals.  That is why I ordered it but why I use it every single day, twice a day, is because it is very effective for my aging skin.  I am getting compliments about how much younger I am looking so I know it is working but then again, with such quality, why wouldn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or Rose Hip Seed Oil is very effective for a number of things.  I purchased it to use as a moisturizer for my dry face but I also use it on a few scars I have too.  It is a nice, refreshing moisturizer and scar solution too.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic.  I have had so much difficulty in getting scratches on my legs or feet to heal...  I have been so amazed at how improved my skin looks after using this twice daily for 2 months.  I had ugly bloody scratches on my left leg after one of my dogs pushed off my leg with it&#x27;s claws while my leg was outstretched on my recliner.  I wish I had taken a picture... They were not healing...just red and scabby for months.  I started putting this product on and I am so thankful to say the wounds are healing and have closed completely.  I don&#x27;t know if this will work for everybody, but for me this stuff is like a miracle.</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x60;or oils are on my holy grail list of skin care products. This one is definitely worth the splurge; it makes my skin silky soft and reduces fine lines.The texture was just right for me - I am a big fan of jojoba oil and shea butter but those are on the thicker side. I use this oil as a facial moisturizer at night and wake up next morning with a glowing skin. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I tried the &amp;#34;Perricone MD&amp;#34; line for a couple months, and it had a damaging effect on my skin. I used the &amp;#34;Jack Black&amp;#34; line for a few months to no real effect.  I ride a motorcycle, so my face and skin feel all of the elements. I have now been using the &amp;#34;pura d&#x27;or Vitamin C Serum&amp;#34; along with &amp;#34;pura d&#x27;or Rose Hip Seed Oil,&amp;#34; for a few weeks and have experienced incredible new firm, supple skin growth. My skin feels new, and looks like it too...I have been receiving very kind compliments from friends and family. I will be using this product indefinitely, and have been recommending it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I had read that Rose Hip Seed Oil promotes the natural production of collagen.  Collagen is what makes the skin firm and since my face was saggy, I obviously was not producing enough.  So, I purchased this Pura d’or Rose Hip Seed Oil.  I have been using it daily for about 6 weeks.  My face is feeling tighter and more firm.  I am very pleased and am very happy that I was able to find a natural solution to my problem.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes in my scar formation after 3 weeks of use. Should I use this longer? Or maybe my scar tissue is too dark and aged already?    Update: So I decided to use it longer because it is a waste to throw it away and after about 2 months, my scar is noticeably lighter! I am impressed. So be patient if it doesn&#x27;t work right away.</li>
    <li> Everyone says that my freckles are cute.  Personally, I have never liked them.  I am sixteen now and I begged my mom to find something I could use to try to fade them out.  She didn&#x27;t want to but finally did get this for me because it&#x27;s organic and actually healthy.  I have been putting it on twice a day for two months and I am happy because you can barely see my freckles at all!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! It&#x27;s not too greasy very lightweight and a little goes a long way! The only downside is the smell and pump. It has a light fishy odor and the pump can dispense too much product if using on just a small area like your face. I use it mostly at night after I&#x27;ve showered and cleansed my face. I&#x27;ve noticed brighter skin and acne scars have completely disappeared! I use it on my legs as well since I have some dark spots due to ingrown hairs and they have lightened dramatically. Even better, stretch marks have become less visible. Truly love this stuff and will buy again! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  I can really see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Even after a few days, my face and neck feel super moisturized.  This product is more oily than the argon oil but the next morning all is absorbed in my face.  I have heard that Rose Hips also helps with brown spots so I was happy to get the benefit of both oils in one.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I suffer from a little acne.  Bought this product and our skin looks beautiful.  My daughters has improved greatly.  My skin looks great but I still have breakouts usually once a month it seems due to hormones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this product, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week! I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin tone, and also - my skin isn&#x27;t an odd combination of dry and oily any longer. I&#x27;ve always struggled with skin issues (acne, combo skin) and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything out there. I&#x27;ve finally found my answer :) (For reference, I&#x27;m a 26 y/o white female )</li>
    <li> This bottle came nicely packaged and was encased in a small fabric sack. Better than the packaging is the quality of the product for the price. The smell and texture of the rose hip seed oil was just what I was expecting. I use other another oil on my skin and this will be a nice and natural complement to my skin care regime. I will buy this again when I run out!</li>
    <li> My husband is a \\&quot;He Man\\&quot; and is very vain.  He hates looking older.  I do too so I tried this and loved it.  It is the first aging solution that has brough good results.  My husband finally decided to try it too and I swear he looks younger than I do.  No fair but it&#x27;s all good!</li>
    <li> The best of the best. I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the purest, freshest and highest quality. I can tell by the scent and viscosity. It also works miracle on my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this over argan oil because I can&#x27;t stand the nutty scent of argan oil. This is a more gentle aroma.</li>
    <li> I like it so far I guess...</li>
    <li> This combination left me face in such unbalance. The best of the best. I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the purest, freshest and highest quality. Mixed in with my usual day and night creams makes them go further. This was sent to me to review so I have spent several weeks using it here and there on myself.</li>
    <li> This product smells horrible!  I absolutely cannot stand it! Yuck!!</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s probably too early to say anything. Having used it for three days (twice a day, morning &amp; night), I feel like the scar on my cheeks due to several breakouts are slowly disappearing. I am 30, female, with combination skin type. I occasionally get breakouts due to pressure. Hope this is really a cure for the scar....I will update my review if they really are gone.</li>
    <li> This organic, chemical-free Rose Hip Seed Oil has done the trick that none other could ever do.  I had deep scars on my face and then the skin was thin from the peel.  It would get irritated very easily and would turn red.  Now it is very close to normal looking.  I love the gentle ingredients and the very nice scent.</li>
    <li> Hyper pigmentation was the problem.  Pura d&#x27;or Rose Hip Seed Remedy was the solution.  It got rid of the discolorations I had that made my face look like I had not washed it in months.  Gracias Amigos!</li>
    <li> Preggo with acne and getting stretch marks by the dozen.  I was miserable.  My mom bought me this online.  It&#x27;s a Rose Hip Oil and it smells nice and works so fast.  Happy to say all is well now and I have a happy healthy baby girl who has a happy healthy mommy!</li>
    <li> Oil work well for me, smell when first apply but it dies down.  I have very sensitive skin and will outbreak, did not have this with this product. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Being a man, the thought of putting roses on my face made me cringe.  But so did my acne scars.  I do know quite a bit about natural health and so I was convinced this product would be good for my acne, if I could just make myself use rose stuff. Well, I did and the results are amazing.  Everything is coming up roses, lol.  Really, it&#x27;s not bad at all.  Kind of nice.</li>
    <li> Stressing out causes me to break out.  Not in pimples but more like a rash.  It is embarrassing and stressful.  My bff got me this because I had read about it but could not afford it.  I have been rash-free for 2 months.  It started working in about 2 weeks.  It feels and smells good and does not sting at all.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and my fiance has Rosacea.  We are getting married in 2 months and did not want to be in front of all our guests all broken out and red faced.  I heard this was great stuff and got us one to share.  I see a difference in both of our faces and am going to order another bottle.  Cannot wait to have our wedding now.</li>
    <li> My daughter has always been mature in that she has gone through stages earlier than her peers.  She began having break-outs when she was almost 11 which I think is early.  None of her friends had pimples and it bothered her a lot.  I had to have a very gentle acne solution and in looking online, I found this one.  It is gentle enough for all ages and all skin types and has helped to clear her blemishes.</li>
    <li> Acne is an inflammation in short.  That&#x27;s what my doctor told me.  He was going to give me a perscription for an anti-inflammatory but I do not take perscription drugs because they all come with side effects.  Online I found this solution and whatever all it has in it is organic and is working for my acne and the swelling and redness too.</li>
    <li> I have always concluded that what is safe for the enviornment is safe for me and what is safe for me is safe for the environment.  If something has chemicals as a preservative or SLS in it, it is not safe for the environment and is not safe for me.  This product is safe for all!</li>
    <li> I read in a magazine that Rosehips is great collagen booster and that&#x27;s why I purchased the product. My skin is firmer, finer and it glows, especially when I have had enough sleep at night. I have only been using this for more than a week and my skin has never been fresher than it looks now. My boyfriend had noticed it too since he has been touching my face a lot when we meet for lunch at work. I have never been happier and I will continue to use this product as it has given me refreshing results!</li>
    <li> My friends threw me a spa baby shower when I was expecting my daughter.  One friend gave me this Rose Oil so I could use them on the stretch marks I got very early in my pregnancy.  She uses it and loves it.  Now I use it and love it too!  It is really healthy for the skin and sure took away my ugly stretch marks.  You can barely see them now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Rosehip seed about 3 months ago and I noticed that my hair gone  shiny and healthy , i don&#x27;t even need to go to a hair salon for a treatment. and my hair is tangle free! and  i even in my face gone with the dark spots and pimples, now i also use this for my nails to protect it from damage. since then I continously using this,. I recommend this to everyone! you&#x27;ll not regret if you try this!</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my hands and legs. when I saw that this is great for eczema I did not think twice to buy this. having eczema is very itchy and not a good sight, some people will not touch you, afraid that they will get eczema too. In less than two weeks of using this I don&#x27;t feel the itchiness anymore, I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now and I felt that the the ezcema is fading. I used this twice a day after taking a bath, and I also like the rose smell..</li>
    <li> Out of curiosity, I had to see what on earth fermented radish root was for.  Wouldn&#x27;t you know, it is a preservative!  Instead of using a chemical preervative that is really bad to put on your skin, this company uses fermented radish root.  That is awesome.  I ordered some of this today and it has not come in yet, but I am already impressed.</li>
    <li> I am simply amazed with Rosehips. Aside from the fact that my skin is refreshed every morning when I wake up, I feel great! I did some research and found out that Rosehips contains lots of Vitamin C, so this means it&#x27;s really good for the body! I don&#x27;t have any pimples and my skin looks refreshingly young because of all the vitamin C. I&#x27;m a great fan for anything that has Vitamin C and I have seen that Rosehip oil is great for my skin!</li>
    <li> Pura d&#x27;or Rose Hip Seed Oil has really cleared up my face.  I used to break out all the time and now I don&#x27;t.  I know the Rose Hip Seed Oil is supposed to prevent break outs because it has anti-oxidants and antibiotics in it.  The best thing about this product other than that it works good is that it does not have preservatives and chemicals that really break my face out bad.  I have used plenty of blemish products that made me break out worse and that really upset me.  Who wants to buy pimples?  So I am really happy with this product and think that anyone else who breaks out bad will too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I knew for a fact that Rosehips seed oil has been used as a natural ingredient in improving acne. What I didn&#x27;t know that it was good for the hair and nails too! So now, I not only use Rosehips on my face but I also use it for my hair and on my nails. After a week of using this product, my skin has glowed with all the pimples gone and my hair is shinier than ever! My mom noticed it too and I just bought her one as a present. Now, I&#x27;m using it for my nails to protect it from damage. I guess Rosehips is an all-in-one beauty remedy and I&#x27;m simply happy that I made the right choice - thanks Rosehips!</li>
    <li> This Rose Hips formula took away my unsightly stretchmarks.  I didn&#x27;t think anything could.  I had tried two other ones and they did not help at all.  My stretchmarks were really deep and were shiny and silverish.  I had them on my stomache and even on my thighs.  This formular worked in well under 6 weeks.  I am so relieved and so is my husband.</li>
    <li> I have been meaning to try Botox but I&#x27;ve seen the side effects and this was what drew me back into trying it. However I had heard that Rosehips oil was effective in rejuvenating the skin deep down into the dermis layers of the skin so that&#x27;s why I bought one.&lt;br /&gt;A Botox remedy at this price??? Now, this is what I call a product with a huge value! I&#x27;m prepared to test the waters and see how this goes. So far, with only after a week of using Purador&#x27;s Rosehips oil, my skin feels softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I also learned Purador&#x27;s Rosehips is cold pressed and based on what I read in a beauty blog, Rosehips that are cold pressed are a lot better because it won&#x27;t clog up my pores. I&#x27;m a 41 year old pharmacist and most of the time I have the night shift, so I need a beauty product to rejuvenate my skin after work.&lt;br /&gt;I have an oily face but surprisingly after applying Rosehips oil on my face, my face was smoother and all the oil on my face disappears! Now my colleagues at work are wondering what I have been doing to my face because it&#x27;s looking fabulous! Great job Rosehips!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel as smooth as silk.  Hydrated.  Very pleased with the results.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. So gentle with my essential oils for my face.</li>
    <li> I wanted a product while I was pregnant to prevent stretch marks.  I had to be sure it was a safe, organic one.  Pura d&#x27;or Rose Hip Seed Oil was just what I was looking for.  It is all organic and has no chemicals in it.  The ingredients are really good and when I put it on, my skin feels really smooth and soft.  I have had my baby now and you really can&#x27;t even tell I was ever pregnant.  That&#x27;s a big deal considering I had a 9 lb. baby boy!  I am pretty sure this would help diminish stretch marks too but thank goodness I didn&#x27;t get any, thanks to Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s great product.  I am one happy Mommy!</li>
    <li> I am a thirty-six year old male so when it was recommended that I use Rose Hip Oil on my face for acne scars, I wasn&#x27;t feeling it.  It just soundd sissy.  And what if I smelled like a bouquet of roses?  But the acne scars look really bad so I caved in and tried it.  I use it every night.  I figure at night, no one will smell it but it really does smell good.  Within a few weeks, it has made my face look tons better.  My scars are less noticeable for sure.  Kind of like this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have tried different skin care oils before. I&#x27;ve tried tea tree oil, argan oil, virgin coconut oil and other oils. However I haven&#x27;t tried Rosehip oil before but I have heard that it&#x27;s an excellent substance that helps the skin to rejuvenate all the way down to a cellular level.&lt;br /&gt;I heard it was also used by Egyptian royalty in the past since it contains Vitamin A, lots of Vitamin C and also has Omega 3 and Omega 6 essential fatty acids. Wow with all that benefits, I decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;My good friend Tracy was the first one who used this product and I saw how it made her skin looked fabulous that I chose to buy two bottles right away! I&#x27;m hoping it will give me the same beautiful results as Tracy did.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the bottle, I was surprised because it didn&#x27;t smell bad at all. The oil was non-greasy and it did not feel heavy on my skin.  I instantly felt a smoothness texture on my cheeks and I knew that I had made the right choice in buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have pigmentation problems on my face due to sun exposure. I&#x27;m 38 and I&#x27;m a cyclist, so you can imagine the ton of sun exposure I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;m now in my 3rd week of using this Rosehip Oil from Purador and I&#x27;m loving the results on my face. The best beauty oil ever!</li>
    <li> I just bought this product so I can&#x27;t tell yet if it will work but I have heard some pretty good reviews about it from my sister who&#x27;s been using it for a year now. She is 33 but her face always has a rosy pink glow. I guess that would be one of the amazing effects of Rosehips oil because it comes from the family of roses. I learned that the oil is extracted from the seed which by the way is filled with Vitamin C, Lycopene, Vitamin A and lots of Omega fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt;So with everything that I have learned about this beauty oil and seeing my sister&#x27;s beautiful glowing skin every time we meet at the gym, I think that it&#x27;s time for me to try this extraordinary oil myself and I bought two bottles because I&#x27;m afraid the price would go up in the near future. The price now is terrific, it&#x27;s a real saver!&lt;br /&gt;At 46 with five children, Botox and surgery are both not an option for me. I&#x27;m on a fixed budget and I earn extra money by doing errands for my neighbors every once in a while. I save up this money to buy myself beauty creams but all the good ones are really pricey.&lt;br /&gt;So when I found out about the magnificent benefits that Rosehips oil could have on the skin, I didn&#x27;t wait for another moment but I decided to buy a couple of bottles for myself. I&#x27;m quite positive that I will have rosy glowing skin in no time!</li>
    <li> I started using this no more than 2-3 times a week, but as soon as I saw the glow it gave me I upped it to 5 times a week.  I decided to mix this with the pure d&#x27; or organ oil ... it&#x27;s magical together.  I have to say, I am super surprised that this actually is better than the lancome genifique serum, I am a devoted fan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face and i didn&#x27;t know that it can also be used on nails. my nails are brittle, result of nail biting since I was a toddler and I cant grew my nails long,after 3 weeks of using this, my nails became thicker and harder. now I can even have nail arts. (i cant have them before, my nails are smidget size).</li>
    <li> I actually took this bottle from my girlfriends cabinet. She told me to try it since she used it on her legs and razor bumps when she shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied some onto my face and I will always apply it. I have always had razor bumps and minor scrapes when shaving so it&#x27;s nice to find something that helps to smooth bumps and soothe my skin.</li>
    <li> It absorbs nicely into the skin and is not oily at all. I use it on my face. It has added elasticity back into my skin and works wonders for under eye moisturizer.  The hubby doesn&#x27;t like the smell but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle about a week ago and this was the first time I have tried Rose Hip Oil.  Mixed my essential oils with this to produce a facial serum.  I is wonderful!  The oil just sinks right into my skin and leaves me soft and radiant.  Will continue to use this product with my EO.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this to make quality skincare products, which get rave reviews. It&#x27;s lovely for stretch marks, age spots, and sensitive skin.  Love!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil!  The medicine I take for my auto-immune conditions leaves me with breakouts and scarring, making me look older than I am.  I have used the rosehip seed oil for a month and a half now, and not only has it helped diminish my scars, it&#x27;s also helped clear up my breakouts.  It can be a little oily, but I mix it in with my face cream and that solves that issue.  I also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  All I can say is &#x27;Wow&#x27;-- what a difference it has made!  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the Pur d&#x27;or Vitamin C Serum and its only ramped up the effects of that serum.  First time using any oil in my skin care regimen. No clogged pores.  The oil has helped unclogged pores and get rid of acne scars.  Although they say don&#x27;t put oil under your eyes, I have been and puffiness under my eyes has diminished.  Will continue to use both since they seem to be working better than anything else I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a little over a month now, twice a day. I put a pea sized amount in my face moisturizer in the morning and then the same amount by itself in the evening. I think it&#x27;s helped with the oiliness I usually suffer, although you have to let it &amp;quot;set&amp;quot; for a few minutes before putting on makeup or going to bed so it doesn&#x27;t smear or get on fabrics. When I got a few scratches that scarred a bit I put some directly on them and they healed nicely with no lasting scars. They weren&#x27;t very bad, though, so it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. I&#x27;ve also seen the dry patches on my face clear up a bit. I don&#x27;t notice the smell after I put it on, and it&#x27;s not very strong right out of the bottle either. I&#x27;m going to experiment with putting some in my conditioner and seeing if my extremely curly hair takes to that.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I use it day and night - love how it doesn&#x27;t make me feel greedy and can put make up on top.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve seen great results in a short period of time.  Skin is clearer and I look better without make up.  Rated 4 stars because the pump shoots out fast and too much product gets wasted.</li>
    <li> makes my skin soft, not greasy, no break outs on my sensitive skin.  seems to be working</li>
    <li> As an eco-conscious person, I am impressed that this product is eco friendly too.  It is a good and effective remedy for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> My sister has a degree in Nature Science.  She uses this for aging skin.  When I noticed some crow&#x27;s feet and wrinkles, I asked where she got it.  When I looked it up and went to order, I was taken aback by the price.  I felt it was too expensive.  Then my sister told me what each of the ingredients in it does.  Rose Hip Seed Oil has antioxidants so it actually repairs wrinkles.  Moringa Seed Extract Oil helpsto  erase wrinkles too and revives the skin.  Aloe Vera is a skin conditioner and moisturizer.  The list went on and on.  She explained why it is important for an oil to be cold pressed too.  I guess I only thought it was expensive because I didn&#x27;t realize the value of all the ingredients that are in it and...the value of not having harmful chemicals in it like most others do.  I bought it and love it.  I would pay even more if I had to.</li>
    <li> Although only used for a few days, I can say it feels very nice when applied.  Little or no scent or odor.  Not sticky, quick absorbing.  I am using it to hopefully reduce a scar left on my leg from an internal bruise,  many years ago.  Nice container, easy dispensing</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT. For effectiveness this product earns 5 stars in my book. (For aroma it earns maybe 1-2 stars, it has a mild but definite earthy odor.) I&#x27;m a 28 year old female and I&#x27;ve been battling with frequent facial blemishes since I don&#x27;t know when. I&#x27;ve been using the rose hip seed oil twice a day for a week now and am extremely happy with my results so far. My face is perfectly moisturized and there&#x27;s been dramatic healing of old and new blemishes. When I started using the product I had 22 blemishes (red spots, pimples, and old acne marks) now there are only three that are still obvious. I plan on continuing to use this oil.</li>
    <li> The chemicals in skin care items will floor you if you read the labels.  I do and when I read the label on this Rose Hip Seed Oil, I knew I must try it.  It is excellent and all is done without using a chemical preservative.  They use an organic source.  My product  is still fresh so it works well.</li>
    <li> When you are knowledgeable about vitamins, minerals, herbs and essential oils as I am, you appreciate the quality of the ingredients this product contains.  I know quite a bit and was amazed that this contained some things such as Graperfruit Seed Extract and Nettles.  It takes a lot of research to know what some of these rare remedies do and that was the way I knew that they had a great product.  It is every bit as good as they say and I know my facial products so I do know!</li>
    <li> This product absorbs into my skin within a few seconds of me putting it on. I have only been using this product for a couple of days, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is smoother. One of my friends suggested this product to me, and I&#x27;ve noticed that her skin is very radiant, and it helps the tan that she&#x27;s gotten come out more.&lt;br /&gt;This product has helped the color in her face pop out more, and gives her face pretty accents. Such a great product, I love it.</li>
    <li> I am a very busy middle-aged woman.  I travel for a living and do not have time nor the space to carry a bunch of facial products with me.  I needed a skin care solution for my aging skin that was an all-in-one, or close to it.  I read all the wonderful things said about this product and what all it had (and didn&#x27;t have) in it.  It certainly suits my purpose and is very gentle and effective on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have a deficiency of essential fatty acids and get quilted looking patches on my skin, mostly on  my face.  I am always trying whatever I can in order to fix it.  I have tried things for about 4 years now and finally found something that works.  It&#x27;s Rose Hip Seed Oil.  It looks so much better now and feels better too.  I keep a good stock of it.  Don&#x27;t want to run out of this!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this product. I bought some rosehip oil locally months ago and fell in love with it. I did some online research and chose to purchase Pura d&#x27;or USDA Pure &amp; Organic Rosehip Seed Oil. I use it nightly and wake up to soft hydrated skin. This is a great price for the quality of this oil. This oil is soothing and a little goes a long way. The other brand I tried has a light rose sent. This received four stars because I find the smell is less than pleasant, almost a slightly rancid smell. I wish I could find a way to mask it. If this had a pleasant smell, I would give it five stars. Ultimately I am glad that I tried it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! The company puts so much care into this product, it&#x27;s high quality, great packaging and quick shipping. They even put the bottle in a small burlap sack for extra protection from the light. I can tell the difference in my skin and so can others, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair which sometimes irritates my face and it&#x27;s a huge reason why I have pimples. When I learned about Rosehips oil being an alternative skin care remedy, I was excited and I immediately bought a couple of bottles, one for myself and the other one for my sister who has acne.  She was skeptic at first but after using the oil for about a week, she was raving about it like a lunatic! lol, so I read more about the product description and found out that it was also good for my hair as well. Now, I&#x27;m still using Rosehips oil and so far I love the results on my face and on my hair! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell. It&#x27;s not unpleasant though but it doesn&#x27;t smell good either. I guess because it&#x27;s a plant oil that it smells like medicine but that&#x27;s the ony downside. Other than that, I&#x27;m a happy and satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s natural. It was neatly packed and when I applied the oil, it wasn&#x27;t too oily and it didn&#x27;t smell bad. The oil was absorbed in a few minutes and I usually put it on my face at night after brushing my teeth because it takes time for me to inspect my skin. Aside from this product, I use an aloe vera gel that my mom gave me and I use that during the daytime. I use Rosehips oil at night. So far, the results are good. My skin is amazingly soft in the morning!  I plan to use Rosehips oil everyday as part of my daily skin regimen because it really makes my skin soft, plus I&#x27;m not allergic to it, so that&#x27;s a great thing.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 1 week. So far so good. I like the consistency of this product.</li>
