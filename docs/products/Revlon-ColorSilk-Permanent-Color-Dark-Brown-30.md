      <li>Why is this on lists that great hair coloring?  </li>
      <li>Very nice color coverage ....</li>
      <li>I always use this brand of hair dye because it is cheap and it makes my hair feel great!</li>
      <li>Using the ButterCream version now - it&#x27;s even better, the conditioner is like liquid gold - and the smell is fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>I love Revlon ColorSilk!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t ever seem to find it in the stores anymore... must be popular.</li>
      <li>It could just be myhair texture though, it looked nice before it faded.</li>
      <li>More good news:</li>
      <li>They also tend to fade very easily.  </li>
      <li>and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>and the color looked great right off the bat</li>
      <li>thankfully Revlon have a great product at a very affordable price.</li>
      <li>I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to continue to keep up with salon prices, so I began to hunt for an at-home solution.  </li>
      <li>I plan to order some more soon.</li>
      <li>Love this hair color.</li>
      <li>Cheap and convenient, the way I like it!</li>
      <li>I have been dyeing my hair this color for about 3 or 4 months now and absolutely love the color.</li>
      <li>I love this color hair dye</li>
      <li>I love 30,</li>
      <li>and it is SO cheap!</li>
      <li>- there&#x27;s a lovely vibrancy and sheen.  </li>
      <li>I make sure that my hair has been thoroughly hydrated before I color</li>
      <li>and i love that.</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands of box color over the years, and this is one I would not recommend.</li>
      <li>loved it!&lt;br /&gt; fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for, fine.</li>
      <li>so I switched to Loreal Cleansing Conditioner, which is available at Wal-Mart for $6.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the convenience of getting it online.</li>
      <li>All with the same great color and coverage of the original!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I went to ColorSilk in college because it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>Its quick and easy any one can do it</li>
      <li>I bought this one because it was super cheap.</li>
      <li>The only good thing is that it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>I then used Revlon colorsilk light ash brown because my hair was super porous.</li>
      <li>As with all of drugstore brands, this product dries my hair out regardless of supposedly being more gentle.  </li>
      <li>Colors quickly and evenly, true to box color</li>
      <li>Shipped quick, packed in a box that protected the dye well.</li>
      <li>The best products that I&#x27;ve found that actually reverse the dryness are the Wen products, especially the 6-13 product.  </li>
      <li>I let the color fade on its own and go back to my original color.</li>
      <li>this hair color &#x27;Dark Brown&#x27; was a great color; however, I prefer Revlon Colorsilk Buttercream in Medium Brown.  </li>
      <li>then cheap means absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no salon product, but for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>returning isn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>
      <li>I always color my hair on my own and only color it</li>
      <li>It takes a lot longer than most other dyes (25 minutes vs 10 minutes for many dyes).</li>
      <li>Most of the dyes I&#x27;ve used last 4 weeks easily and many last 6 weeks.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>Two weeks ago, I shelled out the money at another salon where they did a fairly good job of getting me to dark brown...</li>
      <li>, conditioner is awesome (I use just a little after my color so I can use it as a leave-in until the next coloring).</li>
      <li>kit is very basic and easy to use, I recommend using different gloves though, these are extremely cheap and bust easily.</li>
      <li>Came on time and is not expensive</li>
      <li>This is a pretty brown.</li>
      <li>Cheap as hell and stays in longer than most other brands I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>Now, I can happily rid myself of the gray for a very small fraction of the cost of a salon visit.  </li>
      <li>Also read a product comparison in a beauty magazine who voted Revlon Colorsilk as the best at home hair color for lasting color with least damage.  </li>
      <li>I used color oops which took all the color out but left my hair brassy looking and kind of natural light red.</li>
      <li>I use it as an intense conditioner right after coloring and it reverses the dryness from the color and leaves my hair silky soft right from the start.  </li>
      <li>My hair grows very quickly, so since my hairline was already very white, I figured I&#x27;d just give this Revlon a go since the reviews were so go.  </li>
      <li>I really wish I didn&#x27;t have to dye my hair but vanity</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair really&lt;br /&gt;soft and smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have about 3/4 gray and the Buttercream version lasts much longer and leaves my hair feeling healthier.</li>
      <li>The shipping and handling no so much.</li>
      <li>Since I started using colorsilk, I only dye it when the roots grow out significantly</li>
      <li>I only wish there were a few more color options available.  </li>
      <li>I do a full color, even if it&#x27;s still in the same color family (like brown but not the brown</li>
      <li>On me it&#x27;s more a black brown</li>
      <li>This brand is so economical and it totally covers the gray hair and leaves your hair shinny and very manageable.  </li>
      <li>and I have experimented with very light to very dark shades.</li>
      <li>I normally use)...</li>
      <li>Any time I have to change the color or brand (if they are out of the one I normally use</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even tried other ammonia free products and none work quite like this.</li>
      <li>...now I&#x27;m coloring every 3 weeks to cover the new gray.</li>
      <li>or I want to try a new color.  </li>
      <li>The only downfall is the color fades fast considering I wash my hair every day, the gloves are also huge and barely stay on and the conditioner is in a packet instead of a tube which would be easier if you would want to use it the next day.</li>
      <li>I decided to to try this color as it was significantly cheaper than every other brand at my drug store.</li>
      <li>I will not go back to shampoo again and use the whole line form Loreal for all my styling products now!</li>
      <li>First time: I had red highlights from over the summer that were growing out</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve found that it has the longest lasting coverage with the least damage and the most realistic colors!!</li>
      <li>a side note: I was able to cut down on the damage by following my Hairstylists advice and only coloring my roots for the first three colorings and then my whole hair on the fourth coloring.</li>
      <li>it makes your hair soft it</li>
      <li>It really gets the white hair away</li>
      <li>but the color has almost completely faded.</li>
      <li>I tried to correct this myself with a semi-perm color by Ash Brown Natural Instinct, which improved the sitch a bit.  </li>
      <li>I have medium ash brown hair naturally</li>
      <li>I am using a shampoo and conditioner for color-treated hair, I do NOT blow dry my hair and I am not in the sun very much.</li>
      <li>To my surprise, it left my hair in much better condition than the other products and the color lasted essentially indefinitely.  </li>
      <li>and my hair was back to normal!</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s worth for me because i can&#x27;t go to other stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to home hair color, having recently returned to hair dying after trying my natural salt/pepper for nearly a decade.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t ordered from this seller before, but I just wanted to comment on this brand of color.  I have been home dying for years and have tried almost every brand out there and this is by far the best.  It is the only color that completely gets rid of my grays.  Seriously, they are no where to be found.  Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I first bought it because it was one of the only cruelty-free hair dyes at the drugstore, but Revlon has recently started animal testing products in order to get into the Chinese market, where animal testing is required.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> thia product es just excellent for me. It works great in my hair. It really gets the white hair away (i&#x27;m 60).&lt;br /&gt;It takes 25 minutes (maybe a little long compared with others that just take 10) but it lasts 3 or 4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I;ve been buying this product already for 4 years and i&#x27;ll keep getting it.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell at all and the conditioner that comes with it is just great. Leaves your hair really&lt;br /&gt;soft and smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it 100%.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great. The shipping and handling no so much. A little expensive, because if you&lt;br /&gt;buy it in other stores, you will spend a little less. But it&#x27;s worth for me because i can&#x27;t go to other stores.</li>
    <li> I love Revlon ColorSilk! I am 25 and have been dying my hair since I was in 3rd grade (crazy right?).  I have always used boxed color and I have been through every brand and product type on the shelves...even the most expensive.  I went to ColorSilk in college because it was so cheap. To my surprise, it left my hair in much better condition than the other products and the color lasted essentially indefinitely.  I have medium ash brown hair naturally and I have experimented with very light to very dark shades. I used to have to dye my hair every 6 weeks because the color would fade. Since I started using colorsilk, I only dye it when the roots grow out significantly or I want to try a new color.  I only wish there were a few more color options available.  I&#x27;ve even tried other ammonia free products and none work quite like this.</li>
    <li> I love this color hair dye it makes your hair soft it ,s a beautiful color I plan to order some more soon.</li>
    <li> I always color my hair on my own and only color it every 6 months or so just to shake things up. I let the color fade on its own and go back to my original color. Most of the dyes I&#x27;ve used last 4 weeks easily and many last 6 weeks. I bought this one because it was super cheap. It takes a lot longer than most other dyes (25 minutes vs 10 minutes for many dyes). I colored my hair on March 6th and here it is March 20th and the color looked great right off the bat but the color has almost completely faded. I am using a shampoo and conditioner for color-treated hair, I do NOT blow dry my hair and I am not in the sun very much. I am disappointed with how quickly this faded and I think next time I&#x27;ll just buy for quality vs price.</li>
    <li> The color is a soft Black at first, after 2 washes it looks like the box. It did not leave my hair in better conditions, now after I shampoo my hair it feels dry and crunchy, I am forced to use masks instead of regular conditioner. I&#x27;m gonna have a cauterization treatment to see if my hair reco vers...</li>
    <li> It says tgat its drak brown but when you dye it it looks black and i love that. Its quick and easy any one can do it</li>
    <li> My hair was ombre with dark brown on top and dark blonde on the bottom, however I had quite a few grays coming in. I wanted to even out the hair color so I opted for a deep rich shiny dark brown which is what I hoped this would be. No such luck, I ended up with dull flat black hair with ends that had a greenish tint... My grays weren&#x27;t colored and I had to wait a few washes to see any brown. I didn&#x27;t mind the ends because after all they were ombre but I can&#x27;t forgive the no gray coverage, the dullness and not to mention dryness. Probably worst hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve had my hair every color you can think of.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cover my coppery red. And didn&#x27;t look dark brown at all!</li>
    <li> I decided to to try this color as it was significantly cheaper than every other brand at my drug store. I have tried many brands of box color over the years, and this is one I would not recommend. This color made my scalp burn (a problem I never have while coloring), and the color is VERY flat. Definitely not the &amp;#34;3D Color Technology&amp;#34; as stated on the box. My hair also feels very dry the following day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been colouring my hair now for several years due to those pesky greys popping up.  I initially tried Loreal but the tints were all too red.  I then came across Revlon and haven&#x27;t looked back.  I was using Colour 33 (Soft Dark Brown) but have now switched to 30 (Dark Brown) which, as others have noted, is very dark.  On me it&#x27;s more a black brown but I notice that it softens after a few washes and it&#x27;s not a deadpan colour at all - there&#x27;s a lovely vibrancy and sheen.  I really wish I didn&#x27;t have to dye my hair but vanity I&#x27;m afraid wins and thankfully Revlon have a great product at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> I am now beginning to get gray hairs in this covers it beautifully. Such a natural looking hair color. I do my roots once a month and all over color twice a year. Works like a charm! Cheap and convenient, the way I like it!</li>
    <li> Love this hair color. I can&#x27;t ever seem to find it in the stores anymore... must be popular. I totally recommend it! doesn&#x27;t fade or wash out.</li>
    <li> Came on time and is not expensive</li>
    <li> This brand is so economical and it totally covers the gray hair and leaves your hair shinny and very manageable.  It&#x27;s the best hair color brand for us gals that prefer to &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; and save lots of $$$ by not having to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that color in reality.</li>
    <li> Very nice color coverage ....</li>
    <li> This is my product of choice. The color does not fade to red. I enjoy the convenience of getting it online.</li>
    <li> I always use this brand of hair dye because it is cheap and it makes my hair feel great! I have never had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> loved it!&lt;br /&gt; fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Cheap as hell and stays in longer than most other brands I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Shipped quick, packed in a box that protected the dye well. Unfortunately, tge colour did not last too long for me. Faded within a week. It could just be myhair texture though, it looked nice before it faded.</li>
    <li> It was a good product now I think it stinks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to home hair color, having recently returned to hair dying after trying my natural salt/pepper for nearly a decade.  I was a salon-color girl prior to that, but these tough times just make spending $$$ month on hair dye out of the question.  About six weeks ago I had my virgin hair dyed at a low-cost, walk-in hair salon because I was too afraid to color my hair myself.  I asked for dark brown and left way too red/brassy ( ! ).  I tried to correct this myself with a semi-perm color by Ash Brown Natural Instinct, which improved the sitch a bit.  Two weeks ago, I shelled out the money at another salon where they did a fairly good job of getting me to dark brown...but still there was an undertone of brassy red.      I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to continue to keep up with salon prices, so I began to hunt for an at-home solution.  My hair grows very quickly, so since my hairline was already very white, I figured I&#x27;d just give this Revlon a go since the reviews were so go.  This $5.00 box has saved me.  My hair is finally dark brown, exactly matching the model&#x27;s color on the box.  I expect the color to fade, as I&#x27;ve read that even permanent color does fade, but at least I know that I have found a brand/color that works.  More good news: with all this coloring that my poor strands have been through in the past several weeks, Revlon did not fry my hair - amazing.    Note to those wanting to remain in the brown family - this is truly a very dark brown, approaching black, which is what I wanted.  If you&#x27;re searching for a chocolate brown, this may be too dark for your taste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the brands in the drugstore, but all them leave my hair really, really dry and feeling as if I&#x27;ve stripped it with bleach (have done this before, so I know dry and damage when I feel it).  They also tend to fade very easily.  Of all of the drugstore brands, this one works best for me.  I have to cover a great deal of gray and the dark brown does the job whereas the lighter colors don&#x27;t seem to work as well.  However, the dark brown color is dark - and it doesn&#x27;t fade.  As with all of drugstore brands, this product dries my hair out regardless of supposedly being more gentle.  Since I can no longer afford salon color, I&#x27;ve found ways to help improve my experience.  I make sure that my hair has been thoroughly hydrated before I color and I use an intense moisture product for a few days afterwards.  The conditioner that is included in the box does nothing for me.  I&#x27;ve used very cheap conditioners and very expensive salon conditioners without much luck.  The best products that I&#x27;ve found that actually reverse the dryness are the Wen products, especially the 6-13 product.  I use it as an intense conditioner right after coloring and it reverses the dryness from the color and leaves my hair silky soft right from the start.  I also use Pureology shampoo because it does not fade the color.  Now, I can happily rid myself of the gray for a very small fraction of the cost of a salon visit.  I give this 4 stars because of the gray coverage, the cost, and because it doesn&#x27;t fade.  It&#x27;s no salon product, but for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I saw warning hidden in back of instructions only after applying. maybe because it dyes skin extremely well... returning isn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>
    <li> I have been dyeing my hair this color for about 3 or 4 months now and absolutely love the color. My hair is naturally a dirty blonde but I was sick of the color and wanted to make it look a more rich-brown. This color definitely does it for me. The only downfall is the color fades fast considering I wash my hair every day, the gloves are also huge and barely stay on and the conditioner is in a packet instead of a tube which would be easier if you would want to use it the next day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times, and will continue to do so. I love 30, the dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has only worked on my hair if I go darker then what my shade is at the time. If you are trying to go even 1 level lighter, I would recommend you prelighten your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has stayed shiny for a long time after using. The shine may start to dull after a couple months, then I recommend Garnier Fructis shine gloss spray, definitely don&#x27;t overuse it though, I only spray it once about 10 inches from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is very basic and easy to use, I recommend using different gloves though, these are extremely cheap and bust easily.</li>
    <li> Revlon colorsilk has saved me twice! First time: I had red highlights from over the summer that were growing out so I used Garnier nutrisse dark brown to dye my hair all back to normal. It turned black with purple and red lowlights. It was bad. I used color oops which took all the color out but left my hair brassy looking and kind of natural light red. I then used Revlon colorsilk light ash brown because my hair was super porous. I left it on for 7 minutes and then washed out and my hair was back to normal! 3 months later, the color has faded and I have dark brown roots again with reddish brown hair. I bought this dark brown and put it on for 6 minutes, rinsed out, and my hair is back the identical color of my roots with no red or purple undertones. I am so happy with it and it is SO cheap!</li>
    <li> I like Revlon Colorsilk hair color and this hair color &#x27;Dark Brown&#x27; was a great color; however, I prefer Revlon Colorsilk Buttercream in Medium Brown.  I bought both Dark and Medium Brown.  I have about 3/4 gray and the Buttercream version lasts much longer and leaves my hair feeling healthier.</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s my review on Revlon Colorsilk: Wow, by far the worst hair color I have ever used! I have been coloring my hair 10+ years now and this was horrible. Why is this on lists that great hair coloring?  The only good thing is that it&#x27;s cheap but if it doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job then cheap means absolutely nothing. The hair dye only colored my new hair growth but did NOT cover the white hairs!  It also did nothing in terms to coloring over another shade that I had dyed my hair previously. Perhaps that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for, fine. But it should at LEAST color my whites, right? Nope.  Not one that but now my hair feels like HAY. I always wondered why people complained that dying their hair damages it etc because oddly enough, my hair would feel SO smooth afterward. Not so with this dye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not deliver.</li>
    <li> I was trying to avoid the reddish brown colors that I have always had. This is a pretty brown. I have received compliments in this color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for the last 20+ years. Unfortunately, my hair grays come back fast and I find that I have to color twice as often as everyone else...now I&#x27;m coloring every 3 weeks to cover the new gray. I used to use Black, as I&#x27;ve gotten a little older I now use Darkest Brown (30). Revlon has become my number one color!! Not only is it under $5 but I&#x27;ve found that it has the longest lasting coverage with the least damage and the most realistic colors!! Colors quickly and evenly, true to box color, conditioner is awesome (I use just a little after my color so I can use it as a leave-in until the next coloring). Also read a product comparison in a beauty magazine who voted Revlon Colorsilk as the best at home hair color for lasting color with least damage.  Using the ButterCream version now - it&#x27;s even better, the conditioner is like liquid gold - and the smell is fantastic!!! All with the same great color and coverage of the original!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note: I was able to cut down on the damage by following my Hairstylists advice and only coloring my roots for the first three colorings and then my whole hair on the fourth coloring. The box says to comb it through the last 10 min, but since I use the same color each time I don&#x27;t have to and it&#x27;s really cut down on the dry damage that use to be a problem for me...I have very thick, course, frizzy/curly hair and this new technique has helped. Any time I have to change the color or brand (if they are out of the one I normally use and I have to color because of an event or something) I do a full color, even if it&#x27;s still in the same color family (like brown but not the brown I normally use)...also, I started using WEN about a year ago and have not used shampoo since...even the hairstylist I saw the other day raved about how my hair felt. I used the WEN for two bottles but the expense was ridiculous so I switched to Loreal Cleansing Conditioner, which is available at Wal-Mart for $6. I use it just like theWEN (same as you would shampoo) and let it sit for several minutes before rinsing....AMAZING!!! I still get frizz in the humidity but my hair is soft, I have less breakage, and my color lasts longer!! I will not go back to shampoo again and use the whole line form Loreal for all my styling products now!</li>
