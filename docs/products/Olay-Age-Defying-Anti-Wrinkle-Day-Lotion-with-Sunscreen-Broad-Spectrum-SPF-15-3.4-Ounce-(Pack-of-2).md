      <li>Absolutely love this.  </li>

      <li>If they do have it, they are charging up to $4.00 more than what the purchase price is on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Olay products but this stuff is greasy and clogged my pores.</li>
      <li>Easy transaction also</li>
      <li>I began using this product about 2 years ago when i started to notice fine lines.  </li>
      <li>At first I loved how much thicker this Oil of Olay moisturizer is than my regular moisutizer, and I loved how my skin felt, I even liked the smell.  </li>

      <li>Folks, this is an excellent light moisturizer for both men and women - but the seller is frequently offering bottles which expire in one year or less from the sale date.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and for some reason it is becoming scarce in my local stores.  </li>
      <li>I have used Olay Complete Age Defying, Anti-Wrinkle Lotion for many years.  </li>
      <li>I personally think there are better products out there for anti aging, and there are better Olay products in general as well.</li>

      <li>but I find it harder to find on the shelves and glad it was here.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to</li>
      <li>That being said it may work more for other skin types.</li>
      <li>ingredients were slightly different from what I originally had making me think it was a knock off.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I only gave this a star because this version looked so much like the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I looked at my face in a very strong magnifying mirror, and I had little tiny blisters in the red splotches.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the smell either compared to their classic beauty fluid and other creams.</li>
      <li>Take a trip to your local drugstore, and you will clearly see these expire</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I decided to give this product a try when I ran out of my regular moisurizer, Mary Kay.  At first I loved how much thicker this Oil of Olay moisturizer is than my regular moisutizer, and I loved how my skin felt, I even liked the smell.  Day two, I had very high hopes that I could make this product my everyday moisturizer.  Day three, my face started to feel itchy. My chin, forehead, and checks had red splotches on them. That night, before I went to bed, I washed my face.  My face burned like crazy. I looked at my face in a very strong magnifying mirror, and I had little tiny blisters in the red splotches. I had more than 50 tiny puss filled blisters per red splotch.  They were so tiny, without the magnifying mirror they just looked like a rash. If I put my finger nail next to a blister, it popped.  I will not be using this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it came quickly.  Not sure about the reduction of wrinkles, but is a really good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 and have been using this moisturizer since college, at the advice of my grandmother and mother.  It&#x27;s a great consistency, it dries appropriately, and has the perfect amount of desired SPF (15) for me.  The price is right for me as well - I don&#x27;t believe that a similar moisturizer that is $100 works any better.  I can&#x27;t really speak to it&#x27;s long-term benefits but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay Complete Age Defying, Anti-Wrinkle Lotion for many years.  I love this product and for some reason it is becoming scarce in my local stores.  If they do have it, they are charging up to $4.00 more than what the purchase price is on Amazon.com.  I am 62 years old and have very few wrinkles.  I owe that, in my opinion, to this lotion that I use faithfully every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Olay products but this stuff is greasy and clogged my pores. Not crazy about the smell either compared to their classic beauty fluid and other creams. I have combination skin. That being said it may work more for other skin types. I personally think there are better products out there for anti aging, and there are better Olay products in general as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few months after hopping from brand to brand. I have really oily skin, so it&#x27;s hard to find a lotion that moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t leave me shiny all day.  This fits the bill and I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Thought it was great . ingredients were slightly different from what I originally had making me think it was a knock off.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years and find that it works great. The spf 15 is more than enough for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I have used this face cream for many years, I really like the effects and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the daily regenerating serum every morning and it keeps me well hydrated the entire day.  I&#x27;m keen on SPF and have found other face lotions to sting or have a sunblock smell.  This does neither!</li>
    <li> I began using this product about 2 years ago when i started to notice fine lines.  I continue to use it (some days in conjunction with the overnight cream) and it does its job well.  Easy transaction also</li>
    <li> I only gave this a star because this version looked so much like the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use oil of olay; however, this one I purchased via Amazon was a total disaster.  I moisturized my face one morning &amp; by the time I got to work I had raised bright red blotches all over my face &amp; a co-worker telling me how swollen my face was.  I had to wash the entire product off my face &amp; take medication to subdue the flare up.  I&#x27;d hate to see anyone else suffer the same fate; therefore, please be advised.</li>
    <li> 55 year old male here and have been using Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle for years and only have 3 slight lines across forehead, no lines anywhere else!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Folks, this is an excellent light moisturizer for both men and women - but the seller is frequently offering bottles which expire in one year or less from the sale date.  Take a trip to your local drugstore, and you will clearly see these expire at least several years out from the present date.  The seller has an obligation to offer merchandise with the same freshness/time to expire as what is currently sitting on the drugstore shelf.  And for cosmetics with an active sunscreen these dates do matter.</li>
    <li> I have used several products that I have fine lines on the face and this is definitely the best. I have used it for 5 days and the face is stretched and wrinkles are minimal. I love it.</li>
    <li> This product works great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this.  Have been using it for years but I find it harder to find on the shelves and glad it was here.</li>
    <li> love oil of olay products</li>
    <li> Does give skin a move refined look, but find the cream a bit heavy.</li>
