### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>A great buy!</li>
      <li>I loved the colors of this pallette!!</li>
      <li>This is the best eyeshadow product, but you can find it at the drugstore for $5.</li>
      <li>The wear is excellent on the colors as well -- I&#x27;ve had no issues with fading or creasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perfect for all eye colors</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful and pigmented.</li>
      <li>They are all beautifully creamy and pigmented.</li>
      <li>This set is about $5 in drug stores, but even for $10 it is a really great deal.</li>
      <li>The colors look great going by the directions on the color (brow, lid, crease and definer).</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>This is creamy and has great staying power and pigmentation.  </li>
      <li>Not all that great.  </li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s not quite what I was expecting, it&#x27;s still a nice set at a very nice price!</li>
      <li>Very nice palette and colors</li>
      <li>The pigment is very nice.</li>
      <li>What amazing prices!</li>
      <li>I am loving this palette!  </li>
      <li>I have all of the Color Icon eyeshadow sets and they are all gorgeous.</li>
      <li>while it didn&#x27;t work as gorgeous as when I first put it on, I must say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
      <li>Love all these palettes!</li>
      <li>It is so extremely beautiful and unique that pictures cant capture it.</li>
      <li>The darker shades work amazingly well as liners when applied with an angled brush.</li>
      <li>but its an amazing duochrome color that looks amazing on any skin tone.</li>
      <li>If you know how to use these palettes they are amazing</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re kind of patchy &amp; chunky...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest,  </li>
      <li>A nice, inexpensive palate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Plus the handy labels show you how to coordinate the shades on your eye to hep them work together.</li>
      <li>Nice variety in color&lt;</li>
      <li>Nice variety of colors for day and evening...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>The best shade in this palette is the bottom right Definer shade -- it&#x27;s a gorgeous deep teal duochrome on the eye (although it doesn&#x27;t look that impressive in product photographs!).</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this item!</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
      <li>another thing I love about it is that it has like a day color and a night color</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Also love the ferrite collection eye shadow primer which is comparable to Too Faced Shadow Assurance at an 1/8 of the price.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>This one looks brown, but has an awesome blue iridescence whey you put it on.</li>
      <li>One of the best low priced palettes out there!</li>
      <li>Brown side top to bottom:</li>
      <li>I used brow-bone colours with any regularity I&#x27;d be able to comment on the two in this palette.  </li>
      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay more.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeshadow pallete</li>
      <li>, I reach for this and my Sephora brand palettes the most.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>/&gt;That paired with perfect pigmentation, buttery application and low cost</li>
      <li>Has some striking colours.</li>
      <li>I bought this from RiteAid and have been using this for more than 6 months now.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>you can pick up an eight color eye shadow palette, bronzer, foundation, gel eyeliner and many mire products for under $3.99/piece.</li>
      <li>very good deal with seller and super fast delivery!  </li>
      <li>finely milled, nice to build up &amp; easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The colors are smooth, beautiful and highly pigmented.</li>
      <li>Best part is, you get eight eyeshadows... for a fraction of what you would pay for a single color at Sephora or department</li>
      <li>It is a very iridescent red/blue shade and surprisingly wearable!&lt;br</li>
      <li>the duo chrome lower  right definer shade, but all the shades are really nice in this palette.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered my second set of this eye shadow set, it&#x27;s SOOOO gorgeous!</li>
      <li>I took more time trying to clean up my area than I wanted to fool with.</li>
      <li>and I had heard that the bottom right hand corner one was a perfect match (it definitely is by the way</li>
      <li>colors are fantastic, very unique, and rich.</li>
      <li>but sometimes warm with the occasional cool thrown in for good measure),  which translates to &amp;</li>
      <li>Let me start off by saying that Wet-n-Wild has the best eyeshadows from the drugstore, hands down!</li>
      <li>But you can buy this cheaply at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>/&gt; If you&#x27;re looking for cheap, pigmented eyeshadow, this is it.</li>
      <li>The products are the cheapest available anywhere in the US....</li>
      <li>What I will say though is that the light sandy colour has virtually no pigment.  </li>
      <li>I do use the light beige color</li>
      <li>These colors are smooth and have a lot of intensity to them.</li>
      <li>This eyeshadow combination is perfect for everyday and going out too.</li>
      <li>I love the colors here, and I love that they have a light shimmer (e.g. not matte) so that even when I&#x27;m doing a very understated look (with the colors in the left-hand column)</li>
      <li>The quality is okay for really cheap makeup....not highly pigmented, somewhat chalky, somewhat dry, with exception of their eyeliner which is absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>Some of the shades are really sophisticated, like the bottom right color.</li>
      <li>My favorite shadow is the one in the bottom right compartment.</li>
      <li>Has some fallout, but that&#x27;s ok, with the right brush these blend like a dream.  </li>
      <li>I have never gotten better pigmentation out of a drugstore pressed shadow than with this one right here.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In terms of pigmentation, the right hand column is going to give you the most color pay off.</li>
      <li>The gray color in the top right corner was all busted up when it arrived.</li>
      <li>Secondly the product itself is fine, for the money these shadows are a good value, as well as being a good way for beginners to get into makeup and try different shades without spending hundreds of dollars on high end colors that might not look good with their skin tones.</li>
      <li>I love it very much.</li>
      <li>The pigments are flattering, rich and buildable.  </li>
      <li>The colors are incredibly pigmented -- and yes, that means the darker shades are DARK.</li>
      <li>Just now getting the hang of using these gorgeous palettes and I&#x27;m starting to really enjoy them.</li>
      <li>However it is a beautiful color and easy use in a different place on the lid.&lt;br /&gt;The powders are very soft, so DO NOT make the mistake of dropping the palette (like i accidentally did).&lt;br /&gt;Really,</li>
      <li>#34;This is going to look either absolutely gorgeous,  or frightful - there will be no middle man&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>This eyeshadow wears longer and looks better than products that cost 3x as much.</li>
      <li>Really I don&#x27;t know why people pay more for prestige brands of cosmetics.</li>
      <li>all that you need to take from this is that I loved this palette enough to repurchase it.</li>
      <li>I love this palatte and ended up buying more in different colors.</li>
      <li>Super blendable, smooth, and very very pigmented colors.</li>
      <li>i initially bought this palette for the gorgeous color in the bottom right corner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The two eyelid colours are very pretty</li>
      <li>most of the other colors are nice too.</li>
      <li>very pretty colors</li>
      <li>The packaging is really cheap though and the shadows themselves are very soft, so they are rather powdery and they can also break easily.</li>
      <li>Nail colors are offered in great selection of colors and finishes and are typical of varnish at any spectrum of polishes.</li>
      <li>If you are going to price gouge, at least package items more successfully.</li>
      <li>Where can I start this make-up palette is amazing hands down no complaints I love that the colors are very very pigmented</li>

    <li> What amazing prices! These are the newest trend in context and colors, words out ladies&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT BUY BOBBI BROWN and those extremely overpriced cosmetics. I&#x27;ve compared, and was stunned when w&amp;w wore longer looked fresher and I did not have to sell my ears to afford lol.&lt;br /&gt;Very very good deal with seller and super fast delivery!  Kudospropstos</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough great things about this little palette. It has at least 5 dupes for a number of high end shadows including UD Naked and Mac shadows. They are all beautifully creamy and pigmented. Plus the handy labels show you how to coordinate the shades on your eye to hep them work together. I recommend all WW products but this collection may be the closest they&#x27;ve come to proving there&#x27;s no excuse for buying a $45 shadow palette.</li>
    <li> i initially bought this palette for the gorgeous color in the bottom right corner. i&#x27;m OBSESSED. it&#x27;s a deep terracotta-brown with blue reflect in it. such a unique color. i want to buy a back-up palette so i never run out of it lol. most of the other colors are nice too. finely milled, nice to build up &amp; easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only two i&#x27;m not a huge fan of is the bottom left and the one above the terracotta/blue shade. they&#x27;re kind of patchy &amp; chunky... but alright for an accent color.</li>
    <li> Every shade is shimmery and it&#x27;s just too much. The gray color in the top right corner was all busted up when it arrived. I find a use for all the colors on the left side and overall, I like this pallet.</li>
    <li> I got this palette mainly for the duo chrome lower  right definer shade, but all the shades are really nice in this palette. I usually go with a one shadow look and this gives you lots of options. The darker shades work amazingly well as liners when applied with an angled brush. You definitely want an eye primer or cream base under these shadows as they can fade a little more than I would like but over all a really nice set of shadows at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Alright friends, let me tell you something about this little eye shadow palette here.I have never gotten better pigmentation out of a drugstore pressed shadow than with this one right here. I was very skeptical when purchasing this, but I was looking for a dupe for the Mac Blue/Brown pigment powder and I had heard that the bottom right hand corner one was a perfect match (it definitely is by the way, I would purchase an infinite amount of that eye shadow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of pigmentation, the right hand column is going to give you the most color pay off. Now, that isn&#x27;t to say that the left hand column is bad, but it does have the lighter shades that need just a little more help to show. The definer shade on the left hand side is showing brown in the picture, but it&#x27;s a much smokier almost black brown color in person. Actually, the picture doesn&#x27;t give any of the colors justice. They are so much lovelier in person and they stand out in the drugstore when compared to everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say much in terms of stand alone staying power because I always apply primer with my shadows. It&#x27;s just a given for me. So with that knowledge, these last all day with me and can withstand the Texas heat, so I think that says something.</li>
    <li> Horrible the make up was all broken and cracked and was all over everything</li>
    <li> Where can I start this make-up palette is amazing hands down no complaints I love that the colors are very very pigmented no fall out when I wear it all day long and it stay on all day another thing I love about it is that it has like a day color and a night color very pretty colors anyone can wear them and very affordable I bought my first comfort zone palette at Wal-Mart for like $4.00 I was amazed definitely recommend it I always get compliments on my eyeshadow and I only use this pallete.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow. The colors are close to the picture but the bottom two are tough to get a good picture of. They are both have a black base with a red shimmer (left) and green shimmer (right). The colors look great going by the directions on the color (brow, lid, crease and definer). I love this palatte and ended up buying more in different colors. The colors are vibrant but not too overpowering that it can&#x27;t be an every day look.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeshadow product, but you can find it at the drugstore for $5. I use this everyday, and it works best when used wet! BUY THIS! I love it.</li>
    <li> The green color actually has a bit of gold in it that makes it look very chic and comparable to something you might expect from a high end department store brand.  The pigments are flattering, rich and buildable.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The colors are really pretty and they are said to be dupes for MAC shadows. The packaging is really cheap though and the shadows themselves are very soft, so they are rather powdery and they can also break easily. But you can buy this cheaply at the drugstore. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This palette has &amp;#34;equivalents&amp;#34; to MAC eyeshadow:&lt;br /&gt;MAC Dazzlelight&lt;br /&gt;MAC All That Glitters&lt;br /&gt;MAC Bronze&lt;br /&gt;MAC Twinks&lt;br /&gt;MAC Vex&lt;br /&gt;MAC Juxt&lt;br /&gt;MAC Humid&lt;br /&gt;MAC Club&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That paired with perfect pigmentation, buttery application and low cost.... What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow pallete it is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I do want to say that it was over prized because at the store they are around 3.99 but at the end it was worth it because I use it almost everyday.</li>
    <li> I love the colors here, and I love that they have a light shimmer (e.g. not matte) so that even when I&#x27;m doing a very understated look (with the colors in the left-hand column) there&#x27;s still a very faint glow which really makes my eyes perk up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is that they don&#x27;t last for a full 18-hour day. Not sure why. For the record, I don&#x27;t use an eyeshadow primer, so if you do, your mileage with this shadow may vary.</li>
    <li> Basically one of the finest palettes I&#x27;ve ever seen from Wet n&#x27; Wild. The last color doesn&#x27;t look like much in the photo but its an amazing duochrome color that looks amazing on any skin tone. Would definitely buy just to own this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this from RiteAid and have been using this for more than 6 months now. About half my colors have fallen out, so I would not say this lasts very long. The packaging didn&#x27;t last that long either. Only tape is holding it together. The pigment is very nice. The darker colors are a bit harder to blend such as the brown or black eyeshadows. As for wear, that will depend on whether you use a primer or not. With primer, it definitely lasts longer. I would buy it again, but be very careful with packaging since it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> I loved the colors of this pallette!! I got it at the same time as Too faced Chocolate bar, and I prefer this one to that!!!</li>
    <li> Color are so nice very pigmented you can  make a lot of different looks with the shades look goods on any skin tone .</li>
    <li> I bought this months ago,  from the generic Drugstore Down The Street.  I&#x27;ll be honest,  I had some trepidation.  Traditionally I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;neutral but sometimes warm with the occasional cool thrown in for good measure),  which translates to &amp;#34;This is going to look either absolutely gorgeous,  or frightful - there will be no middle man&amp;#34;.  Still,  it was a freebie so I grabbed it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I used brow-bone colours with any regularity I&#x27;d be able to comment on the two in this palette.  What I will say though is that the light sandy colour has virtually no pigment.  At all.  Ever.  Even with primer.  The other shade is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two eyelid colours are very pretty (the photos don&#x27;t do it justice - these are really,  really pretty)  and you&#x27;ll be able to match them with virtually any other shade in your possession.  The crease shades take a bit more blending effort than I&#x27;d like,  and if you&#x27;re not careful they can end up patchy but other than that they do their job very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The definers do what they should do - define.  Now,  you want a steady hand because these suckers last a LONG time and it can be a bother trying to fix up mistakes without having to remove everything and start over again.  They&#x27;d also be better (for me, anyway)  if they were just a tad less shimmery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  I&#x27;d give this 3.5 out of 5...but Amazon won&#x27;t let me,  so I rounded up.  They do last a long time without gunking up your crease-line,  the pigmentation is nicely rich (perhaps surprisingly so and as long as you&#x27;re not paying UD prices this one might suit you and your pocket very well indeed.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow combination is perfect for everyday and going out too. Wet-n-Wlid did not disappoint! This eyeshadow wears longer and looks better than products that cost 3x as much. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do eyeshadow that much, but I got these to play with. I found that the pigmentation varied a lot--most of the colors were as expected or a little more subtle, but the &amp;#34;Definer&amp;#34; on the reddish side is DARK! It&#x27;s nice. On the green side, the colors aren&#x27;t as neutral as I&#x27;d hoped, but they&#x27;re not bad. But that Definer is not very dark. Even though it&#x27;s not quite what I was expecting, it&#x27;s still a nice set at a very nice price!</li>
    <li> I previously owned this palette, I bought it in stores when that was still possible, and I truly LOVED it!&lt;br /&gt;The colors are fantastic, very unique, and rich. My favorite shadow is the one in the bottom right compartment. It is so extremely beautiful and unique that pictures cant capture it. It is a very iridescent red/blue shade and surprisingly wearable!&lt;br /&gt;My only two complaints were that the lightest almost yellowy shade had some fallout, and the \\&quot;highlight\\&quot; for the green palette really isn&#x27;t bright or light enough to work well as a highlight. However it is a beautiful color and easy use in a different place on the lid.&lt;br /&gt;The powders are very soft, so DO NOT make the mistake of dropping the palette (like i accidentally did).&lt;br /&gt;Really, all that you need to take from this is that I loved this palette enough to repurchase it. A great buy!</li>
    <li> This is creamy and has great staying power and pigmentation.  There are lots of dupes including ones from the Naked pallet and MAC shadows!  I would recommend this to all makeup lovers!</li>
    <li> I am loving this palette!  Very pigmented.  Has some fallout, but that&#x27;s ok, with the right brush these blend like a dream.  The colors pop on my brown eyes!  I received on a Sunday, have been using everyday since ... great everyday palette.  I have several high end palettes, Naked 1, 2 and 3, Vice, etc., I reach for this and my Sephora brand palettes the most.</li>
    <li> Super blendable, smooth, and very very pigmented colors. I feel like I am using some plush expensive eyeshadow when I use these. The pick of colors work so well for different types of looks and even have a little stamp telling you how to apply it in a basic fashion if you are new to makeup. Only slight problem I had was that I threw them around a lot and the two bottom most colors cracked and broke (on different occasions). I repressed them each and have never had a problem since. Anyways...LOVE LOVE LOVE. Gonna go get the purple palette later on and few of the smaller ones as well.</li>
    <li> Save your money. This product was very poorly packaged and came with the first row of colors broken off. There was dust all over the place</li>
    <li> For a drugstore palette, this blows me away. The colors are incredibly pigmented -- and yes, that means the darker shades are DARK. The best shade in this palette is the bottom right Definer shade -- it&#x27;s a gorgeous deep teal duochrome on the eye (although it doesn&#x27;t look that impressive in product photographs!). The wear is excellent on the colors as well -- I&#x27;ve had no issues with fading or creasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is absolutely worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> A nice, inexpensive palate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;• Highly blendable color&lt;br /&gt;• Perfect for all eye colors&lt;br /&gt;• Nice variety in color&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Very powdery, if flipped upside down or shaken will create powder excess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a drugstore brand, Wet n Wild is one of my favorites. It’s one of the cheapest, yet high quality and extremely manageable. I repeatedly find myself in the makeup aisle at the grocery store eyeing their new palates. This was my most recent purchase of their brand and I love it. I have green eyes and these shades make my eyes especially pop. When paired with a primer underneath, these shadows last all day and look amazing and vibrant. These can be used on their own or blended in with other colors from other palates. I strongly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> All of the powders were crumbled and mixed together in the container. Unable to use the product.  I didn&#x27;t pay enough for the product to go to the trouble of returning it. It was a lesson learned. I will buy powder shadows at a store front instead of by mail in the future.</li>
    <li> Went all over my city one Friday night looking for this palette before I gave up and bought it here. All of the shades are amazing and buttery, but the star of the show is the bottom left shade imprinted with &amp;#34;define.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s a duochrome reddish brown/blueish green and its absolutely stunning and unique when applied. Well worth the hunt.</li>
    <li> Very nice palette and colors</li>
    <li> Surprisingly intense for the price. Has some striking colours.</li>
    <li> Eye shadow color is very beautifu l, very color .Eye makeup is very persistent .So I love it very much.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of colors for day and evening...Fun to play around with because of the many different colors and looks you could get from the one small pkg.</li>
    <li> Last all day, blends well - get tons of compliments!!! Love all these palettes! If you know how to use these palettes they are amazing - I don&#x27;t have fallout or issues. If you do use your finger not a brush. Hopefully this helps!</li>
    <li> The bottom right color arrive and all busted up.  Was in the middle of the Fluted Cake Pan and I don&#x27;t even have that color now.</li>
    <li> One of the best low priced palettes out there! I even bought a back up! The colors are smooth, beautiful and highly pigmented.</li>
    <li> Not all that great.  It has a shinning appearance to the colors.  They are very deep colors.  Not my favorite.  I do use the light beige color and then us a different brand to go along with it.</li>
    <li> Just now getting the hang of using these gorgeous palettes and I&#x27;m starting to really enjoy them. Don&#x27;t forget to prime your eye lids before you start using this so your eye shadow stays on longer. I love these. I put this on my eyes yesterday and went out to a hot and humid afternoon of running errands, then a long yoga session - not too sweaty but enough to mess up any make-up and then a walk in the humid night and while it didn&#x27;t work as gorgeous as when I first put it on, I must say I&#x27;m impressed. High-quality eye shadow. Love the Wet n Wild brand :)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered my second set of this eye shadow set, it&#x27;s SOOOO gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that Wet-n-Wild has the best eyeshadows from the drugstore, hands down! This Comfort Zone palette is no exception. The colors are beautiful and pigmented. The color you see is the color you get. All of the shades have been duped to MAC eyeshadows. Brown side top to bottom: Dazzlelight, Texture, Woodwinked and Twinks. Green Side top to bottom: Retrospeck, Sumptuous Olive, Green Smoke and Club. If you&#x27;ve been wanting to try any of these MAC shades, give the Wet-n-Wild palette a try. It&#x27;s less than $5 at the drugstore. And if you like the palette, I&#x27;ve got 8 amazing shadows less than the cost of one MAC eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Some of these shadows may have a little fall out, so be sure you tap your brush off before you apply. (:</li>
    <li> I had actually seen this palette in a tutorial on youtube so I went out right then and bought it. The colors were actually too dark, so beware if you have lighter hair and eyes. I guess if you used the lightest colors on the palette it would work well. I was going for the smokey eye look and the darker colors were TOO DARK, and very messy and hard to blend. I took more time trying to clean up my area than I wanted to fool with. Definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> Wet &amp; Wild is the perfect &amp;#34;starter makeup&amp;#34; for teens and young women in the initial stage of cosmetic experimentation. The products are the cheapest available anywhere in the US....you can pick up an eight color eye shadow palette, bronzer, foundation, gel eyeliner and many mire products for under $3.99/piece. Lipstick is almost always $1-2 as is eyeliner. The quality is okay for really cheap makeup....not highly pigmented, somewhat chalky, somewhat dry, with exception of their eyeliner which is absolutely perfect. Also love the ferrite collection eye shadow primer which is comparable to Too Faced Shadow Assurance at an 1/8 of the price. Nail colors are offered in great selection of colors and finishes and are typical of varnish at any spectrum of polishes. Overall,  W&amp;W offers great products, despite their general limitations (poor color payoff, less than great texture, poor staying power, etc) for ant girl not wanting to make a major investment or just starting out with cosmetics.</li>
    <li> First of all, this is $5 at Walgreens/CVS, which is pretty ridiculous compared to the $13 from this seller. Secondly the product itself is fine, for the money these shadows are a good value, as well as being a good way for beginners to get into makeup and try different shades without spending hundreds of dollars on high end colors that might not look good with their skin tones. Lastly this seller is really abysmal. Almost 3x price hike in addition to one of my colors broken and smearing all over the rest? Unacceptable. If you are going to price gouge, at least package items more successfully. Huge thumbs down.</li>
    <li> Wet N Wild is one of the cheapest drugstore makeup brands on the market, yet they are one of my favorites. Their eyeshadows are always CRAZY pigmented (I have never seen such pigmented black eyeshadows from the drugstore!)and super soft without being powdery. These shades are no exception. I have all of the Color Icon eyeshadow sets and they are all gorgeous. Funnily, I bought this set around the same time Urban Decay came out with their Oz Palettes (both of which I have) this reminds me of the Theodora palette - but far cheaper!&lt;br /&gt; If you&#x27;re looking for cheap, pigmented eyeshadow, this is it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s color is so beauitful</li>
    <li> Oh my... how I hate this palette!  I read such rave reviews so I had to go out and find it.  I give it two stars for being very pigmented, but the colors are just a bit off (in my opinion).  Beware of the darker colors... a little goes a long, long way and doesn&#x27;t come off easily.  I&#x27;ve tried this palette over and over again and I&#x27;m giving up.  Glad I didn&#x27;t pay more.</li>
    <li> This set is about $5 in drug stores, but even for $10 it is a really great deal. These colors are smooth and have a lot of intensity to them. Some of the shades are really sophisticated, like the bottom right color. This one looks brown, but has an awesome blue iridescence whey you put it on. Best part is, you get eight eyeshadows... for a fraction of what you would pay for a single color at Sephora or department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad... Wet n Wild powder shadows and blushes break easily. I would NOT plan on carrying this around in your purse, or traveling with it a lot. You may find yourself cleaning up a broken mess. In the past I&#x27;ve had whole pans of eyeshadow just separate and fall out. So leave it on your counter. This comes with ONE crappy applicator/brush... so you will either need to use your fingers or have a spare brush. If you&#x27;re not careful when applying this, it can leave a dusting under your eyes. I apply it with fingers and don&#x27;t have this flyaway problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use the $1 primer from ELF... and this combination keeps my eyeshadow set for 18 hours. Really I don&#x27;t know why people pay more for prestige brands of cosmetics.</li>
