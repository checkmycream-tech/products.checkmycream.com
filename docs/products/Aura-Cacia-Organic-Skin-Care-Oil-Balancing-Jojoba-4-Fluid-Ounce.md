      <li>The essential oil is awesome for all my hair and skin needs.</li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t care for the non spill top because it took a lot of squeeze to get oil out</li>

      <li>good to use, I wash my face with it in the evening, right after I&#x27;ve used Sibu Beauty Cleansing Face and Body Bar Sea Buckthorn, 3.5 Ounce .</li>
      <li>/&gt;And now that my face is fine the bottle says to use it for a sensual massage :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll try that out</li>
      <li>Really excellent for people with eczema and chronic dry skin!</li>
      <li>It doesnt break me out which is most important thing.</li>
      <li>I use it for baby massage and it absorbs easily into the skin.  </li>
      <li>Will be ordering more very soon!!</li>
      <li>the force is too powerful and sprays more than I need at one given time.</li>
      <li>I was worried it would clog my pores, but this oil is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>My acne face is smooth and I can let my prescription do its job without worrying about it drying me out.</li>
      <li>Aura Cacia is usually a good company for natural products.</li>
      <li>First I will say, I love the properties of Jojoba oil.  </li>
      <li>I also use it as a carrier oil for essential oils and it works really nicely!</li>
      <li>Makes my skin look really nice and clear.</li>
      <li>It does such a good job at hydrating my skin and soaks right in.</li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s almost normal :).</li>
      <li>I use this oil as a facial moisturizer and absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also in my second week of using this oil for the oil cleansing method and it&#x27;s going great so far!</li>
      <li>The cap was literally unscrewed a turn or two and about an inch worth of oil</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s natural and organic, and it works better than the medicated stuff my doctor prescribed for me.</li>
      <li>I have purchased several oils from this company and I feel they have the best pricing compared to other places.</li>
      <li>Very well packaged, natural, potent and worth every cent.  </li>
      <li>and I really think this is true</li>
      <li>You could try and remove the rubber/silicone, but I would imagine the opening would be too large and way too much oil would come out since this is about the consistency of lightly warmed cooking</li>
      <li>than that i like it very much, using it in the shower amplifies the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has really done the trick!</li>
      <li>This really does the trick on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it oily after washing it out!</li>
      <li>This is my first time trying jojoba oil.</li>
      <li>First, it arrived in an Amazon box saturated with oil - yep</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks, and my skin is only becoming clearer (I use it after I wash my face with Manuka honey).</li>
      <li>It is a good value for the price and will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>It really has no scent</li>
      <li>I switched it for another bottle and am much happier.</li>
      <li>sometimes too much comes out</li>
      <li>The bottle dispenses too much product.  </li>
      <li>Feels really nourishing</li>
      <li>Their quality control is a standard I feel comfortable with.</li>
      <li>so by the end of the day my skin is very shiny.</li>
      <li>, let you know how that goes haha</li>
      <li>I personally really like it.</li>
      <li>You have to really squeeze to dispense and then you get too much.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>A while ago, I read an article that said jojoba oil is the oil most similar to skins natural oil, sebum.</li>
      <li>I use just a few drops on my face right before I go to bed three times a week, and my face is much softer and remains acne free!  </li>
      <li>I also buy the USDA organic argon oil for my mom and it&#x27;s way cheaper than most places and other places</li>
      <li>I have used other brands however, including Trader Joes, that were better quality.  </li>
      <li>Did some research on preshave products because my face was becoming irritated after shaving (it has always been sensitive and because of that I only shave 2-3 times per week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This particular brand had a wierd odor.  </li>
      <li>But my main issue is with the bottle delivery system itself.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend these for those into alternative medicines/healing/wellness.  </li>
      <li>My face is so soft!!</li>
      <li>I suggest it to anyone acne conscious who wants to avoid the saturated market of chemical alternatives.</li>
      <li>I plan on keeping this in my regimen all year round :).</li>
      <li>If you have super dry skin I would recommend this product for you.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like to complain about a product from a brand that I like, but this one just has several issues, unrelated really...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a marked decrease in oil production on my face!</li>
      <li>I use it for my skin when it is dry feeling and right after every shower.</li>
      <li>I used it and Gentle Baby essential oil blend (Young Living) during my pregnancy</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t effect my sensitive nose.</li>
      <li>(I always shave after showering and with Edge Sensitive Skin shaving gel and my Gillette Fusion razor).</li>
      <li>Always leaves me feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>(Male, 21) I have very sensative skin</li>
      <li>I chose this oil because I read it is the closest to the skin&#x27;s natural sebum</li>
      <li>Leaving it on thick helps more but looks greasy haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
      <li>It has a kind of valve that requires you to squeeze the bottle hard enough to overcome the resistance of the valve so that finally a big squirt of oil shoots out into your hand.</li>
      <li>Its natural, relatively grease free if you use a moderate amount of it, and extremely moisterizing.  </li>
      <li>It is hard to get a drop or two out because you need to squeeze with a reasonable amount of force and almost always end up with about 5-10 drops worth of oil on your hand.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very well packaged, natural, potent and worth every cent.  Highly recommend these for those into alternative medicines/healing/wellness.  Aura Cacia makes a great product.  Their quality control is a standard I feel comfortable with.</li>
    <li> Really excellent for people with eczema and chronic dry skin!</li>
    <li> I use prescription-strength cleansers to keep my acne in check, but the result was dry, itchy skin that was really sensitive in the winter.  My esthetician recommended jojoba oil to keep my face moisturized.  I was worried it would clog my pores, but this oil is fantastic.  I use just a few drops on my face right before I go to bed three times a week, and my face is much softer and remains acne free!  I also use a few drops on my hair at the ends, and wrap it up for a quick moisture boost.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like to complain about a product from a brand that I like, but this one just has several issues, unrelated really... First, it arrived in an Amazon box saturated with oil - yep, it was from my jojoba oil. The cap was literally unscrewed a turn or two and about an inch worth of oil had leaked past the seal. A one-off event, likely... But my main issue is with the bottle delivery system itself. It has a kind of valve that requires you to squeeze the bottle hard enough to overcome the resistance of the valve so that finally a big squirt of oil shoots out into your hand. Not possible to get just a few drops from this squirt system. It makes one feel they are being forced to use it up faster than they might otherwise... I&#x27;ve never used jojoba oil before, so I can&#x27;t comment on the product itself.</li>
    <li> Good oil, bad dispenser. You have to really squeeze to dispense and then you get too much. Pump top would be much better to control amount dispensed.</li>
    <li> Jojoba oil is one of my favorite oils. I use it as a base for aromatherapy oils - since it&#x27;s supposed to be the closest to our natural skin oils and is less likely to stain clothing. I also use a little bit in my hair and it&#x27;s made a huge difference in the texture of my dry, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I love this Jojoba Oil! It is so good for you hair and body. Always leaves me feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I use this oil as a facial moisturizer and absolutely love it! I just wait a few minutes before applying foundation. It&#x27;s made a great difference in my complexion, and even softens my breakouts - but never gives me breakouts. I also use it as a carrier oil for essential oils and it works really nicely! :) I used it and Gentle Baby essential oil blend (Young Living) during my pregnancy and I do not have any stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This is my go to oil! I use it for my skin when it is dry feeling and right after every shower. I use it in my scalp for dermatitis before I shampoo and also in the ends of my hair as a conditioner since I have a lot of allergies and can&#x27;t use a regular conditioner. This really does the trick on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it oily after washing it out! I also use it for massages and even for pedicures and manicures! It really has no scent so it doesn&#x27;t effect my sensitive nose. The bottle is sort of hard to use because you really have to squeeze to get the oil out and sometimes too much comes out but once you&#x27;ve gotten use to how to use it you get the hang of it. I cannot use any other kinds of oils and this has been s life saver for me!</li>
    <li> The essential oil is awesome for all my hair and skin needs. As well as the best for me considering its organic BUT the packaging sucks...the force is too powerful and sprays more than I need at one given time. Other than that A ++++</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Aura Cacia is usually a good company for natural products. My only minor flaw? The way it comes out. I&#x27;m use to &#x27;drip&#x27; bottles when it comes to oils. For this bottle, you have to squeeze it for the oil to come out... and it STREAMS out!!!! More than once I &#x27;overshot&#x27; my hand and ended up with a stream of oil on my rug. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the oil itself works great!!</li>
    <li> If you have super dry skin I would recommend this product for you.  It definitely hydrated the dry spots on my face, but it left my face looking very oily after it was on for a few hours.</li>
    <li> (Male, 21) I have very sensative skin and before I changed face washes my skin would get very dry and cracked, to the point where moisturizers burned on contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a perfect alternative and helps the skin heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to get a small amount out, you need the bottle tilted up and then be gentle, a bunch comes out at once, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use it looks like you have oil on your face (because you do).  But you should just leave it and rub it in when you anticipate going in public.  Leaving it on thick helps more but looks greasy haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that i like it very much, using it in the shower amplifies the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now that my face is fine the bottle says to use it for a sensual massage :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll try that out, let you know how that goes haha</li>
    <li> A very nice product.  I use it for baby massage and it absorbs easily into the skin.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is magical, I love it</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this oil for years. I use it as make-up remover, moisturizer, body oil, hair mask - it&#x27;s good for all your needs. I personally really like it. My fave brand of jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> I have acne-prone skin so was worried about using this. But I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks, and my skin is only becoming clearer (I use it after I wash my face with Manuka honey).</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have noted, the top on this bottle is annoying. It cannot dispense a small amount. I switched it for another bottle and am much happier. The oil itself is 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have been using this jojoba oil for over a year and I love it! A while ago, I read an article that said jojoba oil is the oil most similar to skins natural oil, sebum. I have very dry skin (especially during a MN winter), and as a result my skin over produces oil to compensate, so by the end of the day my skin is very shiny. When I use jojoba oil, my skin looks fantastic! No flakes and no shine.</li>
    <li> This is so good for your skin.  It only takes a little bit and so the bottle lasts forever. It gives you a natural glow much different than the lotion creams I used to apply.</li>
    <li> This product is nice and moisturizing for my skin and helps to control oil.  It is a good value for the price and will last a long time.  I rated it down because of the packaging.  The bottle dispenses too much product.  I wish you could get it to give you less oil, but even with the lightest squeeze of the bottle, it dispenses a lot.  I would also prefer a glass bottle to plastic.</li>
    <li> good to use, I wash my face with it in the evening, right after I&#x27;ve used Sibu Beauty Cleansing Face and Body Bar Sea Buckthorn, 3.5 Ounce .</li>
    <li> Nice oil, light fragrance</li>
    <li> I love the oil but messy to get out, not easy to get just a bit. you have to squeeze pretty hard to get the oil out of the opening and that can be touchy. That&#x27;s why only the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> For 4 years I have been using this oil, never any lotion! No wrinkles around eyes! People dont believe that I am 57 :)))</li>
    <li> I love Jojoba oil! I have had a bottle of it from &amp;#34;The Vitamin Shoppe&amp;#34; for about 6 months and used it off and on but I started using Retin-A this winter and my face started getting dry. To combat the dryness I&#x27;ve been adding Jojoba oil to my daily moisturizer in addition to the Rosehip oil I already used for the last 6-8 weeks. This has really done the trick! I&#x27;ve noticed a marked decrease in oil production on my face! I had oily, slightly acneic skin but now I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s almost normal :). I chose this oil because I read it is the closest to the skin&#x27;s natural sebum and I really think this is true considering how well my skin has adjusted to it. My oil production decreased with the use of Rosehip oil but that hardly compares to how much it decreased with the Jojoba! It does such a good job at hydrating my skin and soaks right in. I plan on keeping this in my regimen all year round :). I didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects such as pimples or clogged pores with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also in my second week of using this oil for the oil cleansing method and it&#x27;s going great so far! I use 1 part castor oil, 3 parts grapeseed oil, 1 part jojoba oil, and a few drops of lavender oil.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying jojoba oil. Every moisturizer I&#x27;ve bought in the past has either suffocated my face because its too thick or caused break outs because its too thin, seeping into my pores and sitting there. I use this after I cleanse and tone or after I get out of the shower. Its a wonderful product and organic certified. I suggest it to anyone acne conscious who wants to avoid the saturated market of chemical alternatives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin forever it seems and every acne prescription has dried out my skin severely. So I started applying this mixed in with my lotion and it was a night and day difference. My acne face is smooth and I can let my prescription do its job without worrying about it drying me out.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived having leaked all on the inside of the box, resulting in loss of a lot of the product.</li>
    <li> Did some research on preshave products because my face was becoming irritated after shaving (it has always been sensitive and because of that I only shave 2-3 times per week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly Jojoba oil is an excellent product for skin care and I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied to my face after showering and before applying shaving cream (I always shave after showering and with Edge Sensitive Skin shaving gel and my Gillette Fusion razor). This time the razor just glided over my skin and did not tug on the hair. I would estimate that the irritation was reduced by about 60-70%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last few nights, I washed my face and applied the oil before bed. My skin has already become noticeably smoother and the product has not caused me to breakout...actually it may have helped clear up a few very small pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product is organic and there is no reason to purchase the non-organic oil because there is only about a $0.41/oz difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer commented on the cap which has a sort of rubber/silicone valve. It is hard to get a drop or two out because you need to squeeze with a reasonable amount of force and almost always end up with about 5-10 drops worth of oil on your hand. You could try and remove the rubber/silicone, but I would imagine the opening would be too large and way too much oil would come out since this is about the consistency of lightly warmed cooking oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product and I can recommend it to anyone looking for a preshave or general skin care product (also try Vitamin E oil for general skin care...I use Nature&#x27;s Bounty &amp; Burt&#x27;s Bees brand).</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff! Makes my skin look really nice and clear.</li>
    <li> Sooo soothing.  Feels really nourishing and my skin drinks it in.  Love it.</li>
    <li> First I will say, I love the properties of Jojoba oil.  Its natural, relatively grease free if you use a moderate amount of it, and extremely moisterizing.  I have used other brands however, including Trader Joes, that were better quality.  This particular brand had a wierd odor.  I can&#x27;t pinpoint it, but it almost smelled rancid or like it went bad.  I also didn&#x27;t care for the non spill top because it took a lot of squeeze to get oil out and when it came out, it came out with extreme force and kinda went all over the place.  I think I am going to stick with Trader Joe&#x27;s brand of this, its not as expensive, you get more, and doesn&#x27;t have the wierd smell.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and had been a great product in some homemade cosmetics.</li>
    <li> while the oil is good quality I hate the way it comes out. one tiny little squirt and waaaaaaay to much comes out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand at my local farmers market, and it has essentially no smell. I&#x27;m not sure what happened with the other reviewers&#x27; oil.</li>
    <li> I only buy the USDA organic oils and this is the best. I have purchased several oils from this company and I feel they have the best pricing compared to other places. I also buy the USDA organic argon oil for my mom and it&#x27;s way cheaper than most places and other places aren&#x27;t even USDA organic. I want to know what I am putting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is a great multi tasker. It doesnt break me out which is most important thing. I use it as facial moisterizer and I use a tiny amount as a hair serum. I used to buy Biosilk for my hair but for $30 a bottle, this works just as well. I have purchased two or three times. I think a bottle lasts me about 4 months but I use it day and night for my face and skin. If you break out and can&#x27;t tolerate most moisterizer I suggest this without hesitation:)</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Will be ordering more very soon!! My face is so soft!!</li>
    <li> When winter time comes around I get really bad dry skin on my face. Using this Jojoba Oil a few times each week has left my face feeling and looking smooth and without redness. Plus it&#x27;s natural and organic, and it works better than the medicated stuff my doctor prescribed for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after purchasing the same item at a local store. It was a bit cheaper to order on Amazon so I did. However, when it arrived it had a really strange smell, like bacon or hotdogs. The bottle I purchased from the local store did not have this smell at all. Seems like okay quality, but going back to the store to purchase, don&#x27;t think I like smelling like bacon all day :-(</li>
