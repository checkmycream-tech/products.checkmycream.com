      <li>Very glad we purchased it.</li>
      <li>Excellent product... works exactly as it was advertised.  </li>
      <li>So glad that I invested in this!</li>
      <li>And great to diminish those fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>This thing is really amazing.  </li>
      <li>Feels nice.</li>
      <li>This is specifically just for acne even the cystic kind.  </li>
      <li>Mega-doses, although effective temporarily at killing acne all over the body, lead to long-term irreversible hair loss from many anecdotal reports I&#x27;ve read.</li>
      <li>Top heavy(this unit tips over very easily</li>
      <li>I got great results after the first treatment - meaning a signficant reduction in the size &amp; quantity of bumps.  </li>
      <li>However I do believe what made the most difference for me was three fold  1.</li>
      <li>works great and really helped my skin</li>
      <li>She felt like it helped her sleep better at night.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With this Caribbean Sun unit, I have experienced the same great results as when I go to the dermatologists office for red/blue light treatments.  </li>
      <li>The tiny lines on my face have diminished, but best of all, I feel like my skin glows!</li>
      <li>so I can cover more area at a time.</li>
      <li>But this device works much better.</li>
      <li>She uses it for 10 minutes daily and has had wonderful results.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many things to help with Rosacea</li>
      <li>love mine</li>
      <li>When I saw the price for the at home models, I was even more hooked.</li>
      <li>been to dermatoligist many times and nothing worked.  </li>
      <li>,so glad I ran across the youtube.</li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
      <li>just make sure if you have pustules</li>
      <li>By the way in researching all this I figured out that Rosacea can be caused by Demodex Mites (which you cannot see and most everyone has</li>
      <li>On top of that, the size of my pimple after 15 minutes of use shrinks noticeably.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>very relaxing, and nice for face!</li>
      <li>After a full week of use, her skin cleared up almost completely, and people began commenting that her skin &amp;#34;glowed.&amp;#34; My daughter is very fair and this lamp took a lot of the redness and splotchiness out of her skin.</li>
      <li>Oh,and sure and wear the goggles to protect the eyes,they are included in the box with the light.</li>
      <li>Bottom line is I&#x27;m willing to invest 10 minutes a day 5-6 times a week for acne/cystic free skin!!</li>
      <li>That being said, the panel gets pretty warm after 30 minutes</li>
      <li>Hands down, this is the BEST invention ever made for acne.  </li>
      <li>It makes a huge difference to your self esteem.</li>
      <li>However, the red light is great for a glowing complexion - just use during the day.</li>
      <li>I found out by using a light therapy your supposed to feel warmth.</li>
      <li>I know it works because I have used light therapy before.  </li>
      <li>My initial thought was great product for the price, instead of paying $75 per treatment at a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>I thought it was the perfect way to really see what the red LED light could do</li>
      <li>and my acne is now severe where as it was not before  the light.</li>
      <li>The light therapy is not a miracle worker, but enhances your skin care routine.</li>
      <li>I use proactiv, and added the light in as part of my night time routine after I wash my face.</li>
      <li>can select which light to use depending on your needs.</li>
      <li>, I have read that the light at that close range can harm your eyes.</li>
      <li>Works great for my teen son.</li>
      <li>We had tried just about everything for our teenagers acne and this light did the trick.  </li>
      <li>And, then when I saw that the blue light helps curb acne, naturally, I just had to try this on my daughter (the perfect justification for buying this home beauty product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has helped clear up my skin, i used to use the illumask but wanted to use something with more led bulbs for better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As I stated in my original review it arrived damaged(tilt feature).I wanted to add to my review now that I used it the full 3 months</li>
      <li>Given that most of the research by Dr. Burke seemed to be done in the infrared range of 830 nM, I wonder how much faster it would have healed if she had used that wavelength.    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is placebo effect, or just having those minutes to myself with a good book, but I feel a lift in my mood in the hours following a session.</li>
      <li>I think this is the key to regaining a good complexion ...</li>
      <li>I figured the very bright red light might be covering up the blue light.</li>
      <li>I started looking into the use of light therapy more and discovered that the red LED wavelength actually does much more than just make your skin look better.  </li>
      <li>However in trying all these different things I have stumbled upon the cure for Rosacea for me and miraculously have no redness or pustules ... perfect complexion which is a first for several years.  </li>
      <li>Red LED light is better absorbed by deoxy hemoglobin and Near Infrared light is better absorbed by hemogloblin.</li>
      <li>The blue lights are great for helping to heal break-outs and the red lights work to help even skin tone and diminish the appearance of fine lines, over time.</li>
      <li>This light really works well for clearning up acne.  </li>
      <li>And I also feel better,perky,after I do my light treatment, I saw on the net that most people have a mood lift after using the LED lights,.</li>
      <li>after freshly cleaned skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so you should use the blue light to make sure you kill the bacteria too.       </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any blemishes on my face right now for the first time in almost a year!</li>
      <li>With the right diet and this product you will be amazed by the results.</li>
      <li>The research is really amazing at what RED and NEAR INFRARED light can do.    </li>
      <li>It is kind of heavy to hold onto and the red light is super bright, but I&#x27;ve been using the blue light everyday and my skin is clearing up.:)</li>
      <li>This is a huge step towards clear skin but it should be relied on for everything.</li>
      <li>Remember, you HAVE TO be willing to use it as directed.  </li>
      <li>First and foremost, the unit you will receive is NOT the image shown in the photo on this product page.  </li>
      <li>If you use it consistantly it really does help!</li>
      <li>The once every two weeks treatments gave me enough results to want more.</li>
      <li>I only use the blue light because I use before going to bed, and the red light is so bright</li>
      <li>These basic problems would bother me more had i paid full price for a new one like most people, but nevertheless i have read others have had these same issues</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m 59 I decided since it&#x27;s doing such a good job on my face with the red light for fine lines and smoother skin,use it on the other body parts too.</li>
      <li>Before we purchased this product, we were using a handheld light that you held right up to your face and moved it around to cover your entire face.</li>
      <li>I can use full strength Apple Cider vinegar now and only have mild sting on eyelashes</li>
      <li>I think it is good for the face but not sure it had a real effect on my rosacea.  </li>
      <li>The package, and my research, states that there is a certain wavelength that triggers a reaction that kills acne bacteria.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was introduced to light therapy by an esthetician who started adding ten minutes of it to the end of my facials. The once every two weeks treatments gave me enough results to want more. When I saw the price for the at home models, I was even more hooked. And, then when I saw that the blue light helps curb acne, naturally, I just had to try this on my daughter (the perfect justification for buying this home beauty product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 14 year-old daughter is prone to getting lots of pimples on her forehead. After three days of using this for ten minutes a day, her skin started clearing up. After a full week of use, her skin cleared up almost completely, and people began commenting that her skin &amp;#34;glowed.&amp;#34; My daughter is very fair and this lamp took a lot of the redness and splotchiness out of her skin. Furthermore, the lamp seemed to give her an emotional lift. Very subtle, but enough to make her &amp;#34;want&amp;#34; to sit in front of it each day. She felt like it helped her sleep better at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for me. I am 55 years-old with dry skin that is beginning to sag. This lamp reduced my slight jowls to almost nothing, and seems to have helped my chicken neck be less noticeable. The tiny lines on my face have diminished, but best of all, I feel like my skin glows! I try to use it every day for at least 10 minutes, sometimes 20. I usually listen to an audible book while I am sitting in front of it, so I don&#x27;t feel like I am wasting my time. I don&#x27;t know if it is placebo effect, or just having those minutes to myself with a good book, but I feel a lift in my mood in the hours following a session. It&#x27;s like having a spa experience at home.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when I pulled this lamp from the box and realized it was made of steel. In the photo online it looks like it is made of plastic. The lamp is very sturdy but small enough to move around, easily. You can adjust the angle of the lights up or down, to get the coverage you need. When lit, the light covers your entire face (and a little bit of neck, too), and you can turn on both the blue and red lights at the same time, making the total time shorter in front of it. One caveat about it&#x27;s use, I have read that the light at that close range can harm your eyes. Not sure if this is true, but make sure you wear the goggles that come with it.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very little documentation. No timer. The edge of the goggles makes small, temporary creases around the eyes. The panels can&#x27;t be removed for use on other parts of the body.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, the unit you will receive is NOT the image shown in the photo on this product page.  They are blatantly false advertising and I wish Amazon would force them to upload an accurate picture of the unit people actually get, which is HALF the size, barely covers your whole face and does NOT include a stand.  You have to hold it in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, does the product even work?  NO.  I have no used it for about a full month, every day without missing a single day and I can confidently say that my face looks no better than it did when I started.  In fact, it actually looks slightly worse and that is because the skin on my entire face is inflamed and red from usage of this product.  I didn&#x27;t even have moderate acne to begin with.  I had mild, but with all of this inflammation that&#x27;s been added to the picture, my skin does look like I have moderate acne now.  Thanks a ton, Carribean Sun for ripping me off with false advertising and messing my face up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $225 for this as it was on sale and I can only imagine how much more angry I would be if I had paid $275 as it&#x27;s listed for right now.  The only thing that can quench my anger at being ripped off like this is if I can convince even just ONE person to spend their money elsewhere.  I honestly think the majority of these reviews are either paid or entirely false altogether.  This was the most expensive gizmo that I have ever wasted money on.  Please learn from my mistake and I won&#x27;t feel like my money was spent in vain.</li>
    <li> Me and my husband are using this product. The blue lights are great for helping to heal break-outs and the red lights work to help even skin tone and diminish the appearance of fine lines, over time. We have been using it for about a month. Before we purchased this product, we were using a handheld light that you held right up to your face and moved it around to cover your entire face. It worked well, but we like this sun box because you can just sit and relax. It also has the option to use the red and blue lights at the same time. The light therapy is not a miracle worker, but enhances your skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Did not help with acne at all.  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> works great and really helped my skin</li>
    <li> Amazing!  After only 1 week of use, my teen&#x27;s acne is nearly gone, and it was the deep, red and inflamed type!  My other teen has scars from picking at skin and the scars are actually fading.  All they do is use it for 10 minutes per day as directed.  So glad that I invested in this!</li>
    <li> I am 42 and suffer with hormonal acne.  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything under the sun, but nothing ever completely cured my cystic hormonal acne.  Purchased this lamp 3 months ago and used it everyday for weeks, but wanted to wait to post a review to see what type of results I was going to get.  Hands down, this is the BEST invention ever made for acne.  Remember, you HAVE TO be willing to use it as directed.  Meaning, it says to use for 10 minutes a day for a certain amount of time.  If you want to see lasting results, you HAVE TO do what the manufacturer says and use it every single day.  I read a review that says it made acne worse?  Nope, not possible.  Use it every day, like the instructions say, and it will work.  For me, as an adult acne sufferer, I discovered that I can get away with using it 5-6 times a week.  Because I noticed that when I slack off, my acne comes back.  Bottom line is I&#x27;m willing to invest 10 minutes a day 5-6 times a week for acne/cystic free skin!!</li>
    <li> Feels nice. Seems to help.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these used on ebay for only $150. My initial thought was great product for the price, instead of paying $75 per treatment at a dermatologist. This has helped clear up my skin, i used to use the illumask but wanted to use something with more led bulbs for better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works well, has options to turn on 415nm blue light and 660nm red lights separately or together, built with metal instead of plastic so it lasts long and is strong, the sheets of glass over the led bulbs are uv filtering to no worry about damaging your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Top heavy(this unit tips over very easily, i have actually had it tilt and hit me in the nose a few times and have to store it propped up against something so it doesnt tip and shatter the glass) and the tilt of the led panel does not hold true(if i angle it upward for my face, within 4 minutes it has tilted back to vertical)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If you can get pass the frustration of stabilizing the stand and holding the tilt to your preference, its actually a good product. These basic problems would bother me more had i paid full price for a new one like most people, but nevertheless i have read others have had these same issues so i cant assume it from receiving a used product. I use this with both lights for 30 minute intervals 3-4 times a week. I wasnt getting as good results with the recommended 10 minute sessions. That being said, the panel gets pretty warm after 30 minutes so i would not recommend going longer than that for risk of damaging it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this light therapy device. I previously had a bulb with the red and blue light therapy that screws into a lamp. But this device works much better. It definitely keeps my face clear.  The device is very good quality. It is heavy and made of metal.</li>
    <li> I just received this earlier in the week and have now used it 4 times with both the blue &amp; red light together.  With this Caribbean Sun unit, I have experienced the same great results as when I go to the dermatologists office for red/blue light treatments.  I have roseacea and when it flares, I get red bumps rising all over my cheeks, chin, nose and between my eyebrows.  During a recent flare up, I went to see my derm and he had me sit under the blue light and also added a separate red light machine.  I got great results after the first treatment - meaning a signficant reduction in the size &amp; quantity of bumps.  After 3 sessions at the derm&#x27;s office, it was nearly clear, but it cost me $375.  My skin started flaring up again late last week and not wanting to plunk down $125 per session at the derm&#x27;s office, I decided to give this a try.  After 3 sessions with this unit, my skin has calmed &amp; cleared..after the 4th session today, I don&#x27;t even need to wear concealer and my skin has no visible bumps.  At the derms office, they position the blue &amp; red light extremely close to my face (almost touching), so I have done the same with the Caribbean Sun unit.  I&#x27;ve set a timer for 11 minutes each time.  I do wish the panels were slightly taller and that there was a height adjustment on the unit, but for the price it&#x27;s solidly built and it actually works.</li>
    <li> Love,love this machine.Blue light clears up my acne and white head problem.Red light makes it heal up in no time so I don&#x27;t have any scars. Last night I used the red LED light on my face,neck,arms,hands,legs and knees. Since I&#x27;m 59 I decided since it&#x27;s doing such a good job on my face with the red light for fine lines and smoother skin,use it on the other body parts too. With the acne and whiteheads I have to use it everyday or else the excess oil and bacteria builds up and I will have a flare up that takes about 5 days to clear it back up. The only suggestion I would make be is to make one bigger so I can cover more area at a time. I wish I had found out about LED lights years ago,I saw them on youtube about a month ago. Oh,and sure and wear the goggles to protect the eyes,they are included in the box with the light. And I also feel better,perky,after I do my light treatment, I saw on the net that most people have a mood lift after using the LED lights,.Yesterday I did the lights twice for 6 min. in the AM and about 6 min.PM. on my face. While I help my face might as well help my brain too.&lt;br /&gt;I love mine,so glad I ran across the youtube.</li>
    <li> I have used this lamp for 3 days to reduce acne and even skin tone.  I already see a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> My daughter had struggled with acne for 2 years and had been on numerous medications. When I bought this I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work and the doctor said &amp;#34;At least it won&#x27;t hurt.&amp;#34; I am so glad I took the chance. My daughter&#x27;s skin cleared up completely in about a month. She uses it for 10 minutes daily and has had wonderful results.</li>
    <li> Great for acne maintenance. I use for 10 minutes daily, and as long as I&#x27;m sticking to my normal face cleanse regimen, and staying away from dairy, I get few zits. If I do get them, they&#x27;re small and heal quickly. I only use the blue light because I use before going to bed, and the red light is so bright, it kills all melatonin production in my body for several hours (i.e., I have trouble falling to sleep). However, the red light is great for a glowing complexion - just use during the day. It&#x27;s not a sunburn effect, though. Something inexplicable, but it feels healthy and is mood enhancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, stay away from Pantothenic Acid. Mega-doses, although effective temporarily at killing acne all over the body, lead to long-term irreversible hair loss from many anecdotal reports I&#x27;ve read. No bueno!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key acne fighting formula: cleanse daily + this blue light daily + no stinking dairy!</li>
    <li> The best treatment for bad acne.  Really destroys the bacteria behind the acne. This is not a sunlamp.  This is specifically just for acne even the cystic kind.  With the right diet and this product you will be amazed by the results. I searched for 2 years to help my son when everything else failed.  This really works. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Quality looks good. Fast service.</li>
    <li> This thing is really amazing.  I have been dealing with skin changes for the last year.  I am 60 yrs old.  While at the esthetician one day my facial included LED light therapy treatment.  Well, my skin just looked so great afterwards.  Then I did it again and I was sold.  When I found this great thing on Amazon I could hardly wait to get one.  All you do is plug it in and use it.  They say 3-5 days a week and yes I see a remarkable difference.  It does nothing but good things for your skin.  And great to diminish those fine lines and wrinkles.  :)</li>
    <li> If you use it consistantly it really does help! I&#x27;m very glad I bought this thing. It is kind of heavy to hold onto and the red light is super bright, but I&#x27;ve been using the blue light everyday and my skin is clearing up.:)</li>
    <li> Lol. Never wrote reviews, but this is a must. When we opened it up, it looked USED! Scratches, labeling was slightly scratched off at the corner,no goggles as they promised, positioning kept moving down further away from my face. Never held still!! I did what the directions said. Anyways, I used it probably twice. Despite all those problems above, the worse is, I never felt like it was working. I know two days is not enough. But using a another company same type of product WHAT A DIFFERENCE!.  I found out by using a light therapy your supposed to feel warmth. With this product their wasn&#x27;t any period. Closer I got still no warmth. Remember, more expensive does not mean better quality!</li>
    <li> So far my acne has improved.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very bright and they give you goggles for this.&lt;br /&gt;I lay down and lay it on my face because I think sitting there for so long is slightly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;They need to just make a version of this that&#x27;s shaped like a tanning bed!</li>
    <li> Works great for my teen son.</li>
    <li> I know it works because I have used light therapy before.  Just can&#x27;t find the time to do it everyday.</li>
    <li> This product looked faded and dingey off white, then it didn&#x27;t work properly so I&#x27;m assuming it was either really old or used, I sent it back</li>
    <li> The package, and my research, states that there is a certain wavelength that triggers a reaction that kills acne bacteria. I don&#x27;t have any counter-facts to disprove this claim. The apparatus itself is quite sturdy. It&#x27;s quite heavy for its size.&lt;br /&gt;You can select which light to use depending on your needs. Blue to kill bacteria, red to promote cellular regeneration. Or you can use both and cut the time. Since using this machine, my acne has noticeably lessened. On top of that, the size of my pimple after 15 minutes of use shrinks noticeably. But know that this is and shouldn&#x27;t be the only thing you are doing against acne. If you think this machine will end your acne problems, you might as well spend your money elsewhere. This is a huge step towards clear skin but it should be relied on for everything.</li>
    <li> Excellent product... works exactly as it was advertised.  Loved how it improves my skin!</li>
    <li> Maybe this works for some people but this actually seemed to make my acne worse. Very sorry I wasted 300.00</li>
    <li> I started using mine December 12 2013 it&#x27;s now Feb 15 I have only missed two treatments in  that time. I saw a reduction of oil but a major increase in acne. Not saying it&#x27;s from this. Waste of money for me.As I stated in my original review it arrived damaged(tilt feature).I wanted to add to my review now that I used it the full 3 months and my acne is now severe where as it was not before  the light. I have pics before and after but I&#x27;m to embarrassed to show them. My dermatologist will place me on Accutane soon.&lt;br /&gt;Was thinking of ordering a SAD light but now I&#x27;m not so sure.Please decide for yourself if this works as everyone is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time spend each day 10 min. after freshly cleaned skin.&lt;br /&gt;Company shipped fast.</li>
    <li> very relaxing, and nice for face!</li>
    <li> This light really works well for clearning up acne.  We had tried just about everything for our teenagers acne and this light did the trick.  Very glad we purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks, and felt obligated to write a review! I have very acne prone skin. I don&#x27;t have any blemishes on my face right now for the first time in almost a year! Here is how i use it since the instructions are so vague:&lt;br /&gt; I use proactiv, and added the light in as part of my night time routine after I wash my face. I initially used both colors- red and blue, but realized I was now getting super small pimples which I&#x27;ve never had before! I figured the very bright red light might be covering up the blue light. Now, I only use the blue light for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worked great for me!! I had a cystic pimple begin to form, which usually means a bad week or two ahead. But I used the light, and it was gone the next day! I love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter was already under a care of a dermatologist, on facial cream and atibiotics for 2 months and I was not happy with the results. So I thought about getting this for her, we saw results with in a weeks time. She is happy with the results as I am. One of the great buys.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well for acne, but am concerned about long term effects to skin and eyes. I do use the goggles, but am still concerned.</li>
    <li> The red and blue LED lights work really well.  I got this product to help with Rosacea and to firm the skin and reduce age spots.  I started looking into the use of light therapy more and discovered that the red LED wavelength actually does much more than just make your skin look better.  You can find videos on youtube from a Dr. Burke who has used red LED light AND near infrared LED light to HEAL open wounds like ulcers on the fingers and legs, gang green, and even heal broken bones.  The research is really amazing at what RED and NEAR INFRARED light can do.    Red LED light is better absorbed by deoxy hemoglobin and Near Infrared light is better absorbed by hemogloblin. The Red wavelength is around 630 nM and the Near Infrared (which is called Near because of its wavelength range not the proximity to you) is around 830 nM in the research Dr. Burke did.  Both wavelengths seem to increase blood circulation by releasing Nitric Oxide which acts as a vaso-dilator but it also cause new blood vessels to form which reduces healing time.    Shortly after buying this my employee came in on a Monday with a large cold sore that was on her lip and chin.  It looked painful and she said it developed on Friday resulting in her barely being able to eat over the weekend.  I thought it was the perfect way to really see what the red LED light could do so I loaned it to her.  The next day (12 hrs later) after a total of 40 minutes with the light over 3 times my employee came back in and the inflammation was reduced.  She said it was no longer painful when normally it still would be.  We have continued to see how the Red LED light would cut down on the normal time to heal and she estimates that it has reduced her time to heal by at least a week (or more since this cold sore was bigger than she had ever had before but is healing faster).  Given that most of the research by Dr. Burke seemed to be done in the infrared range of 830 nM, I wonder how much faster it would have healed if she had used that wavelength.    By the way in researching all this I figured out that Rosacea can be caused by Demodex Mites (which you cannot see and most everyone has but Rosacea sufferers have 10X the number).  I also discovered that I have blepharitis which is common with Rosacea and also aggravated by the mites.  I tries using 50% Tea Tree Oil and 50% Olive Oil on my skin to kill the mites but they like living in the eyelashes and this stuff burns your eye.  I also used 50% apple cider vinegar on my face and eyelids/eyelashes.  It burned initially but second and third treatment did not so I think the burning might have been it killing the mites.  I can use full strength Apple Cider vinegar now and only have mild sting on eyelashes so definitely something changed after first treatment.    I have tried so many things to help with Rosacea and I&#x27;d like to say this light was the total cure but it wasn&#x27;t.  However in trying all these different things I have stumbled upon the cure for Rosacea for me and miraculously have no redness or pustules ... perfect complexion which is a first for several years.  I&#x27;m going to list what I&#x27;ve done and hopefully you can try and see if any of it helps you because I do think it may be a combination of things.    Prescriptions  1. Metrogel - Didn&#x27;t work for me.  It may have helped a little but not nearly enough.  Quit using it altogether years ago.  2. Oracea - Helps a lot but costs like $400 per 30 pills.  It still did not give me the perfect complexion though but may have if I had continued it  3. Finacea cream - Helps with pustules but not as much with redness.  I don&#x27;t use anymore because of cost and I just sought something else to solve total problem    Vitamins  1. Vitamin C - I started taking a gummy vitamin c only that was 400% the daily dose (I thinks this helps and certainly can&#x27;t hurt)   2. L-Lysine - I found I was deficient in this because my ferritin is low and hair would not grow past a certain length.  You need L-Lysine with iron in order to store iron which is your ferritin level. Turns out there is a correlation between deficiency in L-Lysine and Rosacea too.  I started taking 1000 mg per day about 45 days before complexion went to normal.  I think this helped because L-Lysine is NEEDED for collagen production  3. Iron - I&#x27;m taking this for my ferritin level but I am listing it just so you know I also took one iron pill a day  4. Gummy Multi vitamin - I can&#x27;t stand pills and will choose a gummy vitamin when I can    Creams/Liquids   1. Vitamin C serum - I have used this occasionally.  I think it is good for the face but not sure it had a real effect on my rosacea.  2. Apple Cider Vinegar - I started with 50% concentration (just half water and half cider). It burned.  Then repeated next day, it burned less. Then used full concentration next day and it burned less. Now I only feel a slight burn when wiping eyelashes and none on face.  I really think it is killing the demodex mites when it is burning. When these mites die they release bacteria so you should use the blue light to make sure you kill the bacteria too.       Tools   1. Micro Derma Rollers - These have tiny needles that puncture the skin and promote collagen growth.  I think this is the key to regaining a good complexion ... you have got to get the collagen to grow.  I used this when I got it in which was tough because my cheeks were red and puffed. I had already used the Apple cider vinegar which I think killed the Demodex mites but it did nothing to repair the collagen.  Afterwards I used the Vitamin C Serum and the blue light on this product and then the red to encourage the collagen growth.   2. This Red and Blue LED Light - I have used this intermittently.  I think it helps but was not the SOLUTION to my rosacea    My opinion ... I have tried a lot of this stuff and saw improvements but no cure for the rosacea.  However I do believe what made the most difference for me was three fold  1. adding L-Lysine as a supplementbecause I know for a fact I was deficient (took 45 days before it corrected the complexion so don&#x27;t give up too soon).  You NEED it for collagen  2. controlling the mites with apple cider vinegar (tee tree oil is too tough to use on eyelashes and the cider gave me feedback with burning or no burning to let me know if it was working because burning reduced with each treatment)  3. Micro Derma Roller - It was at least 3 weeks after first use before I suddenly had good complexion. Using this stimulates a lot of collagen growth just make sure if you have pustules you don&#x27;t spread bacteria over your face and shine the blue light afterwards to prevent it.    I hope this helps someone.  I cannot tell you how ecstatic I am to have good complexion again.  I do not actually need foundation.  It makes a huge difference to your self esteem.</li>
    <li> my daughter has been dealing with acne for the last 8 years . been to dermatoligist many times and nothing worked.  this thing is great cleared all her acne within a month.</li>
