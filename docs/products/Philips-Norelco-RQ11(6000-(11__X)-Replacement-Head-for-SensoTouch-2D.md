<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The 5 star rating says it all.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. The goods as described.</li>
    <li> The head itself fits fine but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks and already it&#x27;s not shaving as closely as it should.  I will be ordering another soon.</li>
    <li> perfect replacement for my 2 year old heads.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Good Quality.</li>
    <li> For the money, I would have thought this head would have a closer shave.  It&#x27;s good, but not great.  It&#x27;s something you have to have so it&#x27;s hard to complain about because you really have no choice.  I love the shavers waterproof feature and it does maintain a long battery life between shavings.</li>
    <li> Seems to be just fine</li>
    <li> The head is too expensive.</li>
    <li> Quality replacement cutting head.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t expect more than that.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep your razor going a few more years.&lt;br /&gt;Trick is to find the lowest price.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other sites are asking a lot more than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;At that point you my as well get another razor.</li>
    <li> This replaced a head that had been used for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;As expected, it made a big difference, restoring the razor to its as new performance.&lt;br /&gt;The new head seems to be getting a little sharper as it is used.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it is &amp;#34;wearing in&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It is what was expected.  No problems.  No issues.  Good product.</li>
    <li> get one for your dad or hubby. fits perfectly with smooth clean shave. no problem putting on his old razor</li>
    <li> I had not really noticed how poorly my razor was cutting until I replaced the head.  It is now working as well or better than it did when I first took it out of the box.  This is a must do for every year from now on.</li>
    <li> gets the job done. have used Norelco shavers for years. never disappointed.</li>
    <li> Perfect quality and a precise fit.</li>
    <li> Once again it was easy to order, arrived on time, and fit his razor perfect.</li>
    <li> These were quite helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were of good quality.</li>
    <li> The service was excellent but these are just overpriced in my opinion</li>
    <li> Nice product and service</li>
    <li> I like it very much.It is a very cheap and Superior quality.Is really fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> It fits to my shaver well. With a coupon of $5 off, the price was preferential.</li>
    <li> Nothing more to say. If you are happy with your Philips Norelco Shaver, then you will be happy with this genuine replacement head, as it is exactly the same as the one that came with your shaver.</li>
    <li> Replacements are just what I need but they don&#x27;t last more than 6 months.  This is coming from someone who only shaves every other day.  Need more longevity from these blades for the price paid.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Rq11 Replacement Heads for SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Silver (Purchased on 07/22/2011) were a perfect match for the shaver. It was easy to find exactly the right product that would fit the shaver that I had on hand. I will purchase this product again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with the speed in which my order was filled. The Norelco Replacement Shaver Head arrived on time and was packaged well. Thanks so much. Carole Lawrence</li>
    <li> Good shave, all the shaving heads are in one unit now, so it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I accidentally lost the blades down the drain while rinsing them in the sink, I thought that maybe therewas no entire replacement for them but there are and it works sharper and better than before!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> replacement worked fine and fit like a glove</li>
    <li> thank you very much....</li>
    <li> Nice to have the razor head available when needed and the price is cheaper than Walmart.</li>
    <li> excellent piece and great packaging &#x3D; 100% like</li>
    <li> Much-needed replacement head with cutting blades. Good price and received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> It works as required.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I always like to keep replacements on hand in case of a original equipment failure.</li>
    <li> Seems to be as god as the original!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Works as it should, was easy to install.</li>
    <li> Good price, great product.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once but the original head was two years old and getting very tired.  I renewed the the razor for about 1/3 the cost.</li>
    <li> Replacement head is what was needed to get a close shave</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the purchade. It does not work because cutters are not sharp. I get a poor shave.</li>
    <li> Not sharp. It&#x27;s pulling my hair instead of trimming. May be I got the defective piece. But at this price you can get another normal trimmer.</li>
    <li> May be a little pricey as you can buy a whole new razor for another 20 bucks or so more, but a fresh set of blades cuts so nice!</li>
    <li> These heads work well and they shave you very well.  The only problem is they are expensive.  The razor costs enough and then you must replace the head annually to get a close shave.  Need to get a generic head for this.</li>
    <li> New head works just fine. Unfortunately, no stores carry it so had to order it online.</li>
    <li> The item was a perfect replacement head for my shaver.It works great.</li>
    <li> super . ran like a sneaker!</li>
    <li> Great product, does a real nice job/. Worth the price</li>
    <li> Worked perfect, fit perfect</li>
    <li> Just as described. I ordered from this source previously. Arrived on time. Brand new, good packaging.</li>
    <li> Restored the razor to  like-new performance.  Once again I can even shave against the grain without the razor pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you find when you open the box is the upper half of the  razor head with the cutters in place.  You pop off the old top and put on the new replacement.  For razors I had previously, the replacement was only the 3 cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is not with these replacement heads but with the fact that I am unable to get more than 6 months from these cutters or the cutters of any other razor I have had since&lt;br /&gt;switching to an electric shaver.  But I suppose that is what helps keep these companies in business</li>
    <li> Required replacement.</li>
    <li> An easy replacement that made my year old razor new again.  Worth investing in, thought it would be great if it was less expensive.  Oh... well... I&#x27;ll buy another next year, I am sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the way the  Norelco shaver goes me a comfortable, close shave.  The only complaint I have is the on/off switch doesn&#x27;t hold up to constant use.  I had to replace the shaver after only two years of use.</li>
    <li> great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;strongly recommend</li>
    <li> The replacement head was exactly the right way to go! My shaver is like new again doing a great job.</li>
    <li> christmas present. Good !!</li>
    <li> Exact replacement head for my husband&#x27;s Norelco razor. Arrived on time and it fit and works great. There are several replacement heads (confusing) for Norelco razors so be sure to check your razor&#x27;s model to select the correct one. Much easier than trying to sort it out at a store.</li>
    <li> The fit the razor as expected. Will last 6 mos. to a year, depending on use.</li>
    <li> amazon&#x27;S  price was about 1/2 of what Phillips  wanted for the  same replacement blades</li>
    <li> Over priced not recommend</li>
    <li> I may just not be happy with the razor itself, but I never feel like the shave is truly clean.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and was exactly what I needed.  I have two Norelco shavers and use one for travelling and one daily.  Glad to see that the replacements are still available.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nice replacements for my shaver. I was going to purchase a new shaver but these worked well.</li>
    <li> very nice replacement head for my shaver. it used to come with only the 3 blades. now it comes as the whole top of the shaver. very easy to replace and does the job well.</li>
    <li> Shaves no better than the old head that it replaces.  Very good service from seller, however.</li>
    <li> Snapped right into place, works great.</li>
    <li> Fits my razor and works great.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very well! I think the head can be used for many years</li>
    <li> This fit the razor I own as stated.  The blades eventually  get dull after daily use and a replacement is needed.  The replacement head is very easy to clean and take apart if necessary.  I plan on purchasing this again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is much less expensive on Amazon than in stores.</li>
    <li> After about a year, the original head wore out, with actual holes in the metal.  In the mean time, I purchased a cheap version to get me by, while this replacement head was shipped.  Once it arrived, I was surprised that the cheap one shaved better than this expensive one.  I guess I should have saved my money and just bought the cheap versions all along.</li>
    <li> Saving 15% by subscribing. So far I have not yet found cheaper one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim when I realized I was still using the original shave head after a year of daily shaving.  The old head seemed to be doing just fine, but it turns out this really made a world of difference.  There&#x27;s usually no substitute for OEM since you get what you pay for - this is one of those items where it&#x27;s worth an extra $2 to get the best possible results.</li>
    <li> This product is great to get your worn blades out of the way and you can get a great shave again.  Love those sharp blades.</li>
    <li> Feels like new again.</li>
    <li> Less expensive than original manufacture&#x27;s product and just as good. I&#x27;ll order them again when I need replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandfather. The first time I bought this item there was no problem (sold by: Amazon). On the second time I bought it under a seller (Sold by: Gidabo) and received only the three blades, not the replacement head. It&#x27;s a good product (grandpa loved it), as long as you don&#x27;t buy it from Gidabo.</li>
    <li> Improved saving to like new levels.</li>
    <li> Good product and receives as expected/</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a gift for my husband! He loves it very much! It&#x27;s really works well! And I get it while promotion! It&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> Exact replacement perfect fit</li>
    <li> When I purchased by shaver just over a year ago, I read in the instructions that head should be changed once a year.  Being cheap by nature, I thought that I wouldn&#x27;t really need to do that.  A year later, I noticed that the shave wasn&#x27;t as close as it used to.  The new head changed all that!  I shopped various stores and sites looking for the lowest price on this shaver head.  I found it at Amazon.  For me, a Canadian, Amazon&#x27;s price is lower that any Canadian retailer&#x27;s even when I consider shipping and import duties.  As with most things Amazon, the shipping was done quickly and well.  I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars instead of 5, because it&#x27;s ridiculous to spend 1/3 of the price of a shaver once a year.  I would expect Philips/Norelco to offer these products at a more reasonable price or to design them to last longer than a single year.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize just how dull my old blades were until I used the new ones. Cut like a dream with no pulling or irritation. I will be replacing at least annually from here forward. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
    <li> It works great!  But, then again I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver when it is on sale on Amazon for $49.99 dollars and got  a rebate form for $30 dollars. I sent the rebate form to Philips, but they rejected. They only rebate the items sell at regular price. What a shame for Philips!</li>
    <li> Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to. Like having a new shaver</li>
    <li> Suppling me with very close shaves! I love a smooth face!</li>
    <li> The new head works as advertised.  I was a bit disappointed that the little plastic piece broke on the original head, but now my razor is like new again.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is the best shaver ever.  He is so very happy they have replacement parts so that he doesn&#x27;t need to replace the shaver.</li>
    <li> Great buy!!  Easy purchase!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the right size, for a better price. yes i would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t have 6 more words!</li>
    <li> The product does what it is supposed to do. What can I say?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice,but.......  What can I do if the rq11 to raise the price ? Can I cancel &#x27;Subscribe &amp; Save&#x27;?</li>
    <li> Replacement head greatly improved the shaving performance of my Norelco, but I note that I can still shave my head faster and cleaner with my Gilette Mach III.</li>
    <li> great price -quick delivery-savings $5</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco elec. razors since the fifties and it is quite noticeable that the blades do not last nearly as long as they once did.  I hate to think this is deliberate but it is difficult to reach any other conclusion.  It is obvious that Norelco make much of its profit from the sale of blades!</li>
    <li> Works as a perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed, I couldn&#x27;t find it local but finally found it on amazon. Very fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These were given as a gift to a friend who own&#x27;s the razor.  He is very happy with the quality of the razor heads.</li>
    <li> George is very happy with the replacement heads</li>
    <li> It was easy to install and my shaving is much more comfortable and close.  Would recommend to others.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars because it is compatible like they say and lasts as long as Norelco recommends that you use it. I cannot say that it gives me a particularly close shave though. Also, it is still expensive to have to replace the head on your razor every few months. But without buying a more expensive model I think that this is acceptable quality</li>
    <li> My old blades were not giving me a close shave anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The VERY expensive replacement blades don&#x27;t show&lt;br /&gt;any appreciable improvement.</li>
    <li> As advertised very good.</li>
    <li> Made such a huge difference. I didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old blades/heads were. Great price too.</li>
    <li> exactly what we were looking for</li>
    <li> Price was great. Easy to change out. Delivery quick.</li>
    <li> Works great for husbands razor.</li>
    <li> It works as supposed to albeit a little too expensive.  Would be nice to have a self sharpening blade replacement.</li>
    <li> Love my shaver and was happy to know that I could find a replacement head at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> heads arrived quickly and fit perfectly just as described in the ad. This item was moderately priced. Will definitely shop here again.</li>
    <li> These are the exact replacement blades for my Norelco razor. Great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I quickly realized these blades seem to have a shorter shelf life then my previous Norelco blades. I think it is weird i have to replace the whole head and pay $10 more, but as the other reviewer stated, you really do need to replace these every 4-6 months as the quality does go down hill and left with uneven cuts.</li>
    <li> Good price, hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> Very happy with service and product.</li>
    <li> Best wet/dry eletric you can buy. In the past these razors have lasted me many years and just keep getting better. I have tried others but they just don&#x27;t shave as close</li>
    <li> Easy to change and works well.</li>
    <li> The heads are just as described and for a fair price. We couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  We will order again from this supplier.</li>
    <li> This item is much more cheap that i can get in a regular store. It fits very good to my electric shaver</li>
    <li> the blades are great  i have a thick beard if you do not shave everyday it takes longer.why cant you buy just the blades by there self it would cut the cost.i would recommend the razor to someone who does not like cutting there throat every morning &amp; it does cut the cost of regular razor blades.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift to his father, and his father very much, all aspects are good, if longer cheaper the better.</li>
    <li> Works as designed. Very nice item.</li>
    <li> Great replacement heads</li>
    <li> The original head wasnt even on for 8 months and started working poorly, bought this and it works great again,Cheaper than buying disposable heads for my old razor.</li>
    <li> perfect  fas delivery</li>
    <li> I replaced the head after the indicator on the razor came on and cannot believe how much closer shave I now get with the replacement head.</li>
    <li> Can shave better and quicker again :)</li>
    <li> Had looked for this product in so many places--even where I purchased the razor.  If only I&#x27;d started at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great quality At a great price.</li>
    <li> Does good arrived in timely manner</li>
    <li> Was the perfect part I was looking for, lost that part of the razor after hotel stay. Did not need to buy the whole razor.</li>
    <li> Great replacement head , price is good and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband needed for his razor many thx</li>
    <li> Ordered and showed up very quickly. Happy customer here.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco Rq11 Replacement Heads made shaving much easier and faster.  I would recommend changing the blades out once a year.</li>
    <li> The replacement head made the razor like new.  It cuts great, and very smoothly.  That&#x27;s why I like Norelco razors.  I have been using them for over 40 years.</li>
    <li> You need to replace the shaver head approx. once a year to maintain peak performance with this razor. I&#x27;ve had this razor for 3+ years &amp; it continues to do an excellent job</li>
    <li> broken after second use. bad, I lost my money on this replacement, broken into pieces, the whole head replacement came off the razor</li>
    <li> Once a year like the say make a new razor out of the deal</li>
    <li> The heads work great for a few months, but really drop off in effectiveness after about three months.</li>
    <li> It is a perfect replacement for the shaver head of the SensoTouch 2D Norelco. It provides an very good shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor price on the replacement heads!</li>
    <li> We are pleased to be able to purchase this hard to find head for this rapidly changing product.  It is frustrating that a manufacturer can continue to change such an expensive product with no regard for the consumer by not making available the attachments.  Therefore we are pleased to be able to buy it here.</li>
    <li> What I got was three round blade assemblies. It was not, as it says on the site and on the box - a replacement head that you pop in after you pop out the old one. A little bit of Ikea-hell - three blades and no idea what you&#x27;re supposed to do with them.  I ordered this same replacement in 2012 and that was fine. Re-ordered it today Dec 16 - let&#x27;s see if I get Ikea-hell parts again or the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I did get the replacement head as advertised and ordered. Though the replacement head works fine, I am only moving it up from 1 to 2 stars for the service side of the transaction.</li>
    <li> Factory part.&lt;br /&gt;Dropped in.&lt;br /&gt;Turned on&lt;br /&gt;Smooth face&lt;br /&gt;Got lots of kisses&lt;br /&gt;Had sex&lt;br /&gt;I like the result&lt;br /&gt;What more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> This is a good product for a replacement head. Mine fell of the counter and broke and I was surprised to find out that just the head was almost the cost of the shaver.</li>
    <li> The shipping just took a week from USA to Australia, and my boyfriend like it very much. I will choose it again.</li>
    <li> It is nice to finally get what you order and o&lt;br /&gt;It works! I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I have ordered for my husband and it was as I expected. Thank you for taking care of mailing for us. We love to order things from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Norelco heads are  suppose to give you one year of good shaving.The most I can get out of any Norelco shaving heads is six months.&lt;br /&gt;As far as Amazon, I received very quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Put in my order on Sunday and received the replacement heads on Tuesday.  It saved me a couple of bucks and a trip to Walmart myself.  Like I said...</li>
    <li> cut like a brand new lawn mower.</li>
    <li> Bigger and better than the original. VERY happy with the new shaver head.</li>
    <li> Saved $ buying through Amazon. Same quality/product as the retail stores but without the retail markup. Works great. Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> Have not try, but the original one came with the razor works well</li>
    <li> replacements heads for my shaver works great!</li>
    <li> Nice package  Working fine.</li>
    <li> Phillips Norelco has gone downhill in my opinion a shadow of the company is to be quality wise the motors are the motors I think&lt;br /&gt;Heads are cheap quality</li>
    <li> If you are looking to buy these replacement blades, you obviously already own the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These replacements work as good as the originals that come with the razor. They really only stay sharp about 4 months if you shave daily. The packaging states they should only need to be replaced every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These replacements are easy to install. Make sure to thoroughly rinse all the hair and debris off the razor before installing these replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> It works as well as the original that came with my shaver, no better no worse.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly and appears to be genuine oem.</li>
    <li> perfecty work to RQ1160 :)</li>
    <li> This replacement head does exactly what it advertises, and was packaged in a genuine Philips Norelco box, giving me no doubts as to its authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this new replacement works great out of the box and was a good deal at the time of purchase ($18 with automatic coupon), I still have my doubts about Philips&#x27; advertised &amp;#34;12 month&amp;#34; replacement cycle per head. From my experience, the blades begin to dull pretty dramatically around the 6 month mark, making for a slow and inconsistent shave shortly thereafter.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Its the same as the OEM part with good package and on time delivery. However, the price is little expensive comparing the price of the whole product.</li>
    <li> Heads were as advertised, they arrived promptly and are doing well in our razor.&lt;br /&gt;They installed easily and solved the problem.</li>
    <li> Ordered this because my husband loves the razor &amp; the heads had gone bad.  Received our order veyr quickly &amp; it was exactly what we wanted</li>
    <li> The head did the job it was bought to do.  It fit the razor and was sharp and efficient.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his Norelco but since replacing the head it doesn&#x27;t work as well and has gone back to using his old old one.  I don&#x27;t know what is wrong he has tried putting the head on several times and it still for some reason doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  I don&#x27;t want to spend the money for another new head so guess we will just wait and purchase another razor in the future.</li>
    <li> Very easy on skin. Close shave. Dependable.</li>
    <li> Good blades for shaving but overpriced . For 60% more you can boy the whole razor !</li>
    <li> Replacement heads worked as good if not better than the original. This is the third replacement head I have purchased. They do need to be replaced after approx. a year.</li>
    <li> I feel same like the old one.</li>
    <li> I now know I waited too long to replace my shaving heads. These replacement heads fit perfectly and I ger a much better shave now.</li>
    <li> The factory recommends changing blades once a year.  It is not until you replace the blades that you realize how dull they actually get.  I now have a like new razor again!!  It cuts the shaving time also!!!</li>
    <li> fast shipping great replacement heads.</li>
    <li> paid half the price for the replacement heads , then i would have at walmart</li>
    <li> This thing fit perfect and was much cheaper than many other sites.</li>
    <li> Works well, bought my shaver in France and these blades fit right in.  Unfortunately when i did this is noticed one of the spinners in the shaver was not moving so one head was not moving.  This ended up costing 40 dollars fro Norelco so at the end of the day I should have just bought a new shaver.</li>
    <li> The first refill did not last as long as the original head but the latest delivery has lasted a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> i like it ,it&#x27;s so cool,i use it one time per week,i will say it to my friend.it works very well</li>
    <li> Got this in 2013 for my husband&#x27;s shaver, but he was happy with the original head, so hasn&#x27;t needed it until now.  When he opened the box this week (June 2016), he found the wrong item packaged inside the box.  The whole head should be inside (as pictured on the box) but only a set of blades are here and they are not the same blades that should be on the &amp;quot;RQ11 Replacement head&amp;quot;.</li>
    <li> what a difference to use a new one!!1</li>
    <li> I made sure to get an extra blade ahead of time.</li>
    <li> My husband needed replacement heads for his Norelco SensoTouch.  After going to several  retailers and not being able to find heads to fit his model, we contacted Norelco.  They took our order but, alas, it never arrived.  Then we turned to Amazon, which should have been our first choice.  We found exactly what we were looking for.  We got the replacement heads at an excellent price and they were delivered quickly.  As these heads need to be replaced a couple of times a year, we will definitely keep this vendor in mind the next time we are in the market.</li>
    <li> Whats there to say? it fits my sensotouch 2d. Takes a few times to get all the hairs, but it performs the same as the stock unit that&#x27;s included with my original purchase</li>
    <li> I may be a bit biased because my old blades were so worn. But this set of blades feels like a dream. I have only used them a few times but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Makes my Sensotouch work like new again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfectly to replace old head.&lt;br /&gt;Working well and good value.</li>
    <li> Now I can shave for another year</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Shaver head replacement works just like the original.</li>
    <li> This was a good price for the replacement head and they work very very well.  I&#x27;ll buy them again for sure.</li>
    <li> My razor was like new again</li>
    <li> Nice to have new replacements</li>
    <li> I thought what I was getting was the whole head not the blades.  That was misleading.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i expected</li>
    <li> IT IS JUST OK. -- I THOUGHT MY SHAVER WAS NOT CUTTING WELL ,SO I GOT A NEW ONE -- CAN&#x27;T SEE OR FEAL ANY CHANGE AFTER USEING THE OLD SHAVER DOR 4 YEARS.</li>
    <li> Wish they came in Tungsten (harder, last longer) I also shave my head with them. Best i have found yet, I will keep buying yhem&#x27; Larry Murvine.</li>
    <li> I never though I could like a razor as much as I do my Norelco,&lt;br /&gt;Driving to work, texting and shaving all at one time; I have a driver!</li>
    <li> What a great value.. now I can change my dull razor heads more often than once a year..&lt;br /&gt;makes shaving much eaiser..I recieved my order right away..thanks Amazon and GJ Wholesale.&lt;br /&gt;I Will Return!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful - razor is working just like new now.  Once the new head was put on the spots that were being missed or now clean shaven.</li>
    <li> When I first got my shaver, I would go weeks without cleaning it. This greatly dulled the blades, so I ordered an RQ11 Replacement Head for SensoTouch 2D.  I replaced the old head with the new owe and OMG, there was a radical change. I got a clean shave in about a minute...amazing compared to before.  Now I wash out the head after EVERY shave.</li>
    <li> I did Not expect to get the entire head I thought I was going to just get the blades what a surprise I got when I Saw the whole head</li>
    <li> Bought my husband a norelco razor several years ago and the heads became dull. i was ready to buy him and new razor and i found out I could just buy new heads for the razor. I put the replacement heads on the razor and it&#x27;s like a new razor.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, original equipment</li>
    <li> Very satisfactory product</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and today I asked him what rating he would give it out of five stars and he said four stars.</li>
    <li> very good！I like it very much！</li>
    <li> Works great. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I ordered this product according to the manufacturer suggestion , but it&#x27;s a wrong product and I loose my money !</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised. Works great.</li>
    <li> Do not like the quality blades did not preform as new heads.  ie,. dull.  Did not shave well at all.</li>
    <li> No complaints, works well</li>
    <li> They work well!  Just like the original head blades.  They breath new life into a daily used razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the blades allows for a better experience.  It stops hair pulling you experience with dull blades and makes for a faster, cleaner, closer shave.</li>
    <li> This is teh replacement head for my shaver. None of the local stores carried it. The head snaps on without difficulty and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I liked the correct replacement, I shave everyday but the new replacement did not shave any better than the 1 year old ones. Leaves uncut hairs all over my neck and needs numerous times over and over in different directions to get all the ones missed in normal shaving.</li>
    <li> It seems like the surface area to shave with is much smaller than my old Panasonic ES8092, with its longer parallel blades.  My old Panasonic did a better job over-all.  It takes noticeably longer to shave with these rotary blades.</li>
    <li> This new replacement head brought my shaver back to life after a year of daily use. It is Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> now I don&#x27;t have to go all over to try and find the replacement heads for the shaver and they will ship me a new one when I need one. They have a way you can pick the next time to have one shipped to you.</li>
    <li> It works great for half a year then you get cuts and scratches so you have to get new one for around $30. In my old unit I could replace individual metal pieces but here I have to buy whole damn head. Ripoff?</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as original,</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad, he said it was exactly what he needed.</li>
    <li> My husband like very much! It works perfectly and arrived in time!</li>
    <li> Husband likes this a lot.</li>
    <li> It works just like a new razor head should. No complaints. Amazon makes it easy to buy your replacement without the struggle of finding it in stock somewhere other than a BestBuy.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my grandfathers razor as a Christmas stocking stuffer. They are the replacements his razor, so I can&#x27;t imagine he would have any issue with them. The box was sealed and looks brand new, so I guess they will be ok.</li>
    <li> great product  fast delivery  thanks</li>
    <li> As expected, but somehow it seems to me that it has lost it&#x27;s sharpness too fast.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works great.</li>
    <li> the RQ11 is not the complete head replacement just the faceplate and floating blades in their housing. The RQ12 is the actual full replacement head complete! Be careful when you are purchasing.</li>
    <li> Cannot tell it from the factory original.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this replacement head before; worked fine before and working fine again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Without having to pay the 80-100 dollars ai saw they were asking for it in different places.I have medium/fine facial hair that only needs shaving every other day, you might need something more heavy duty if your&#x27;s is thicker but this will do the job if yours is similar or finer. My hair got pretty long while waiting for the cartridge but it handled it just fine.</li>
    <li> The shave head is well made and operates very well.  The only negative is that i wish it would get a little closer.</li>
    <li> there will not to use yet, but the quality should be no problem</li>
    <li> it is ok, i can use it. i think it is not good as original head. there are more words to need.</li>
    <li> Husband wishes he got a closer shave but is okay with these heads. He will continue with these at this time.</li>
    <li> Buy spare, yet apart used. RQ11 Replacement Head would not disappoint me, has been very trust the quality of Philips.</li>
    <li> Must be my husband&#x27; space but they don&#x27;t last very long. They become dull in about a month and a half!</li>
    <li> Norelco RQ11 replacement heads were a perfect fit and works well.</li>
    <li> Works great just like item stated.  Best buy and perfect fir for my husband&#x27;s razor.  Price is unbeatable and saved us from buying a brand new set.  Will be back for sure!</li>
    <li> work well enough although I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the blades that are just meh or my 4+ old shaver.</li>
    <li> My shaver is Like new again... I tried replacing this 2d with the 3d from China.. oh, that was hurful... I am glad I bought this one and my face feels like a baby butt again.</li>
    <li> My face says thanks didn&#x27;t realize the old blades were that bad</li>
    <li> Great product. Worked just like the original.</li>
    <li> No issues... Delivered timely and perform fine.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted; perfect fit.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT MY HUSBAND WAS LOOKING FOR AND WAS A GREAT PRICE HAS BEEN USING AND VERY VERY PLEASED WITH BLADES</li>
    <li> I purchased this set of replacement heads for my brother. He says it like a new razor now. Makes his mornings easier.</li>
    <li> Be warned:  This product does NOT contain an entire replacement head, but rather a set of 3 blades that don&#x27;t even fit the RQ11 style Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the 1st set, received an identical 2nd set, and will have to return this one as well.  At first I thought I was doing something wrong, but the box shows a very specific picture of &amp;#34;1X RQ11 Head Included&amp;#34;, with a picture of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh.</li>
    <li> new sharp blades are always good</li>
    <li> it does not shave as close as the old one, maybe it is a recondition one.One never knows. To bad.</li>
    <li> Works fine than original one. Its my everyday buddy. Does smooth shave, easy cleaning. Lets see how many months it lasts.</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Originals did not last 4 months.  We will see how long these last.  The blades cost too much.</li>
    <li> Works as it should! I use mine everyday and I made it last 2 years. Overpriced but it&#x27;s better than buying a new shaver everytime.</li>
    <li> the heads are good and were sent within a reasonable time,thanks again Amazon&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is good and I have used it for a couple of years</li>
    <li> When you need it.....You need it.&lt;br /&gt;An exact replacement for the comb and blade assembly for your Norelco razor.&lt;br /&gt;The price point was the lowest available and the shipment time was reasonable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Philips-Norelco electric razor for about 3 years now, and it&#x27;s been a great performer for me. These replacement heads come sharp, and are a welcome refresh on an otherwise great product. They last about a year, which is also a great value. You&#x27;ll notice the blades not catching hairs after about 9 or 10 months, and at 12 months they&#x27;ll start yanking hairs out. That being said, a once a year refresh with a new blade will keep your razor working like a champ.</li>
    <li> I bought a Norelco razor to make shaving easier with my illness and found that the cutting blades wore out. So finding these gave me a like new shave. They work as though it were brand new.</li>
    <li> Great material, no shipping problems.</li>
    <li> These unit last for a long time and cut real well.  I have used them for many years.  Very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Love this Razor!.  I use an electric razor for my legs as my skin is sensitive and cannot tolerate a regular razor.  This is my second replacement head and will continue using this until it give out.</li>
    <li> Excellent response time and product</li>
    <li> Came in one day and I once again have a close shave.  This black blade replacement triple blade set is just like the original blades.</li>
    <li> Can only get through Amazon.  He now feels like he has a new razor!  Loves it!  Don&#x27;t go out and buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if they sent a refurbished head or not (I thought it was supposed to be new), but it is very dull.  Doesn&#x27;t give a good shave at all.  My husband&#x27;s beard is scratchy in only a few hours. When the razor was new, his shave would last most of the day.  Certainly distracts from smooching.</li>
    <li> My razor wasn&#x27;t functioning very well anymore. I was pulling out hairs instead of cutting them. Now it&#x27;s like I have a brand new razor again.</li>
    <li> Perfect match and works perfectly.  Not much else to say except that delivery was quick and the shaving head works great.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carl</li>
    <li> just what I ordered, gives a smooth shave and less irritation to my neck.  I don&#x27;t know what all the discussion is about with the different heads if it calls for the RQ11 then get it.  I am afraid I don&#x27;t see the advantage in using a different head.</li>
    <li> med t best.  do not know if I would purchase again. do not appear to be as sharp as I would desire and want</li>
    <li> Shaving with an electric razor took years to get used to but now it is my main method.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! My bf loved it!! Much cheaper than in store too! Excellent replacement head for his Norelco!</li>
    <li> Great price, Great product, will continue to buy from!  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> It looks like they are cutting costs at Philips--this is too lightly built to last. It shaves well enough, but flies into pieces at the slightest&lt;br /&gt;mishap.</li>
    <li> Replacement head for my fiance&#x27;s razor. Fits and works perfectly! We couldn&#x27;t find one locally. Found it here, had it in two days!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but looks exactly like what is on the shaver at present.</li>
    <li> works great - no problems and it&#x27;s been 4 months or more</li>
    <li> I love this product for my opinion is the best shaving product I have used it in several years, thanks</li>
    <li> I was looking for a great price for the Norelco RQD11 Replacement Head to fit the SensoTouch 2D.  Amazon accommodated the price and shipped it out immediately.  The gift was a great success and was used today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase another one at Amazon when the time arises.</li>
    <li> This razor  Norelco 1150 has turned out to be a piece od crap  It was purchased aug 10 worked fine till I cleaned,.  the motor runs but now the heads dont turn/..  pretty crappy for paying $80+ buckes.  thank you Amazon and Norelco for screwqing me good</li>
    <li> The product works fine but seems a bit pricey through Amazon. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find the replacement head nearby. Beats buying a new razor, though.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and works very well.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> these shaver blades were delivered on time and and are original from Philips. I didn&#x27;t had any issues installing them on my shaver and they work excellent. And this is the lowest price I could find on any other website except Amazon. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful accessory to have un hand for a fine shaver.</li>
    <li> Waited too long to order new heads.  Now the razor is as good as new .Getting a smooth clean shave again</li>
    <li> Great price on blades</li>
    <li> Good delivery. Not as sharp as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Shave is regular, requires the use of a hand shaver to get a smooth shave, I expected a better performance from Norelco</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is right competitive for this Philips Norelco shaving head I&#x27;ve been using for years. Just recently I started wet-shaving, using a shaving cream and  water with my razor. Why not sooner? I ask myself. Live and learn!</li>
    <li> I had to replace the last heads on the razor because they came apart after 2 months of use. Very disappointing after paying so much for an item. Trying to purchase them was a pain in the ass! Not real happy with the entire product, but what are you going to do after it&#x27;s 3 months old and you find out it is JUNK!!</li>
    <li> I used to look all over for razor heads but found that the best place to purchase is Amazon. Thank you great job!</li>
    <li> Honestly, every face is different so you&#x27;ll have your own experience, but for mine this has given me the best results for an electric with the least amount of irritation. I have very curly facial hair, so tearing and irritation are a problem and this is hands down the best I&#x27;ve used over the last 10 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only big caveat is that I go through one just outside of 6 months, as a few other people have mentioned. I really noticed the difference when I switched the head after 6 months of use. Philips 1 year claim is for me, bumpkis. That being said, I shave every day so getting a new razor head only twice a year doesn&#x27;t seem that unreasonable.</li>
    <li> a norelco product.  fits perfect.</li>
    <li> Exact  fit, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Much more reasonable than the local stores, if you can find this particular model number.  One of the blades came loose from its mounting and took a bit for me to get it back together.  Finally got it re-attached and the blades work well</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco RQ11 Replacement Head for SensoTouch 2D is perfect, I always have purchased from Philips and they never let me down. great product.</li>
    <li> Waited too long to order these because of negative reviews.  Finally original blades had to be replaced. Decided to take a chance and happy I did.  Blades were just as I wished and are working well and plenty sharp.  Hopefully they will last.</li>
    <li> same old dependability</li>
    <li> Made my shaver like new.  Good price.</li>
    <li> At first I was impressed with the quality, but, now I m not that impressed, because the closeness of the shave has gone.&lt;br /&gt;that is why I rated this product a 3.</li>
    <li> Very good and is the same description from the pic, easy to change for the old one and good price</li>
    <li> great value ,great quality</li>
    <li> works fine for my husband, was unable to find them in the retail store so went to online and found it.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads I purchased  for my Norelco shaver exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit thank you Philips!</li>
    <li> It is a typical Norelco product, excellent craftsmanship</li>
    <li> Worked great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Its just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I am immensely satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> They work great. However they were a little different from my original heads I got with the razor. They both had the same part number. The new design is working better.</li>
    <li> Well, these were replacements for a friend of mine and he says they work great.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! Great delivery time. It came in one day!! Fast, easy and a great product.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads for my Norelco razor are easy to install and are convenient to get through Amazon.com. Beats trying to find them in a brick and mortar store, especially when the razor is more than a year or 2 old.</li>
    <li> Long time Phillips Norelco user. The product works well. I looked for replacement heads in other retail locations and could not locate them. I then tried Amazon and success.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and was exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> These blades were a replacement  for my husbands Phillips Senso touch 2D razor. They fit and worked well. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy and satisfy for this purchase.The price is fare and works great. I Will buy it again&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> The shave is closer and smother.  I should have changed the blades sooner.  I would recommend changing every six to seven months.</li>
    <li> The service was very good.  the Norelco head was more than I expected I thought I was just getting&lt;br /&gt;the blades. This was less expensive than the blades at Walgreen.  Bob</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the Norelco razor.  I have had one since they first arrived on the scene and I received my replacement heads promptly.</li>
    <li> My father is really happy that we were able to find replacements heads for his shaver. Now his 18 month old great-grand daughter likes to snuggle/burrow her little head in his neck again!</li>
    <li> This product came on time works well and as seen but when I removed the outer packaging to expose the box that was housing the item it looked like someone had stepped on it before they stuck it in the mail for me.</li>
    <li> These are providing a nice close shave and they also seem to stay clean after just a rinsing under the faucet.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for three years.  I liked it so much, I bought on for my oldest grandson two years age who was thrilled with it.  We buy new heads each year.  They are sharp and stay that way for a little longer than a year so Christmas is our time to buy each other new heads.</li>
    <li> These cost more than they should but the guidelines to change them every 12 months are indisputable.  I had not changed the heads for 16 months and my shaves were not real close.  I put on the new head and &amp;#34;bingo!&amp;#34;: close, clean shaves again.  Norelco, could you bring down the price or perhaps sell new blades by themselves, or blades &amp; screens, and make it a bit more affordable?</li>
    <li> Worked like a new pair of blades.I have used norelco products about 40 years . Why buy a new razor,when all I need are new blades.</li>
    <li> Not provided in stores locally, just typed in Amazon and searched, had just what we wanted in only a few clicks. My husband is well groomed again.</li>
    <li> It makes my old razor peform like new,and was $7 less than at a retilal outlet. Amazon always has great deals.</li>
    <li> The new heads are ok, however, I would think that Norelco could make on that lasts longer as they used to YEARS AGO.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, in time and much easier than trying to find in stores. I will buy them again next time</li>
    <li> This is for my husband.  Had difficulty finding these products-always out.  Thank you for the fast service.  My husband loves his razor and the cleaning solution.  He is legally blind and they help with his independence.</li>
    <li> Brought my old shaver back to life. Great service. Thanks</li>
    <li> Worked, but not as sharp as I expected.</li>
    <li> Work fine, good replacement heads for dull ones</li>
    <li> The Item arrived on time and fit and worked perfectly Thanks, Jacck</li>
    <li> This is the correct replacement head for my Norelco Razor.  Amazon had the best price for it that I could find anywhere.  It performs just like the original head. I was a little worried that it might be a cheap knockout version, but so far as I can tell it is OEM quality.</li>
    <li> I have another shaver Archetec but it is not amoung your choices for purchase.  If you carry one why not the other?</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are over-priced, and the seem pretty dull to me.  The stock head was much better.  I cannot explain why, but only tell you it is true for my rather harsh whiskers.  I used the cleaner, which I thought was less helpful than simply rinsing the stubble out under the water fountain.  I am headed to a new electric razor.  Your experience may be different -- but I doubt it.  Bruce</li>
    <li> After replacing a two year old razor head with this replacement I noticed an immediate improvement. This is an excellent invest.</li>
    <li> New blades are better but never seems to do a completely clean shave..</li>
    <li> replacement head came promptly and works well</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Does&#x27;t shave as well as expected.</li>
    <li> according to Philips these heads should last 1 year but never do for me .. The most i have been able to get out of a set is 6 months.</li>
    <li> Great decision to change the heads. My razor is working like new. I  highly recommend to buy them through Amazon!</li>
    <li> The quality is good, price is cheap, sharp blades,It&#x27;s really works well And I get it while promotion It&#x27;s cheap</li>
    <li> Original 4-Star review: Fits perfectly, works wonderfully! My original blades lasted 18 months, but these are just incredible and have taught me a good lesson!  I need to replace them much sooner, at the recommended 12 month interval!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2/2014 2-Star Update: Well I&#x27;m sorry to say, the blades have worn down extremely fast, (as others have also reported) and are now completely dead!!!!!!!!!  I will be calling Amazon and Phillips to complain. It&#x27;s almost as if Phillips has taken a page from the ink-jet printer industry!  If I cannot get satisfaction, I will be moving to another shaver manufacturer after 40 years with Phillips ....</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t stay sharp after using several times. Get dull too quick and won&#x27;t give a close shave like I like.</li>
    <li> It came as expected but the razors were no sharper than the one I used for a year and a half</li>
    <li> This replacement head works fine, it fits good in the razor, &amp; I would get another when it gets dull.</li>
    <li> Very nice replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Expensive you can buy the whole thing at Kohl&#x27;s for $79.00</li>
    <li> Positives:  looks&lt;br /&gt;.  &amp; feels nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A real pain to clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lack of a pop up trimmer is also a negative.</li>
    <li> This is the second replacement head&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure why they never seem to be as good as the original&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t ever drop the head. It will look like a distructo car from your childhood</li>
    <li> The razor head works as expected. That is it is top quality and works perfectly as befits Philips. I have used them for 40 years more or less.</li>
    <li> If you own a sensotouch 2D,as stated on service you need to replace heads once a year. Got mine at a great price and fast shipping from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> SUPER REPLACEMENT HEAD AND EVERYTHING WAS IN-TACK---ALL U HAD TO DO IS SIMPLY REPLACE THE LD HEAD WITH THE NEW ONE---GREAT JOB AMAZON AND PHILLIPS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for quite long time, they are best quality, no complain.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;Works nicely&lt;br /&gt;Time for sharp blades</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s from Philips Norelco: top of the line.</li>
    <li> Love Norelco...great product</li>
    <li> Works great. Much better than my other one that is more than a year old.</li>
    <li> Just does as I expected</li>
    <li> Works great.  Cheaper than store prices.</li>
    <li> maybe use for about 2 years</li>
    <li> Correct replacement head. Snapped into place and worked on first try.</li>
    <li> These replace the worn shaving heads on Norelco razors. They work as they should.</li>
    <li> The shaved works great with a new blade. I would.recommend.this shaved to my friends.and family..worth every bit of the cost.</li>
    <li> Great product; factory spec and works well. Would have given five stars but the cost is 2/3 that of buying the new electric shaver itself. Next time I will most likely buy the new shaver, since everything else on the old shaver will have even more use on it.</li>
    <li> Smooth shaving ,maybe better than when shaver was new&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had ordered sooner, would be nice if these heads were a little cheaper</li>
    <li> the head came but only had gears on 2 drives so 1 drive never works</li>
    <li> Excellent Replacement shaving heads!!!! I LOVE Phillips products!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son. Delivery time was excellent, item exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement piece. My razor is working like brand new again! Make sure you replace these about every 12-18 months</li>
    <li> Great price, quick shipping</li>
    <li> price was pretty good. heads work well although really not much better than the old heads did.</li>
    <li> It fit - works perfectly</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last nearly a year, 4 months and it&#x27;s not doing to well .</li>
    <li> Fast and was as promised.</li>
    <li> Already did a review on this item...came with the razor that I ordered for my husband</li>
    <li> Good replacement part as expected.</li>
    <li> It quite suit my bear shaker.</li>
    <li> Good product made even better by Amazon access. Fairly easy to clean. Nice to have perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> Good price for 2 pack.  Quick service</li>
    <li> Do not feel as sharp as they are when you buy them brand new</li>
    <li> Was not the whole assy- need to clarify what you are getting</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm for my hubby&#x27;s older Norelco Razor, just like it said it would. Popped it on and tried it right out of the box and it literally like getting a new ravor.</li>
    <li> Gives great shaves and last one year sometimes shaving more than once a day.  I highly recommend this Norelco product.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving, but when I have to shave, I use these.  That work fine!</li>
    <li> Everytime I basically debate if I want to buy more blades or just get a new razor. So far, i&#x27;ve gone with blades.</li>
    <li> Took a while to figure exactly which one fit but it was perfect and almost 1/2 the price of Target</li>
    <li> Seems like something was left off from what the original equipment had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased before, arrived quickly and works as expected.</li>
    <li> After owning it for 2 years, my husband&#x27;s Norelco SensoTouch razor was wearing down a bit and taking much longer to shave his face. I finally realized we could just replace the head without buying a whole new system and it works perfectly again. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have two RQ11 Heads.  These do not fit my razor per my local jeweler.  The jeweler said I need RQ12 heads.  I would like to return these RQ11&#x27;s  and send me  two  RQ12&#x27;s with no cost.</li>
    <li> Fit my razor as advertised.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly and arrived timely.</li>
    <li> The product came quick to my house.  The replaceable head is not like as good as the original one on my razor.  I didn&#x27;t have to go over my face twice when my razor was new.  That&#x27;s why I purchased this replaceable head.  It works fine but I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again.  I guess I was spoiled with my new razor.  It still shaves good but I just have to go over my face a couple of times to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Great product.  They dont last as long as the former models, but Norelco made it so that you cannot use older heads on this razor.  Be careful of the catch!  There is a setting that allows Amazon to send you a new razor head periodically.  If you do not want this, make sure you dont agree to the terms!</li>
    <li> What a difference the new cutters made.  Smooth and a very close shave.Would buy again. Replace once a year for peak performance.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco RQ11 head unit gives me a close shave. I had lost my original head unit in a hotel. I recommend this shaver and blades.</li>
    <li> This product was worth the purchase.  It worked on my shaver very well, and I had no problems whatsoever when I installed it.  The price of the product I thougth was a little steep.</li>
    <li> Wish it shave a little closer. I Get new blades once a year.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement head for my Sensotouch after 12 months using the original heads. I noticed that shaves were getting a bit rough and the heads weren&#x27;t cutting as close as they used to. Popped the new one in, and immediately noticed a difference in the closeness of the shave. Makes your shaver function like it&#x27;s brand new!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too simple!And not same as imagine.I would never buy this item again.This message want to help to those who want to buy.</li>
    <li> My husband is very satisfied with the replacement head for this Norelco shaver.  It is just like  new!</li>
    <li> The replacement heads I purchased through Amazon.com for my Norelco shaver exceeded expectations in performance and quality. In my opinion, they are a higher quality than the original shaver heads. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> it did not mach my machine</li>
    <li> I purchase these once a year, and I am always been very pleased with each replacement head I have received.</li>
    <li> Old head would flip up for cleaning. This one has to be removed.</li>
    <li> received in a timely fashion and was of good quality.</li>
    <li> razor works like new now</li>
    <li> Vastly improved the shaver by replacing the blades...after all you can sharpen them</li>
    <li> Needed to replace 3yr old blades.</li>
    <li> what was expected. Its Norelco</li>
    <li> not as good as original</li>
    <li> great the last set lasted over a year&lt;br /&gt;good shaver very happy with it&lt;br /&gt;you dont realize how well it work till you get the new blades</li>
    <li> Snaps right in to my 1160x and provides a close shave - good as new.  Guess replacing blades periodically does make difference.  Well worth it vs buying new.</li>
    <li> Received the correct item, on time.</li>
    <li> They work as expected would purchase again</li>
    <li> great shaver heads.  love this razor.  arrived on time.</li>
    <li> He loved it.  Fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Original as what came in the original razor. Poor at best. Hard to clean. Don&#x27;t buy the razor in the first place.</li>
    <li> Seller was quick to ship and item was exactly as described.  My husband said these razor replacement heads work better than the original ones that came with the razor!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my teenage son and after 2 months of use, there are several sections of the outer guard missing from the head.  The razor is now rather useless.</li>
    <li> Spare parts for the future.</li>
    <li> HOPING IT STAYS SHARPER LONGER THAN THE ORIGANAL HEAD???</li>
    <li> my husband uses the shaver daily</li>
    <li> came on time and was perfect fit.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and good price.</li>
    <li> My husband has been very happy with his Norelco shaver, so when the blades became dull, we were glad to see they were replaceable.  However, the replacement blades we received are NOT good.  He has to go multiple times over an area just to get poor results. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> Made my razor new again!</li>
    <li> had  norelco for fifty years smooth!!!!</li>
    <li> Superb! However the small, well protected item was enclosed in a huge box which I found rather strange.</li>
    <li> Grate product, recommended</li>
    <li> get as clean shaven as with blades I replaced.....</li>
    <li> the only place that we could get these at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I HATE this razor, and these replacement blades did nothing to help/make the neck closeness any better. Still hurts, still leaves hairs. Crap!</li>
    <li> I see no difference between this replacement head and the old head I replaced. I did the &amp;#34;right thing&amp;#34; and when the razor told me to replace the heads, I did. I was expecting a much better shave, but I should have known that you just can&#x27;t get a decent shave with an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is from a reputed brand and is a very reliable product.  It is a pleasure to use this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a yearly replacement. It arrived before the estimated date. The unit was a perfect fit for my razor and has worked well ever since.</li>
    <li> OK - their replacement heads for a Norelco by Norelco....they work.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need for my model of Norelco razor. Works great.</li>
    <li> yes it was the correct part for my husbands razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this a Christmas gift for my hubby, it works really good!</li>
    <li> It is the wrong head. It did not fit my razor.</li>
    <li> Great original replacement part at a great price!</li>
    <li> Heads didn&#x27;t even last me 6 months before they got dull. Will buy a different brand of razor next time.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Still like a safety razor but Coumadin prevents using that.</li>
    <li> I have been using these replacement heads once a week for less than 6 months and now they are making a crazy noise. I puy my old shaver head on and it is not making any noise. i called norelco and they wont do anything about it. the original head that came with the shaver lasted for 4 years with no problem. this lasted less than 6 months. not good</li>
    <li> Best shaver my husband has ever had</li>
    <li> Works fine and solved my problem of used Head that did not cut well.</li>
    <li> I am one of those sensotouch 3D user who was bound to use RQ12+ (The RQ12 blades for the sensotouch 3d are no longer in production )  as the replacement blades which gave me the shave that a sadistic would enjoy. I returned the product and bought these blades as well as the assembly base ( from philips website) and WOW these blades are close to an RQ12 EXCEPT that i miss the 3rd degree of movement when I run across my jawline and I had to run a couple of extra strokes.&lt;br /&gt;But between the sadistic hair tuggin RQ12+ and this one .. I would take this gladly accept this.. I was literally on the verge of throwing away my sensotouch 3D but because thanks to this head......I am s(h)aved</li>
    <li> No problem with the heads, they work great.  I wait too long as usual to order and don&#x27;t realize how well the newer ones work.  I love using an electric razor but I wish the heads were a bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> It was nice to find eactly what I needed without having to go to a number of different sites and spend a lot of time.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Phillips Norelco RQ11 Replacement Head for my SensoTouch 2D.  I am very pleased with this product.  It seems even better than the original rasor head.</li>
    <li> I very satisfied about the purchase and it was what I was looking for. Thanks a lot for sending me the right one.</li>
    <li> Excellent; it is a good buy and it works extremely well. I had some reservations but they were put aside.</li>
    <li> Turned my razor back into a brand new one... no problems.</li>
    <li> delivered on time, product as described, replacement parts fitted to the product, that I bought for my father,  still using , thanks</li>
    <li> seems to be working just like the old one it replaced</li>
    <li> I needed this for my shaver. It was about time I replaced the heads on it and this was the one I needed. Once I replaced this it was like getting a new razor. I mean the battery is still getting a little worn, but the shave it better than it was so I&#x27;m happy. I use it to shave my head and face but Norelco always has that issue where they never can get the neck just right. So for me it makes sense to use the Norelco then a day later use a Gilette to get a clean shave once the Norelco has done the heavy lifting.</li>
    <li> Fit just as it was supposed to and has been giving me a shave just like when it was new.</li>
    <li> Placed in use immediately.</li>
    <li> My husband needed a refill for his razor. It was easy to remove the old blades then add this new one.</li>
    <li> Fits just like they were supposed to. Easy to find online. Price was right. Not sure what more could be said?</li>
    <li> No review needed it is a replacement head.  Really does not make sense to write a review here.  Two more</li>
    <li> The blade heads dull quickly, they are expensive and they fall apart into minute pieces that you can&#x27;t put back together again unless you are a genius.  I rate the razor and the heads a dud for design and cost.  I really wanted to like this but it has turned out to be worthless-twice.</li>
    <li> These heads are easy to install. I have a heavy beard and replacing the heads was a big improvement. I wuld recommend not waiting for a year to replace the heads.</li>
    <li> Simple, easy.  Worked exactly as intended</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and worked great.</li>
    <li> Perfect it was new as stated.</li>
    <li> Right, every manufacturer &amp;#34;recommends&amp;#34; frequent replacement; in this case, an annual replacement is indeed justified. Heads are easily cleaned as well.</li>
    <li> shaves really close, fits perfectly. just make sure it is the replacement for your specific razor.</li>
    <li> Not sure how you can rate this any better than OK as it is exactly the same as the original.</li>
    <li> This is only the second electric shaver I&#x27;ve bought.  But I&#x27;m on my third replacement head, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I give it four stars because I&#x27;ve never bought a shaver over a hundred dollar so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m missing out on.  I can&#x27;t grow a thick beard so there&#x27;s not a whole of for this thing to fight through compared to some people that I know.  I think it would be a bad choice for someone who can.</li>
    <li> Came quickly ,works well</li>
    <li> Seems to be an exact replacement.  Much less cost than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> Have had my Norelco senso touch for about six years. Recently one of the little plastic rotor drivers got broke. So I purchased A braun 340S which was A big disappointment. I immediately ordered the RQ11 replacement head. It works great. and I look forward to many years of good service from my old Norelco</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver at Walmart for $47.00 on clearance. I used Gilette razors before. Once I started using the Norelco, it was abit uncomforable. After two weeks, no more razors.</li>
    <li> hAVE USED nORELCE FOR DECADES.  THE REPLACEMENT HEAD WORKS JUST AS EXPECTED, JUST FINE.  nOT MUCH MORE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT THAN THIS.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes the shaver and I ordered these to have on hand when he needed them.  My husband has a very tough beard and goes through shaving heads like a champ.  Hard to find shaving heads so when I found these on Amazon, I ordered!&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON..........the best place to shop!!!!</li>
    <li> These razor blades would have been fret, but were not ensconced in the housing as described and thereby were unusable for my razor. I was able to return the product without any hassles and able to obtain the correct product.</li>
    <li> Fast service easy to order worth your trying out, nothing to worry about. Try it, I did and am glad I did.</li>
    <li> estas cuchillas en 2d son de calidad insuperable le queda a uno el rostro super suave recomiendo este producto okey.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and as ordered</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get a very close shave with this shaver. I though it might be the blades that came with it when it was new, but I was wrong.</li>
    <li> The new heads do not shave as close as the Original heads that came with the shaver? I have to shave for a longer time to accomplish a good shave that is not acceptable!!!! Some thing is wrong? you should look into this!!!!</li>
    <li> Husband is happy and has been using the head for months now. His hair is average growth and average thickness. Will order again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Shaves like a new razor now !!!!</li>
    <li> IT WAS THE RIGHT REPLACEMENT HEAD.</li>
    <li> Great product, It feels like i have a new racer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the replacement I that I have received.  It is dull and doesn&#x27;t cut anywhere near the way it should.  I would dare to say it&#x27;s a refurbished head and not a new one.  It has been terrible since the first shave with it.  First time I&#x27;ve experienced this problem and not sure I will replace it again.  I will just buy a different brand razor and I have used a Norelco triple head shaver for over 30 years.</li>
    <li> Works great, affordable price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as stated!</li>
    <li> Fits razor perfectly. Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Wish I did not need to buy the whole head but fit perfect. I forgot  what new blades feel like, 100x better.</li>
    <li> They work great just like the original blades</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as well as those came with the razor..</li>
    <li> I have been happy in the past and rated this product fine. For some reason this last replacement head cuts no better than the used one I have used for months.</li>
    <li> ok for couple of months.  not like original.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT IT AS A REPLACEMENT FOR MY RAZOR AS I USE IT TO SHAVE MY HEAD, SO IT GETS EXTRA HEAVY DUTY USE, SO I FIGURED IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE ONE IN RESERVE!!!</li>
    <li> The improvement in cutting efficiency was gratifying  I wasn&#x27;t aware how dull the old blades had gotten to be. Nice</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.perforce.</li>
    <li> Met expectations. RQ11 Horelco replacement head hard to find locally. Amazon had it. FedEX or USP (Brown) delivered it but did not receive notification from deliverly agency. Since it was small, thought it would come via USPS so waited three days before going on line to see deliverly status and found that it had been delivered to the aprartment complex office.</li>
    <li> I bought Panasonic as a replacement for my old Norelco. Big disappointment.  I just bought the replacement head for my old trusted Norelco, it now it is shaving like the first day I bought the Norelco.  Triple head really makes shaving efficient.</li>
    <li> Good price spare blade for next year</li>
    <li> My husband thanks you!</li>
    <li> Does the job it was intended for. Replaced existing head and works well.</li>
    <li> GOOD  PRICE &amp; PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This replacement head is of good quality, and replacing the old head was literally a snap. The improvement in my shaving experience is marginally better. I find that soaking the blades weekly in rubbing alcohol prevents buildup and makes shaving easier. I barely cover the head in alcohol and swirl it around for about 20 seconds, then rinse with hot water. Sometimes I add a drop of liquid dish soap to the mixture.</li>
    <li> all that is important on replacement parts is that it fits and works which it does&lt;br /&gt;what else could you want?</li>
    <li> Impressed with the shaving action, wet or dry.  Feels good in my hand.  I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone for a touch up shave or for a heavy evening beard at work or home.</li>
    <li> Recomendado, los repuestos son muy buenos, el tiempo de entrega y el empaque practico, recomendados sin lugar a dudas, buenos.</li>
    <li> This is a product that works/does as offered for sale. Nothing to say more than if you need this, then you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s the exact replacement head for the original. After over a year using the original head, I finally purchased a replacement head for my Norelco 1150. This does the job like it should.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because when I push down on the razor, it feels like the blades are rubbing which the original blades did not do.</li>
    <li> These heads fit perfect and the shave is excellent compared to the old blades, price is much cheaper then the stores</li>
    <li> I was surprised when my original shaver head broke so quickly.  I stuck it in a drawer for about 6 months before I found the replacement heads.  Now my razor is truly as good as new.  I will stock up on a couple of these to get the maximum life out of my razor base.</li>
    <li> Was as advertised &amp; shipped promptly. Was well satisfied with this item, it was competitively priced. Would purchase this item in the future.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and I can&#x27;t believe the difference it has made.  It was even better than what was on the razor originally which is surprising as the original was mfg&#x27;s but didn&#x27;t seem all that sharp compared to this.</li>
    <li> Very good.  Though these items are always pretty expensive, getting it this way was much more cost effective and it came very quickly</li>
    <li> Looks and cuts 98% same as the original part.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve currently used it for about a year and it&#x27;s still cutting the same as the first day I got it.</li>
    <li> The local store no longer carried this replacement head - this one is the right model and works just like it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> exact replacement, works great, not particularly a deal but these are hard to find.</li>
    <li> This is the replacement head for my Norelco RQ11. I use my subscribe and save and order one per month, as I like to keep a sharp razor head, and find the best price is through the subscribe and save. I love it !</li>
    <li> Works great as long as you DONT DROP IT like i did and 40 pieces later.</li>
    <li> IS THE PERFECT COMPLEMENT FOR YOUR PHILIPS NORELCO SHAVER. THIS ITEM HAS GOOD QUALITY AN IMPROVED DESIGN. VERY RECOMMENDABLE FOR PHILIPS OWNERS.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this product to anyone with a Norelco SensoTouch 2D shaver.  it was a gift for my Uncle.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review as i have not used this product but it is long lasting!  Why?  Because the stock blades have been lasting me for more than a year though it is recommended to change annually.  Nevertheless, i am confident this product will last!  --&amp;#62; I am writing another review as I just gotten another replacement set.  This time the heads are different and more matt surface at each of the heads.  This actually makes the shaving tougher as more friction can be felt.  Ended up using the older head and new blades and that works fine.</li>
    <li> No problems with it since I got it. Some have complained about the &amp;#34;cheapness&amp;#34; of the item...well, welcome to a throw-away world.</li>
    <li> Did my beard get more wirey and tougher? Or did the quality of Norelco razors decline. I kinda wish my 20 year old rusty trusty Norelco had lasted forever. Seems you must spend two hundred or more bucks these days to get one that lasts a year or so. During 2 1/2 years I&#x27;ve had two of these Sense Touch razors and I&#x27;m on my fourth shaving head(two came with the razor). The older razors were very good, this one is &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; okay.</li>
    <li> Well, now I feel the difference, but I wonder why I can now just change the circular heads instead the full head and get a better price...</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Since I don&#x27;t have 18 words to say about electric razor heads I will just ramble.  You should consider removing the 18 word minimum.</li>
    <li> Costly but what do you do? Buy another unit? No, just pay the price&lt;br /&gt;for the new head. Good for another year.</li>
    <li> wrong one, and the right one cost 100 bucks, so negative review for the crazy price. no thanks, going back to manual razors</li>
    <li> I went a whole year before I needed to replace my razors so it works great and I still get to keep using my razor I love.</li>
    <li> wow. what a different between this new head and my 1 1/2 yr old one.  It was time to change it for sure.</li>
    <li> Exactly perfect replacement at a great price.  I will definitely purchase this again when necessary.</li>
    <li> When I ordered these I was concerned that they would not fit my razor.  Norelco has so many different models your head will spin trying to figure out what works and what won&#x27;t.  However this head works perfectly and restored the razor to new.  Very clean close shave for my heavy beard.  I intend to subscribe to get new blades every six months or so.  Well worth the price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> seems over priced but could not even find locally.</li>
    <li> I Needed to replace the blades on my shavers like every 8 months and this is the second time I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> REPLACEMENT HEAD WORKS FINE,IM HAPPY WITH IT</li>
    <li> As good as the original</li>
    <li> The replacement blades fit easily into his shaver.  He has a nice smooth shave with a shaver that is like new.</li>
    <li> Great for my husband Ed while he was alive could sit in his chair and shave......I was in charge of cleaning his razor tho.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND ALWAYS BREAKS OUT AND THIS RAZOR IS THE ONLY ON THAT WORKS REALLY GOOD FOR HIM I COULD ONLY FIND THE REPLACEMENT HEADS HERE.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure where to buy or how much to spend on replacement heads for my Norelco electric razor.  After checking other sites, found this to be the best price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my Norelco 1150x.  Amazon&#x27;s pricing was really great for this item as it was at least 30-50% more expensive in retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This head brought my razor back to life.  It is a official Philips factory head so it will essentially give you a brand new razor and makes your electric feel like it is brand new out of the box again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recommended time to change the head is once per year but I have extraordinarily thick quick growing dark hair and I find I need to replace mine about once every six months to maintain optimal performance!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for &amp;#34;so I thought anyway&amp;#34; as a replacement head for my electric shaver. I have to order these every 6 months is the only major drawback. They fit my razor just fine. The company says they should last a full year and to replace them yearly. The fact is there is not a &amp;#34;Chance&amp;#34; they will last a year. The best I can get from them is 5 to 6 months of use MAX. They are not CHEAP in price to only last as long as they do. You can get a closer shave with a disposable razor, then with these Knockoff  IMITATION Norelco blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to my post. Today is Jan. 15, 2014:&lt;br /&gt; I think after using this item and seeing how fast the blades wore out. I definitely know this is NOT made by the Norelco Company.  Some other Chinese company copied their product and is selling it on Amazon. The reason I think this is because I ordered this shaver head before and it lasted about 6 months. When I got this replacement I only got about 2 months of good daily use out of it. It now does not shave well at all, So I went back to original blade and I get a better shave from the original blade that came with the unit new, and is 13 month&#x27;s old.</li>
    <li> I use my razor every day .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the replacement head because of the excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will reorder the next time that I need the replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provided that the price remains good</li>
    <li> I stretched my first set of Norelco razor heads to over two years.  They seemed to be working fine.  I was used to them.  Of course there was a little more irritation than when new, but I was willing to pay that price.  Then my wife purchased a new set for me for Christmas.  Out of curiosity, I set the new blades next to the old blades to see if I could visually tell a difference.  On the new set, the &amp;#34;Lift &amp; Cut&amp;#34; action that Norelco markets is clearly visible.  It looks like a double-decker set of blades--one just a smidge above the other.  On the old blades, there was no noticeable difference.  If I didn&#x27;t know any better, I would have though my old set was just a single blade.  On most blades the two parts were bent or fused or worn together (I don&#x27;t know what is actually happening).  On only a few could I see that the two blades were still separated, but there was so much gunk in between them that I doubt they were of any benefit.  So I installed the new blades, fired them up, and...SURPRISE!  I could actually feel a difference in the blades.  The best I can describe is a gentle tugging while I moved the razor across my face.  I assume that is the &amp;#34;Lift &amp; Cut&amp;#34; action actually working.  I honestly thought it was a gimmick, but not anymore.  My shave was closer and with less irritation than with my old set of blades.  The price was cheaper than a new razor.  The battery on the original razor, going on 3 years now, is still going strong.  Will I now start replacing my blades every year?  Probably not.  I&#x27;m too cheap.  But I will now look forward to the new blades or razor when the time comes!</li>
    <li> The price was resaonable and the delivery was faster than expected.</li>
    <li> My dad&#x27;s face is smoother now</li>
    <li> Excellent item and excellent price.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed!!</li>
    <li> Works great! We had a hard time finding these replacement heads at the stores near us.  My son&#x27;s used them on their shavers and liked how they worked.</li>
    <li> These NEW replacement blades are NOT good at all.. I&#x27;m having to shave longer than when I used my old one&#x27;s.. NOT a close shave.. ORIGINAL blades MUCH MUCH better</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  Very difficult to asssemble.  Poor directions.  Ended up calling the company and they were unable to help.  The  replacement head just fell apart and we have no idea how to put it back together.  I am going to try to return the razor and buy a different brand.;</li>
    <li> It is a GREAT razor! Is way more than I expected. I have used for 30 days without recharge. It does all they say and more.</li>
    <li> The replacement head did what it was suppose to do.  Easy to change out.  Easy to clean and shaves nice and close.</li>
    <li> After all this is just a replacement head. The reason I rate it so high is that the first head lasted a year - just as advertised!!</li>
    <li> The product and order was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not need another shipment.  Please cancel further shipments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please cancel automatic order</li>
    <li> I have had several electric shavers in recent years - more expensive brands than this Norelco. The micro screen on top of the blades always seem to dent or pull my whiskers. Not so with this electric razor. The shave heads are smooth, do not pull and cut close. They seem to last longer too, than the replacement heads of others I have owned. The razor itself is lightweight, easy to use, charges quickly and has a pivoting head. I don&#x27;t see myself changing from this product line; great quality, great razor, great buy.</li>
    <li> Works as it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads were perfect and makes for a clean and comfortable shave. I was completely happy with the service and with the product.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition&lt;br /&gt;Razor now runs just like it did when new.</li>
    <li> The Razor Head did not perform and was dull horrible results when shaving.  Would definitely want a new one.  Did not work as my last one did.</li>
    <li> got this replacement head to replace my present head that I have had over a year. This head feels lighter, and my OLD head actually cuts better.  Needless to say I&amp;#34;m disappointed, so much so, that when I can no longer use the older head, I&#x27;ll be junking an otherwise nice shaver, and be going back to blades.  Like so much these days, new doesn&#x27;t always mean better.  Obviously these are outsourced replacements and corners were cut for the sake of profit.</li>
    <li> I noticed the packaging is FSC certified which means no old growth forests were logged for the packaging.  Many companies use SFI, a fake industry certification that allows logging of old growth forests and doesn&#x27;t even have a tree replant requirement.  I am happy Philips is certified by the right party.</li>
    <li> The head with the blades are constructed so they don&#x27;t come apart it&#x27;s the best for this Phillips .</li>
    <li> Brings the razor back to like new... shave times cut down. I was frustrated with repeating strokes to get a clean shave, this OEM part put a smile on my face quickly.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement head.  To my front door,Nhuck and easy.</li>
    <li> I have not been pleased with the quality of any of the Phillips Norelco replacement heads I have bought. The metal used in the blades seem to be too soft because they become dull in a very short time. Mine lose their sharpness after only about 4 months of use and I have a relatively soft beard. The replacement heads and blades are very overpriced  for the short time they stay sharp. It is the same for all the Phillips Norelco replacement heads, regardless if they are for their cheapest or most expensive shavers. I found that it is cheaper to just buy the cheapest electric shaver they make and then throw it away when the blades become dull. You can buy Phillips Norelco&#x27;s lowest priced shaver for less than what just the replacement heads cost for most of their shavers.</li>
    <li> Exact product descrption</li>
    <li> Norelco is still the number one in men&#x27;s shavers and the replacement blades makes the old razor new again. Thanks to Amazon for quick and economical service.&lt;br /&gt;WF Britt</li>
    <li> The Norelco heads that I ordered were exactly what I ordered. I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old ones were until I put the new ones on. I now get a close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy a new shaver because it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. (No pun intended). But since I liked the shaver I decided to replace the head. It was long overdue since my wife bought the shaver for me about 3 years ago!  And I was wondering why it wasn&#x27;t shaving much anymore.  Duh!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it works like a champ again with the new shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably best to replace the head every year at a minimum to maximize shaver effectiveness.</li>
    <li> These blades renewed the life of my razor.  I had the original blades for over two years because I could stomach the cost of new blades( I know.... I&#x27;m cheap), but I finally pulled the trigger as a Christmas present to my self.  Much quieter and much better cut</li>
    <li> Perfect and just what my husband needed</li>
    <li> I was ready to buy this RQ11 replacement head for my Sensotouch 1150x 2D shaver when thanks to another reviewer of the RQ12 replacement heads I learned that the new RQ12 3D was a direct/perfect fit replacement upgrade from the RQ11 on my old 2D shaver. The RQ12 is a real advance over the RQ11 because each of the three blade pods flex not only to the inside, but also  outward, each independent of the other. A much better shave, even on tough neck hair. My old 1150X 2D shaver is now 3D.</li>
    <li> Totally satisfied with purchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, I found it here cheaper than at the store. It works perfect!</li>
    <li> nice item fast shipping</li>
    <li> As stated in subject, good original factory quality one can expect from the company Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For newbies (in terms of beginner shavers), just like the guy said in the consumer review video, please DO NOT shave dry...always try to shave wet and be sure to apply shaving cream every time and you will eliminate most acne-like irritations problems on your chin.</li>
    <li> It keeps falling off while shaving. I used to be a Braun user, but was looking to change, this keeps falling off and this is my third in 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is my first replacement head I have ordered for this razor. The  original head that was on the shaver when I first purchased the shaver cut the hair close and lasted a long time, very pleased. This replacement head does not cut the hair as close and has been disappointing.</li>
    <li> A realy good price for these heads - and the razor runs like new...But of course it should / the head is the only thing that wears!</li>
    <li> Have not replaced the head on this shaver since I bought it at least three years ago.  It was easy to assemble and install, and improved the shaver&#x27;s performance.  Good investment!</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about purchasing these replacement heads for my model #1190x. All of the details for the heads showed up to model #1180x without mention of my model #. I researched it as much as I could, and decided to take a chance. I&#x27;m glad that they were the correct heads for my unit. I received them a little earlier than expected, so that made the purchase all the better!</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norelco electric shaver in 40 years, and it took me awhile to figure out that if you replace the heads yearly, you will have a much better shave. I found that purchasing here was much quicker, easier, and I generally save about $10 compared to the big box stores. Each Norelco I have had has been progressively better, and now that I&#x27;m pushing 60, I realize that I should have gotten the cheapest model with the best head from the start. So my next purchase (Christmas present from my lovely wife!) will be the 9000 series (9311) which can be used wet or dry, and I should be good for another 10 years, as Philips Norelco has gotten to the point that there are no longer any big advancements to be made in electric shavers according to those in the know. Norelco is hands down the finest electric shaver made, and like any precision tool, routine maintenance (annual) will keep it working flawlessly (and your face happy) for years at a cost of about $70 annually. How can you beat that for a great shave?</li>
    <li> They just don&#x27;t stay as sharp as manufacturer claims.</li>
    <li> Works just like the original!!!</li>
    <li> Good item. Works nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the SensoTouch 2D for over a year now. I lather with shaving cream for the ultimate smooth shave. Great razors.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement head, smooth and effortless shaving even in shower.</li>
    <li> Good razor is writing well</li>
    <li> Pros: Easy to use, clean, and lasts for one year. Actually the Norelco shaver is awesome. ALL THREE HEADS WORK, not just one. It doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, and glides on making the morning dry shave experience pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A bit pricey. Also not good in the shower. (I&#x27;m talking about the whole unit, not just the head..) If you use it in the shower, it will get damaged via steam or water and short out after only 6-7 months. They should make this exact model for shower use. It would kill the competition.</li>
    <li> Bought them for my dad and uncles. They love it. well, I guess they love the razor with this head...</li>
    <li> thought it was expensive for what it is ,the whole shaver only cost $90 . and i bought that 1 year ago</li>
    <li> Good, it makes my RQ1150 just like a brand new one. I would expect the price could be a little bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> Replaced my 2+ year old shaver and the unit works like new again. Quick and easy replacement. Just pull out the old one and snap in the new one.</li>
    <li> OBVIOUSLY, WE WE HAD A DISCONNECT, ITHOUGHT I WAS OR DERING THE HEAD, THAT PLUGS INTO THE HAND HELD  BATTERY PORTION.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful</li>
    <li> Fits on my Norelco SensoTouch 1180.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have tried, of any brand.  It worked perfectly from the get go.  I have had no problems with the product and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves an excellent value.  It is built to last and is efficient as it out performs all other products like it.  You won’t regret this purchase.&lt;br /&gt; This product gets top ratings 5★s</li>
    <li> Great product and smooth sharp shave every time.</li>
    <li> Bought this replacement for the hubby and he still enjoys his razor. The price was actually a little bit cheaper than Target and Wal-Mart never had this in stock.</li>
    <li> I wish that I would have replaced my blades sooner. I have had the same blade for over a year and the company recommends replacing them every year.  Great product.</li>
    <li> required , its like a tune-up for the razor. I normally bought new razors but with this I am extending the life of the razor and getting good shaves.</li>
    <li> What a price for replacement blades!  I purchase 2 at a time, lasts me 2 years!  Or I can change every 6 months as needed!</li>
    <li> This head works as advertised, but it isn&#x27;t as well-built as these heads were when the shaver was new. To be expected, I suppose.</li>
    <li> GOOD VALUE.  AUTOMATIC ORDERING IS NICE.</li>
    <li> For some reason local retailers do not stock this replacement head tor the Norelco. I did not really need a new razor, just the head. Local retailers carried the other replacement heads but not the RQ11. I was really happy that you had it and that it was discounted..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> The replacement head for the razor worked great, glad I didnt have to buy a new razor.  Nice job Philips</li>
    <li> If this had actually been the product ordered, it would have worked fine. We later bought the correct part from a local store. However, this merchant missed the fact that someone had switched the product in the box with a different head. So much for quality control!</li>
    <li> The new head made a big difference in the performance of the razor....should replace yearly if used almost daily.</li>
    <li> Probably should have got a new Norelco shaver, even though it&#x27;s only a little over a year old. Seem to lose it&#x27;s power way too short in time. Not what they used to be.</li>
    <li> I liked my order because it came on time within a few days.  My order was not complicated but they had the right amount of supplies I ordered and the billing info was correct.</li>
    <li> The product was for a different model of shaver that was for replacing individual circular blades rather than the one that I had ordered or was shown in the picture on the sale page.  This is the first time this has happened.  Amazon was quick to refund the full amount including the ship back charges.  I could not understand how such a mistake can happen unless it was opened and repacked with the wrong item.</li>
    <li> My husband is impressed with this product, and the razor the blades go on.  He recommends using something to trim longer beard hairs, then use this on the shorter hairs, or for regular maintenance. The blades do last for a year or longer, if shaving up to three times a week.</li>
    <li> The blade wasn&#x27;t that sharp, didn&#x27;t have the same experience like when I first bought the machine. Philips is declining in quality.</li>
    <li> New blades, cleaner, closer cut.</li>
    <li> Prefect! &amp; almost next day delivered!</li>
    <li> I have used these blades before.  Very high quality.  I have been using for about 4 years now.  Would use again.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to surprise my gorgeous boyfriend  and he loves it! Me too, because now I can stoke that freshly shaved jaw every morning :-)  See, Mark, it&#x27;s not so hard to come up with 20 word review</li>
    <li> Delivery met expectations, price was right and eas of ordering</li>
    <li> The replacement heads I purchased through Amazon.com for my Norelco shaver met my expectations in both performance and quality. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> What can I say. If you like the shaving head that came with the Sensotouch 2D, then you will like these every bit as much because they are one in the same and visa versa. They are a bit less expensive here at Amazon as compared to a local store.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and gives him an extra blade to use.  He likes this razor - so am glad we can replace heads.</li>
    <li> I renew these annually as suggested by manufacturer. The Senseo Touch 2D is the best shaving system i&#x27;ve used, the replacement heads keep it that way.</li>
    <li> I have used versions of this razor for many years and as it is waterproof I always shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;This is a replacement head for sharper blades.</li>
    <li> Every thing went as planned</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement head for my shaver. I found out what number it was and found it on Amazon at a good price and ordered it.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd or 4th purchase of the RQ11. I shave daily, before showering, and clean the razor with compressed air ( no water). They work very well for the first 4 -5 months, then become dull and ineffective. I keep hoping the next one will last longer - we shall see!</li>
    <li> The new head works fine.  I broke the old one not knowing where to lift it in order to clean it.  Once it was broken, I knew what I had done and won&#x27;t repeat the mistake.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Easy plug and play for my razor. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good quality as the one that came with the shaver, but perhaps the quality of Philips decreased in 3 years</li>
    <li> GREAT price,, Works Great</li>
    <li> After only a few months, my shaver is indicated the blades need to be replaced again.</li>
    <li> It was dull and never worked better than the previous one.</li>
    <li> I was having problems with finding these.  Amazon had them at a good price and just what I needed. Fast delivery was an added plus.</li>
    <li> Fit as expected. Easy to match my existing norelco with the needed replacement head.</li>
    <li> When the head for my well used Norelco shaver broke into pieces when I took it apart to clean, I decided to buy a complete new shaver.  Later when I saw the heads at an attractive price on Amazon however, I decided to try them as the motor in my old shaver was working fine.  I snapped the new heads in place and presto, I had two Norelco shavers that provide a close shave and work great.  I use one for travel and the other in my home.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for about thirty years and I have never experienced one so easy to replace.  These are awesome.  Also, I get a much closer shave with new blades.  I know, it is expected but it is a great improvement.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, should have replaced the original  much earlier than I did.  No problem to replace, very good result.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads worked perfectly on my Phillips Norelco shaver. And it is a lot easier to order and get them in one easy move from Amazon than trying to figure out what store might stock them, call the store and be told yes we have them only to drive to the store and find out that they do have Phillips Norelco replacement heads only not the ones you wanted because the person responsible for maintaining inventory at the store was not able to keep up with the inventory levels and let the inventory on this item run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several electric razors, but this Norelco is the only one that comes close to a shaver quality, in an electric.</li>
    <li> I think these things last about a year. I buy them for my dad.</li>
    <li> The only thing that could be better is the price. Everything else was perfect.</li>
    <li> Great Value on replacement!</li>
    <li> The RQ11 is the correct set of replacement blades for my 1150 Norelco razor and it works well.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know if im doing anything wrong i tried eveything stil don&#x27;t cut</li>
    <li> perfect fit.exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent, excellent, excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised - excellent service</li>
    <li> It fit perfectly and it was simple to install.  I also received the package promptly in the mail.  It was a simple replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he was very pleased.  It fit the razor perfectly and it was exactly like the first one.  Smoooth shave.  Yes, I certainly would recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> It just simply delivers. That&#x27;s why I keep buying this product</li>
    <li> Not sure why but the head that came with the original shaver was much better. This one almost seems like a cheaper version.</li>
    <li> Hey, these worked out really well for my husband and were much more affordable than buying a new razor.  Easy to replace.</li>
    <li> Because it is a excellence product It cut bread close Good Good  Very good replacement head for my  sensor touch 2D</li>
    <li> Works well. Surprising how much better a sharper blade woks.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price</li>
    <li> It works as expected.  Thanks</li>
    <li> My decision was to purchase a new shaver OR replace the shaver head.  Now My husband&#x27;s shaver is as good as new and he&#x27;s pleased with the money I saved on this quality item.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with replacement blade.  Have used the shaver for nearly 2 years and find there is a difference in new blades.  Delivery in a timely manner and best price I could find.</li>
    <li> I have used the same blades for so long, that I forgot how good new blades feel!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t wait this long next time!!!</li>
    <li> no longer getting a burn on neck, guess it was time to change.  This makes it easy, the entire surface comes ready to pop in.</li>
    <li> good&lt;br /&gt; look like orginel</li>
    <li> I ordered this item originally and got exactly what I wanted.  The RQ11 replacement heads for my Norelco razor.  Since this model tends to go dull sooner than my previous razors, I setup the automatic delivery service to send me another set at the 4 month interval.  New heads arrived on December 4th and all appeared well.  Norelco&#x27;s Razor Head packaging is sealed, but only internally.  I used the Heads and had poor shaving performance, but know there is an adjustment period with each cycle.  After several very painful injuries of actually cutting or shaving the top layer of skin off in one instance, I had to very thoroughly investigate what was going on.  I have never previously had issues with injury on any of my Norelco razors.  The heads appear to be crafted nearly identically, and as such, I am wondering if someone placed the sealed case into the wrong exterior box.  The heads I received say \\&quot;Dual Precision\\&quot; on the cover and not the \\&quot;8-Series\\&quot; as matches the picture and would be expected.  If this is a knockoff, it is very well done as the machining is almost identical save for different metal appears to have been used.  I have tried looking at other Norelco replacement heads but see none that match the ones that were shipped in my last order.</li>
    <li> Replaced entire shaver head and shaver works like new. Original head lasted 10 - 11 months. Much better than previous shavers.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a future repalcement as the original blades are working fine. I did install it and shaved with it once and it did not seem to give a closer shave than my year old original heads.It was about the same.</li>
    <li> Nice to not worry about re-ordering when the blades get dull.  Can&#x27;t use same baldes forever...</li>
    <li> Works fine with my razor but what happened to the 3D heads?</li>
    <li> For the price these last close to a year for face only, about 4-6 months since i shave my head everyday.</li>
    <li> The goods is very good, very good use. Satisfaction. Just logistics slowly.</li>
    <li> FINALLY A CLEAN SHAVE</li>
    <li> I received my SensoTouch 2D Shaver as a Christmas present last year (Dec. 2011). The original head didn&#x27;t wear out as of yet, but I tapped on it too many times to remove facial hair from it and the green plastic holder came loose. I ordered a new Philips Norelco RQ11 Replacement Head in late July and it&#x27;s been working very well. The shaver is almost like new again. However, I did glue the plastic holder onto the old head with multi-purpose cement and it will now serve as a backup to the new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon shipped the new one quickly, and it was packaged a bit loose, but there was no damage to the shaver head. The price was more than I expected, but Amazon was cheaper than other sellers, and I really hope I don&#x27;t need to buy one every year. I gave it 4 stars due to the price (Philips Norelco), which was more than half of what I&#x27;m sure was paid for the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more note: I bought a spray can of Remington Shaver Saver (the only brand I found) at a local store. It cleans and lubricates the shaver&#x27;s blades and head, and it seems to help quite a bit. I use the spray whenever the shaver needs to be recharged.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t use it but looks good.I love it .Hope it will be a  very nice replacement for my husband&#x27;s shaver.</li>
    <li> For some reason, replacement heads aren&#x27;t as sharp as the original ones. Not sure what the problem is, since it&#x27;s the second time that I&#x27;ve ordered these and they seemed to have the same issue.</li>
    <li> my razors works great now thanks</li>
    <li> Worked perfect.  Snapped right on, husband can use his expensive razor again.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Excellent!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve needed a new shaving head for the last 5 years. Cuts like new.</li>
    <li> Razor is like new again.</li>
    <li> This was a direct replacement for the head that I had.  I believe the old one was shaving as close as the new one, which is more a testament to their quality.  I had to replace the old one as I had punched a hole in two of the screens, which turns out not to be good on your face.  The screens got damaged by my neglect and not from normal usage.</li>
    <li> The replacement head was easily ordered, and it arrived promptly. Installation is simple. Product is in keeping with Norelco reputation of quality products.</li>
    <li> the bomb thanks I am smoother than a babys bottom</li>
    <li> Great product.  Excellent shaving</li>
    <li> Although necessary - these replacements are perfect and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my shave!</li>
    <li> Performs well but is noisy</li>
    <li> Somewhat of an improvement. However my Norelco does not provide nearly as close a shave as the Remington foil type shaver I recently purchased. No electric shaver is &#x27;perfect&#x27;.</li>
    <li> My husband only buys the best and uses the best and it was such a good buy for the money</li>
    <li> I love the senso touch shaver, and a new head is good every 9 mos.  The plastic retainer wire that holds the blades in failed for the&lt;br /&gt;first time.  This is my third.  I can still make it work by aligning the blades upside down then snapping it shut.  Cleaning is more of a&lt;br /&gt;chore now because the plastic ring that holds the blades in- will not secure to the posts inside.</li>
    <li> Shaver works as good as new forgot how well this shaver performed</li>
    <li> Brought my shaver of 4 years back to a new condition way cheaper than just buying a new model, it is worth a 4 year replacement of the heads,</li>
    <li> Phillips consistently produce excellent quality and I continue to be a very satisfied customer. They are excellent in customer service and prompt in sending parts required.</li>
    <li> So if you want the Perfect shave get these puppies....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they slide across your face so smooth, you won&#x27;t even notice they are there!</li>
    <li> my old head for my shaver was feeling dull and now this new head makes the shaver feel like it is new.</li>
    <li> We bought replacement of inbuilt shaver head. I like it, and look for more products from Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for friends.</li>
    <li> The head replacements are perfect; however my problem lay deeper. I thought I was getting the entire head assembly wherein my problem lay. There are 3 tiny hex bolt heads which cause the heads to spin. Two of the three hex bolt lost there hex head leaving two of the three heads stationary.</li>
    <li> love the feel of it. not too expensive and it is the thing i needed. the 3 shaver heads is the best fit.</li>
    <li> My husband has had this trimmer for years and never replaced the blades.  This works so much better with new blades.</li>
    <li> good replacmeent blade - works like original</li>
    <li> This is a great way to renew your shaver.  I replaced the head and it&#x27;s like getting a new shaver for a fraction of the cost.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have to shave my husband as his hands shake so bad.  I couldn&#x27;t get a good shave and then read the heads need to be replaced every year.  I replaced the head and now get a much smoother shave.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and was the right item</li>
    <li> Works just great, better than buying a new razor for sure.</li>
    <li> I did not realize how bad my year old plus blades were, until I replaced them. Razor is working like new again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was needing. Fit perfectly with the model razor and the blades were refreshingly sharp compared to what I was using.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my shaver. Works like new again.</li>
    <li> I bought these to have as a back up for my shaver.  It will probably be a year before I use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very good buy.</li>
    <li> I hate buying replacement heads for my razor but it is a necessity. They are pricey but Amazon is the cheapest place to buy them. I even had a $5 off coupon to use in a retail store and Amazon was cheaper even after the coupon. I have to use an electric razor because my skin is so rough but lately I have been trying to use a regular razor as much as possible so that I can limit the use of my electric razor and maybe prolong the razor head.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Met my needs.</li>
    <li> Works great, at half the price we paid 18 months ago for a 2-pack.</li>
    <li> This came with the complete head &amp; not just replacement blades for the razer.  We were pleasantly surprised &amp; would purchase again!</li>
    <li> So glad my old ones clogged as I wasn&#x27;t even aware these should be changed every year.  These were a great price and work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are nice. fit perfectly, it is what it is and a lot cheaper on here than at the department store. will buy again or a new shaver</li>
    <li> was just what we needed.  thank you</li>
    <li> Very Good, but not has sharp as new. Will buy again. All replacement shaver heads are over priced. Most brands its cheaper to buy a new shaver.</li>
    <li> These replacement bodes re a little more expensive than necessary if you ask me. Still better than buying a new unit but I prefer the Braun unit I had before. Seemed like it shaved closer and fluid and blades were cheaper</li>
    <li> The original heads did not last one year.  The original failed because the razor quit making them turn.  The reason they failed to turn was the design.  The heads have a plastic cog that is suppose to fit into a cog on the razor but the plastic tends to fail.  These replacements do not work as well as the originals.  The two sets of cogs don&#x27;t fit together that well so the heads frequently fail to turn.</li>
    <li> I needed new blades. It ddoes not seem any better than before though. I can&#x27;t afford to keep buying different razors so I have nothign to compare it to. Disposable razors work far better than this device.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized just how dull my blades were until I replaced them. The new blades shave much closer in less time. Wet shaving with shaving cream yields a shave as close as a blade with no cuts. Good for shaving my head too.</li>
    <li> The heads were exactly what I wanted, just like the original. They give me the same close shave as the original, no break.in.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Was new in the box. Was simple to replace the head. I am sure we will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Expensive but they aren&#x27;t cheaper elsewhere and they work great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, price and speedy delivery from Amazon.  This was a once a year replacement for the electric razor. It was originally purchased as well from Amazon and I have found it of great value.</li>
    <li> I thought with a fresh set of blades that the shave would be closer.  Not the case. Very disappointing and I will not order another set of new blades when the time comes.  I may be switching shaver brands in the near future.  The Norelco looks good, handles well and conforms to the face.  When it comes to cutting, well that is another story. I like shaving with an electric because it is no hassel, but if I&#x27;m not getting the close cut then changes will have to be made. It can not compare to a safety razor and soap.There are a few more Electrics on the market, maybe I will try them out.  I think Norelco needs a wake up call.  The Shaver costs 189.00.  I think it should shave better than it does.  Does anyone feel the same out there.</li>
    <li> I have been using my new blades and I am getting good shaves.</li>
    <li> Sharp and gives you a good clean shave.</li>
    <li> Dad dropped his razor and this head gave it new life. A great price also.</li>
    <li> Easy install,  works great</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I will buy again. Can&#x27;t beat Norelco.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly and delivered promptly.  Good price.</li>
    <li> It works as well as the last one I purchased through retail store.</li>
    <li> Never use it , still using the original one , for like a year or more, shaving great.</li>
    <li> Seems to have done the job. The first time you replace this head on your shaver you&#x27;ll notice right away. It is easy to replace it too. So no problem at all!</li>
    <li> great to have new blades.</li>
    <li> The shipment was prompt and exactly as ordered. Unfortunately, the overall quality of the razor was little improved.</li>
    <li> They work as expected and do the job.  Nuff said!</li>
    <li> Your shaver is new again. Good price.</li>
    <li> Expensive and short-lived!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Genuine Norelco head.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Works perfect.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product.  Product came apart while cleaning razor after first use - heads do not lock in place. Upon inspection and comparison with old shaving head - some parts are defective.</li>
    <li> They seem to be quality replacements for the cutting head on my razor.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> These heads don&#x27;t even last three months. We&#x27;ll try another razor. My husband has been a fan of the Norelco electrics since I bought his first about eight years ago, and they seem to last about four years, but this one has been very unsatisfactory-no power and the heads not lasting.</li>
    <li> Great and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Same as the original and work well to smooth out the rough beard.  Work well with or without water.  Recommend if you have the Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> Great blades, nice and sharp. My old blades were pulling my hair instead of cutting it. Norelco says you should order new blades every year and now I know why.</li>
    <li> New as described. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Very happy w/the Phillips replacement head, was a little confusing finding the right head for my shaver. Was very easy putting it on my shaver, just pops right on. Sharp too, cuts my husband whiskers like a breeze.</li>
    <li> Great product. And service&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Shaver head, just as I expected.</li>
    <li> I have tried other but this one is the best for me. I would  suggest this to anyone. Great product</li>
    <li> I noticed the immediate difference! Now I am baby bottom soft again! I have no stubble left at all, great shave.</li>
    <li> Last between 8 to 12 months and fits most Philips Norelcos</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement after using my other for about 13 months.  The change was much needed and the new replacement head give me a better shave.</li>
    <li> It came quickly and my boyfriend was really happy with it. The old one was good for 3 year but that came with the shaver itself so we will see how the replacement holds up.</li>
    <li> Great replacement and just poped it in.</li>
    <li> Nice one ,not better price.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, the part was an identical replacement for the original.</li>
    <li> These do not seem to cut as well as the original that came on the shaver. I expected them to work as well.</li>
    <li> Genuine Norelco product, brought back precision cutting to razor.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t actually a complete replacement part.  My shaver head broke, and this isn&#x27;t the part that broke.  It&#x27;s the part that was still fine.  It see,s like there&#x27;s very little point in providing replacement for the part that still works when the entire removable replacement head is the thing people will actually need.  Guess I&#x27;ll find another shaver company.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years - great shaves!</li>
    <li> sharp knives but after one use, the plastic inside that holds the blades came off and won&#x27;t stay in place...  cheap manufacture</li>
    <li> I received the shipment on time. Worked like it is supposed to for closed to 2 months and then it wasnt any better than the old head that i replaced. I used the previous two heads for almost 12 months each. Hmmmm so does that mean i bought a used and refinished product? I am not sure if its an issue with Philips or the seller.  Lost confidence on my Norelco, am back to Gillette :( .</li>
    <li> Since installing the new heads, I have not been able to get a decent shave. After several years of very good performance I had to buy a new razor to get an adequate shave. I feel that I threw my money away by purchasing these heads and will probably not buy another Norelco product.</li>
    <li> Terrific replacement for the original.</li>
    <li> I used to replace the three-year head, easy to use.</li>
    <li> i buy new when i received it was used and dirty. i am Disappointed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a real set of made by Norelco replacement heads for your razor. Cheaper than buying a new razor. Watch the price on these. They seem to vary quite a bit as sales come and go. Unless you simply lost your old heads, this is something you can watch for a bit to get a good deal on.</li>
    <li> A little expensive for replacement head i have to replace every year...3 pcs equals a brand new shaver... ;o</li>
    <li> Priced right;fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied with product</li>
    <li> performed as advertised.</li>
    <li> perfect factory fit and operation</li>
    <li> Right set cut much better.  Cost for blades was best price but still half cost of complete razor.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco RQ11 Replacement Head for SensoTouch 2D. This item should be replaced at least annually if not more often.</li>
    <li> I was expecting just the blades for the price I paid. When the whold head ws in the box, I was extremely happy. Great bang for my buck.</li>
    <li> If you ever shopped for a head replacement you know they make a ton of models. Amazon supplied enough information that made my replacement razor head easy. Works just like brand new.</li>
    <li> works as advertised.  I bought this as a replacement for the heads that were 2 years old, so of course it works much better.</li>
    <li> What I would have got downtowb only  this was a few dollars cheaper...  I will order this when I need a new replacwmwnt.</li>
    <li> Norelco recommends replacement yearly. After head replacement the razor works better but I still need a blade to clean up around my jaw where the electric doesn&#x27;t cut close enough around curves or loose skin.</li>
    <li> A new set of heads is almost a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;These heads fit with no problems and last as well as the original one.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my third set and the razor works as if it were new.&lt;br /&gt;Changing heads is not problem either.&lt;br /&gt;The old ones pop off and the new ones pop on.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades do not shave as well as the original blades that came with the razor...in fact the original blades gave the same if not better shave than the new replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Thank heavens you had in stock. Dad is 90 yrs old and loves his shaver. We couldn&#x27;t find replacement in any dept or drug store.</li>
    <li> Liked the price and quick availability.</li>
    <li> It was like I got a brand new razor when  I put these in.  New and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and works just like the first one. and stays sharp for longer then the 12 month replacement recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the second RQ11 Replacement Head for Senso Touch 2D.  It does a satisfactory job and I have little else to compare it with.</li>
    <li> The older design was superior for me.  See other review under Norelco SensaTouch. It is sensitive because it never touches the hard spots.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift to my friends. I like it but I don&#x27;t know how good it works. it is ok.</li>
    <li> Alot of force and angling is required to get a complete clean shave..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does a very good job of shaving the neck area though..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the upper lip and lower lip requires quite abit of finesse to obtain a clean shave..</li>
    <li> Direct factory replacement, nothing bad about it.</li>
    <li> Great way to save money compared to buying at local store.  Same as I would get in local store.</li>
    <li> It works great Just like a new razor</li>
    <li> It met my specifications  Thanks</li>
    <li> These replacement heads work very well and I have had no problems</li>
    <li> I was shocked when I opened the package as I was expecting to replace the blades and foils.  It&#x27;s the whole assembly all ready to be put on the razor.  My old one I had to remove the head, remove the retainer, remove the blades and foils and reverse the procedure.  This one you take one head off like you were going to rinse out the razor and ut the new one on... couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
    <li> They work exactly like the originals.</li>
    <li> still cutting work great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor for about two years, the blades started getting a little dull. Ordered the replacement blades and received them in two days. The heads were very easy to replace took about 10 seconds, razor is still as good as new.</li>
    <li> Have been using Norelco for many years. Happy with product.</li>
    <li> Nothing like a clean shave again! I&#x27;ve been a Norelco Man since I was 16 years old. I&#x27;m now 59 1/2 and still love the product.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for fast and it was exactly what I needed and wanted.</li>
    <li> perfect replacement  an at a better price then other place including Norelco</li>
    <li> Unfortunately for norelco, I really dislike this shaver, and these heads seem to do nothing.  Sure, it shaves my face, what shaver over $20 can&#x27;t? But this does a less-than-acceptable job on my neck.  Every use, it frustrates me, and when I want to look good, I need to use a razor.  I absolutely would not recommend the sensotouch or spending the money on these replacement heads.  Save yourself the trouble and buy another shaver.</li>
    <li> Makes the razor feel like new!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only purchased two sets of these and I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with them. Once a year replacement is recommended.</li>
    <li> A very good product at a fair price.  Quick handling/delivery.</li>
    <li> Worked great - all of the stores I visited did not have this in stock.  I went to five different stores.</li>
    <li> It fits the razor. However, maybe it is just me, it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooths and doesn&#x27;t shave as effective and clean as the original head that came with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price isn&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
    <li> Little pricey but good razor</li>
    <li> Once I figured out which one - there are literally loads of replacement head parts - the head worked like a dream. I saved the package  for the next time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s little bit  expensive for me</li>
    <li> Happy with product, but not with the durability. Does not last as long as I would expect, but works well otherwise.</li>
    <li> does not include base that blades click to.... i stupidly threw out the whole piece thinking they send a bottom piece as well.... i&#x27;m giving this three stars for them not making that expressly clear. plus i feel stupid for doing it.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re razor blades not much to say</li>
    <li> I got the wrong one, I thought that was the one my husband said to get.  Its open, so I don&#x27;t think I can exchange it.</li>
    <li> Really bad shopping experience. I just received a empty box with no head inside.</li>
    <li> I had thought that I read that there were two replacement shaver heads instead I had received only 1. Somewhat disappointed in that.  The shaver head works fine, and Amazon service and delivery was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter A. Garofalo</li>
    <li> Bought my shaver on Jan/2012 by Amazon (description says it is 1150X/40).&lt;br /&gt;I think blades are still ok (not as new, of course)&lt;br /&gt;Lost a small green plastic triangle, that fix blades in place inside the head.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this item because description says HEAD (I needed the head, not just the blades)&lt;br /&gt;Received a box with 3 blades and their metallic covers, that are different from my original ones. I don&#x27;t know if I could adapt then to my shaver but it wouldn&#x27;t be an easy task due to the several differences I see (and I am a skilled consumer of electronic gadgets)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the head is the part that contains the blades and is a closed space (the bottom connects to the body, and the top touches my face when shaving, the 3 blades come in between, fixed by the green plastic triangle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I suggested Amazon changed description to REPLACEMENT BLADES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my shaver&#x27;s body I can see (it is almost completely faded) that I should use shaving unit RQ11 (this item?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solved the wrong purchase with Amazon (always a great consumer experience) but now I don&#x27;t know what to do to get new blades for my shaver (when needed) and to replace the lost part (buy a new shaver? :( )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Apr 30, 2013 - On a recent trip to US I tried my luck and bought again this same RQ11 blades (that didn´t work for me before). What it happened? This time I got a whole head that fit perfectly to my shaver!!! The explanation? On the first time somebody must have changed the content of the blades box, so the blades I received were from a different kind of shaver. A RQ11 box with different blades inside.&lt;br /&gt;Almost completely happy now, unless by the new blades performance, as they doesn´t seem to be so efficient as the ones that came with the shaver.</li>
    <li> We were not sure it the replacement blades would be as good as the orginal; however, no complaints here. They are just like the orginals, easy to install and working great. Don&#x27;t buy a new shaver, replace the blades! You will be happy with your order!</li>
    <li> if you liked the original then youll like the replacement.</li>
    <li> Made  a huge difference.  If your Norelco is over a year old, go ahead and replace the head.  Smoother shave, just like new!!!</li>
    <li> great price! cheaper than Walmart ect- great shave with new a head- then is not much more to say- works great!</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s with my shaver and dose a good job.</li>
    <li> Saifisfied with product for the price .  Was ok as expected  ok  ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok</li>
    <li> Always a good review.</li>
    <li> Am getting a very close shave with this product.  Expect it to last for one year.</li>
    <li> This came in the original manufacturers box as shown in the picture.  No different then what you would get in the store.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it provides a close shave, but not sure if it is the blade or the actual razor design.</li>
    <li> Replacement was easy.</li>
    <li> Replacement fit perfectly and gave a smooth and close shave.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these replacement heads for my shaver at any retail store and even went to there web store and they said they where out of stock.</li>
    <li> the quality is not as the original one which came with the Senso Touch 2D</li>
    <li> razor is working just as good as it did when it was first purchased at only a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> This replacement head is like an ink cartridge for a printer, it needs to be replace way too often.  At 4 months per, that&#x27;s 3 a year.&lt;br /&gt;I threw out the razor, because the replacement heads cost more than the razor, every year.</li>
    <li> just a good product, was just as expected good quality and did a good job of shaving,was easy to install.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco RQ11 Replacement Head for SensoTouch 2D are just what I needed for my shaver to keep it sharp.</li>
