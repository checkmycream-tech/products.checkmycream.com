      <li>I am always looking for organic/chemical-free/natural products for a better living</li>

      <li>It feels like it doesn&#x27;t clean at all!</li>
      <li>I love the Renpure Originals gluten free products.</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to gluten, this is a great shampoo.</li>
      <li>this product is hands down one of the best conditioners I have ever used on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fine with it.  </li>
      <li>the smell was fine with me, it was light and fresh...not overly flowery.</li>
      <li>As a huge fan of organic products, this conditioner is a plus in my books.</li>
      <li>I need a conditioner for severe tangle management and this one is fantastic</li>
      <li>My hair is baby soft, completely detangled and the scent is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited about trying this conditioner along with the  shampoo as the ones with lots of chemicals tend to make my head itch.  </li>
      <li>To be organic with all natural ingridients makes it a great choice for those who prefer natural products :)))</li>
      <li>I can no longer buy it at the drugstore where I originally found it.</li>
      <li>great &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; for very long tangly hair.</li>
      <li>and I liked the price compared to ones in natural stores</li>
      <li>This smells terrific and gives good moisture to my hair without making it greasy.</li>
      <li>So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>because the store I work at currently does NOT carry my beloved Suave Professionals Almond and Shea Butter conditioner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing to my hair and leaves it smooth and easy to comb through.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this shampoo a dozen times and this time it is evident that something is different, and not in a good way</li>
      <li>My Pretty Hair is Parched!</li>
      <li>My Pretty Hair is Parched!</li>
      <li>conditioner really does leave your heair silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>I dont buy salon brand products, but I often switch between a few great kinds, herbal essence, aussie and pantene.  </li>
      <li>After using the Shampoo this really helps smooth out my hair</li>
      <li>This really doesn&#x27;t qualify as all natural, but it&#x27;s a nice compromise.</li>
      <li>and I have never EVER had my hair feel so soft, light, and airy!  </li>
      <li>I love this smell and the way feels not heavy after conditioning it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice this to be any better than some regular conditioner you could pick up on the cheap at wal-mart or something.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>To make it right, you owe me four bottles.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve found the right one.</li>
      <li>The only thing we&#x27;re not overly fond of is the scent - it is VERY strong.</li>
      <li>I found this product at my local Meijer when I was pregnant and looking for safe items to use on my hair and body.</li>
      <li>have very fine, very coarse 2c/3a hair.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;and leaves it soft and pliable - easy to pump out of container</li>
      <li>The best part is it works just as well, if not better, than the bigger brands out there like Garnier or Pantene ProV.</li>
      <li>Gluten free shampoo that leaves hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>(sounds like a weird idea, but once I got over the strangeness of the idea it turned out to be the best hair decision I ever made).  </li>
      <li>First of all, I have to say...</li>
      <li>I scrub my scalp pretty vigorously with conditioner on my fingertips in the shower to get rid of any dirt or particles or whatever.  </li>
      <li>Thank you amazon for always having what I need, and thank you Renpure for making a safe product I can use on my entire family!</li>
      <li>Paired with the Shampoo this left my hair smelling fruity and feeling even better.</li>
      <li>I love the product, but was short changed three bottles from my most recent order.  </li>
      <li>But unfortunately not for my hair.</li>
      <li>I used this and my hair feels light soft, and shinny like you came out of the salon.</li>
      <li>a fine product, i just dont see it to be worth extra cash.</li>
      <li>looks good, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, works good - if you&#x27;re looking for an organic conditioner, I wouldn&#x27;t look anywhere else.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am really happy with this conditioner, it leaves my hair feeling moisturized, but not oily.  The smell is awesome.  When I bought this I was in search of something that would give my hair a drink it was soooo dry.  I have longer, thick, fine hair.  This stuff has done some wonders.  I am happy!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to say...this product is hands down one of the best conditioners I have ever used on my hair.  I have long hair ( about to the middle of my back ) that is extremely thick.  My hair always ends up tangled, the ends are dry and I have a lot of breakage.  I dont buy salon brand products, but I often switch between a few great kinds, herbal essence, aussie and pantene.  I bought this on a whim after reading the reviews about how soft it makes your hair and I am more than thrilled with this product!  I immediately noticed a difference when using this product.  Typically after washing my hair and putting it up in a towel for about 15 minutes, my hair is very heavy and still has a lot of water and moisture in it.  That is not the case with this!  After about 3 minutes, I took the towel out and I have never EVER had my hair feel so soft, light, and airy!  It does not feel weighed down at all and this is the softest it has EVER been.  Typically the only time I can run my fingers through my hair all day is when I take a straightener to it.  Not with this though!  My hair is baby soft, completely detangled and the scent is wonderful.  If you have a lot of hair or have a problem with dry hair or it being a tangled mess, I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This review is somewhat in response to other reviews. I have searched and tried every organic conditioner and shampoo out there. They all leave my curly hair looking like straw after a few weeks.  This product is the most moisturizing I have found. it&#x27;s great. It has a pleasant fragrance.  One reviewer is incorrect in that the EWG rating on this is a 4 (not 5), and all the ingredients EXCEPT fragrance are 3 or lower. All of the 3&#x27;s are 3&#x27;s because of contamination concerns.  The company claims all the ingredients are 100% certified organic. So, if you believe that, then there shouldn&#x27;t be much issues with contamination.  I&#x27;m sure there are many safer products with one or two ingredients. But if your hair is parched and curly frizzy from them, try this for a while. I&#x27;ve tried their other products too, no problems yet, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to pretty much everything with fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I only purchased Renpure Organics My Pretty Hair is Parched! Moisturizing conditioner because the store I work at currently does NOT carry my beloved Suave Professionals Almond and Shea Butter conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that I had waited till after work to drive over to Family Dollar General and pick up the Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super fine and very long hair that frizzes up and breaks easily if it&#x27;s not SUPER moisturized. Fine and long hair doesn&#x27;t soak up moisture like thicker and shorter hair tends to. Since using the Renpure, my hair has gone back to feeling super dry, brittle, and frizzy, and it knots up easily, worse than before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Suave Professionals Almond and Shea Butter, and chucking this bottle in the trash. It is by far the WORST conditioner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo and conditioner for every day use. I got tired of the way my hair felt using cheap shampoo you get at the store. I used this and my hair feels light soft, and shinny like you came out of the salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this shampoo a dozen times and this time it is evident that something is different, and not in a good way :S it&#x27;s as though it has been watered down, the shampoo and conditioner is not thick like the bottles I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about trying this conditioner along with the  shampoo as the ones with lots of chemicals tend to make my head itch.  It has a nice smell but whether it is the shampoo or the conditioner my hair is left with that little heavy oily feel to it.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! MY hair is naturally curly and fairly thick and tends to dry out easilly since i straighten my hair A LOT.  Therefore, finding a natural conditioner that actually does a good job moisturizing my hair is tough, but I really like this conditioner. It&#x27;s safe for color-treated hair (like mine) which is also a plus and it&#x27;s natural, organic, and free of gluten and lots of other nasty stuff.  :)</li>
    <li> They claim to be organic, and lead you to believe everything to put in this product is \\&quot;safe\\&quot;. I promise you it is not. Among the lengthy list of junk they put in this crap and market it as organic, they include quaternium-17 which is a known cancer causing agent. On the cosmetic database this product is given a safety rating (0being VERY safe and no risk and 10being very dangerous) it got a 5... which is just as terrible as any other off brand shampoo and conditioner at your local store. I cant justify the price for the product, and I think its terrible they try and label this an organic product when its FULL of chemicals.</li>
    <li> great &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; for very long tangly hair. Love it! I need a conditioner for severe tangle management and this one is fantastic</li>
    <li> I am always looking for organic/chemical-free/natural products for a better living and I liked the price compared to ones in natural stores and it&#x27;s a local brand where I live, so I&#x27;m helping out the community too! My hair feel soft and it smells good, so I&#x27;ll consider this brand again!</li>
    <li> I love the Renpure Originals gluten free products. My 13 and 8 year old daughters use it and have beautiful hair. Our hair dresser comments on how well our hair and scalp look.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier ... unless it was Renpure Organics My Savvy Hair Needs Sleek! Smoothing Conditioner</li>
    <li> Gluten free shampoo that leaves hair feeling soft and moisturized. I tried this at a friend&#x27;s house and bought some for myself later that day. It&#x27;s tough to find shampoo and conditioner that are labeled \\&quot;gluten free\\&quot;. And, when you do, they are typically upwards of $20 a piece, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the very reasonable prices of these Ren Pure products.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Makes my dry frizzy hair soft. My sister tried it, loved it, and now uses this in her hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for about 3 years. I have given it as gifts and the  recipients love it also. Hopefully they will continue to make and sell it. I can no longer buy it at the drugstore where I originally found it. Thank you Amazon for carrying it.</li>
    <li> Been using Renpure for years and years.only shampoo and conditioner I use....love that it can be on subscribe and save</li>
    <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
    <li> It was inexpensive. I actually liked it a lot. I have to rotate conditioners and have a super complex hair issue that is very high maintenance but this is fine a few days a week or for travel. It smells great. The red is better than the orange for my hair which is fine and dry</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to gluten, this is a great shampoo. Free of many harsh chemicals so it is safe for your color, but at the same time out performs all the natural hair care products I&#x27;ve found. This really doesn&#x27;t qualify as all natural, but it&#x27;s a nice compromise.</li>
    <li> I found this product at my local Meijer when I was pregnant and looking for safe items to use on my hair and body. This smells terrific and gives good moisture to my hair without making it greasy. Meijer stopped carrying this so I had to search for it online. Thank you amazon for always having what I need, and thank you Renpure for making a safe product I can use on my entire family!</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry, and I had a difficult time finding a good moisturizing conditioner. This brand works for me. I use it along with the shampoo, and my hair feels and looks a lot better!</li>
    <li> My daughter has hair that is curly, frizzy, and ultra dry. This conditioner works wonders for her. We go through a lot of conditioner - at least 2 bottles a month on average. That&#x27;s how dry her hair is - like the Sahara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner has amazing slip (that&#x27;s what lets you detangle with ease and makes your hair \\&quot;slippery\\&quot;) and it moisturizes very well. There are no silicone&#x27;s in it which is great for us as we are a cone free household (we don&#x27;t use harsh sulfate shampoo&#x27;s either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent conditioner for the money. The only thing we&#x27;re not overly fond of is the scent - it is VERY strong. It does fade once in your hair though but it&#x27;s enough to take a star off for me considering I have a teen who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like conditioner. Two thumbs up (unless you are scent sensitive)!</li>
    <li> Worst shampoo and conditioner ever, made hair so dry that it started falling out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice this to be any better than some regular conditioner you could pick up on the cheap at wal-mart or something.&lt;br /&gt;Its a fine product, i just dont see it to be worth extra cash.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems to be gentle on the scalp and those of us who have sensitive scalps understand the importance of that!</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Curly Girl Method approved. It works great for my kinky curls! My husband even said &amp;#34;Mmm you smell good&amp;#34;. :)</li>
    <li> Recently switched to Organics.  This conditioner is awesome.  My hair is sooooo damaged from years of highlights, blow drying and flat ironing.  This conditioner is great and really helping on my road to recovery with my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has made all the difference in the world for my curly hair. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. I&#x27;ve always had a mane of unmanageably dry, frizzy, curly hair that I couldn&#x27;t ever seem to make friends with.  For about a year now, I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner alone when I wash my hair, and the difference is like night and day.  I was so disappointed when they stopped selling it at my local grocery store that I followed it online.  If they ever stop selling it on Amazon, I&#x27;ll track it down wherever I can and keep buying it because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;--It&#x27;s all organic with no harsh, drying, damaging ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;--It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  In fact, my hair is more manageable now than it&#x27;s ever been before.  It doesn&#x27;t frizz as much, and it maintains its curl better.&lt;br /&gt;--It&#x27;s a great detangler.  I finger comb my hair in the shower while I have conditioner in, and the strands just slide right past each other without catching.  Since I started using this conditioner, my problems with tangles have completely disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;--My hair is stronger and doesn&#x27;t break anymore.  I can actually feel and see the difference even if I take just one strand of hair between my fingers and look at it.  It&#x27;s smoother and stronger than before.&lt;br /&gt;--It smells good.  I saw a review where someone complained about the scent.  I guess that&#x27;s a matter of taste, but I really like it.  My hair smells good all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get these results, I stopped using shampoo altogether (sounds like a weird idea, but once I got over the strangeness of the idea it turned out to be the best hair decision I ever made).  I scrub my scalp pretty vigorously with conditioner on my fingertips in the shower to get rid of any dirt or particles or whatever.  I rinse that out, then finger comb this conditioner all through my hair from end to end, without rinsing.  Then I use an alcohol-free spray gel to set the curl and air dry.  That&#x27;s it.  Easiest hair regimen ever, best results I ever had.  Maybe this wouldn&#x27;t work as well with another hair type, but if you have thick, unruly, thirsty curls like mine you should try it.  It has been a complete game changer for me.  Thank you, Renpure.</li>
    <li> maybe its just me but this smells like chemicals. i gave it away to a friend with a less sensitive nose</li>
    <li> This product did not perform on my hair as expected from other reviews.  I have very long fine hair &amp; had a tangled mess, though it evidently works well for others.</li>
    <li> I had bought this bottle on a whim--it was on sale and I needed conditioner. The fragrance of the conditioner is nice and stays with your hair, which I like. The fact that it is organic was a real draw, too.  The best part is it works just as well, if not better, than the bigger brands out there like Garnier or Pantene ProV. My hair was just bleached and had felt parched for the last month. Switching over to this brand, after using another brand&#x27;s organic conditioner, I noticed I can actually feel a difference when I run my hands through my hair!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells awesome, doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair, and leaves it silky smooth. Without all the added garbage of other hair care products, RenPure Organics makes amazing products that work, and work gently.</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft and shiny. To be organic with all natural ingridients makes it a great choice for those who prefer natural products :)))</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product....the smell was fine with me, it was light and fresh...not overly flowery. And though it didn&#x27;t seem to strip my hair as most natural/organic poos/conditioners do....the second day of use i found my scalp all flaky and my ends just frazzled looking, no amount of their conditioner or other products seemed able to rehydrate my poor hair and scalp. My hair is parched and then was even more parched after using both the shampoo and conditioner sadly :(</li>
    <li> This conditioner was suggested as a rinse out for the curly girl method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this conditioner. Absolutely love it. The conditioner is thick and rich .. But unfortunately not for my hair. I tried it as both a rinse out and a leave in, and even tried it as a co-wash. It just doesn&#x27;t give my hair the slip it needs to not mat up, and it was way too thick to use as a co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, very coarse 2c/3a hair. It&#x27;s a pain to find product that works. This has been retired to leg shaving because it smells SO GOOD.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is good I would order it again</li>
    <li> I am so gad I found this brand! I have been straightening and curling my hair a ton for years and this definitely helps with the damage. And it doesnt have all the harmful chemicals in them that I try to avoid. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars only because I need to use quite a bit of it in my hair. My hair is only just past shoulder length but it seems to take quite a bit of this conditioner to work through it.  Love the way it leaves my hair though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year. As a huge fan of organic products, this conditioner is a plus in my books. The texture is smooth (usually organic product conditioners have horrible textures), it doesn&#x27;t smell BAD (unfortunately a standard I had to set), and after a while it started taking effect. I was previously using this with an unorganic shampoo and I didn&#x27;t notice results, I switched to a different shampoo and it was no coincidence the chemicals stopped interfering and this started to work.&lt;br /&gt;It looks good, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, works good - if you&#x27;re looking for an organic conditioner, I wouldn&#x27;t look anywhere else. You&#x27;ve found the right one.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well as mentioned, smells great and very smooth. Hair looked shiny and soft also. Presented in a stylish bottle. Have ordered shampoo also now.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but was short changed three bottles from my most recent order.  Also, the time before, when I ordered two bottles ( in Januar), one bottle had broke from the cold during shipping and had leaked out all of the contents.  To make it right, you owe me four bottles.  I am a dedicated customer and should be treated as such.</li>
    <li> Renpure Originals My Pretty Hair is Parched! Moisturizing Conditioner,... smells really good. I love this smell and the way feels not heavy after conditioning it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is by far the best conditioner i have purchased. It smells amazing!! I have fine, curly, frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for over a month and my hair is a lot healthier.</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference in the product from what I was using.  Was a bit disappointed in the stiff feeling I was left with.</li>
    <li> I tried out this product, but in the end it seemed more expensive and no more satisfying than the Clear Scalp brand hydrating line.  I have not repurchased.</li>
    <li> After using the Shampoo this really helps smooth out my hair&lt;br /&gt;and leaves it soft and pliable - easy to pump out of container</li>
    <li> This is a solid product that contains no gluten or sulfates. Very moisturizing to my hair and leaves it smooth and easy to comb through. I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Paired with the Shampoo this left my hair smelling fruity and feeling even better. My hair was well moisturized and didn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s normal dry frizzy self after washing my hair. I recommend this to everyone who&#x27;s hair needs the hydration.</li>
    <li> My wife and I were looking for a product for our hair and this fit the bill perfectly!  A lot better than competitors.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes looking for a mild, daily shampoo &amp; conditioner after reading amazon reviews. After using for 1 week, I hate it and can&#x27;t wait for the bottles to be empty! It feels like it doesn&#x27;t clean at all! Not much lather, faint \\&quot;doggy\\&quot; scent, and leaves hair rough and yucky! The conditioner doesn&#x27;t do anything, not soft or tamed or shiny, nothing! Dollar store shampoos &amp; conditioners do a better job! SO not what I was looking for! My long, dry hair will have to keep looking for good daily care!</li>
    <li> Some people don&#x27;t like the scent...I&#x27;m fine with it.  Sniffing the bottle, it smells like baby powder, during use is a little perfumy, but after my hair dried, it smelled nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good at detangling my 3b curls and provides good \\&quot;slip\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depends on your type of hair but it works nicely for mine.  Will by again.</li>
    <li> I regretted CVS pulling this product from their shelves.  I started using it and love it. Now I order from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner really does leave your heair silky smooth.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, but especially to those people who have dry hair.</li>
