<li> I bought it as a fluke a few months ago, now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
<li> It has a small amount of an exfoliator in it, but not so much that it is too rough on my skin.  </li>
<li> I have begun to have open pores around my nose due to allergies and this is the only wash that closes the pores and takes away the redness due to irritation and clogged pores.</li>
<li> Recently I ran out and decided to purchase this product due to the reviews and price.</li>
<li> I have extraordinarily sensitive skin that with the wrong wash or moisturizer will turn red, bumpy and irritated.  </li>
<li> and I am seeing results after less than 1 week of use.</li>
<li> I have been using the ROC products ordered for less than a week and can already feel the difference.</li>
<li> All in all a waste of my money would not recommend or purchase ever again.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
<li> I use just a small amount morning and night.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t smell awful</li>
<li> Apply to face and leave for at least 15-20mins.</li>
<li> However, I have to buy it online, because it&#x27;s very hard to find.</li>
<li> (make it thin not pasty or you will \\&quot;shed\\&quot; the baking soda as it dries).</li>
<li> I ran out and had to use another product for a few days and it was horrible.</li>
<li> Boy are they ugly!</li>

    <li> I absolutely love this product. I bought it as a fluke a few months ago, now I can&#x27;t live without it. I ran out and had to use another product for a few days and it was horrible. With Amazon&#x27;s subscribe ans save I will not have that problem again! A must have!</li>
    <li> Very cleansing and does seem to help reduce pore size.  I just received this and haven&#x27;t used it long enough to judge completely, but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> love this product. The quality was above my expectations. I love the fine microbeads. My face feels very clean when I use it.</li>
    <li> The pores on my nose were huge, but after using this for a month they aren&#x27;t so noticeable when I look in the mirror.  It&#x27;s not an overly strong scrub.  And the only problem I have with it is that it stings the eyes</li>
    <li> I just love this cleanser, it really does the job of taking all of my makeup off and leaving my skin clean and fresh</li>
    <li> good product, I use it every day on my forehead and I get comments on how nice my skin is</li>

It has a small amount of an exfoliator in it, but not so much that it is too rough on my skin.  It&#x27;s just enough that I can use it every day. As we age, sometimes pores tend to look bigger and this is one reason why I purchased this. Already my skin looks healthier and brighter and this cleanser leaves it feeling smooth and not dry and drawn.  I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this because I want one cleanser that I can stick with that makes my skin look better and feel better, and it looks like I&#x27;ve finally found the one I like.

    <li> The cleanser is the best one I have used. It makes my skin feel clean and vibrant without drying.  It doesn&#x27;t work miracles but it helps.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser (eg gets rid of makeup, doesn&#x27;t dry skin), though doesn&#x27;t seem to have made a difference in pore size at all.</li>

    <li> I really enjoy using this product.  Easy to use and super to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;I would most definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product as it does work in minimizing your pores.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I would buy again but it is cheaper in the stores.</li>

    <li> How I use every day cleansers with clarisonic, I want to buy this one cause Roc it&#x27;s an amazing brand.</li>
    <li> very gentle scrub. great for using on sensitive skin.</li>

    <li> I have been using an ROC cleanser with microbeads for years which I have loved ( the bottle is blue and it does not have harsh acids in it) Recently I ran out and decided to purchase this product due to the reviews and price. Do not waste your time the scent if overpowering, the consistency in my opinion is strange and when I have used it on my face it has caused a severe outbreak. All in all a waste of my money would not recommend or purchase ever again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just been using this product for two weeks. So far I have seen minimizing of my pores across my chin. It will take time for the complete effect I want, but will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I am loving the effects of this. It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t smell awful and I am seeing results after less than 1 week of use. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it contains a chemical that makes your skin more susceptible to sun damage (as per the disclaimer on the back).

    <li> I have been a Roc user for years, before the company was purchased by J&amp;J.  It was recommended by my dermatologist at the time.  It works for me and my skin type.  Not too harsh nor too gentle.</li>
    <li> finally something that does what it claims, been using this for about a month and my pores are almost non-existent and I don&#x27;t have any more breakouts, great product</li>
    <li> I love this product I no longer can see my pores used along with the other products wrinkle filler and disk really brings results.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY products. At 40 our skin changes as we all know. Around that time I began to see pores!!! Boy are they ugly! This product is amazing and I will ditch othere cleansers for this one! Thank you for offering it at such a great price too!</li>
    <li> I use just a small amount morning and night. It keeps my skin clear. However, I have to buy it online, because it&#x27;s very hard to find. It&#x27;s the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It&#x27;s one of the best if not the best facial cleanser out there! It makes my face feel so smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. And it really does reduce your pores. I even got my daughter to start using this too and she loves it also. Please ROC, keep making this product.</li>
