      <li>OK I&#x27;m going to support them</li>
      <li>Its a bit warm and humid where I live, so I was a bit worried about it melting in the mailbox (it can get quite hot in there)</li>
      <li>I bought these for the lighter, nude colors, but the light ones are sparkly and really bright and look like they&#x27;d glow in the dark.</li>
      <li>(the light ones are supposed to be light, but using a lip liner in a similar color will get you a lighter shade at full coverage if thats what you want.)</li>

      <li>Ok so it did deliver pretty quick but it is not moisturizing It has very little pigment</li>
      <li>The two dark colors are ok, but I bought this package for the nudes and had to throw them out.</li>
      <li>Love them for a daily natural look, so soft to use and durable</li>
      <li>Decent pigment in the medium to darker colors</li>
