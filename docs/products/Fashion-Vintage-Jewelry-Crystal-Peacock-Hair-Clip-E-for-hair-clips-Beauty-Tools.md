<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gorgeous. Looks exactly like the photo, and is large and colorful but not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2.  I wanted to give one as a gift.  Both arrived with stones missing.  The company has of today agreed to refund me half of my money.  I will use stones from one to make a complete one.  Other than that it is very pretty.</li>
    <li> I got so many commpliment about this item. I is made with heavy weight gold tone metal. and is approxiamatly 6 inches across.</li>
    <li> Such a pretty accessory but it takes about a month to arrive. If you can wait, then it&#x27;s quite a lovely piece.</li>
    <li> This hair clip was even prettier than the picture.  I gave it as a Christmas gift and my friend loved it.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and am yet getting praise for it! The recipient was delighted and wears it proudly.</li>
    <li> my entire life I have loved peacocks and this necklace is so pretty.  I keep it on the hook so I can see it when I want.  Anytime I see peacock jewelry at a reasonable price I buy it.</li>
    <li> Slightly disappointed, the stones are plastic. but, the colors are awesome and i can easily put it in my hair after braiding and it looks wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product it&#x27;s beautiful but too big and heavy to wear.  Other than it&#x27;s really beautiful and the ringstone are very bright.</li>
    <li> Lovely head piece I get so many compliments with it.</li>
    <li> I just got this peacock hair peace today, I will show it off to my friends and see what they think, but I think it&#x27;s very nice!</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> It took around 2wks to arrive but when it did, it took my breath away! It goes all the way across the back of the head and looks awesome above a bun! Its light weight and does not tug at the hair. The gems are very well attached. I have received several compliments on it!</li>
    <li> I love this and the other clips like it that I got. I get so many compliments on it. It is so pretty and actually made really well. The only thing that could be better is for it to curve a little with your head instead of being so flat.</li>
    <li> I love this unique design.  Easily dresses up a simple pony tail</li>
    <li> Really pretty and especially useful if you have extremely thick, curly hair that normal american clips won&#x27;t contain.&lt;br /&gt;Clip clamps tight and does not come loose.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is very beautiful. The colors are stunning. I will be ordering more of these to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t Go Wrong in buying these, but after buying it I wanted to purchase more and I see the price double on them all not good or fair. The price should not go up any more. I will write the same review for them all because they are beautiful and the sellers are pretty good too, they will contact you almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted. thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented. i recommend. and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait i bought a few more so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others. i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken.</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece of hair jewelry, would not work well with very thin hair as it is a little heavy,  I have long hair and it stays in place beautifully.......very well worth the price for long hair.......</li>
    <li> The eye of the peacock is missing! :-&amp;#60; But other than that, it is very pretty! Just as described in the description and image shown. It is also rather heavy (and large) (for a hair clip), which I would equate with it being durable. So overall I like the hair clip and will hopefully order more different designs like it!</li>
    <li> Nice clip all the stones were there. look is nice. I&#x27;ll recommend if someone like peacock clip. Just Little heavy..</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!! I JUST RECEIVED THIS ORDER. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE LONG AGO...HOWEVER, GOOD THINGS ARE WORTH THE WAIT!  I LIVE THESE HAIR PINS.  MADE FOR SOMEOME WITH A LOT OF LONG HAIR.  I KNOW MY NIECES ARE GOING TO LOVE THESE HAIR PINS. ABOUT 3.5&amp;#34; LONG AND HEAVY.</li>
    <li> There were stones missing</li>
    <li> I love this peice.  It is art for the hair.  This is so beautiful.  It shipped quicklyand met my expectations.  It was something I thought about gifting, but its so pretty, I think I will keep it and order more for gifts.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty item despite one of the jewels on mine being a little off center. However, unless someone is looking close at it (which is rare), it&#x27;s not noticeable. I was surprised by the beauty and quality for the price. I would definitely buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and well constructed.  This is a substantial piece, not a small little barrette.  Receive many compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in great condition and on time.  The piece is beautiful.  Wore it to work and got compliments on how pretty and unique it was!</li>
    <li> heavy ornament but its beautiful</li>
    <li> This is also beautiful, and well made, BUT...it is also too heavy to wear in your hair, unless your hair is super long &amp; thick.</li>
    <li> heavy and somewhat clumsy</li>
    <li> Gotten so many compliments from this piece. It will take up few weeks to arrive but for the price it&#x27;s def worth waiting for. For sure does not look like the amount you paid for. :)</li>
    <li> Just Beautiful! This is another winner! Large and expensive looking. Holds onto my short but thick hair great.</li>
    <li> Colors are super vibrant. All jewels were in tact. A little larger than anticipated but still great for a bun or updo.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is well made, and it it big enough to hold thick hair. I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This clip is just as gorgeous as it looks here.  And it is well made.  I wish it held all if my hair but I have to use thus clip for only part of my hair when I twist it up.</li>
    <li> This is gorgeous. It is actually pretty gig, almost the size of a barette.</li>
    <li> This piece is magnificent the stones and the rhinestones complement each other wonderfully. It&#x27;s a real eye catcher. Get it</li>
    <li> This clip has a spring hinge, not a closure that stays closed. Still pretty but I have to wear it over another clip to hold my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very colorful, very pretty a little big that&#x27;s y I gave it 4 stars. But it&#x27;s very pretty. I have gotten allot of compliments on thus clip.</li>
    <li> It is cute. Unfortunately, it was completely broken when it arrived.</li>
    <li> this one is big and beautiful as the pic shows... I use it all the time! Can afford my tick and &#x27;big&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> Great price....it looks very pretty, and it didn&#x27;t cost that much.</li>
    <li> This one was beautiful i love it and its colors are Great...I would consider this for every lady who loves there hair up the clip is so pretty and people just comment on the peacock and colors they are great a must for every lady at there.....thanks again love love love..................:):):)</li>
    <li> I have now purchased several of these bejeweled &amp;#34;peacock&amp;#34; hair clips, and I just love them all!! They are very attractive, pretty, and very sturdy!!!</li>
    <li> When I received this item it was broken already</li>
    <li> This is beautiful. However it is much bigger than appears, as about 5&amp;#34; across. But a great way to dress up your hair for a special occasion.</li>
    <li> I got this hair clip through the mail today,and it is even more beautiful in person. I love these type of hair clips. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it! It is even at a reasonable price! Prices for these at the mall are outrageous!</li>
    <li> It is perfect just like the picture it is a little heavy but it is so beautiful best thing ever</li>
    <li> This is awesomely&lt;br /&gt;Cute. Great color it looks better when u actually see it so cute</li>
    <li> This is a very classy looking product, looks really great in thick hair and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. With the free shipping it&#x27;s well worth the price.  I bought extra ones for gifts.</li>
    <li> this clip is lovely, an excellent touch for the hair. My daughter and I both use it, it&#x27;s very light. item took a while to arrive, I was in no rush to get so it worked perfectly fine for me.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, it is also an attractive piece just hanging out on my dresser!</li>
    <li> My initial order did not arrive and when I contacted Sodio, they were very quick in responding to my query as well as sending out a replacement. I am very pleased with the product and will order again soon!</li>
    <li> So cute and it looks exactly like advertise.</li>
    <li> This clip is large enough to hold my hair in place and it is stunning, so much better than the pic and much more than I ever expected. Have seen products like this in the malls selling for $30. I definitely plan to order more, will make great Christmas present.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is a good size, perhaps about 5&amp;#34; and I was surprised by how sparkly it is. It really looks good under bright lights, and has a clip which seems strong enough to hold my thick hair. Prettier and more sparkly than the picture shows.</li>
    <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
    <li> Great clip, nice and sturdy and very unique! I haven&#x27;t seen this clips in any local store. My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> what is your phone number</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Great construction. Holds up well. No problems with this item. I get compliments on this every time I wear it.</li>
