      <li>I love your product and it works amazing for me.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Make sure you leave it on for 60 seconds if you use it in the shower</li>

      <li>i love this product i had never seen it in stores</li>
      <li>Okay, that&#x27;s an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using this for about a week just to make sure there was even a difference</li>
      <li>Love this product for my acne prone skin.  </li>
      <li>but his does help with cleansing and keeping more marks from appearing.</li>
      <li>She feels the product&#x27;s use as a wash is fantastic!</li>
      <li>My skin isn&#x27;t as oily as it once was, but it still needs more care than can be found in a bar of soap.</li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff!</li>
      <li>Neutrogena is even better.</li>
      <li>My skin feels and looks so much better.</li>
      <li>a better product for those with oily skin.</li>
      <li>Afterward, my skin feels nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I woke up and noticed that my marks have faded more than 50%.  </li>
      <li>My skin is healthier-looking and more even-toned.</li>
      <li>I love this faical wash.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worthwhile.</li>
      <li>I love this face wash.</li>
      <li>I love the texture and feel.</li>
      <li>But, it was free, so I gladly accepted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I like the fact that I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin issues while using the product so far.</li>
      <li>and so far it seems to be working great.</li>
      <li>In this case Clearasil Ultra is a clear winner, as it works great and doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable problems.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a nice face wash, and I will give this more time to see if it really fades the appearance of marks.</li>
      <li>My face never felt so clean and smooth!  </li>
      <li>so that is pretty amazing</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with this product and really have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
      <li>Clearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask is pretty effective at sopping up the excess oil.</li>
      <li>This Clearasil does a fine job washing your face, but won&#x27;t perform any miracles.  </li>
      <li>product was great for me because it didn&#x27;t dry up my skin as many acne masks would have.</li>
      <li>When you try to work the product into a smooth lather, however, the product acts like a gel and refuses to smooth out.</li>
      <li>I rarely broke out as a teenager, but now in my 20s, I tend to break out more often.</li>
      <li>However, the opportunity to see if it might fit the bill arose, and I gave the Clearasil Ultra Acne a shot.  </li>
      <li>Keeps the skin smooth after application, cleans the pores and keeps acne away.</li>
      <li>This was a great daily face wash!</li>
      <li>I tested this on my three teen nephew boys and it seemed to work great.  </li>
      <li>The important part is to leave it on your face.</li>
      <li>My daughter has tried all the acne products you can think of... from the ones sold on TV to the old and tried saturated pad-types and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>So, it might be good for someone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin prone to dryness.</li>
      <li>It is def worth a shot!  </li>
      <li>Does not leave you with a squeaky clean feeling.</li>
      <li>This acid causes your skin to turn over skin cells faster, which in turn causes some dryness, and the skin is able to heal itself faster, which is good for people with normal skin but will probably cause irritation to those who have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face doesn&#x27;t need some special facewash to keep me from breaking out or clean my pores.</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s decent enough, but you might be able to find something that works even better for you!</li>
      <li>(that&#x27;s true of any mask, I just don&#x27;t like crud on my face).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and should be long past my acne days...but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was great for me because it didn&#x27;t dry up my skin as many acne masks would have. It has a pleasant smell and wasn&#x27;t rough on my sensitive skin. It didn&#x27;t really clear up acne but it removed makeup very well and cleaned my skin without drying or leaving irritants behind. Overall, it was good for cleaning, non-irritating for a mask but didn&#x27;t really help much with adult acne.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any fading, but I have pretty sensitive skin and the product didn&#x27;t irritate it.  I recommend this product as a pretty good facial cleanser.  The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like is that it does not make that many suds, but when the masseur left oil on my back and my back broke out I used this product on my back and the bumps cleared up within a day or two.</li>
    <li> My 16 yr old daughter was extremely excited to try out the Clearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask. She feels the product&#x27;s use as a wash is fantastic! She&#x27;s been using this twice daily for the past several weeks and has noticed a large improvement in the number of blackheads around her nose and chin. She doesn&#x27;t find the wash to be drying at all; although she admits, she always moisturize immediately after washing her face.    When she tried to use this product as a mask, it didn&#x27;t work well due to the unique texture of the wash. When squeezed into your hand, it appears to be a cream. When you try to work the product into a smooth lather, however, the product acts like a gel and refuses to smooth out. In the end, when you spread the mask on your face, you&#x27;re left with some areas covered with a sheer layer of the mask and others with large globs of product gooped on.   Despite this, she felt that the Clearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask is a good product--just don&#x27;t expect it to be easy to use as a mask. It will, however, help to clear up blackheads and fight the formation of future blemishes. She will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I actually like using this product initially.  It worked really well on clearing up some light acne.  I also like the fresh, pleasant scent and the fact that immediately after washing my skin didn&#x27;t seem to be as tight and dry as it can be using some soap-based face wash products.  However after using it for a bit, I noticed some dry patches of skin on my face.  To their credit, the manufacturer warns that drying could be a side affect.  However, given chronically dry skin, the drying was very noticeable to me.  Would likely e a better product for those with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Been using the product for over two weeks.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  However, the bear tax you are paying, doesn&#x27;t mean it is keeping the bears away if there are no bears in the area.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with sore breakouts and dull looking skin for three years now.  I never had acne as a teenager but after I had my son at 24 my skin totally changed and became sensitive, dry, and prone to breaking out.  I had it somewhat under crontrol until December of 2010 and then my face just had an acne explosion on my cheeks, forehead, and chin.  I was so embarrassed and didn&#x27;t know what to do, I tried everything.  I finally got it under control again by using a gentle hydrating cleanser, but the horrible acne flare up had left red acne marks/scars all over my cheeks.  I saw the commercial for this product on tv and decided it was worth a shot.  I bought a tube of this at my local grocery store for about $6 bucks and used it for the first time a few nights ago.  I put it on and used my gentle scrubber to rub it in and left it on for about a minute, rinsed then followed with my hydrationist moisturizer.  I woke up and noticed that my marks have faded more than 50%.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but then after I used it the the second time, and I didn&#x27;t even leave it on as long followed again with my moisturizer, I noticed I had an itchy feeling on my jaw and chin area.  Sure enough the next day I woke up with what looks to be hives or just blothcy, itchy, red skin around my mouth, chin and jaw.  I stopped using the product but my skin is still irritated.  I am hoping it clears up soon because it looks awful.  I had high hopes but it&#x27;s just not good for dry skin.  But hopefully if you have normal skin and acne, this will do the trick.  That&#x27;s why I gave this two stars.</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail a few days ago, I use it 1-2 times a day and have already seen results. It is lightening the pink marks on my face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clearasil products on occasion throughout most of my adult life. My three daughters (ages 17, 13 &amp; 12) have had issues with breakouts so I was eager to give this a try. Unfortunately we didn&#x27;t really get the results that we were all hoping for. I used it on my face about 3 times a week, as my acne issues have finally become rather mild. It seemed to help, without being too drying for me. Same as for my middle daughter, she has mild acne so she used it 3 days a week like me.  My oldest &amp; youngest daughters had the most frustrating results with the product. If they used it only 3 times a week, it didn&#x27;t have much of an effect on their acne. If they used it more, then their faces would dry out and get flaky. Which then makes it not prudent to use any other product, such as the gel for spot treatment.  So I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for sensitive skin if you need to use it daily for major breakouts. I like Clearasil products, but we&#x27;ll stick with other treatments like their DailyClear line.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my teenage daughter who has tried many acne products, all to no avail. This wash and mask falls into the same category, and did not help at all. She followed the directions to the \\&quot;t\\&quot; and used solely this product for a few weeks. Her acne did not get better, and it was yet another disappointment for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also has tried to find cures on the internet- things she made herself, and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her acne finally did clear up, but only after I broke down and bought her a cream prescribed by her doctor. At this point, I believe that all over the counter acne medications are pretty much the same, and do not deliver what they claim. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this Clearasil Wash and Mask, it doesn&#x27;t help acne.</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and have always had oily skin that breaks out. I just started using the Clearasil Ultra Acne Marks Wash and Mask a few nights ago, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I use it once a day in the evening, every other night I leave it on as a mask, and the other night I just use it as a wash. So far my skin is softer, is clearing up, (no new pimples!) and it seems that my old acne marks are starting to fade. My skin is also not as oily. I will definitely continue to use this product. The only thing that surprised me is that when you use it as a mask, you only leave it on for one minute. At first I was skeptical that it could work so quickly, but it really seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find the best product for my skin , but to no avail until I found this product. I was sort of skeptical at first , because generally these types of products dry out my skin and cause some serious burning afterwards . So what the heck , I gave it a shot and am so thankful I did . I used it both as a wash and as a mask , and it makes my skin afterward feel refreshed , clean without all the bad side effects . I noticed a dramatic change after about a week after use. At the time , I had break outs on my chin and around the legs where my glasses sit. My skin is oily and I hate it lol.. With this stuff it not only cleans , makes ur face soft but it does a trendous job at clearing any breakouts. I will say I did have a break out from time to time , but all I have to do is put a lil of the face wash/mask on it and the next day you could already see it drying up. Fantastic stuff! I have ran out of the product and now my face is having some major breakouts...Time to buy some more!!! It is def worth a shot!  Note : I still used my face moisturizer afterwards , and it did not affect the product in the least bit</li>
    <li> My daughter has tried all the acne products you can think of... from the ones sold on TV to the old and tried saturated pad-types and this is by far the best.  She is medium complected and scars from acne turn dark and ugly.  This new Clearasil Acne + Marks gets the oil off her T-zone without over drying her face and causing flaky and dry/itchy skin.  I am amazed at this product doing what it says it will do.  It is a generation ahead of other acne products we have tried and it only comes in one tube, not a three or four tube regimen.  i give it five stars because it works!</li>
    <li> and this product really works well with older skin too. I like that it left my face soft and took care of the acne at the same time without over drying it.</li>
    <li> I have some slight acne scars that I was hoping this might help with--but after two months, I didn&#x27;t see any difference. And the texture of the wash took some getting used too--it was super thick and felt greasy while I was using it. I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on it, but it is a decent face wash.</li>
    <li> This is a simple, easy to use product for those who are blemish prone.  It appears to me (a noncosmetic scientist) to be merely a daily wash which is thick enough to use as a temporary mask. There is nothing to suggest in the ingredient list, or from daily use, that this retards the creation of blemish marks.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this and said it made her skin very dry.</li>
    <li> I stopped using another cleaser for this. My face is brighter and a tiny bit clearer, I have only been using this for a few days so I will definetly update.  update  my blackheads are not disappearing, I will be using a different cleanser soon</li>
    <li> This product does not work. From reading the other reviews I thought it was pretty good but not really...It has saliyic acid like 2% and that doesnt cut it for my face....I used Clean and clear persa gel 10 which is 10% benzoyl peroxide and clean and clear face wash that has 10% benzoyl peroxide too and it works for me...it dries up the acne....but it does make your face dry so i use clean and clear dual moisturizer....it feels so tingly and nice...it has menthol so does the face wash..</li>
    <li> I bought this wanting to try something new and because I had two pimples pop up on my face the day I was supposed to be going out for a birthday dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went straight home, read the instructions and put a mask on my face. I rinsed it off, not expecting any immediate results. When it was time for me to get ready to go out, my pimples had visibly reduced! Never has that happened to me in the SAME day! I have extremely oily skin and have now been using this product for almost a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use it everyday because I noticed that it does dry your skin out. I do a mask now once a week and treat breakouts individually. I have noticed that my skin is a lot less oily since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this product sooner! I highly recommend this for women who struggle with oily, acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> Clearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask: 6.78 OZ  is a nice pastel blue colored, clay slip consistency acne wash it is drying but it works</li>
    <li> This product is designed as a acne wash and mask.  I have somewhat sensitive skin, and generally do not like to use products of this type.  However, the opportunity to see if it might fit the bill arose, and I gave the Clearasil Ultra Acne a shot.  While it seemed to work OK - there was some improvement on my 40 year old face - the nature of the wash and mask was somewhat acidic - causing some redness and irritation - and this was specifically used as directed.  If you have sensitive skin, this product may be a bit too much for your face.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I had very bad acne on my forehead. I&#x27;ve been applying it twice per day for the last week.. Acne marks are fading very well, and my acne has completely stopped while using this product. All that&#x27;s left is clearing these marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be worth noting that I have been applying an oil free moisturizer on my forehead after washing. I wash twice per day with this product -- once after waking up, once before bed.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after using Proactiv for so long. I was wanting to save a little bit more money instead of having to constantly order the Proactiv so I decided to give the Clearasil a try. I have been using it just over a month now and so far it seems to be working great. I don&#x27;t have really bad acne but just regular breakouts around my time of the month near my chin and around my mouth. I have really oily skin so the Clearasil Ultra Acne didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  It actually helped get rid of my oiliness and dry out the pimples that I had gotten the previous month and for that I&#x27;m grateful.  I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell but I try not to let it bother me given the fact that the product actually works.  I have really sensitive skin and I like the fact that I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin issues while using the product so far. It is not terribly strong so I&#x27;m happy about that. I would definitely recommend this particular Clearasil because it works well and is an affordable option to getting rid of acne.</li>
    <li> I have hormone-replacement triggered acne; but am older and have drier skin.  I cannot use products to help with my periodic blemishes that further dry my skin.  This one seems to do a great job at both, and I will purchase this cleanser again.</li>
    <li> I should admit something before I say anything else. I&#x27;m not the target demographic for this product. My face doesn&#x27;t need some special facewash to keep me from breaking out or clean my pores. But, it was free, so I gladly accepted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finishing the bottle recently I stepped back and really looked at my skin and I really didn&#x27;t see much difference. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I didn&#x27;t have any blemishes or anything, but I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s due to this product...I&#x27;m not saying it isn&#x27;t either though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, I&#x27;m totally indifferent. I can&#x27;t say it works because I really didn&#x27;t need it, but I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t work for that exact same reason. So I&#x27;ll offer this, my face did feel cleaner after using it. If you feel like you need a product like this, give it a shot. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different. What works for you might not work for solmeone else, likewise for the other person. It&#x27;s all about finding what suits you best.</li>
    <li> made my skin soft wet face with warm water applied product then washed off with cold water made my skin real soft after the first use &amp; smells sooo good</li>
    <li> I have officially found the face wash that I will use for life! (Now to find the ultimate eye cream, toner, and moisturizer and anything else that will make my face look good. lol)    Anyway, I just want to tell a little about myself. I am a 20 year old who still has acne, with LOTS of hyperpigmentation - started when I was 12. Recently I tried to drink a tablespoon of flaxseed a day so that I could get my omega-3 fatty acids and it BROKE me out! now when I mean broke me out, I don&#x27;t mean a little cluster of pimples at the side of my cheek, I mean my WHOLE face, especially my forehead. I literally hated it! I came across this product because I ran out of my Acnefree sulfur mask, and since this was a heck of a lot bigger and said \\&quot;Mask\\&quot; I said why not? - Besides it was for postacne marks, which seemed like a plus. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but that night when I used it, my face felt so soft and the next morning my pimples were smaller! So I continue to use it and it has really helped my face a lot! It feels smoother, looks brighter, and I just feel good after washing my face. As for my marks, I can&#x27;t completely tell if they are fading since I have a lot, but it has been getting rid of my pimples and I only had this for a week! ^_^     I am very pleased!    EDIT/UPDATE 9-17-2011    So I&#x27;ve stopped using this product only because after using it for a 2 months, it stopped treating my acne. :( I&#x27;m a little disappointed, but it was good while it lasted.</li>
    <li> I wish they wouldn&#x27;t have stopped selling this at my local stores, as it works better for me personally than any other product I&#x27;ve found.  Make sure you leave it on for 60 seconds if you use it in the shower, it makes a world of difference.</li>
    <li> I have always had sensitive skin growing up. Trying new cleansers was always so nerve wracking for me because I would wake up with either redness or breakouts. This cleanser has become my lifeline for about two years. I can use it everyday and it actually does reduce pimples overnight and treat marks. Doesn&#x27;t leave a burning feeling after use like most cleaners do and the smell isn&#x27;t harsh. I put a Mary Kay moisturizer on afterwards and my skin never dries out from it. I&#x27;ve gone through about 6 tubes and you only need a pea size to do the trick. Love love love</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with acne since i have memory and it gets worst everytime  i try something new so i decided to leave it alone and now i have these marks on my face and i starte using the microneedle along with this mask, it was the best product for marks  i have tried my face is clearing and i have used it for almost a week so that is pretty amazing i highly recomend it</li>
    <li> I have never seen or used a product that work in 24hrs like this dies. I was having a really bad breakout and started stressing I bought this because all the other products were so expensive I am happy I gave it a try my face is happy my sister that live in Jamaica came to my house due to the sun her face was dry out and Sun burn three weeks later it all cleared up. Thanks clearasil #clearasil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Clearasil as face wash for just over two weeks now, and I&#x27;m experiencing less break-outs, and calmer skin (I usually have red marks to cover-up and 1-2 inflamed pimples). My skin is healthier-looking and more even-toned. I&#x27;ve only used it as a mask once, and I didn&#x27;t really notice much difference opposed to just washing my face with it, so I will generally rinse it right off. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Clearsil fan and out of any face wash product, I will buy Clearsil first. I feel their products are reasonable priced and does do the job. I was very satisfied with this product and really have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> I like this product...it is a good daily use face/body wash that is not drying. I use it every day and I do find a decrease in routine breakouts. I find it also hastens the demise of any beginning acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not believe I&#x27;ve seen any evidence of lessened scarring; I think that is what the product is being marketed for. I&#x27;m not sure anything will do that although I have had success with retinol and AHA products. This contains salicylic acid. I find it most useful for drying/eliminating out blackheads without drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice container; I like the top down base so that product is always near the opening. Good sturdy top that won&#x27;t fall over in the shower.</li>
    <li> I got this because my 10 year old daughter use this because she just started breaking out in pimples.  They&#x27;ve turned up on her forehead by the hundreds.  Okay, that&#x27;s an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them.  She&#x27;s been very good about not picking at them.  She started using the wash and did use it for about one week.  She stopped because she said it didn&#x27;t work. Yes, I know, a week is not long.  But when you are a child with pimples popping up on your forehead a week is forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found something else for her to use and that has decreased the appearance of the pimples. So, not sure if she had continued to use the product maybe it would have helped.  That&#x27;s why the three stars.  I think the length of time for effectiveness is important especially when dealing with pre-teens and teenagers.</li>
    <li> My kids and I used the product and we all liked how it was creamy AND soapy -- I have always been a Clearasil fan so I was excited to try out a new product in their line. My daughter said it felt refreshing and helped clear up her skin, and she&#x27;s almost 13 so she&#x27;s in the know about skin care and facial products!</li>
    <li> The product works well. The important part is to leave it on your face. After washing your face with it, don&#x27;t rinse it off immideatly, let it stay for about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a mild but persistent acne problem my whole life.  For the most part, I just use a Neutrogena acne spot cream for it after I get out of the shower (after washing my face with regular soap), but I decided to give this product a try.  After testing it for a few weeks, I have to say that it is seems to be slightly better than my old cream.  It controls my acne about as well as the Neutrogena cream (which helps bumps go away faster but does not stop them from popping up in the first place), but it seems to be a bit gentler on my face and works a bit faster.  Unfortunately, I thought that since this is a facial wash and not just a spot treatment cream, it might actually help clear up acne like it says it does and keep me looking clearer all the time.  It doesn&#x27;t do any of those things.  It lessened my acne a bit and that&#x27;s it. It certainly didn&#x27;t fully clear it up and it didn&#x27;t keep it clear.  Still, though, I like it better than my old Neutrogena cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that I only used it as a face wash and not a mask because I don&#x27;t think I could stand to have this crud on my face that long (that&#x27;s true of any mask, I just don&#x27;t like crud on my face).  So, do I recommend Clearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask?  Sure, it&#x27;s decent enough, but you might be able to find something that works even better for you!</li>
    <li> I tested this on my three teen nephew boys and it seemed to work great.  Cleared up their faces well.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My skin is a little odd, its not very oily or very dry but kinda in the middle of the two. I used this for about 2 or 3 weeks followed by a moisturizer after every use and it was awesome, cleared my trouble spots very well and prevented new ones from forming. I stopped using this for about a week just to make sure there was even a difference and my trouble spot came back almost right away. I will definitely keep using this product(: I noticed other reviewers said the smell was unbearable but I think it was pretty normally smelling for a face cleanser and my face did feel a little tight if I didn&#x27;t follow this with my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Just received it. I was bothered to see that the expiration date was on 2011. The scent smells kind of weird. I will be posting on results after this week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the CLEARASIL ULTRA ACNE + MARKS WASH &amp; MASK on and off for about 6-7 weeks now. At first, the product made my skin extremely dry and tight, after about four-six washings, so I had to skip a few days and continue. I should add that I occasionally use ProActiv Benzyl-Peroxide lotion at night, so the excessive drying will happen when using two different acne products at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However my skin did acclimate to the CLEARASIL WASH and the excessive drying did stop. I did notice that pimples and existing marks -- including a mosquito bite I received in Tokyo -- did heal much faster and left hardly a trace, whereas normally I&#x27;d have a dark mark for a month or so afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this has to do with the active ingredient 2% Salicylic Acid, which is like a low grade chemical peel. This acid causes your skin to turn over skin cells faster, which in turn causes some dryness, and the skin is able to heal itself faster, which is good for people with normal skin but will probably cause irritation to those who have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula has a distinct medicinal scent and has very low suds (which I&#x27;ve read is actually better for the skin because it&#x27;s a chemical that creates the lather), but it has a creamy texture and rinses away cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you can use this product as both a mask and a daily wash, my advice is to try it as a mask to begin with and then work your way up to washing twice daily. If you have extremely sensitive skin, I&#x27;d use caution.</li>
    <li> It cleans and is a good mask for my type of skin, grease.  Is a very good product that had helped me a lot to control acné.</li>
    <li> I did not find it useful at all. The pimples did not dry even after using it for 3 days. I am not sure, how people got their pimples dried within a day</li>
    <li> I have oily skin; I used this product and I immediately had to stop using it. it broke me out so bad on top of that I already had acne scars, this product made them darker and now im feeling depress over my face again. :(  it was actually a little better before I started using this product but I just made it worst by using this produc. if you have sensitive  oily skin I dont recommend you to use this , it will just make it worst. but everyone has different skin so it will work on some people.</li>
    <li> Good product.Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. I believe that it actually keeps the oil and acne away. I love the texture and feel.</li>
    <li> The first time I put this on my face, I knew I had found a special product. First of all, it smells great- it doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal at all, it&#x27;s almost slightly fruity in a way. But it is not overwhelming. It is a good consistency, and is a light-blue/grayish color. The first few times I used it, I only used it as a wash. And while I didn&#x27;t notice an immediate difference, I noticed subtle things. My skin started to clear up a bit. And then the big changes- the scars I have started to fade.&lt;br /&gt;This in itself was a huge deal to me! I have quite a bit of marks from previous breakouts. I am very, very fair (I usually wear the lightest or second lightest foundation available), so those red marks definitely stick around. And in high school, I had a slight picking issue when it came to my face, which also created scaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used it as a mask. And it was like the heavens opened up and light shined down and I heard beautiful music and angels singing. NO JOKE. It has been that good for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all, and it has actually made some of my active breakouts shrink in size overnight!&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself does not completely dry, but I usually leave it on between 7 - 10 minutes- I&#x27;ll pluck my eyebrows, or brush my teeth, or just watch a YouTube video or two while I&#x27;m waiting. Then I usually rinse with warm water, and it comes off super easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any irritation with this product- I actually go back to it when I do have issues with something else I might be trying. I also will only use this product if I am having some break out issues. It just really clears everything up for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I still have some scaring, but it has faded so much in my eyes. And I still get active breakouts, but nowhere near as severe, and they do not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(review also seen on my blog - beautyandthereads.com)</li>
    <li> There was some spillage on my bottle, and Amazon gave me a full refund. I&#x27;ve used this product before, and it works quite well. Because this works as a face wash and a face mask, it gives variety. I noticed acne coming less and less. Friends had even commented on the product working.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years...as a mask and face wash. Does not dry out the skin and helps improve appearance of skin.&lt;br /&gt;After finishing up the last tube, I had trouble finding it at any of the local convenience stores. I was about to order it here on amazon, but after a visit to the local walmart, fount it for much less then price here. Just $5.97.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to let you guys know this product did not work for me I have been using it constantly for over 6 months and has still yet to remove my dark spots or my pimples not even my white heads I am a hispanc male of age 18 and have been suffering form acne and acne dark spots since 14 so I don&#x27;t recommend this product to the youth but if you are older and have mild acne or mild dark spot problems this might work for you I tried this product with ultra rapid action scrub that states that you the user will see clearer skin in as little as 12 hours it is also a lie because I don&#x27;t get to much acne these days once in a while a couple pimples appear with a couple whiteheads as well I would describe my acne problem as mild since my real problem are dark spots but as I was saying this product did not do what it was supposed to do so if you are low on cash I would suggest home treatments or if you rather have the sure and safe way I would suggest you checking in with your dermatologist</li>
    <li> Love this product for my acne prone skin.  This is the only product that really works for me without drying out my skin or making it break out.  I&#x27;ve tried several products from proactive, neutrogena, arbonne, oil of olay.  Clearasil mask is best for my 38 year old skin.  I get told I look more like I&#x27;m 30 / late 20s than closer to 38 years old.  Take it when you can get it ladies:)!</li>
    <li> I love this faical wash. It clears up acne and reduces the appearance of marks. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and they have recently stopped selling it instores. I&#x27;m so happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> When walking down the aisle at the store the question is always there - go with the real deal and a brand name like Clearasil, or save a couple of bucks and buy the generic version?  Can the more expensive variety actually be that much better?  In this case Clearasil Ultra is a clear winner, as it works great and doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acne wash isn&#x27;t messy or smelly, doesn&#x27;t burn the skin, and isn&#x27;t harsh and abrasive like a typical exfoliating wash.  I personally didn&#x27;t experience any dryness of the skin, but I generally use it every other day instead of every day.  The only thing keeping this from perfection is that I prefer the feel of the Equate brand, but the Clearasil variety has worked better and completely prevented breakouts.</li>
    <li> i have cystic acne on my cheek and near my jaw line (large raised bump that&#x27;s clogged with oil) Cystic acne is one of the worse acne anyone can have because they are painful when they rupture into the skin and are very sensitive to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go to the dermatologist who told me that it does not matter the brand or the title of the product, what matters first and foremost are the ingredients. The main fighting ingredient in Clearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask is Salicylic Acid (2%). Salicylic Acid helps the skin exfoliate so it doesn&#x27;t get clogged up. It is often paired with benzoyl peroxide. benzoyl peroxide kills bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of products and as well all know, acne is a killer on self-esteem and can cause a lot of depression. I have acne marks from past acne, and unfortunately as much as I wanted to this to help me, it didn&#x27;t do much to improve my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist gave me retin-a macro, and hopefully that will make a difference instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPEARANCE:&lt;br /&gt;Metallic white, very easy to apply. I found it works better when you use it as a mask 2-3 a week than as a wash every single day since Salicylic Acid&#x27;s main purpose is to exfoliate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for:&lt;br /&gt;People with mild acne, if you have cystic acne like me (raised bumps that get bigger and uglier unlike blackheads which are tiny black plugs on your nose), you are much better off saving your money for a tougher product/more expensive regime like retin-a, accutane, laser therapy, etc.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have pointed out, considering that this has the same active ingredient as almost all over the counter acne treatments, your choice comes down to fragrance and price.  This Clearasil does a fine job washing your face, but won&#x27;t perform any miracles.  I tend to prefer the men&#x27;s Clearsil which comes with exfoliating beads.  This particular product is smooth and filmy.  But it gets your face clean and clears up minor acne.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with acne and oily skin since middle school. Nothing ever seemed to work that well, including anti-biotics (which didn&#x27;t really help my acne problem, so I don&#x27;t recommend taking them unless you really need them. anti-biotics are over prescribed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I tried this product and it really does take away the red surrounding the acne after a few days and it reduces the pimples alot. I recommend using this product while in the shower in the morning with a washcloth. Use it in conjunction with your acne creams and oil astringent to wipe the oil off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product again because it really does work.</li>
    <li> Acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheez! I suffered from this embarrassing skin condition throughout my teenage years and thought it would never clear up. Miraculously, it did, although the battle left many scars, and I still have the occassional breakout. My skin isn&#x27;t as oily as it once was, but it still needs more care than can be found in a bar of soap. Clearasil Ultra Acne + Marks Wash and Mask is pretty effective at sopping up the excess oil. Instead of using it as a wash, I&#x27;d recommend applying it to the face, leaving it on to dry, then washing if off. Afterward, my skin feels nice and smooth. It&#x27;s dry, too, but not scaly.</li>
    <li> I must say, for Clearasil, this product left me disappointed. I personally have light acne, flaring up occasionally; three or four times a year. What drew me to this product was the fact that it acted both as a wash and a mask, as well as the pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the the product for about a week, I no longer wish to use it further. It actually left my skin feeling dry and irritated; not clean and smooth. When I used the product as a wash, it didn&#x27;t foam, leaving me second guessing whether or not I dispensed enough onto my palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to point out that the cap is not made well. It broke this morning when closing the cap. Please, save your money and buy a different product.</li>
    <li> I rarely broke out as a teenager, but now in my 20s, I tend to break out more often. I have used this product twice a day for two months and I don&#x27;t see a difference. I bought this product because when I do break out, it tends to leave a dark spot. Even though I have been using this wash, it has not reduced the amount of breakouts and dark spots still occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may work for others, but not for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff works good. I get breakouts on my chest and upper back. I&#x27;ve used this twice daily for about two weeks now and there is a huge difference.</li>
    <li> To give you a background on my Acne issue, I dont get acne in dronze like alot of people do. Just one or two pimples here and there.But I do have another issue, I pick on my pimples to the point of scaring the skin. So even though I dont get alot of pimples I do have alot of ance scares. What is great about this product is that I can put it on the pimple when its small enough where I dont get the urge to pop it and by the next day its gone so there is nothing to pick on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily twice a day. In the mornings I put it on before I hit the shower and then leave it on while I soap the rest of my body and wash my face at the end.&lt;br /&gt;Then I put it on at night for a quick wash or leave it on for about 15min and then wash it off. If I feel a a pimple coming I also use it as a spot treatment over night and it just gets rid of the pimple super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like any product your skin needs time to get used to it and after it does its works so great. I did break out on my forhead when I first started using it but now that I have been using it for over two weeks I have seen a big difference in my skin</li>
    <li> ...this wash has been very effective in clearing up our son&#x27;s face.  We probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it at its list price, but for the half off you&#x27;re currently getting on Amazon it&#x27;s worthwhile.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 4 days now and I&#x27;m breaking out all over my face.  Not happy with this product at all.</li>
    <li> it works well as a facial cleanser, but I haven&#x27;t see any effect on my acne so far (have used half of the tube).</li>
    <li> I struggle a lot with black heads and acne marks, and since using this for about four days now, the results are crazy. My blackheads on my chin are going away and it&#x27;s very noticeable. My skin is brighter and I&#x27;ve noticed missing marks that were there before. I definitely suggest this wash.</li>
    <li> Keeps the skin smooth after application, cleans the pores and keeps acne away. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> Awesome feel on face. It actually fades dark marks and give my face a youthful soft and young glow. I like to use it right after I shave. Its a blessing. Some times I sleep with it on and wake up to a new face lift.</li>
    <li> I could only manage to use this product for about five days before I decided to give up on it. Clearasil Ultra really dries out my skin, which only causes more severe acne issues. Of course I cannot speak for its ability (or lackthereof) to reduce the redness of \\&quot;acne marks,\\&quot; but my guess is that one would have to use this product for months on end to notice such a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The positives are that it is a very creamy, unabrasive wash that does not have an unpleasant smell. Furthermore it is fairly priced. So, it might be good for someone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin prone to dryness.</li>
    <li> I loving this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use as a face mask. I have a lot of scarring on face and I have not noticed a difference with this product. It claims to fade the appearance of marks which I have not seen. But I have only used this a handful of times, so I do not feel like its fair to say that its not a good product. It is a nice face wash, and I will give this more time to see if it really fades the appearance of marks.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but I&#x27;m so happy about this product that I couldn&#x27;t stop myself from creating a post about it. I went through my severe breakout phase when I was 11 and 12 and I cleared it up with proactive. After I stopped using it, my face started breaking out again, but proactive is so expensive and I couldn&#x27;t afford it anymore. So I started shopping around. I have oily skin and I tried SO many different types of face washes. When I was 15 or 16, my mom got me this face wash (maybe not exactly the same one but very similar and also by clearasil). I noticed a difference right away. It makes my skin feel so great after I finish washing and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin too much. In fact, the only time my skin actually dries out is in the winter where I just add a tiny bit of moisturizer to my face afterwards and it&#x27;s just right. I tried using something else this year that was supposed to be really good (it was a gift), but all it did was make my face red and splotchy, so I switched back. I&#x27;ve used this stuff daily since I got it when I was 16 (I am 23 now) and I get so many compliments on my skin. Even I, who am my own worst enemy, think that my skin looks great! I recommend this to anyone who wants to clear up their oily skin. It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I ordered two tubes of Clearasil for my daughter around the end of JUNE or the beginning of JULY, I received two tubes of this products which were different items from the web (web said NEW FORMULA),but the items I got look like color deeper and No NEW sign over the corner. I did not return them since I would try all of the products that would cure the Acne problem. I used around 20 days just testing the Clearasil (I think I should call this OLD FORMULA, because they were different from the web &#x27;NEW ONE), they worked slowly after 10 days, I am very happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I got busy when school started , I decided to order  10 more tubes for my daughter,that would solve all my problems later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aug.15, I received the 9 tubes of Clearasil (NEW FORMULA) same bar code, they will send me another 1 tube later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aug. 15 afternoon, when my daughter tried this NEW FORMULA one, she told me that was not the one we tried before, it likes hair shampoo, if you push a little bit harder, they would come out like water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried to return them, but this items only can be replaced not return with refund,I did return this morning, hopefully, I can get the 9 tubes of OLD FORMULA one back, otherwise, I wrote letter to the amazon, I can not accept another 9 tubes of NEW FORMULA clearasil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason that made me feel upset was I used my $30 Amazon points to buy this, I do not think that Amazon will refund for that lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to buy this product, you have to be very careful to recognize the &#x27;TRICK&#x27;, if you do not have time to deal with this &#x27;NEW&#x27; and &#x27;OLD&#x27; GAME, you may just forget it, do not buy this product. I used 1 hour yesterday night to figure out the problem, I used three hours to solve the return, printed the label, drove the UPS store, and wrote the review. I am still not sure the replacement for the rest of the days, and I lost $30 reward point from my amazon account. you count me just bad luck. Hopefully, my review can help you get rid of trouble.</li>
    <li> I have had acne problems eversince I was a teenager and have been to dermatologist many times already and was always prescribed quite expensive medicine for my face. But I finally gave up spending so much money for my face so I tried this product and just worked pretty well. It made my skin flacky when I used it twice a day, so I used it once a day and it was less flacky. This product is very helpful. I cant believe I tried this product now that I am 24. Wish I tried it when I was still a teenager.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to let u know that I bought Clean &amp; Clear breakout control and after I used it I broke out all over my face and jaw line really bad even in places I have never broke out before so I bought ur Clearasil Ultra Acne+Marks used it one time as the mask and it almost completely took all acne and marks away. My skin feels and looks so much better. I want to say thank you and I will continue buying Clearasil Ultra Acne+marks from now on I only tried the other cause it was cheaper but I will never do that again I love your product and it works amazing for me.&lt;br /&gt;  thank you,&lt;br /&gt;  a loyal customer from now on</li>
    <li> This was a great daily face wash! I have oily, troubled skin with acne scarring. Not only did this keep my skin clear but it helped fade my dark acne scars. I am very impressed. Please regard the directions, the mask is only meant to be used for 1 minute, otherwise it might dry out your skin. I wouldnt recommend this product for people with dry or sensitive skin because of the strength and fragrance of this product. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin has gotten so much clearer in just a few weeks. Im still waiting on my marks to fade.. they might already be fading away but too gradually for me to tell. No overwhelming scent either.</li>
    <li> i love this product i had never seen it in stores but i love face masks! great as a wash or a mask it has a great  too</li>
    <li> I had to write a review on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a bit of background info.  I am not used to getting any acne with the exception of one cystic looking acne cyst for that time of the month or if I take too much caffeine without drinking plenty of water.  I was very tired from work and was drinking way too many energy drinks, such as Red Bulls and Monsters. {I quit doing that though - its bad for the health.}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, with that I had some horrible breakouts along the jaw line. I was using Olay Detoxifying Pore Scrub {Which is still good, but} I realized that the exfoliating beads in this scrub was popping the pimples and causing them to spread further.  So I knew I needed to find another solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up as well as the Clearasil Daily Face Wash to rotate between the two since this one said only use it up to 3 times per week and the Daily Face Wash is well, daily.  I used it yes correctly, and on the pimples I used it as a spot treatment.  I seen marked improvement after the first use.  It is harsh, yes, so its not okay to keep using it more than than the suggested dosage, particularly on the parts of the skin that are NOT problematic at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it did for me was dry the pimples OUT.  First it looked as if it was bringing it to a head but I could still see that it was drying it out from the outside of the pimple and it gradually shrunk it and dried it up whereas I could just pull the dry skin off of it after moisturizing and the skin beneath it looked brand new.  It cleared up the blemishes and dried up the pimples more and more after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By three days, I was almost completely clear with just a little bit of the old pimples still drying up.  So my spot treatment areas were so much smaller and I feel good again.  But it worked very fast.  It is harsh so careful with using it on skin that doesn&#x27;t have acne on it. For the skin that doesn&#x27;t have acne on it use it for the recommended dosage.  But the skin that&#x27;s all pimpled up, can actually take the harshness. Man, this stuff killed it and I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As a spot treatment, I just put some on the pimples and just leave it on just like any other spot treatment cream.  Also I like the fact that a little bit goes along way. :-)skin that&#x27;s all pimpled up, can actually take the harshness.

    <li> This is an awesome product!  I have to use it as a mask though to see better results which are GREAT!  Just leave it on for one minute and then rinse.  I pair this up with ClearZit Benzoyle Peroxide that I can only find at Dollar General which is dirt cheap.  This wash/mask lasts s LONG time!  So that&#x27;s another plus for your money!  A little background... I have VERY oily skin, so am definitely prone to a lot of breakouts especially around the time of my period.  I have noticed a dramatic decrease in acne size and redness going down when I use this as a mask and some of my acne scars are disappearing!  XD  Very happy with that!  I do want to move on to a more natural route though just to see if that can work too.  I hear Turmeric can have amazing results with acne in general and even decreasing scars.  So we&#x27;ll see later on :)  But right now I recommend this for those with oily skin.  I know everyone&#x27;s oily skin can be different, but I hope this product also helps others out there!  :)  Thanks Clearasil for your hard work in helping people like me who suffer from acne!</li>
    <li> i have problem skin but his does help with cleansing and keeping more marks from appearing. Will buy again though</li>
    <li> I bought purchased this for around $6 at my local drugstore and had very high hopes for it since I have many acne marks. I used it for the first time at night and right when I washed it off my face felt super soft. The following morning, I could tell that my acne scars had diminished in appearance, but my face was super itchy especially around the jawline and my cheeks. This product definitely works, but it would possibly work better on a more oily skin type than on a dryer one. The itchiness went away after I used a kept using a good moisturizer, and I later decided to give it another go, but it dried out my skin again. Gave it 4 stars because it does work, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Fight marks as promised. Very good product!</li>
    <li> I am using this product as a mask while I type this review!!! I put it on my fresh washed by the same product face and sit back as it takes away impurities and helps clear my acne!  I just sit back to this melon smelling mask and let it go to work!  It doesn&#x27;t get hard or cracky like other masks though I do look like a Geisha Girl. (lol)  When I wash it off,new skin is revealed and old is washed away!!!  My face never felt so clean and smooth!  Thanks Amazon for a Great Price!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a lot of scarring from when I was younger and would constantly be picking my face. This is definitely helping to clear my face of both acne AND scars!</li>
    <li> I hated this product. I didnt have very bad acne. I had it like a little bit. But when i started using this face wash, it actually made my acne worse. I still regret that i used it because i got blemishes after that which is not going away. Not recommended! Neutrogena is even better.</li>
    <li> This new formula Clearasil is nowhere as good as the old formula. Does not leave you with a squeaky clean feeling. Does&#x27;t suds up and you use more to get a good lather on your face, neck, hair. It will cost you much more in the long run. Give me the OLD formula anytime. If you can still get it?</li>
    <li> my skin so oily and i had alot of problems with it .I bought this product and i am Clearasil user before  .  in the first time i was using it in wrong way and my skin went dry and noticed  some  dying skin appearing in my face which put me in embarrassed situation  and i discovered that the worm water was giving that results . then after a while i start to was the Clearasil with cold water and the result was above the expectations  its really a big anti acne and the old marks of it . so happy with it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use it 3 times a day  in the morning before going to work and when i come back from my work and in the night before i go to sleep .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not  going to stop using it this product .</li>
