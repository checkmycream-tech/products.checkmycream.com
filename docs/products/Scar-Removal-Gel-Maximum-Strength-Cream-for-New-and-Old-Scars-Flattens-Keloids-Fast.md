<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have two chicken pox scars on my face ever since childhood. This is doing wonders on those scars and I can slowly see them fading away. This is gentle enough on my skin to not cause rashes, breakout or pimples and yet works wonderfully in fading the scar slowly. It does not have a bad smell that would make me want to take it off immediately. The consistency of the gel is thick but it is not greasy and oily when applied to skin. I have had no ideas with applying it onto my skin. I wash my face well. Apply this gel and go to bed. I am quite pleased with this item and would recommend this t anyone! I am so glad that I found this product out. I received this in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> From the packaging, to the feel and easy to apply consistency and absorption, it is a great product.  I&#x27;ve just started using it and people are already telling me how great my incision is looking so soon after surgery.  The personal follow up from the company is a nice touch too.</li>
    <li> This may work well for new scars, but I did not notice an improvement from my usage.  I used this on a surgical scar that is 6 months old and on stretch marks.  I did not have a noticeable improvement on either type.  I used it twice a day, every day for two months.  The cream feels nice, but in terms of fading the scars, I just didn&#x27;t notice any change.</li>
    <li> no changes to my scar</li>
    <li> I bought this scar gel with high expectations after reading the reviews. I can honestly report that I have noticed improvements on my scar from a second degree burn. It was about a month and a half old when i began use. I noticed a difference within two weeks. I use the gel as directed. It is now a month later and I have not seen any major improvements since the first two weeks but I am still applying as directed and hope to see further results. It feels like aloe vera once applied but dries much faster. I am happy sp far with this product.</li>
    <li> I plan to use it for my shingles scar, after applied for a week, I see the color fade. I hope it could remove keloid (bumps on the scar). Will see.</li>
    <li> Not a great thing like most of the people said. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I do notice a difference in using the gel.  In short, I have a keloid scar from when I was young about the size of a nickel on the back of my neck/lower hair line. In honesty, it has bothered me for years. The problem was the constant itching, irritation, dryness, flaking....in short, the scar never could heal. Using petroleum jelly offered some relief....the exception is all that it would do is keep it moist, but again not heal. I have noticed when using the scar gel as directed that I am relieved of the constant itching, irritation, dryness, flaking, but also notice a flattening effect. For this I am grateful. Otherwise, I will continue to use your product in hoping to see continued success.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It seems to be working on all scars, and a few black scars, i have some surgery scars that have gotten lighter in color too. So far this is the only gel that has shown results in a small period of time. Love it</li>
    <li> I had a very bad biking accident that took off a bunch of the skin on my shoulder, collar bone, and a little bit of my jaw line.  When it started to heal enough that I noticed scarring, I used this cream twice a day with vigorous rubbing for about two minutes each time and now there&#x27;s only slight discoloration on my shoulder left- it doesn&#x27;t even look like a scar!  No scarring on my collar bone or jaw anymore!  The best part is that it took very little cream each time I used it, so I still have half a jar to use after my next crash :)  I used also used Mederma SPF 30 on my scars whenever I was out in the sun, so they wouldn&#x27;t get worse.  Combined, these two products have been great!</li>
    <li> This product is completely a JOKE, WASTE MONEY, VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Just started using  the Healing Touch, Scar Gel Best Removal/Remover w/ Silicone twice daily as per directions.&lt;br /&gt;Compare to other scar remover I like this one the best. I have been using this product for lest than a week and I already notice a flattening of the scar located on my chin. Healing Touch premium scar gel is a very smooth soft gel. The gel smell fresh and it does not burn the skin. I am very please with this product and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the biggest skeptic there is!  I read about this product and decided to give it a try since it costs less than $40.  I figured if the product didn&#x27;t work, I would not be out of a ton of money at least!  Well to my surprise, the product works great!  I noticed a slight difference in two weeks; by the 4th week, the difference was remarkable!  I will keep using this product--I&#x27;ve already ordered two more jars!</li>
    <li> This gel did not improve the look of my scar at all even after using it for three months.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST scar gel cream I&#x27;ve ever used! The price is just right and it works fast! If you have an unsightly scar, this is THE choice for you.</li>
    <li> I love love this product! I give the creator many thanks once again for providing me with the BEST scar removal gel on the market this day. I have suffered from the worst acne breakout at age 11 and ended up with lots of keloid scars all around my chest, shoulders and upper back. After using my 2nd jar of this amazing product, I could begin to see some areas of the scar actually flatten within less than 2 weeks. I&#x27;m constantly using it as required as I wish to see the full results, plus I had the scars for over a decade. I knew from day 1 it was time to make a change for the best. I will continue to purchase this product! I personally would recommend this product to people who wish to treat the embarrassing scars they suffer!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working pretty good so far</li>
    <li> I received this product in a nice orange drawstring pouch. The jar is about the size of my palm. It is 30 grams which equates to 1.058 ounces. My jar was completely full which made me happy. I have purchased other products before and the jars were only halfway full. I took the time to read the label on the product before using it and decided to do research on each of the ingredients. In my research I found that the ingredient Hexapeptide9 (collaxyl) is used in order to trigger the skins healing process causing it to trigger the skin to start regenerating damaged cells. Panthenol is what helps to keep the skin moisturized. Allantoin is also used to help with moisturizing but it also assists in the healing process of the skin. Rose Hip Seed oil is popular  for use by itself and it helps with skin healing , Vitamin E oil helps heal the damaged skin cells. So the product description is very accurate when stating they combined some of the best ingredients. Many people purchase vitamin E and Rose Hip oil by themselves to help with their skincare needs. I didn&#x27;t mention the other ingredients because they just preserve the product.&lt;br /&gt;  I would like to point out that the label on this product clearly states that this product is ideal for the minimizing and fading of scars. Knowing this fact I have been using this product with the hope that it continues to help fade my scars not make them disappear. My scars are not fresh and therefore will require quite some time to fade. For the sake of testing it out I have two scars on my left arm and three on my right. The left arm scars are about a year old and the right side are about two months old. I have been using the product on them to see how well my skin will take to the treatment. So far I can see that they are starting to fade but because I am so early in the treatment process I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic change. One thing that I like about this product is that it is non-greasy and it absorbs quickly. I only apply one to two finger tips of the product per scarred area so while this is a small jar I believe it will last. I like that it is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell. My rating is based on my personal experience with the product up until this point.&lt;br /&gt;  Once some time has passed I will update this review with before and after photos of the scars I was using this product on. Skincare is one of those things that you have to keep trying things until you find something that works for you. Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts different to different things make sure to keep that in mind and be realistic about your expectations. With that being said this product is at least worth trying especially because it has ingredients that are used in many other common skincare products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review. It in no way has had any effect on my opinion of this product&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last week on a tummy tuck scar.  It is nice to put on - no smell, no itchiness.  So far, my scar looks better, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just the natural healing process or the cream (or both).  I will update as I see further results.</li>
    <li> The can is small maybe it will  finish before i see any  results cause my scar is big. With this size it will finish by a week</li>
    <li> I really wish I’d found this stuff and shelled out the $35 originally instead of wasting at least that much on pure aloe vera, vitamin e oil, and Mederma.  I used the aloe vera and vitamin e oil for about a month with no real results except an oily face.  It kept the area around my scar moisturized, but regular facial moisturizer could do that.  In just one month of using Healing Touch Premium Scar Gel, the raised scars on my forehead have started to flatten and are far less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the fact that this is gel and not like an ointment or oil or cream.  The gel is lightly cooling and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin (which is my major beef with most facial moisturizers).  With this gel, I can easily apply it and walk out the door ready to go.  There’s no wait time for it to soak in, or de-grease, or anything like that. There&#x27;s really no smell unless I practically put my nose IN the jar, but, why would you do that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely helping intensely to reduce how self-conscious I am about this cat attack scar on my face!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Definitely healing a large scar from surgery!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this scar removal cream for around 3 days now. It is a great product the results are visible and my scars are healing fast. Thank you for this cream it is life changing!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m onto my second bottle of this stuff and it&#x27;s pretty good. I have scars all up and down my legs and arms (I&#x27;m a scratcher and a picker, bad combination when you&#x27;re planning to have good looking skin for a wedding), and for about a month and a half I used this twice a day and saw definite fading in my dark scars. Then like a truly gifted mind, I quit using it and started at the scratching and picking again. But after ordering a second bottle I&#x27;m determined to use this until I get the results. They recommend using it twice a day for three months to see most blemishes completely fade away. I am very confident in this product.</li>
    <li> Seems like it is working for me.  I&#x27;ve been trying some better skin care in general though so that might be part of results.  Been using it for about a month now and have gotten noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I am writing this with a smile on my face. Last year, a small mistake I made when working in my kitchen, created burns and big boils on my hand. Even after the heel, the scar was bigger and highly noticed. I was a bit upset on this. It&#x27;s been more than a month that I am using the scar gel. Wow, the result is amazing. The result is progressing week by week. I can see my scar getting dimmer. I love this product. My hopes now are positive that the scar will disappear.  I am feeling good about it. I am thanking the team from the bottom of my heart.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement from my usage. I used it twice a day, every day for a months. I used this on acne scar, but I did not have a noticeable improvement on either type. The can is very small, maybe it will finish before I see any results. Unfortunatly, it does&#x27;t work to reduce my acne scare.</li>
    <li> I finally got it today it came in an envelope I thought it wuld come in a tiny box but no. It was also in the small orange pouch that says healing touch &amp; I thought it would smell like natural ingredients but it doesn&#x27;t so you shuldnt expect that it looks like a cream more than a gel but it feels kind of in between. I put it on a few areas where I have stretch marks (stomach nd knees) &amp; it felt cool wen I put it on. I may be putting up a YouTube review on it a little later this month. My youtube name is KameshiaFrazier</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many scar creams/gels including Mederma, FLAWless, and Bio-Oil. Healing Touch is better than each one of those.&lt;br /&gt;You might need to used a whole bottle before you see results depending on how old your scars are, but you will see results.</li>
    <li> I had a second to 12 inch third degree burn, by hot coffee on my thigh. It included purple as well as red hard bruises. Went to two of the best dermatologists in this area. One tried to convince me, that nothing short of laser could get that removed. If laser would not work, I should be trying Plastic surgery. LOL. she was hoping Id spend on both. The other dermatologist tried selling a 200 dollar a month treatment, open ended, because he was not sure when it would be gone.I tried this thankfully, after reading amazon reviews. In three months, the scar has really toned down, and still is very light pink. We women often get burn scars, surgery scars. This should work on most. Hoping this review will help someone.</li>
    <li> No notable change in my depressed in the first 30 days. I will continue for another 30 days, as per instructions.</li>
    <li> Premium Scar Gel by The Healing Touch is a new solution to old scars! This scar gel is made with only a few, yet important, ingredients like: Aqua, Dimethicone ( Which is Silicon, the main ingredient ) , Panthenol, Hexapeptide-9 (Collaxyl), Allantoin, Rosehip Seed Oil, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, &amp; Potassium Sorbate! The ingredient Collaxyl is well known to help deep wrinkles &amp; scars to heal and fade. This Premium Scar Gel has a combination of ingredients that even Plastic Surgeons recommend, and prefer for their own clients!!! It is known to heal scars from injury, surgery, acne, stretch marks, C-Sections, Burns, &amp; more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Premium Scar Gel comes in a orange travel pouch. Inside the pouch is a 30 gram jar of the Scar Gel! I love how the pouch, and jar, looks so high quality, modern, and high end! I have been using this Scar Gel for 2 months now, and can definitely say that it works! I use it twice a day, and make sure to gently massage it in over my scars, until absorbed. It isn&#x27;t meant to be used on open wounds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love The Healing Touch Premium Scar Gel:&lt;br /&gt;-It only takes a small dab on my finger to cover one scar. (( Example in one of the pictures above! )) I still have a lot left in the jar, and know this will last me a long time!&lt;br /&gt;-I absolutely LOVE the way this gel feels! It is so creamy, lightweight, airy, soft, &amp; has a cooling effect when applied to the skin!&lt;br /&gt;-The solid gel quickly melts into skin, which makes it super easy to massage into skin, and leaves my skin feeling soft!&lt;br /&gt;-It makes my skin moisturized, smooth,  &amp; silky!&lt;br /&gt;-It is completely odorless!&lt;br /&gt;-It absorbs into skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, or sticky, feeling behind on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;-I had a super bad, and please don&#x27;t laugh, burn scar on my chin that I got from a fresh out of the over Hot Pocket. Yes, I know, embarrassing...BUT after using this scar gel with a derma roller on my chin, twice a day for two months, it has completely healed it! There is no trace whatsoever of the once ugly, &amp; bad, burn scar on my chin! I was so incredibly impressed with how well this gel worked, even though it took a while to heal my scar!!&lt;br /&gt;-I have even used this gel on my fine lines and wrinkles at night before bed. I am happy to say that it has also helped to diminish the fine lines and wrinkles on my face as well! What a versatile gel!&lt;br /&gt;-It healed a scar on my arm that I had gotten when I was a teenager! So the scar was super deep, set in, and there forever - until I used this gel!&lt;br /&gt;-I love how it helped to fade some of my really deep stretch marks! I think that is just amazing!&lt;br /&gt;-It has helped to heal almost all of the bad scars I have( NOW HAD! )! I do have a few I haven&#x27;t focused on trying to heal yet, because others were more important first.....but I have NO DOUBT that this Scar Gel will help to heal, and fade them completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Premium Scar Gel is high quality and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed too! I have never had a scar gel that worked as well as this one does! I am super happy with the results it has given me, and will continue to use it! I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to heal, and fade, their scars - old or new! There is no risk in giving it a try either, because it comes with a 60 day money back guarantee! Though it worked so well for me, everyone is different, so you may not get the same results that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find The Healing Touch Premium Scar Gel - HERE - On Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** I received this product FREE in exchange for my HONEST &amp; UNBIASED FEEDBACK.

    <li> Has improved but not eradicted a scar from botched plastic surgery under my chin.  I&#x27;m still using it regularly to get as much improvement as possible.  I like that it is absorbed very quickly so putting make-up over it isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> This is a great get, I will probably get another jar once it is gone.</li>
    <li> Using this product for over a week and already see results on a fresh scar after surgery. Very thoughtful and caring seller.</li>
    <li> I received this scar gel on 02/10/15 and have used it daily since then. I can already see a major difference in my scars and highly recommend this product. You only need to use a very small amount so I am sure this jar will last an incredibly long time. With a money back guarantee even after the jar is empty, well, how can you possibly go wrong?</li>
    <li> The Premium Scar Gel by healing touch is a magical product. It works very well with continued use to fade scars and help them to become more smooth over time. It is not an instant fix solution but if used every day over a couple of months really helps to make scars much less noticeable. You do not need to pile it on just enough to make the scar area moist is enough per application. I have noticed outstanding results with this product. I would highly recommend this product to every person who wants to have a flawless skin .&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for review purposes in return for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Has helped soften and fade just in the slightest but not much. I&#x27;m wondering if my scars are too old. Almost 1 year</li>
    <li> I have dark spots on my face and upper back, and with one bottle I definitely have seen a difference. I have used the mederma scar cream before and after two bottles of the cream I saw the same results with one bottle of the healing touch. I would recommend this product whole heartedly! It&#x27;s great, the customer service is amazing how the co founder wanted to make sure if I was pleased with the product, and the eagerness to meet my expectations, and everything did! I&#x27;m purchasing the bigger bottle today, I say if anybody has any type of scars that they want to lighten this serum has been the best comparing my uses of bio oil, mederma, and spot treatments.</li>
    <li> Item was received as on time, waiting now for results from using product.</li>
    <li> Seems to help a little with scars, mostly a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Really wanted this to work but I noticed no difference in my surgery scars. Nice package and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I am very grateful that scar removal creams that ACTUALLY WORK are out there in the market today, like Passionate Care&#x27;s Maximum Strength Scar Removal Cream. I have been using it on my stomach surgery scars, on marks left by severe dermatitis/cellulitis and on nicks left by shaving accidents on my legs. I love this product because within a week of religiously using it, I can already see a big difference in the appearance of my scars. I have used popular scar removal brands in the past that didn&#x27;t really do anything for me....so I could not begin to tell all of you how thrilled I am that I found a product that actually worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I had a concern about this product and my jaw just dropped at the A+ customer relations. I&#x27;m still reviewing the product and will take pics of before &amp; after results.</li>
    <li> I had two surgeries through the same incision so I have a thick keloid on my neck that is fairly new. I tried this product but unfortunately my scar is just too new. When I told the company I was disarifisfied they didn&#x27;t even question me and gave me a full refund. I definetley suggest trying this product you have nothing to lose ( except hopefully your scar !)</li>
    <li> I decided to try Healing Touch&#x27;s Best Scar Removal Gel for myself and had such fast, remarkable results that I just had to share it with my family. My mother and I both have (had) some very noticeable scars and after using 1 jar, the scars are barely visible. Also, 2 other members of my family have severe acne that has left considerable scarring. They both had amazing results. You can see the difference in their skin smoothness and they no longer have issues with acne flare ups and ugly cysts. I&#x27;ve seen scars disappear from their faces that I thought they would have for life. I would recommend the product to anyone who is serious about scarring. If you&#x27;re one of those people who use something for a couple of days and then quit using it and badmouth it, don&#x27;t bother. If you&#x27;re serious, buy it now! It is well worth the price!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been so impressed, now I am purchasing their Best Retinol Anti-Aging Anti-wrinkle Night Cream. I am expecting great results and if I get them, I will post before and after pictures.</li>
    <li> I use the premium scar gel when I am not wearing a silicone scar sheet.  Between the gel and the scar sheet, the scar left from my hip surgery is actually fading!  The gel also sooths and relieves any pangs of pain associated with the scar.</li>
    <li> First of all I was very pleased with the speedy delivery,and it comes well packaged. Secondly the cream goes on smoothly, no burning or stinging. I have not used it that long, but I can see slight improvement on an old scrape that I have on my shin. I can&#x27;t wait to see the final results!</li>
    <li> After almost a month, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any result maybe I should use it longer</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve got bad acne scars, some old some new and this product makes a difference. You hear so many things about &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cures that expectation vs. results doesn&#x27;t always work out but really think its working. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll ever entirely go away but just in the few weeks i&#x27;ve been using it i can see a difference in my skin overall. thank you!</li>
    <li> This is an unbelievable product! I have many scars on my arms and hands from my dog. I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 1/2 weeks. Some scars are almostly completely gone-depends on size and thickness - I know those will take longer.but the redness is gone as well. I mostly bought it for my face because my dog clawed me - that I know will take a long time I just have to be patient. I highky recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i had surgery a couple months ago. I waited til my wounds completely heal before I used this product. IT MAGIC IN A BOTTLE! It&#x27;s so amazing to see just drastic results in just 10days! I can&#x27;t wait to see how it look after a month. You don&#x27;t have you apply a lot either. I just dip the tip of my finger and spread it thin across my scar making sure I rub it in really good. I use it twice a day. Definitely going to recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This product is totally useless. My scar remains the same on my face. Totally dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I have only been using for a short time; no significant improvement to date. I will continue for a reasonable amount of time before making a decision.</li>
    <li> I love this product :)  My daughter has some scarring from bad habits of picking and scratching and this product has helped clear up that scarring and instilled confidence in her body.</li>
    <li> This product is working great. I recently got a scar on my chin and it is definitely getting noticeably lighter and I have received positive comments on the appearance.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product hoping that it would help a scar on my hand.  I got it in two days, love amazon prime.  My husband and I both applied it to scars.  It really has a great consistency, not greasy or oily. Totally absorbed into the skin.  Appreciated the light scent, so anyone can use it. Being an RN, I was looking for a relatively low cost nonprescription alternative for scar remediation. And this was it! Understanding that scar removal is a long term  process.  I would recommend this product to my family.</li>
    <li> Not pleased with this product at all. I spend $35.00 and it doesn&#x27;t work. Will order something else. I regret that I wasted my money on this product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this scar treatment. I had surgery about 2 months ago, but have only been using this cream for 5 days. I use it twice a day as recommended. It is very easy to apply, only takes a few seconds to rub in and the amount used for every application is not a lot, so it will last a long time. I am already seeing whitening of the scars around the edges and an old scar that I never treated is starting to lighten also. I have had several surgeries for a broken tibia in the last 3 years and previously I had used silicone bandages (ScarAway) which I started using again this time, but as one reviewer stated they don&#x27;t seem to stick properly any more and I was not happy with them. Also, they required washing every day and came off in bed during the night. The treatment takes 12 weeks so you always have these on for that long. This cream is WAY easier to use and it is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Smoothed out dark spots and was easy on skin. No odor was nice and moisturized my skin throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I use this product faithfully, twice a day.  I can’t even remember at this point, how many jars I have ordered since I have been using it since September 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a full tummy tuck in August 2014.  Due to an old gallbladder scar, the doc not only had to make the required horizontal incision but had to make a vertical incision from right below my breast bone to the horizontal incision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the gel has been instrumental in diminishing and healing the scar.  You can barely see the left side of the horizontal scar and the right side is coming along nicely.  With the help of this gel, the vertical scar is getting better by the day.  It will take some time for that scar but I am happy with not only the outcome of the surgery, but the result from using this scar gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried another product as well as some silicone gel tape but did not like them as well as this product. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product for my acne scars. This was one of the few that had a minimal list of ingredients; easy to read and simple to research. After conducting that research, I was ready for testing. When it arrived in the mail, the packaging was very fancy. It came just as shown in the photo and seemed very high quality. The texture of the cream was not too thick and easy to apply. I am currently applying onto my skin once a week as a test for sensitivity, and slowly I will be increasing my dose. When applying the gel, I noticed the product absorbs easily and does not leave residue. I will keep everyone posted regarding my scar fading results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 20 yr old son, and he was really happy with the results, unfortunately, when I went to re-order it, this was on back-order with no date given as far as when it would be available again.</li>
    <li> The product is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to be special</li>
    <li> After a minor facial surgery, I returned to my Dermatologist for the follow up.  I had followed my Physicians post surgical instructions to the letter.  Healing was progressing well, the scar was naturally still pink and tender.  (The scar runs along the inner cheek next to the nose and is obvious.  The Physician has to open the incision twice to get all the bad cells.)  During the follow up conversation, the Specialist recommended a silicone scar cream or jell treatment.  She did not recommend a specific product.  Local Drug Stores did not have much of anything so I went on Amazon.  I read comments on multiple products and chose Healing Touch.  After several (like 3 to 6 treatments)  I saw  a difference with the scar smoothing out and healing quickly.  I wash my face before bed and lightly pat a light application directly on the scar.  While still a little pink progress continues.  Am very impressed with the products healing properties.  As always when dealing with scars, patience is important.</li>
    <li> Freaking frustrating writing this review b/c the wife told me to buy it for her and now 2 months later I&#x27;m writing amazon reviews and I asked her about it and she asked me if it can be returned. Come to find out she used it and it made No difference according to her so it was a big waste of money. sheesh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7-13-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and the seller and they both provided a refund. I upgraded my review to 4 stars simply b/c of the great customer service. The seller offered to provide a free treatment on them so that my wife can continue the treatment. I declined b/c she still has plenty left on the original purchase but some products just don&#x27;t work the same for everyone. So i don&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from not purchasing this product just b/c it did not work on my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service in a time where companies take no responsibility is far more important than the product at times.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I had a &amp;#34;disagreement&amp;#34; with my cat a few weeks ago - I lost. I was left with several large scratches on the inside of my forearm. After using this product for only a few days, I can already see the scars diminishing. Although the scars are fairly recent, I am looking forward to trying it on some older scars that I have, realizing that time and patience will play a factor. Thanks for making such an awesome gel!</li>
    <li> This is truly a miracle product for anyone who is looking for a product that actually does what it claims to do. This product gave me noticeable results within a week for an older scar that I have had for a very long time. It is does not leave the skin feeling greasy, it is very easy to apply, and you only have to apply it twice a day. I love this product and and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Amazing delivery..! Yes, it came on a sunday, as guaranteed!!! Seeing results, after just one week,! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a big difference yet, but a small difference. I used it on a 25 year old surgical scar, no difference, but on my face the acne scars are a bit better. I have used the whole jar already in 2 months because I use it on my whole face. Works well as a moisturizer too.</li>
    <li> I have seen a marked improvement on my keloid scars after only 30 days.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product expecting great things after reading the reviews.  I don&#x27;t have superficial flesh wounds or acne scars. I had open abdominal surgery that left me with an 8 inch dark purple scar down my stomach.  I have been using this for 6 weeks 2-3 times a day, massaging it into the scar and I don&#x27;t see the slightest improvement.  And this is after using Mederma for 6 weeks.  So 12 weeks into scar treatment and it still looks just as bad.  The texture is nice, the smell is not offputting, it absorbs easily.... but I would say if you have large surgical scars, don&#x27;t expect it to work like it does on the cosmetic scars people keep giving it rave reviews for. I will finish the jar and the description does say for larger or older scars it may need to be used longer, but I would have expected a noticeable difference by now.  At this point, i think the scar starts to fade and blend on it&#x27;s own and I could have saved myself the expense!</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this product, I have to say that I was quite skeptical in how this would compare to Mederma PM. My husband had surgery in early May and needed something to make his surgical scar less noticeable. Since he&#x27;s been using this product (May 18th, to be exact), his scar is now COMPLETELY FLATTENED and much less noticeable. I have to say how impressed I am, and I will never go back to Mederma again. Thanx for an excellent product!!!! Repeat customer? Umm, yes please!!!!</li>
    <li> Im just wasting my money for this product..my scars doesn&#x27;t go away</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. I had open heart surgery last March with a substantial scar. This stuff goes on easily. I am depending on the previous good reviews and expect to see visible results soon. I can already (after a couple of weeks) see some improvement. This stuff s expensive but should be well worth it.</li>
    <li> The cream seems to be working.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.  What impressed me was the follow-up to make sure I received the product but the use of it .  I&#x27;ll keep using it as it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I brought the product for my acne marks. It wasn&#x27;t helpful. The reason I gave it 5 star was because my 2 year old ran pass the table and hit his face. His face bruised immediately. I rubbed the cream on his face every day for a week and the scar is barely noticeable. Thanks for saving my little guy face. He calls it the booboo cream. Lol</li>
    <li> I have been used it for 3 weeks only and already noticed little improvement, I will continue using it and will post another review later on.</li>
    <li> Bought this product some time ago, had some left over and used it again. Was still amazing! Used it on a very noticeable scar on the middle of my face and had amazing results!</li>
    <li> Delivered way before I expected and am pleased with your product thank you</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> it works pretty good haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but barely started using it, so far so good.</li>
    <li> Been using for over a month and haven&#x27;t notice any changes on any of my scars. Maybe it works for others but not so much for me.</li>
    <li> not sure yet needs a lot more time but seems good directions could have been bigger</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now. No results yet but I&#x27;ll continue using till the cream runs out.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this.  I wish I had known that it was on Amazon earlier.  I purchased this for my father in law who had open heart surgery.  I am going to have him apply it to his chest and leg incisions so it doesn’t scar bad.  You see I myself had knee surgery earlier in the year and a friend of mine gave me this cream, she said it did WONDERS on her C - Section incision.  So I tried it just like they said I should.  I applied it twice a day to the incision.  There was no stinging, there was no bad smell and it didn’t cause any extra pain.  In fact it kinda felt nice because it was cool to the touch.  Several weeks later WoW, you couldn’t even see it (well you could very slightly but only if you knew where to look).  I have been wearing shorts all summer and no one has even asked me about my knee cuz I don’t think they can even tell.  I can’t wait to see my father in laws results; I know we are going to be happy.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but works slow don&#x27;t really erase scars just dims it</li>
    <li> It really is not as I expected.</li>
    <li> Quite impressed! The redness reduced significantly in the first WEEK. Long term results still pending</li>
    <li> I used it on an area where I had stitches and was getting a little bumpy.  In just a short time the gel flatten out the bumpy area and is making the area look great. They promised it would work or my money back, well it worked.</li>
    <li> I had bypass surgery on Nov 22, 2013 which left a large ugly scar down the center of my chest.&lt;br /&gt;I swim and go to the beach whenever I can and am somewhat self conscious about the scar.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this gel in April and have been applying it 2X a day, and I can honestly tell you that my scar is fading.&lt;br /&gt;Although the scar is still noticeable I am not nearly as self conscious about it as I once was, and it becomes lighter and lighter all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for fading your scars.  If my scar wasn&#x27;t so big to start with, I don&#x27;t think it would be noticeable now.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
    <li> My scar I had for  3months is still the same I purchased this scar remover 3weeks ago using 3times still no improvement</li>
    <li> I just bought my second jar because it has come in handy.  I purchased my first one some time ago for a small burn on my hand. The small burn was no match for the scar gel, in fact I didn’t even have to use it all, at least on myself I didn’t.  I have been using that gel for all types of scrapes and bumps that my kids have gotten into and it has done the trick each time and everytime.  Even though summer is coming to an end the accidents and skirmishes that my kids get into have not so I am staying ahead of the game by getting another one.  Thanks for making it; I just wished you had it in a bigger jar.  I would buy it.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it was going to be a lot more then what I got and then on top of that I get an email telling it&#x27;s going to take up to two years of putting g the stuff on before all markings are gone. Well I used up most of the small thing in a month on only a small area. I can&#x27;t be buying it every month for two year at this price!</li>
    <li> Broke 4 metatarsals  &amp; bones shifted 6/28/14 on right foot which required surgery. Anyone that wants to know how: I was doing the NO-NO looking at my cell phone while walking down a flight of stairs and mis-stepped!!! OUCH  My pain was worse with the break of course then after surgery (go figure).  First time I&#x27;ve ever broken anything or had any surgery in my life and I&#x27;m 48.  Childbirth (3) all natural so trust me I did my homework because I absolutely love my ethnic skin and have always taken excellent care of it.  So I Pre-purchased this from the reviews so that when the wounds closed and healing started couldn&#x27;t wait to apply.  I&#x27;m now 4 weeks non bearing out of 8 weeks and 2 surgical wounds later I&#x27;m now applying to the parts of the incisions that are without scabs and closed.  It&#x27;s very soothing and cool to the touch and a little goes a long way.  You don&#x27;t have to saturate this has ample coverage.  I believed in it from the reviews but can&#x27;t speak on results.  I&#x27;ll see if I&#x27;m allowed to post again in 60 days since they have a 60 day refund process.  I love it for now how it makes my skin feel in that area.  I&#x27;m planning on keeping a jar just for safe keeping.  You never know :-)  Another thing I love how it stays cool because of the type of jar it&#x27;s in, no need to refrigerate.  It&#x27;s like giving your skin a popsicle it feels so cool!!!  God Bless</li>
    <li> This product is one of many I have tried. The price was high for what I received, container wasnt full, (about half). Clear product, no odor , and not sticky, goes on smooth. I cant say that I have really noticed any significant changes in scarring, and have used the whole product. Doubtful that I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was really worried about my incision itching because sometimes you can get that problem with Mederma but my incision is healing without any itching!  5 Stars in my book.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading the reviews for scars. Did not see any improvement after using for few weeks together. Stopped using this now.</li>
    <li> Been using it on some very small scars for a couple weeks. They&#x27;ve already disappeared!</li>
    <li> It lightened up an old burn on my arm from a pale pink to white, which in my pale case is hardly noticeable. Burn&#x27;s original origin was 3 years prior bumping skin against hot lawn mower motor. So skin just had a pale patch that even removed freckles! But now the pink color has faded and it blends in with my skin so much better.That was the best result I got with it.&lt;br /&gt;It did not help a facial scar from a dog bite that is about an inch long and 20 years old at all, which was the main goal.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try and eliminate (or at least minimize) the effects of some poison oak scarring. Other reviews make this seem like a great treatment for more obvious scars, and maybe thats true... but it literally did nothing for my scarring and mine is very recent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this stuff twice a day quite liberally and made it through an entire jar. For $40~ per tiny jar, I would hope for something positive... even a little progress and I would have bought another jar to try and finish it off. This may work for other purposes, but I cannot verify that and can only account for how well it performs to poison-related scarring... and that is poorly.</li>
    <li> Didnt work at all. The jar was half full when I received it. It did make my skin soft and I used it as directed and seen no results. Save your money</li>
    <li> Purchased for scars on my hands and legs (from shaving) - Worked excellent on my legs - scars were noticeable diminished in just a few days - esp fresh razor scratches and scars - softened my hands, but did not see any noticable effect on a scar from a burn nor a scar from a deep cut on my hand.</li>
    <li> Learn from me.  i followed all directions.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> So far this is the only scar product that hasn&#x27;t made me itch. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday, and the scar is starting to lighten up</li>
    <li> I had bi-lateral knee replacement surgery and started using this cream twice a day after the bandages were removed and healing had started. I am amazed at how scars on both knees have healed and lightened. Even my surgeon was impressed. The cream is very light and goes a long way. The customer service from this company was absolutely wonderful. I actually received a &#x27;thank you&#x27; email for purchasing the cream and a follow-up email to make sure that I was happy with their product. Would highly recommend this cream to anyone</li>
    <li> I purchased the Best Scar Removal Gel w/Silicone give or take about three weeks ago. So I guess you would categorize my stage of treatment, Stage 1 still. I have both acne scaring on the left side of my neck, as well as some surgical scars on both of my arms that I purchased and am using Best Scar Removal Gel on. I would say I have been able to tell a difference. Now as to how much of a difference, well that is a little bit harder to tell at this early stage. This is my first Jar of Best Scar Removal Gel that I have purchased and I am close to being at the bottom of the jar, so I would say that a jar lasts anywhere from four to five weeks, depending on several  factors, One would be how large of an area are you treating, and two would be how often a day are you applying the gel and last, how much of it are you using. Just to remind you when I started using the Best Scar Removal Gel, I stopped all previous treatments. The results I have seem thus far is that the scars are much less noticeable, my skin is firmer and the elasticity seems to of come back. I will definitely continue to use this Scar Removal Gel for at least another Twelve weeks(3 Jars). The thing you have to understand is that this, just like any other promising Scar Removing Gel or Cream takes time and patience. Some people will see quicker results than others and that is to be expected. But in the end, the way I see it, if someone like me does not see significant results after using 4 jars, either A, It is not working or B, that is about as good as it is going to get for me. I wish you all the best of results. I hope my review helps those who may have questions or those of you who are in doubt about this product even working. The way I see it what do you have to loose, the company does offer a  money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> I was sorry this product just didn&#x27;t cut it.  After my arterial bypass surgery in both legs, I needed something to lessen the scar and take away the red.  This product lessened the scar, but the red was still there after two jars.  Decided to go with Scar Away.</li>
    <li> I love it, I used it a while ago and I try to keep a spare just in case. I myself also use it on the occasional scratches and scraped knees.  However this time its not for me.  When something works, you just have to share it.  I&#x27;m buying this one for my cousin.</li>
    <li> Did not work well removing my wife&#x27;s scar.  We are looking for other alternatives.</li>
    <li> My friend strongly recommended this scar gel.  I am so glad she did.  The gel comes in a pretty bag and feels cool and soft on my skin.  Does not leave residual and is not oily or leave a shiny look. Does it work?  Lets just say you would never know that my curling iron sometimes fights back ;)</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; After several weeks of using this scar removal gel i can see results improving the scars from my foot operation. The red and rough surrounding the incisions have lessened and my foot is becoming smooth and clear. So far i have used about half the jar with great results, can&#x27;t wait to see how my foot looks after using all this scar removal gel.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product has really helped fade my scars. Thank you for the prompt shipping and fine product.</li>
    <li> I had to get three stitches just below the bridge of my nose because of a body surfing incident and face planting into a sandbar.  oops!  Well the cut was too deep for glue s&amp;#34;stitches&amp;#34; and I was given three threaded stitches.  I waited 10 days to have the stitches removed while I constantly moisturized the wound with a triple antibiotic for those days.  Once the stitches were removed their was still a gash and I started to apply this scar mover gel immediately.  After 10 days of use 2x a day my scar is almost nonexistent. BUT is was my skin was still red at and around the wound so I use another cream that works awesome for the redness, dry skin and sunspots called Medicine Mama&#x27;s Apothecary Sweet Bee Magic All in One Healing Skin Cream, I found this cream while researching for scar removal.  I highly suggest using one after the other but not together?  When I was happy with my scar removal I then applied this other gel.  You can try both at once but I&#x27;d certainly recommend at least waiting for the &amp;#34;Best Scar Removal gel&amp;#34; to dry first.</li>
    <li> I received this nicely packaged. I do like it but it&#x27;s too soon to tell whether or not it&#x27;s working. Will definitely send an update soon. Thanks</li>
    <li> This cream REALLY works. I was skeptical of all the reviews but since using this item on my surgical scar, I have seen a noticeable change in it&#x27;s appearance. I use it religiously.</li>
    <li> I had breast reduction surgery on July 22nd, about 4 weeks ago. I have been using your product for the last 10 or 11 days and my scars are almost invisible. This scar gel is amazing, and I&#x27;m shocked that more people aren&#x27;t singing it&#x27;s praises! I had a follow up appointment with my plastic surgeon today, both he and the nurse were speechless at how well I had healed and how my anchor scars are nearly invisible.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Amazing results! Photo attached is after using this product on my scar for 2 days! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes either! I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money. I have used it as indicated and haven&#x27;t had ANY results. Will stick with what is known. I am Very disappointed and will never buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product for those of you who may have seen my first review. I would just like to follow it up by letting you know that it is really helping me- my scars from recent surgery have lost that angry red appearance, and the way the cream feels when I put it on is so refreshing and soothing. I was comfortable recommending this product before, but now after extended use, I am enthusiastic about doing so!</li>
    <li> I’m happy, you will be too.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been looking for a great scar cream because life happens all the time.  Well my search is over, if you want a cream that really makes all of your scratches and cuts disappear then you can be confident that your search is over too.  I don’t have any large scars but this cream makes all my small ones go away fast and I like that! I keep it handy, because like I said: life happens.</li>
    <li> I have seen what old staple scars can look like on people and it was not a look I was interested. in.  So I used this scar gel, boy I&#x27;m glad I did.  It looks great!  But I need to be clear and say that I was strict about using it as directed.  So as long as you are firm about using it as directed then you should be great too!</li>
    <li> If you have a keloid scar then you know mentally bothersome they can be.  Well I feel a lot better about mine now.  The gel completely flattened it and also did a great job of fading it (though you can still see it a little, but you have to look).  It wasn&#x27;t a large scar but it still bothered me enough to try something.  This something worked.</li>
    <li> The scar gel is working amazingly well for me. I haven’t been using it long and my scar is almost completely gone. I recently got a burn on my hand from some flying grease (it really hurt!).  I like my hands and didn’t want it to permanently show so I purchase the scar gel and started using it.  I only had to use a little at a time. It absorbed really easily on my skin. It didn’t have any medicine like smell which I appreciate and it didn’t itch. In just a few days I was like WOW!  It healed so fast.  I’m sure surgeries and stuff take longer to heal but if you have small grease like burn then this is your ticket. My hand looks great!&lt;br /&gt;Plus the jar came beautifully wrapped!</li>
    <li> I can speak for myself and say that the premium scar gel works.  I’ve used it before and that is why I am reordering it.  For those who say it doesn’t work for them, maybe it’s true or maybe they are not using it right because I have used it several times and I have always been happy.  I also want to add that the price is better here on Amazon than what I have paid before.  Go Amazon!</li>
    <li> its ok but must apply multiple times per day. Initially caused alot of redness</li>
    <li> It did the trick. It flattened my scar completely and it&#x27;s really fading away now. The fading is a bonus for me because I was just focused on the flattening part. I hated that my scar was bumpy and raised, so I have tried a few other products (plus some embarrassing family recipes and old wives tales tricks) but it&#x27;s like I wasn&#x27;t even trying because my scar didn&#x27;t change. I hated that. It may have softened up a bit but that&#x27;s all. Then I tried the scar gel and it changed everything for me.  From now on no more baking soda (did I just say that out loud?), it&#x27;s the scar gel for me.</li>
    <li> Yes the bottle is pretty and yes it comes in an amazing little bag but at the end of the day what really matters is results.  Well I am happy to say that “Yes” it came through with great results. You will never see a before and after picture of me because of the nature of the scar. But I do know how great it works and if you are reading this review, well sorry, you will just have to take my word for it.</li>
    <li> Their customer service is AMAZING!  I just need to say that right out front.  They follow up with your concerns or questions right away.  Elizabeth at customer service took really good care of me (thanks girl!).  I am very happy with my results, my scar is flattening out nicely and it’s even starting to fade. 5 stars all the way.</li>
    <li> The customer service alone is worth 5 star. Been a month now and haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my scars however</li>
    <li> This is the first time I order a scar product so I wasn’t sure which product to order.  This product has the better reviews so that is why I ordered this one. I know it costs a little more but the way my skins looks is important to me. I know I didn’t have a large scar, but guess what? Now it’s even smaller. I think it’s going to go away completely. Thanks</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and I can already tell a difference.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for my scare</li>
    <li> Hi Raul,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a week into using it and in all honesty, it has been amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had mammoplasty January 20 and had gone through the usual vitamin E, mederma, all of them.  The scars got so bad last week they were red, angry looking, and super painful; I couldn&#x27;t move and anything that came in contact with them was agoninzing.  I called the doctor&#x27;s office for a faster follow up.  The cream arrived April 1 and I started using 2x daily.  The improvement has been amazing!  Within 3 days the scars were no longer bumpy, now they are shrinking in size, and some are fading.  I&#x27;ll have to reorder I expect in a few weeks, completely worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took photos (rated totally G) before I started.  Will take again at the 3 week mark.  The doctor today was thrilled with the outcome, and very happy with the cream as water is the first ingredient and not oil or a silicone so it doesn&#x27;t clog the pores.</li>
    <li> First let me share that I am a critical care nurse. So I am picky about what I use. A friend of mine told me that I had to use this and I am so glad I did. I had quite the gash on my forearm from sports. I used the cream just for a few weeks and now I can barely even see the scar. Don&#x27;t believe me? check out my picture. Strongly, strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using the cream for three months and really don&#x27;t see much change on my scar..</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is rich and thick and goes on easily and works to remove scars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it daily for about 2 months on a surgical scar. Honestly, it dies nothing at all. I notice absolutely no difference what-so-ever. I was expecting at least SOME result based on some of the great reviews bu tdid not get any result at all. I would chalk it up to very overpriced snake oil. Sorry, was hoping for better. Will ask my dermitologist if he has any recommendations.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this product. It has helped me with my new scars</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if creams really work but I wanted to something for my acne scars. This has the best reviews so I picked it. WOW! That&#x27;s all I gotta say. It took about a month but it finally did the trick.  You would never know I had a severe acne problem, my face looks that good. There a two small spots that look like small pits and even though that didn&#x27;t go away it still looks better because the darkness faded from it. I told all my friends about it and they are now customers too.</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money.  It did nothing to remove scars and evaporated quickly in the jar even if you keep the lid tight.  Completely useless.  Worse product so far that I have purchased online.</li>
    <li> I am using this on scars from abdominal surgery. I see a difference after one container in the color for sure, but not in the texture.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have bought this in August for both me and my father. My dad had left over dark spots due to having shingles and this product lightened and evened his skin tone in those areas within a week and a half. I personally had 5 stitches on my arm due to a kitchen incident and I feared I would have a terrible scar that everyone will notice. But I have been using this since mid august and it has helped my stitches heal and look concealed. I use it twice a day and I still have a ton left in the container to last me probably end of this year. My dad used a decent amount but stopped after 3 weeks since his scars fully went away. I truly recommend and personally am grateful for the seller to have made this product. They have amazing customer service but their product is honest and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Great product! I gave it a 4 start rating because it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see true results. I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks and so far I really like how it absorbs into the skin, and I have started to see some scars reducing in color. I am applying this product on Breast Lift procedure.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it. I use it twice a day. Once in the morning, once at night. Simple and effective, I like things that way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sad to say it didn&#x27;t work for me 😔 I was super excited and have seen no results.</li>
    <li> I have really seen a great improvement in my scars. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt about it is obvious that my scars are fading.  I am applying it twice a day (most of the time, sometimes I forget) and I don&#x27;t use too much.  Its working so I&#x27;m going to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift to a friend and it is working perfect.</li>
    <li> Fantastic even in places that are...awkward!</li>
    <li> I received the product and began using it immediately. I don’t know if it’s the product or just my natural healing but it looks really good.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; This gel is EXCELLENT, but I have sensitive skin and have to be very careful not to get it on my skin (causes breakouts), but was amazed at how quickly it helped.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Been using for months does not work well. Thought scar would be much less by now.</li>
    <li> No result. Not working</li>
    <li> Worked great on my scar will buy again</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything, I feel totally ripped off..</li>
    <li> I have received the product as promised by my Amazon prime membership. This is my second order for this product. I really felt it has helped improve the healing of my scar. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using i think for almost 2 weeks and i started seeing my scars fading. Something i noticed is that it fades body scars faster than facial acne scars.  I will definitely keep using this product because i truly believe that it does what its suppose to do. Very very good product and great customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a mth it so and i see no changes. I wish i could get my money back smh</li>
    <li> By no means this works well for keloids (even small ones), but this certainly is the best product that I have tried. It reduces significantly (about a quarter) of the size of larger keloids (after 2 months). For some reason, it does not work on new form keloids very well. No irritation  whatsoever. And a bottle could last about 2-3 months, maybe longer. I just ordered the second jar. I still suggest going to surgery if one has time. I simply don&#x27;t, so this works for me.</li>
    <li> Scares do fade with this product</li>
    <li> If you have a keloid scar (like me), it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all. I used this as directed for over a month and saw absolutely no difference.</li>
    <li> So far has not done Nothing for my scars! I have had it for about two months and bought three jars of this stuff!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I absolutely love this product. It only look one day for me to notice the difference! It is worth every penny! The customer service was also amazing. Someone from the company personally contacted me to see what I thought about the product. WAY BETTER THAN MEDERMA!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick. The gel is light and non-sticky which is what I like. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week so don&#x27;t see the big difference yet. I&#x27;ll add to my review in few weeks.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I would recommend this product 100% In LOVE!</li>
    <li> I had my face nearly ripped off in a car accident less than a year ago (I was ejected face first through a car window).  I started using this gel maybe 6 weeks after having all my stitches removed.  Today, 10 months later, you can barely see my scars.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I thought I was going to need plastic surgery.  I can only imagine how they&#x27;ll look in another 10 months.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I received the package on the second day after i ordered it:) i started using it this morning, I like it so far. Hope it will work for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this immediately after being scratched by my dog in the face. This product worked amazingly well. There is no scar or even lighter skin pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product 3-4 days ago, so I have not seen any results yet but from all the reviews and great customer service I have received, I have no doubt in my mind that it will work. The product does not stink, it absorbs well in your skin and it leaves your skin feeling smooth. I have stretchmarks on my obliques and lower back from a recent bulk up and its embarrassing to me. The CEO of this company had personally answered my questions about the product, and I am satisfied thus far. You will not go wrong if you buy the product as you are guaranteed with their 60 day money back guarantee. I will update my review, after further use.</li>
    <li> Helpful. Thank you.  My wife is using it, because it helps her very much and she is very happy with it. She is advertising it all over the family and explain to them how useful and effective is your product.  I am very happy and pleased to hear that. and Thank you very much. and I will keep buying your product as long as it is useful to my wife and family now. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> This is truly a PREMIUM product,from the quality of the packaging to the actual cream itself.  I highly recommend this product.  Thanks Healing Touch....Please make some more creams!!!</li>
    <li> I like the reviews for the Premium Scar Gel.</li>
    <li> I bought this for some scars that I was self conscious about and they have already become less noticeable. I would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Ordered twice, saw no results.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and the service is the best.  I have been using this several days now and it does ease my scars.  Highly recommend the cream.</li>
    <li> Even though the healing process took time, keloids stopped developing and the scar is flat due to regular use of the Scar Cream.  It works!  I am satisfied!</li>
    <li> Maybe ok on raised scars,  didn&#x27;t help my sunken in acne scars on my face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 6 months and have not noticed any differences at all.  The costumer service is wonderful, but I&#x27;m just not sure this product works.  People say it helps their healing scars, but they wouldn&#x27;t know how the scars would have looked if they didn&#x27;t put the cream on...so there&#x27;s no way to test if this product really works.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I found this scar cream.  I had an eyelid and eyebrow lift that left me with raised scars and a lot of redness.  Someone suggested Mederma and another over-the-counter silicone scar product.  Both made my eyebrows and eyes itch terribly.  I had to use cortizone cream for several days to take the itch away.  Then I found this product and had my fingers crossed that i would not experience the same side effects.  This cream is actually very soothing to put on.  I experienced no side effects what so ever.  I would highly recommend this product.  It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Very professional.  Received product promptly and it really helps to prevent scarring form cuts and scrapes.  I would highly recommend this product, worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> In just a few days I saw dramatic results. I applied it in the morning and right before I went to bed.  Easy to do and it felt good on my skin. No strong odor (I hate creams with strong fragrances). It didn’t smear on my sheets or clothes. Who knew that scar gels actually worked?  Well this one does. Try it with confidence because I certainly will buy again in the future as needed.</li>
    <li> I just started using it a few days ago on my scars from my breast surgery in June, 2014. I&#x27;m already seeing results and the scars are disappearing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little late with this review...but new reasons to use this product kept cropping up and of course it takes time to see results. Your patience will pay off however as this gel does what it claims with ongoing use. I had a bad roller blading accident several months ago and the two scars on my face are no longer there due to the use of this gel. I had a larger scar on my shoulder and that is very faint now and only noticeable to me since I know where it was. I always have a use for this gel as I either burn myself with the curling iron or get some scrape from hiking. I&#x27;m pleased with this product and the company&#x27;s customer service is impeccable and communicative. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is the best cream I have ever used and with several inches of scars on multiple scars the results are great.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t remove any of my facial scars</li>
    <li> Waste of money! Did not do anything for my scars</li>
    <li> I love the way this gel goes on my tummy tuck scar. I have to reapply 2-3 times if I don&#x27;t use scar strips, but, for the price it is great. Will continue to buy this product from the same seller.</li>
    <li> It did remove a small scar I had on my hand, at least it makes the scar look not that obvious. I just used it for three weeks.</li>
    <li> Have been using cream for 2 months, I&#x27;ve yet to notice any fading or lightening of my scar.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion/gel for about a month and a half for a scar that developed right under my eye around my eye socket after falling while mountain biking about three months ago.  The scar has not significantly improved while using this cream twice a day.  It has gotten slightly better, but I attribute that more to the natural healing process than to the cream.  I have tried several different creams and lotions during the course of the last few months and have not seen results with any of them. It may be attributed to where the scar is located, but I have not seen good results with any scar healing products.</li>
    <li> ive been using this product since the end of May at least 3 times a day&lt;br /&gt;-once in the morning&lt;br /&gt;-in the afternoon or before lunch&lt;br /&gt;-and before I go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The scar on my face has lightened a lot and i&#x27;m hoping&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;ll be even more lighter with another 3 weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely advice this to my friends and whoever read this. (give it a try!!!!)</li>
    <li> This product is the BEST! I had a scar on my hand from months ago and after just 2 applications it is almost gone!&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using it on the scars on my stomach from a recent surgery once the Dr tells me they have healed properly.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing Product!!</li>
    <li> I started using the product a week after the removal of a total of  9 stitches on the left side of my face in three different areas near my eye.  Not pretty at all!  Thanks to this scar treatment product I am hopeful that my scars will be barely noticeable in a couple of months. Excellent product and I will continue to us it on other scars, I hope not to get, in the future!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; The gel arrived very quickly. I have used the gel for 6 days now. I have two identical bilateral scars. As an experiment, on one side I am using the gel and on the other side I was using over-the-counter moisturizer, as recommended by my doctor. I have now switched to using the gel on both sides because, even after only 6 days, I could tell a difference.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great customer service by this company!!  This is the only scar cream that has shown any signs of improvements for me so far, but depending on how old or severe your scars are the &amp;#34;healing time&amp;#34; will vary.  I say this because some of my scars are doing better than others with this cream, but i think that all due to time.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar of this cream.  The only complaint i have for this product is the cost, but i guess you get what you pay for.  However, i think if the company changed their container to a less expensive jar that cost saving could be put towards lowering the cost of the product.  There&#x27;s a lot of nice jars out there that&#x27;s not made of glass.</li>
    <li> Light-weight and not greasy! Arrived very quickly!</li>
    <li> I bought this originally for acne scar removal. It works slowly, but I&#x27;ve discovered it does wonders for your tired eyes!!! I put it on every night before bed and since then my eyes are much brighter!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd jar and I see no improvement on my scars.&lt;br /&gt;How many jars will it take?</li>
    <li> Great product, I received it quickly. Feels classy and high end.  The jar looks awesome and the bag it comes in makes it discreet (I appreciate that).  On the other hand it looks just like a gift bag. Very happy so far.</li>
    <li> I have used the cream for about a month and I definitely see improvement.  My scar is an old one, so I understand that it may take more time to fade completely, but I am pleased with the results I am seeing!</li>
    <li> Waste of money, go get a chemical peel or microdermabrasion instead</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Not greasy.  Really helps improve scars.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; The scar gel actually arrived the day after I ordered it. I was surprised at how quickly I received it! I bought it for a particular acne scar on my face, but have since been using it on multiple scars in addition to that one, some new and some old. I have been using the cream since last Wednesday and I can already tell that my acne scar has lightened! I love this cream because it&#x27;s lightweight, non greasy, and absorbs into skin easily. I can&#x27;t wait to keep using this gel and continue to see results! Thank you for your great customer service.</li>
    <li> I think the cream is a pretty good one however it has only been one week of use and this scar is definitely still there although not as aparent as before.  I suppose over time it might remove it but right now it&#x27;s just a little faded. However I used it on my face (the scar is on my face) and my skin appears to be very smooth so I like the way it makes my skin feel and with that I would say 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me on my surgery scars,however it was a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for two weeks now on my raised burn scar, and I have already seen huge improvements.  This product was recommended through a friend and I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better product.  I would highly recommend this product to others that have suffered tissue damage due to being burned.  It works miracles!</li>
    <li> Over priced and it only work on keloid skin if there is swelling by bringing the swelling down but does not minimize scar</li>
    <li> Works well.  I can see the difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> the scar gel I received has been working really well so far. My cat scratched my face pretty deeply and since using the gel on the scars after they healed, I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in the prominence of the scar. Great product and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this buy!</li>
