### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I think this product is awesome!</li>
      <li>I have used it couple of times, and it works perfect</li>
      <li>I LOVED IT!</li>
      <li>I have been using the YouCurl wand (Conair) for over a year, and have loved it!</li>
      <li>It was a christmas gift and she loved it!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great price, great product I love this Spiral Curling Iron.</li>
      <li>I received this product on time and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>Great price, fast shipping, great product.</li>
      <li>My hair is typically very easy to curl and holds curl</li>
      <li>This is one of the better irons I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>and i love it, five stars.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>more gadgety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is curled in record time and it leaves my hair shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>and I have to say I am pretty good at using this type of curling iron</li>
      <li>My hair is VERY long, so this size barrel should be perfect, but it doesn&#x27;t do the trick.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s barrel was too large for my hair, so I gave it to my daughter and she loved it, and I ordered another for myself.</li>
      <li>It is not so easy to make the curls</li>
      <li>It was cheap for a reason.</li>
      <li>Fast and  beautiful way to create a&amp;#34; new person&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and the curls stay in her hair all day.</li>
      <li>Heats up really quickly too.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so pretty!</li>
      <li>I did not like this curling iron because the clip portion that holds your hair so that you can wind it around the spirals is too lose and your hair slips right out.  </li>
      <li>will just buy another larger sized Conair model (the original model that worked perfectly for me for 2 years doesn&#x27;t seem to have a large enough size, so I have to try a different model from the same manufacturer) lets hope that it works as well as the original!</li>
      <li>real well exactly what I was look for for a spiral curl I like it !</li>
      <li>My hair is thick and it does a great job.</li>
      <li>I wanted pretty spiral curls, but I couldn&#x27;t make it work.  </li>
      <li>Great for long or short hair.</li>
      <li>On Christmas day, my daughter opened the curling iron and did her hair, loved it, and has been using it everyday since then.</li>
      <li>The spirals are purely decorative</li>
      <li>My daughter really likes this curling iron.  </li>
      <li>so there is no way for you to know what setting you are using, what temperature you are on, and if you happen to hit the right temperature by coincidence, there is no way you can replicate that experience next time</li>
      <li>Now my hair has gotten longer and so the diameter of my YouCurl created much tighter curls than I like, so I was simply trying to buy a similar product but of wider diameter, but this is obviously not the right choice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, only it means they really don&#x27;t have any purpose other than to make it look</li>

<li> , only it means they really don&#x27;t have any purpose other than to make it look</li>
<li> i had a really hard time using this tool and getting my hair into the spirals, and i found that if i didn&#x27;t, the curls wouldn&#x27;t look right or sprirally at all.</li>
<li> Even when turning the dial to the maximum (at least I think its the maximum, again since there are no labels on the dial), the wand never got hot enough to actually create any</li>
<li> You barely have to touch the off button for the curler to turn off, but you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s off until you realize it&#x27;s not hot anymore.  </li>
<li> and u have to wait a long time to get it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;m probably doing something wrong, but after all the other issues, it&#x27;s not worth trying to figure it out.</li>
<li> I would order the next size down if I had to do it over again.</li>
<li> (yes, really, no numbers!)</li>
<li> Unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t give the same &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; as my smaller one.  </li>
<li> but this was a waste of my money.</li>
<li> /&gt;This is the second wider wand that I have tried and both were terrible (the other one was the Remington Keratin infused wand, which was only a minor improvement from this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Eh, it&#x27;s just too hard to use.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other spiral curling irons and never had a problem, but no matter where I start, I am always winding the wrong direction.  </li>
<li> but sorry i was disappointed!!!</li>

    <li> I think this product is awesome! It curled my hair without the burning smell. My hair is curled in record time and it leaves my hair shiny and healthy. I LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> It is not so easy to make the curls and u have to wait a long time to get it.</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes this curling iron.  It heats up quickly and the curls stay in her hair all day.</li>
    <li> I did not like this curling iron because the clip portion that holds your hair so that you can wind it around the spirals is too lose and your hair slips right out.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I dig it works real well exactly what I was look for for a spiral curl I like it !</li>
    <li> I won a smaller barreled iron just like this one and thought I could get bigger spirals with this one.  Unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t give the same &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; as my smaller one.  I would order the next size down if I had to do it over again.</li>
    <li> It was a christmas gift and she loved it! That is all I have to say about it. The end.</li>
    <li> Fast and  beautiful way to create a&amp;#34; new person&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron but sorry i was disappointed!!! It just didnt work well at all . I don&#x27;t understand why the corkscrew isn&#x27;t longer on it!. It didnt grab the hair well and I have to say I am pretty good at using this type of curling iron, I have a 3/4 to 1 inch size and I have no problem with it. I bought this size for a looser curl but it didnt work out .</li>
    <li> Yuck. Can only roll one direction or ur hair gets lines from spirals. It was cheap for a reason. Gave to my niece.</li>
    <li> I have used it couple of times, and it works perfect</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, great product. I love it. My hair is thick and it does a great job. The curls last all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using the YouCurl wand (Conair) for over a year, and have loved it! Now my hair has gotten longer and so the diameter of my YouCurl created much tighter curls than I like, so I was simply trying to buy a similar product but of wider diameter, but this is obviously not the right choice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Using the base clip is not very intuitive, maybe its just me, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use the clip and twist my hair around it properly quickly enough (I&#x27;m sure if I spent some time on it, it would have been OK, but who has time to spend trying to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; on using a curling iron?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The spirals are purely decorative I think, there is almost no way for your hair to neatly fall between the spirals, so it just wraps around and over them, which in itself is no big deal, only it means they really don&#x27;t have any purpose other than to make it look more gadgety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The heat adjustment knob has no numbers on it (yes, really, no numbers!) so there is no way for you to know what setting you are using, what temperature you are on, and if you happen to hit the right temperature by coincidence, there is no way you can replicate that experience next time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Even when turning the dial to the maximum (at least I think its the maximum, again since there are no labels on the dial), the wand never got hot enough to actually create any curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second wider wand that I have tried and both were terrible (the other one was the Remington Keratin infused wand, which was only a minor improvement from this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will just buy another larger sized Conair model (the original model that worked perfectly for me for 2 years doesn&#x27;t seem to have a large enough size, so I have to try a different model from the same manufacturer) lets hope that it works as well as the original!</li>
    <li> Eh, it&#x27;s just too hard to use.  I wanted pretty spiral curls, but I couldn&#x27;t make it work.  Probably operator error on my part.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product I love this Spiral Curling Iron. It makes my hair so pretty! Great for long or short hair.</li>
    <li> i had a really hard time using this tool and getting my hair into the spirals, and i found that if i didn&#x27;t, the curls wouldn&#x27;t look right or sprirally at all. i got the Goody Heat Wave Creator Styling Iron instead and i love it, five stars. i&#x27;ll probably give the revlon iron away.</li>
    <li> On Christmas day, my daughter opened the curling iron and did her hair, loved it, and has been using it everyday since then. Loves it!</li>
    <li> I received this product on time and in good condition.  I would have returned it, but I just missed the return by date.  The on and off buttons are placed in the same area that you hold the curler.  You barely have to touch the off button for the curler to turn off, but you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s off until you realize it&#x27;s not hot anymore.  Also the clip to hold the hair leaves a crimpped mark.  I&#x27;ve used other spiral curling irons and never had a problem, but no matter where I start, I am always winding the wrong direction.  I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;m probably doing something wrong, but after all the other issues, it&#x27;s not worth trying to figure it out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.  My hair is VERY long, so this size barrel should be perfect, but it doesn&#x27;t do the trick.  My hair is typically very easy to curl and holds curl well but this was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better irons I&#x27;ve purchased. It&#x27;s barrel was too large for my hair, so I gave it to my daughter and she loved it, and I ordered another for myself.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ll take it with me to Europe (dual voltage). Heats up really quickly too. I like it a lot.</li>
