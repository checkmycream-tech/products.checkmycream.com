<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t received the item I ordered.  IT was supposed to ship before Sept 29th.  I&#x27;ve sent 4 emails on the issue and have gotten no response.  Amazon should lose this place as an option.  I&#x27;m not happy and not going to let it go.  It&#x27;s a $25.00 item.  And will not be ordering from here again.</li>
    <li> Although I do like what it did for my hair, I prefer Joico as it is not as expensive and comes in a larger container to last longer.</li>
    <li> didnt work magic but worked good</li>
    <li> I love Paul Mitchell products and use them regularly.  This one was as I expected.  I have relaxed hair (4b, 4c, type)that was breaking a little when I saw a review about this and ordered it.  My breakage stopped immediately after my first use but I noticed that  my hair was a bit straw like.  Since I have been doing my hair for a long time on my own, I realized that I needed more moisture.      I did an overnight treatment with the Paul Mitchell Supercharged and OMG, my hair had shine, body, softness.  I received many compliments and have used this monthly.  This is a two step system so get the other product as well, and follow the directions thoroughly .    IF YOU ARE A NEWBIE AND DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR HAIR, BE CAREFUL WITH THIS OR BRING IT TO YOUR HAIR DRESSER.</li>
    <li> My hair feels great!  I am over 50 with shoulder length color treated hair.  Also tends to be dry.  My hair feels young again.  Shiny and silky to the touch.  Lasts for 4 to 5 weeks.  I also do the Awapuhi Intensive Treatment once a week.  Small amount on hair-shower cap-then under the dryer for 10 or so minutes.  Let cool then rinse out.  Also very prompt in shipping arrival.  Will do business here again.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing to improve the condition of my fragile, fine-textured long hair. I followed the directions exactly, and saw no benefit whatsoever. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am a 58 y.o. woman with dry scalp in the winter.  This makes the dryness go away and makes my hair vibrant and shiny.  I invested in a plastic hood that fits onto my hand dryer and I have had great results. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product to use.  Just an FYI, you&#x27;re suppose to follow it with the keratin intesive treatment so don&#x27;t forget to order that too.  I forgot.  It leaves your hair super soft.  I swim and color my hair and this really helps keep it healthy.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that this would make a noticeable difference in my dry, curly hair.  I followed directions exactly, following with the Step-Two Intensive treatment.  Did nothing for my hair...waste of money!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger products, so I was excited to try this.  I used it as directed with the  Keratin Intensive Treatment, but my hair was the same as if I had used the intensive treatment on its own.  I saw and felt NO difference.  I am giving it 2 stars because there is a chance this really should be a professional-only product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally black hair and recently went blonde  this treatment has brought my hair back from the grave...makes hair super soft ! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Using just one application doesn&#x27;t really give you the opportunity to see how well this will do for your hair.  It felt really nice after use..but it would have been nice to have more ampoules in a purchase so that after a few applications you could really enjoy its effect.</li>
    <li> When combined with the intensive treatment of the product line the results are fantastic! My hair comes out silky soft! I LOVE using this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product! I had done keratin twice &amp; this product made me change my mind regarding keratin , leaves my hair super soft and brings up the color &amp; highlights, very happy with the results...!!!!</li>
    <li> awesome product...i noticed a difference immediately...smells great and left hair very soft and silky....definitely ordering more...my hair is naturally curly and was very damaged but thanks to paul mitchell im on the road to recovery.</li>
    <li> The funny thing is, that for a review to be effective you actually have to review the product....&lt;br /&gt;I bought the keratriplex and the intensive treatment as stated. You can go to YouTube and find a &amp;#34;How to&amp;#34; video which helps tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash your hair in the shower and then use cream rinse as well.&lt;br /&gt;2. Towel dry your hair, leave a little damp.&lt;br /&gt;3. Break the Keratriplex open and apply through your hair. This is about as thin as water and you need to shake it out. I found shaking it in my hand help to conserve the product.&lt;br /&gt;4. I then clipped my hair up and then let it sit for the time stated on bottle.&lt;br /&gt;5. I then used the intensive treatment. I used about a quarter sized squeeze for my very long hair. Conserve it but use enough.&lt;br /&gt;6. Now leave this product in for at least 10-20 minutes. I did not heat my hair as suggested by the YouTube video.&lt;br /&gt;7. Get back in the shower and only rinse your hair.&lt;br /&gt;8. I then towel dried my hair and then blow dried it.&lt;br /&gt;I see the difference now.  My hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark brown and I colored it twice, and it turned to straw....how horrible.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I can see repairing my hair over time. One treatment will not be enough. So if you are looking for a miracle, it&#x27;s not out there. I will keep using the intensive treatment cream I bought to accompany this triplex.&lt;br /&gt;I rated this high because my hair is soft and shiny now. I will come back and comment after a week has passed to let you all know if my hair still feels and looks great still!</li>
    <li> Excellent product , everyone should do this once a month! I&#x27;m receding this product, get the shampoo and conditioner , they are worth the money!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel excellent! I recommend it to all hair types! My hair feels like silk! It should be noted that I used the whole Paul Mitchell collection not just the treatment!</li>
    <li> This products is amazing, made my hair very strong and shiny. Its great treatment for once a month. Especially for color treated hair</li>
    <li> I have not tried this treatment at home,  but if you have a Paul Mitchell Academy available, the student stylists can provide the conditioning treatment for a discounted price from what you&#x27;d pay in salons.  If you are having an additional service such as a hair cut, the price of the conditioning is even more discounted.  I indulge every so often for a bit of pampering that won&#x27;t ding your budget.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got long, naturally dry/wavy, high/lowlighted hair.  Although I don&#x27;t torch it w/straightening irons, it&#x27;s long &amp; color treated so could use all the smoothing it can get.&lt;br /&gt;Read the hype so ordered this. Shampooed awapuhi shampoo, rinsed, towel dried,  put this stuff in small spray bottle &amp; sprayed on. Stayed in shower, rinsed &amp; followed w/recommended awapuhi deep/protein/keratin conditioner &amp; just didn&#x27;t notice a big difference....&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I needed 2 vials because I have long/thick hair or shouldve sat under heat w/keratriplex on, don&#x27;t know, but wasn&#x27;t blown away.  Mane was not noticeably shinier or smoother...&lt;br /&gt;My quest for smoothing/shining the mop has only come up w/2 &#x27;finds&#x27;.... Enjoy Luxury Shampoo &amp; Conditioner  (the bomb) &amp; getting a a Copolla Express Keratin blow dry at salon ($100).</li>
    <li> it was fine you can go to the Paul Mitchell studio and get this treatment for less than what I paid for the vile.! Ridiculous</li>
    <li> You need to buy the conditioner that goes with it I. Order to notice a difference . After all the abuse my hair has been through , 2-3 treatments and what a difference.</li>
    <li> Tonight was my second time doing the ampoule treatment @ home (along with the keratin intense moisture treatment).  The first time my hair seemed a tad bit shinier and healthier but I wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed.  Since my hair was wet when I did &#x27;step 1&#x27; it was hard to tell if I coated my strands evenly.  The first time I did the treatment exactly as directed and this time I changed it up.  I didn&#x27;t bother with washing my hair or even getting it wet.  I dropped the treatment into my dry hair, and then went about the directions as normal.  This time my hair is SUPER soft shiney and healty looking!  I will be doing it this way from here on out!!  I&#x27;m very happy with the results. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is thick, curly (straightened daily!), damaged and breaks easily. On a normal daily basis I use the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Ginger line. (well, shampoo + conditioner anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this treatment a try, just don&#x27;t forget to buy BOTH products.  Dont overpay in a salon either -- this is TOO easy to do at home.  At cost the ampoules are $3 each and the keratin moisture treatment is between $12-15.</li>
    <li> This. Its wonderfully product for a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair just put  oN hair and feel the big.  Difference between before its like miracle</li>
    <li> I used this followed by the Keratin Intensive Treatment and noticed a difference immediately. My hair is soft and shiny again. It was badly damaged before because of over coloring. Now I actually want to touch my hair.</li>
    <li> Seeing less fading when using this after my hair color. The stylist charges way more for the same process. Really happy I&#x27;m able to do this at home by myself.</li>
    <li> Absolutly love it. Two years using it every two or three months and my hair is stronger, longer and healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> I first started using the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi shampoo and rinse a couple of weeks back. Just the shampoo and the rinse alone made my hair very smooth and made my damaged hair look healthy. Fyi, my natural hair is slightly tight curls but I relax it because I don&#x27;t have the time nor the patience to deal with my curls. Now, I have to choice but to let my curls grow out because it is too processed. I dye it as well. I like the results that both the shampoo and rinse gave me so I went out my way and bought the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Intensive treatment and the KearTriplex. I only bought on vile of the KeraTriplex which wasn&#x27;t enough. Even though it wasn&#x27;t enough, my end results was beyond amazing. I went to my salon to so they can do the roller set, blow dry and iron (yes i know, ironing is bad) but my hair looked like I did the Brazilian blow out. Pin straight yet so nice and shiny. The distance between my roots which are dark coffee brown and my dyed light brown hair is about 2-3 inches and I had people asking me if I redyed the part that was already dyed because it looked so bright and shiny and not dull. I will definitely buy more vile! By the way shipping was ridiculously  fast so major plus!</li>
    <li> This product has brought my aggressively bleached hair back from the dead several times now. I initially had the Keratriplex treatment done at a salon, and began doing it at home last month. USE THIS PRODUCT SPARINGLY. It is VERY easy to cause a protein-overload with the Keratriplex serum. I admittedly did that - and my hair was VERY keratin-deficient. (This was easily remedied with liberal use of Bed Head Moisture Maniac, which is protein-free.)&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to anyone with bleached or highlighted hair.</li>
