      <li>I use an ear swab in the cap and it gets the perfect amount for the top set of teeth, and another dab for the bottom set.</li>
      <li>The whitener is easy to use and very effective!</li>

      <li>This stuff works and it is good.</li>

      <li>Not as good but some is better than none till I can go get me another mouth guard.</li>
      <li>Also using two kinds of Rembrandt whitening and one kind of Crest whitening toothpaste and no changes there.</li>
      <li>At the dentist&#x27;s they informed me that over-the-counter whitening agents have a lower concentrate of the chemical that causes results in whitening being effective, which coincides with my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it for 15-20 minutes a day with my own trays.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a review of the gel and now that Amazon sent me an email asking me to that lit a match under me. I simply swap it on my teeth and leave it there for 5-15 min and rinse. My teeth were noticeably whiter within a week or so.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s destroying my gums and the enamel on my teeth but it sure makes &#x27;em white. lol</li>
    <li> I put a pea size drop on a q-tip and apply to my top teeth, and a pea size drop for my bottom teeth. It foams up in about 10 seconds, and I just leave it on for 5 minutes and rinse it out, then brush. I do this once a month or so. I&#x27;ve been using this since high school and my teeth are pure white. Everybody asks me who I see to whiten my teeth, and I even get people asking me if I have veneers because they say my teeth look so perfect! This will work for you too. Apply it every other day or so for the first couple weeks (or more depending on level of stain), and then it&#x27;s just maintenance!</li>
    <li> It makes your teeth white but use only every other day once you buy it because your guns might hurt and use a bit not a lot</li>
    <li> I got this because my night guard would make my teeth darker....&lt;br /&gt;people say its not for sensitive people, but I think it would be fine as long as you don&#x27;t put to much on like I did, cause now my teeth hurt, which I am use to. I&#x27;ve made this mistake before. just get a paintbrush it paint a thin layer on your teeth. I left mine in for about ttwo mins then I took it out cause it was hurting (put to much in). but I do see a difference.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any results after 2 weeks of application. i think the gel is just to mild to do the job. strips worked much better.</li>
    <li> Not working for me, a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Effective, especially for the price, if used daily, once a day.&lt;br /&gt;You know the drill for the folks with the highly stained teeth, it will take longer for your results to show, however you&#x27;ll likely get highly visible results after 3-4 weeks of constant use. Light- medium stained folks 2 weeks, I guess good luck!</li>
    <li> Plus White really does work and it is cheap. For the last 20 years I have been purchasing products at the dentist to bleach my teeth. I have used Premiere and Daywhite with success...but they both cost so much more than Plus White. I read a review where someone said it didn&#x27;t work, and I have to wonder if it was an old tube. I also use my own bleaching trays that were made at the dentist. They can cost around $300.00 but if you take good care of them they can last for years. I have had mine for 20 years, and only lately have I decided I need to get new ones made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this stuff does work if you use trays. I live in Houston and CVS does carry it but they always seem to be sold out. You might want to check a local CVS to see if they have it in stock.</li>
    <li> I used this product three times a week for 20 minutes. I saw a little bit of difference but not alot. I drink coffee almost everyday so I guess that is why I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. It is good for touch ups though.</li>
    <li> This really does work... This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve been using it for a while, but I whiten my teeth once in a while.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I want to put rest to many of the rumors that seem to float around with this product. My review will only try to bring light to the queries rather than rate the product as their seem to be enough positive reviews.     1) It works wonderfully well for MOST people. Unless and until your teeth have very very bad coffee and tea pit stains, I have heard no complaints about this product from anyone.     2) Phosphoric Acid: Yes, excess P.A. can damage tooth enamel. But that said, the levels of the ingredient per use are very very minute. Soda that people consume so frequently these days has many times the quantity of P.A. that this product has. I have had the ingredients examined by a reputed local dentist. He says that with moderate use, your teeth wouldn&#x27;t face any damage. Well of course if you went overboard and used the product 3 times a day, well sure you can damage your teeth. Also, most whitening products have some amount of P.A. or the other. Be it whitening tooth paste, strips or a procedure at your local dentist&#x27;s place. It&#x27;s main function is to loosen the particles on the surface of your teeth.    Improper brushing can cause far greater damage to your enamel. The bacteria that form on your teeth when you don&#x27;t brush often, can produce similar acids that can cause much greater damage. So stop with the P.A. propaganda!    3) Sensitivity: For people with sensitive teeth, such products are not advised. Sensitivity in teeth can be because of lot of reasons, a very common one being damaged enamel. So such products would only add to the uncomfortable sensation in your teeth. Again, it is in the nature of such products to cause discomfort to people with sensitive teeth.     4) My way of using: I follow the procedures that I got to know about through a youtube video. Buy a couple of plasic mouth guards (the kind they use in sports) from your local Walmart or Walgreens, should cost you a $1 each. Place them in hot water just long enough so that they become a little soft and flexible. Now nudge them against your teeth and suck on them for a few seconds and until they take shape and turn hard. the plastic should hold shape, now you&#x27;ve got a personalized set of mouth guards. Then take a thin layer of the teeth whitener and apply a thin layer of the paste. Make sure that it is evenly spread, even in the hard to reach spaces between your teeth. That way you will see uniformity later. Make sure you don&#x27;t get any paste on your gums. As soon as you have the paste spread, put in the mouth guards. Wait it out for 5 minutes, then remove the guards and rinse throughly. Voila, you have a set of shiny white teeth for under $10!     Final verdict : It WORKS! Stop dissing on a product you don&#x27;t properly know about or how to use. Work on facts not presumptions, enjoy!</li>
    <li> i think it works, i drink coffee, and this got my teeth pretty white, infact i stopped using it, unlike the directions say, but i want to see if it really does work again lol.</li>
    <li> My teeth are getting whiter every day.</li>
    <li> I have been searching high and low for something that would whiten my teeth as good as the old Colgate brush on whitener. I DO NOT like the strips. They do not fit my teeth correctly and they seem to always slip off and then most of the whitening gel on them comes off. So I tried this product and for under $5 hey why not. Worked great. Sure it&#x27;s not an overnight thing but in a week you&#x27;ll definitely see results. it&#x27;s easier and you get better results with a mouth guard but I have been using a Q-tip to apply it and I still get results. Not as good but some is better than none till I can go get me another mouth guard. Anyways, to sum it up. Cheap, Good product, Good results.</li>
    <li> Do not expect dramatic results.  I have used this product faithfully twice a day.  I left the gel on ten to&lt;br /&gt;fifteen minutes.  After two weeks my family and I saw maybe one shade of improvement.  Nothing&lt;br /&gt;dramatic.  I use it in place of one brushing each day for maintaining shade I am at.</li>
    <li> I have been using the teeth whitening from this brand over 6 months.  I tried several of them (depends on the deal).  I used it twice a week, and it showed some changes after 2 weeks.  My friend who smaokes showed lot different after 2 weeks, using daily.</li>
    <li> Good, every little bit helps.</li>
    <li> I used this for a few time .look good for keeping my teeth clean ... 70% satisfy on this product,unless you wanted more whitener ,recommend you go to dentist whiten your teeth out......</li>
    <li> For many years, this product was one of the best and most inexpensive whiteners on the market.  Right up until they changed the formula.  They claim that it was because the old formula would break down to liquid form over time.  Regardless, the new formula doesn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s a real shame because this was a good product.</li>
    <li> Where can I start? This product is fabulous! I have slightly stained teeth because I drink a lot of juice, and by the way I am 13; and this product so far was only used once by me. I had to quick put it on, so it was on for a maximum of 4.5 minutes, and i rinsed my mouth, and my teeth looked a great eggshell white! There are 2 ways to put it on your teeth, and I chose to put it on a cotton swab, and it was great! I especially recommend this for smokers and heavy coffee drinkers! So overall, this product had instant results that definitely pleased, as well as surprised me! I would rate it 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> damages in shipment so product was worthless for my use don&#x27;t know why u require a word count for critique. will never critique again for u</li>
    <li> I bought this and two mouthguards. I got regular sports mouthguards (like football players where) and followed the directions to mold them to my teath. Then I just squirt a drop in both the mouthguards, smeer it around and put them in for 10 minutes. This stuff works and it is good. I will buying more when it runs out. So much cheaper (and better) than crest whitestrips.  My reccomendation though - buy some good mouthguards. The ones that comes with this are crap. (They sell a bundled package that includes a mouthguard.</li>
    <li> I have been using Plus White 5 Minute Speed Whitening Gel for years now....and recently ran out. I went to my local Walmart where I purchaced it previously,to find that they don&#x27;t carry it any longer. I&#x27;m so happy to see that it can be found on amazon.com. For anyone wanting to know if they should purchace this product? I say yes!!!!!! Use it with a sports mouth piece for best results. You will be AMAZED!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was a bit sceptical at first, as nothing seemed to be happening after the first two or three days, but the results after two weeks speak for themselves (see my customer photo).  I used the gel for a bit longer than instructed - about two hours a day, split across two sessions, for two weeks (but I&#x27;m not encouraging others to do this; follow the instructions!).  The only time I felt any sensitivity was after I fell asleep for a few hours with the mouth guard and gel still in place.  It cleared up after 24 hours though.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it does!  I had results in just a few applications.  I am not a tea or coffee drinker so if you drink or eat foods that have a high stain factor on a regular basis it may take more applications for you.  Great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This gel really works, it onyl takes a few minutes and in a few days youll have noticably whiter teeth!! i cannot live without it! the tube has lasted me for 4 years because i only use the gel once in a while now. The results do last! unless you always drink coffe</li>
    <li> This gel works well when used as directed. The idea of using a cotton bud to apply the gel on your teeth isn&#x27;t a good idea in my opinion. I believe its best used with teeth molders or else you&#x27;re highly likely to get the gel on your gum line and you tend to use a whole lot more of the gel to get the edges between your teeth. Plus you get the extra benefit of getting the entire tooth coated with no worry of having your mouth open for 5 minutes for the less twice a day for the first two weeks and every other time you use the gel after that. Let me tell you, when I did it for the first time without the moldable tooth guard I was walking around with my head up mouth open. Whilst trying my best not to swallow. The primary problem I have with the product is the use of cold water to stop the whitening process. On the first use I used the cold water but I still felt a ting gulling sensation in my mouth and I could taste the hydrogen peroxide in my mouth. Now I resort to ice cold water which seems to work a whole lot better but numbs my teeth. I suggest that individuals with sensitive teeth should not use this product. Other than that like I said earlier the product works as directed.</li>
    <li> In case, I out for whitening gel.  Just a back-up product.  Not thing special. Wonderful product use 1 a weeks.</li>
    <li> Sure this whitened my teeth after just one use but I experienced jolting stabs of sensitivity that literally made me jump! I had to take these out after just 5-6 minutes. Perhaps I put too much in my tray? I&#x27;m not sure, but it order to use this again I&#x27;ll be taking it easy and pre-brushing with Sensodyne! OUCH!</li>
    <li> I use the mouth-tray directions, and have had NO sensitivity, burning, adverse reactions whatsoever. But, I could SEE a difference the second time I used it in the color of my teeth! I&#x27;ve used entire boxes of the \\&quot;strips\\&quot; etc and never saw as much of a difference as I did on the second use. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use! I&#x27;m a smoker and a coffee/soda addict, so you can believe me when I say IT WORKS! I haven&#x27;t tried just swabbing it on my teeth, but, as long as I don&#x27;t apply too much of the gel to the mouth trays, I don&#x27;t have a problem keeping it off my gums/tongue. I love it!</li>
    <li> As far as I am concerned, this is possibly the best whitening product on the market at a price that cannot be matched.  I stumbled on this product about 10 years ago.  I bought the \\&quot;system\\&quot; which has this whitener with plastic trays for your teeth.  I am telling you right now; if you use this whitener and the trays exactly per the instructions, you will notice a HUGE difference in the whiteness of your teeth.  The secret is to keep the trays in \\&quot;a little longer\\&quot;...keep them in for 20 minutes twice a day.  Then, after you get your teeth really white, keep them that way by periodically using this product with the trays....and by brushing with Plus White toothpaste.  You cannot lose.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product after trying crest white strips, whitening pens, and then this. The strips didnt work too well, the pen didnt at all, and this DID! I mean I didnt have rotten yellow teeth but they werent that white either.  Now they are WHITE! Now they arent perfect, but for the money, WOW its so worth it.  I used it periodically and saw results but when i started doing it twice a day (Like Instructed) it was much more noticeable. I put it on for about 15 - 20 minutes probably twice a week, and it honestly works better than any crest whitening products for me at least. I will purchase again, and it is pretty easy to use, but you have to get the hang of it. All my family has natural white teeth, but me, now i fit in.</li>
    <li> I started out using this product and left it on for about 15 mins a day for the first week then went down to just 5 minutes a day.  My teeth were at least 4-5 shades whiter after like 2 weeks,  I haven&#x27;t got any more results from it but I think it got rid of all surface stains and the shade of yellow I still have keeping me from having super white teeth are below the surface.  I do notice when I stop using this for month&#x27;s(ran out and always forget to buy more) my teeth begin to get yellow again.  I now use this product along with Crest 3D toothpaste and when i added the toothpaste it seemed to help too.  Try this product along with Crest 3d toothpaste and you will defiantly see results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two years and it has never failed! It literally whitens your smile after 1 use and after constant use it gives you an all white smile! It was shipped over very fast which always makes me happy. Number one fan here!</li>
    <li> This is the only teeth whitening I use. Doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive. I got teeth guards a walmart&#x27;s sports section for a buck each. Works great with fabulous results. I do leave the tray in for about 30 minutes, twice a day - and whiten only for 3 days, instead of twice a day, 5-10 minutes for two weeks. Lots of compliments, and questions about what I whiten my teeth with. :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t mention that I only whitened my upper teeth. That way I could see if there was any difference. There&#x27;s a HUGE difference!&lt;br /&gt;I only whiten twice a year now....by the way; time to do the lower jaw.</li>
    <li> I think it is working.  But it does require a bit more patience than I was anticipating.  But I think it is ok.</li>
    <li> I am 65 years old and  live in the UK and after years of trying to get my teeth white I had given up, putting it down to age related darkening of my teeth. I had tried it all, special paste from the chemist with a mouth shield, mouth-washes, special whitening tooth pastes.  To no avail. And I couldn&#x27;t afford the expense of professional tooth whitening.      Then I saw this product being demonstrated on U-Tube and thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  I didn&#x27;t have a lot of faith - but it wasn&#x27;t expensive, even though I had to send off to the States for it.   I have to say, I am absolutely over the moon with the results.   I applied it twice a day for 2 weeks,  for 5 minutes each time - I had an old mouth shiled that I put on the top teeth and applied it with cotton bud to the bottom.   I knew how it was progressing because I have one veneer (done on the NHS) which is very white and my own teeth looked yellowish next to it.  However, after two weeks of faithfully applying Plus+White there is hardly any difference at all between the veneer and my own teeth.  They look great - and I can&#x27;t say what a difference it&#x27;s made to my smile confidence.    My advice if you have given up on ever getting your teeth to look naturally white again - give this a go.  It won&#x27;t break the bank, it worked for me and I thought I was a hopeless case - it may just work for you.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Great product. Wish I would have found it sooner.  Everyone should buy this product today.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> You can see the difference after a week love it and will continue to use it and after my sister seen my teeth she was like OMG now she&#x27;s about to go try it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like magic or anything but does appear to be effective with minimal effort, I could recommend this product for its intended use.</li>
    <li> I always go to the store with the intention of purchasing the pricey teeth whiteners, but after I look down at all the other items in my cart, $50 just seems like too much. I finally found these on the shelf of Walmart for five dollars, the tube is HUGE. I thought, what the heck. I put it on a cotton swab and started rubbing it on my teeth.   My teeth are not terribly yellow, just slightly yellow from the coffee I drink every morning, I was looking for something to make them brighter. I found it! I love this stuff!!! As soon as you put it on,  it starts bubbling up..think rabid foaming dog, haha, but it makes me feel/see that its working. Doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate or leave my teeth or gums sensitive at all.  I try to hold my mouth open a few seconds before I close my lips, it seems to stay on better when I do it that way. It always comes off my bottom teeth a minute or so later, but stays on the top pretty well. I&#x27;m sure if I used trays it would stay in place better.  After the first 10 min application, my teeth were visibily brighter. I have not been using it 2 x a day like suggested b/c I just can&#x27;t seem to remember to do it at night before bed.  So i do it in the morning after my coffee.  Its been 1 week now and my teeth are 1 maybe 2 shades whiter. I&#x27;m thrilled!  I love how they give you so much, so after 2 weeks you can use it a few times a month for maintenance!  Seems like a great product with zero side effects for me.  Highly Recommend!    On the box it does warn...absolutly do NOT use if you have gum disease, cavities, braces, veneers, or dentures!!!! Keep that in mind.  Makes me wonder if the person who gave the 1 star review last year didn&#x27;t have some sort of gum disease/issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel off and on for a few months and I can see very subtle if any, results from this product. So I don&#x27;t understand what everyone is raving about...sure it&#x27;s a much cheaper alternative than other teeth whitening products but doesn&#x27;t have any drastic results. I recommend saving up for costlier but better products. The only plus I can say about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t give you any sensitivity which is always good when it comes to whitening your teeth.</li>
    <li> Okay so I heard about this product through a youtube video done by a make up guru. Seriously it is amazing. I just started using it yesterday and I am completely astonished that I can already see results. Not only that- but the price is so affordable its almost hard to believe. I bought it from Wal- Mart for less than four bucks along with the tooth paste and my teeth are already starting to look better with twice a day use for both the tooth paste and whitening kit. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I think the product does whiten your teeth.  I was initially very happy with the results.  HOWEVER, I now have some of the worst teeth sensitivity I have ever experienced!  Horrible pain!  An when you read the fine print, (I obviously didn&#x27;t until too late), it does mention that it&#x27;s not recommended for sensitive teeth.  If you have some sensitivity, it will make it worse.  If you had none, I would bet that you will after using this product.</li>
    <li> Used it for 2 weeks, 2 times a day, 25 min each time, not a shade lighter!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002CZ6K7S Plus White Teeth Whitener Gel 3 oz (85 g)]]&lt;br /&gt;I bought this not knowing if it would actually work.  I should have taken before pictures so I can show you the results.  How can something so inexpensive have such remarkable results?  I&#x27;m sure there are much better products costing several hundred dollars that you need a license to apply or you must sleep with something in your mouth overnight but this is not one of those products.  It&#x27;s as cheap as toothpaste and makes your teeth bright again.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could show you before and after photos.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but this [[ASIN:B002CZ6K7S Plus White Teeth Whitener Gel 3 oz (85 g)]] is Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I loved it.</li>
    <li> I wear a particular size or fit for this item but maybe that’s why it doesn’t work as well I would have liked or expected. I use it as instructed when using a toothbrush. The material is clear with not so terrible smell. The customers should expect to expend a total of 25 minutes at most each time to get desired goal. I’d say it’s below my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am surprised.  Overall I am happy with the purchase.  I can say it easily whitened my teeth several shades.  I was worried my dentist would say something about my enamel, but she said nothing.  So I hope that is good.  Easy to use.  I bought the moldable bleaching trays to use with these.  I can say this stuff works.  I hope there are no long term affects on my teeth, but so far so good.  It works as advertised and I can afford this!!!</li>
    <li> Good product works as indicated. Will order again but would like to see it on a monthly ship to save some bucks.  Teeth feel like it was cleaned by a dentist. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I just started using this and so far I like it, I am not noticing much of a difference just yet but you have to give it time. I made the mistake of not applying it with my fingers or a q-tip and it did irritate my gums a bit. Make sure you put it only on your teeth. I bought the sport mouth guards and put the gel directly into to guard an then put the guard on my teeth. Don&#x27;t do it that way!!!! Put a generous amount on your teeth first.</li>
    <li> We bought this product to whiten our teeth obviously and it seems to work well. We already had the mouth pieces so that was not a problem.</li>
    <li> Plus White, if you&#x27;re reading this, please change the formulation back to what it used to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old formulation was much better. I usually have sensitive teeth &amp; the old regular formulation did not affect my teeth at all.  I also noticed way faster results with the old version (i.e., I&#x27;d notice a difference after using twice daily for 2 days). I bought this new formulation at a CVS or a Walgreens (can&#x27;t remember) since my teeth were getting yellower again. After using for a week, was very disappointed in the amount (or lack thereof) of whitening. Also, I had to discontinue using this because it starting hurting my teeth, unlike the last formulation.  Lastly, the new gel is a pain in the ass to spread on teeth! The old formulation was much easier to equally distribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are able to find an old version that&#x27;s not expired, I&#x27;d say, definitely try it out. Otherwise, there are probably better products out there (although this product wasn&#x27;t too extremely pricey, from what I remember).</li>
    <li> way better than Supersmile that stuff was not worth the money this is great it works pretty good if you do it consistently&lt;br /&gt;and use it on a dry mouth and not right after you brush your teeth</li>
    <li> it is a little easier to use than the traditional whitener but does not really work much better.  We tried it for a couple of weeks and noticed very little whitening.</li>
    <li> Better than those kits you buy, you can just get these, put some on your finger, smear it around, tilt your head back and watch TV for 10 minutes while holding your spit back.  It is easy and simple.  If you wanted your whole mouth, buy cheap mouth pieces, fill it with this stuff and there you go, no need for 50 buck plus white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, but I would rather do 5 to 10 minute daily sessions with it for a week, then do a crazy 30 minute session twice a week, you abuse it, and your teeth will hurt.  Use as directed, and better shorter time use over longer periods of time than huge time usage over short periods of time.  Give it time and use as directed you will see the difference in two weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! It&#x27;s super fast, super easy, and it WORKS. Don&#x27;t expect huge results in the first use, they will probably be subtle but after about a week of using this once a day I definitely noticed a difference</li>
    <li> Used this product for two weeks. Took pictures to compare in stages. No difference in color. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with the mouth tasty that it needs to be most effective. And the label on the tube says that, in fact, whitening STARTS at the five-minute mark, by which time the gel has completely dissolved already.</li>
    <li> This works great. I noticed a difference after the first use. I don&#x27;t use as directed I only use as needed like maybe once or twice every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made for my smile, especially because it&#x27;s cheap. I get no burning feeling at all, even if it comes in contact with my gums. You really don&#x27;t need very much at all. I use an ear swab in the cap and it gets the perfect amount for the top set of teeth, and another dab for the bottom set. I love this, and my white teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this from another website thinking that it would really lighten my teeth in five minutes based on a You Tube video. Nah. You have to keep the mouthpiece filled with the goo in your mouth for 20 minutes a day and maybe in a week you&#x27;ll see a difference. Misleading product name and really no better than cheaper products and other OTC products.</li>
    <li> WORKS JUST LIKE IT SAID IT WOULD AND WILL REORDER. Makes your teeth whiter.</li>
    <li> i feel the active ingredient has changed the product does not taste smell or look like it used to and it also did not work</li>
    <li> Works really well and does not negatively impact filling materials. Does not make my teeth sensitive like some higher powered strip products do.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the tooth paste. It&#x27;s ok, but does not really make your teeth whiter. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and it doesn&#x27;t make me have sensitive teeth after I use it. I like that it is simple to use and it actually works. It also helps that it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too thick and really use half of even what they recommend or you&#x27;ll be swallowing the stuff...e[...] It really does work if you stick with it for a week and maintain a regular schedule thereafter.</li>
    <li> Have used this 5 days in a row and did not see a noticeable whitening that lasted Prefer small tubes of pearl whitener</li>
    <li> Works well! I brush my teeth with it, leave it in, shower, get out and rinse. Got my teeth several shades whiter in only a few days.</li>
    <li> I purchased the one with the rinse and mouth tray but since the gel is the same, I wanted to post a review here to warn others.     The product says to use it twice a day for 5 minutes each time, and up to 20 minutes for very stained teeth. My teeth were only slightly yellow and mainly on the incisors. Since the instructions said I could use it up to 20 minutes each time, I figured if I did that, I would be done with this in a week.    I have used this product (including the rinse and mouthgiuard) for the past 30 days, twice a day for at least 20 minutes each time and sometimes 30, but my teeth are still yellow. If you do the math, that&#x27;s the equivalent of using the product twice a day for 5 minutes each time for 120 days or 4 months! The product did lighten my teeth a few shades but it is much like the 600 pound person who loses 300 pounds, they are still fat.  I even did an experiment like others but unlike them, I never told my wife I was using this. I wanted to see if she noticed a difference. Thirty days later and she never said a word about my teeth looking whiter.      The product did not even last 14 days. By day 10 I had to buy another package. This second package was in an identical box but the ingredients list for the gel was different. The gel in the second (and third box) also was quite sticky in my mouth and hard to rinse out, which was not the case with the first one. I emailed the customer support via the contact email address on their website to ask what the difference was but never received a reply. I guess when you make a bad product you you don&#x27;t care, or are too lazy to reply to email.    If you think you are going to use this twice a day for 5 minutes each time and have white teeth in two weeks you are crazy. If you do, then they were white to begin with and you don&#x27;t need this product. I am going to ask for a refund per their website, but I don&#x27;t expect to get one.</li>
    <li> After finding this cheaper than most at Walgreen&#x27;s Drugs I tried it. Not quite as good as Crest, but a lot cheaper and ultimately messier. Got some moderate results but eventually stopped using it.   Six months later, it exploded in a drawer (this is inside a living area, so can&#x27;t blame excess heat).  The resultant goop was over everything. It is now a liquid -- viscosity of water -- so no way to apply with a cotton swab.  Hope Walgreen&#x27;s stands behind their products.    ** update **  Walgreen&#x27;s did give me a complete refund, even with no receipt. I was dressed business casual and prepared to insist, but they were gracious.</li>
    <li> I used to buy a similar product in the drug stores, and they no longer carry that one. I was looking for an alternate and found this one. It works pretty well, and probably would work better if I used the trays with it. I just put some on my teeth with a Q-tip and wait for about 10 minutes before rinsing. It is thick enough to stay for such a short time. It will not whiten like some of the commercial treatments, but then it does not cost anywhere near what they cost either. I use it once or twice a week and combined with regular professional cleanings, it does a good job of keeping stains off my teeth. This tube will last a long time, so that is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I use this 2x a week and my teeth have never been whiter.</li>
    <li> I used the product three times now and I&#x27;ve begun to see the results ... especially in a tooth that my dentist fix me and tends to obscure more than the others and it was driving me crazy, but problem solved!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a year and it works great.  Even the dental hygienist  asks me what I use.</li>
    <li> I cannot fathom why the company ruined this product.  For years, it has worked like a CHARM for me. The gel used to be thick and blue, and an application or two would leave my teeth very white.  Now, it&#x27;s this clear gelatinous goop that has barely any effect at all!  It is no better than using a whitening toothpaste now.  I used it constantly before a trip and my teeth looked yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need to switch back to the original formula before I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Plus White Bleach Whitening Gel, 5 Minute, Original Flavor, is a great buy and a great product.  Clearly a difference after using this gel for a few weeks---good buy</li>
    <li> I tried this product on a whim, after reading a few reviews online, honestly I didn&#x27;t expect much, especially for the price....     WOW!! Was I blown away after 2 weeks of using this product, it definitley works better for me that the Crest Whitestrips, for a mere fraction of the price! I did get some great advice from a friend to purchase a sport mouth guard to act as a \\&quot;dental tray\\&quot; when I&#x27;m using the product, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that improved my overall results rather than a mere application with a cotton swab, but this product worked amazingly well!    It has a fresh minty taste, so it&#x27;s not uncomfortable, and while the intial application is a bit tedious (twice a day for 2 weeks) it is well worth it!     You definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, I recommended it to a friend that was getting married, and she can&#x27;t stop thanking me (a year later), she saved a lot of $$ rather than going for a professional laser whitening system.    Cheers!</li>
    <li> I have always had naturally splotchy teeth, so I spent a lot of time and money trying just about everything on the market, until I came across this product.  I tried it out of desperation because it was cheap, not expecting much.&lt;br /&gt;I was blown away by the difference in my teeth after just one week.  Now I use it just once or twice a week for 10-15 minutes, and my teeth stay perfectly white and even-toned.  Friends, family, even dentists have commented on how beautiful my teeth look, and everyone wants to know my secret.  (The three years of braces as a kid helped, too, of course ;-) ).  The color is always a natural shade- not that ultraviolet look some whiteners have.  Even if this stuff worked half as good, I would use it because it is such a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you buy the product, be sure to buy the set with the tray.  I&#x27;ve never found the mouth wash they sell with it made any difference, but the gel is definitely easier to use if you have the tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this from Target and Walmart for the last two years, but it looks like they no longer carry it, so I&#x27;m going to have to find another store or buy it through Amazon. Still, totally worth it!</li>
    <li> This is the best tooth whitener I have ever used and a great price! Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> for the price im loving it, its says to use it consecutively for 14days but in afghanistan i have too much to do and forget but the 4 times i have used it, i hae notice a considerable difference and i like it so far...would recommend</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I heard that Plus White use to be amazing. Well now they have a new formula. It will make your teeth very sensitive and doesn&#x27;t really whiten noticeably. I used it once a week for 4 weeks. I couldn&#x27;t use it any more than that because every time I used it, even breathing would hurt my teeth. Mix up some baking soda and lemon juice, you&#x27;ll get better results and less sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Good results, good price!  I use as a toothpaste with an electric toothbrush and it really gets off the surface stains.</li>
    <li> I am using it everyday, every night for 15minutes daily. Result...nothing. I don&#x27;t know, maybe it has something to do with teeth texture and properties, i don&#x27;t know...</li>
    <li> This whitener is the very very best and will continue to get this!!! It does indeed do what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> Frankly, I didn&#x27;t have huge expectations for this product. It&#x27;s a backwards way of thinking, but if a product is too cheap, my first thought is that it must not be that great--especially compared to the white strips that are 6-7 times more expensive and all of the other kits out there. It&#x27;s definitely not true in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for three days and already my teeth are noticeably whiter. I could stop now and be completely happy, but of course I&#x27;m going to keep going and see how white I can get them. I bought mouth trays and left them on for 20 minutes, brushing right afterwards. There was some sensitivity after the first day, but nothing as bad as the pain I got from white strips when I used them a year ago and it went away a few hours later. Second day was much better, and here on the third day they were only sensitive for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very glad I took a chance on this stuff instead of buying the strips. Sure, it&#x27;s a little more inconvenient, but it&#x27;s fast and the results speak for themselves. Note that I don&#x27;t drink coffee nor smoke, so they weren&#x27;t in bad shape to begin with; can&#x27;t say how it&#x27;d work if you do those things.</li>
    <li> since this product doesn&#x27;t come with a mouth tray, it&#x27;s really hard and messy to apply to teeth. I&#x27;ve also had a really hard time keeping it off of my lips and gums. Not to mention my saliva keeps getting in the way. I just need a mouth tray but this actually works.</li>
    <li> It would be 5 stars except I think they should tell you to use this with a mouth guard only. I know the directions said to wipe it off your gums but how can you keep your lips away from your teeth for 5 minutes without using a mouth guard? I used it for 5 minutes and it made my lip pretty raw. So I can only imagine if you leave it on for 15 minutes without a mouth guard...yikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it works amazing. I noticed whiter teeth after 5 minutes, just using it the first time. I know this sounds impossible. When I read other people&#x27;s reviews who said the same thing, I didn&#x27;t believe it. But it does work...just think about buying the mouth guard. I have mine on order.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several months now, having gone through tree tubes. I have carefully followed the instructions and have used professionally made trays, and although my teeth are visibly whiter than before, it hasn&#x27;t quite performed as expected. My teeth weren&#x27;t very yellow to begin with, and after several courses, they are still not as white as I&#x27;d like them to be, which isn&#x27;t that much (I&#x27;d absolutely hate the snow-white tint that some people are sporting theses days). No one in my family has even noticed that I&#x27;ve been bleaching my teeth, although if I asked them, they&#x27;d probably acknowledge it. So, yes, it does whiten, but only after a lot of treatments, and it only achieves a marginal improvement. Given that its price has risen significantly lately, I cannot give it the highest mark.</li>
    <li> THIS DOES NOT WORK IT MAKE MY GUMS IRRITAGE DO NOT BUY IT IS A WAIST OF TIME.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. No significant change after a month of using. Not guaranteed or I&#x27;d ask for a refund</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months, about one day a week. I have white teeth to begin with, but this seems to intensify it, which is what I was looking for. It works just as well as the expensive brands for whitening teeth. I just put it on with a q tip and let it sit for about 15 minutes. That&#x27;s it!! It&#x27;s that simple.</li>
    <li> After just a week of use - twice a day for approx. 5 minutes per day - I could see results.  I should have purchased mouthguards to hold it on my teeth, but instead, I just wiped it on with a q-tip, which worked just fine.  I did not have any problems with this causing sensitivity on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare this to Crest Whitestrips or any other product out there, but I can say that I would definitely use it again and I am very pleased with the value.</li>
    <li> A terrific do-it-yourself whitening gel which I&#x27;ve used regularly for years. People always ask me where I get my teeth whitened and can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s from an at-home kit. I use it 2 -3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I use the gel as a touch-up gel to keep my teeth white after I had them bleached by a dentist years ago.  Works incredibly well this way.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo80J73T7G2E8F]]UPDATE -- 8/14/12&lt;br /&gt;Still using this and it is still amazing for me.  Just a note that I decided to buy this from Wal-mart once and the kind I got was very different from what I get from Amazon... it was thicker than Petroleum Jelly and tasted absolutely horrible!  I won&#x27;t buy it from Wal-mart ever again!  My teeth are still very white and even though I smoke daily, there&#x27;s no sign whatsoever.  If I forget to do some maintenance I will do 20-30 minutes and there is no sensitivity afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE -- 3/16/11&lt;br /&gt;I still use this once every two weeks or so.  My teeth are a great, natural white.  For me, it only took about 2-3 weeks to get the white I wanted and then from there it&#x27;s just been once a week maintenance to maintain it.  I still smoke cigarettes, but I have absolutely no smoker&#x27;s stains since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Video Review Update! 5.23.11- I just kind of go over the pros and cons of the gel and show my technique on applying it! I hope it helps! Sorry about the lag in my webcam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this last night!  I wasn&#x27;t looking for an overnight miracle, just something that would hopefully get rid of my stains... I&#x27;m a smoker, and there&#x27;s very harsh stains on the side of my teeth where I smoke my cigarettes.&lt;br /&gt;My front left incisor is especially yellowed/brown and it was really noticeable in pictures.  My teeth were so yellow that I had to edit them to at least make sure my teeth didn&#x27;t look pee-yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on for twenty minutes last night using two mouthguards I bought from wal-mart.  I applied it both by Q-tip (including the gaps between my teeth) and I also lightly lined my mouthguards.  I got amazing results.  The stain on my tooth is completely gone!  My mom immediately noticed a difference this morning after my second 20 minute application.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what my teeth look like a week from now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people complain about the burn/safety of this gel.  It has hydrogen peroxide, so there will be foaming and a little burning.  If your gums turn white, that&#x27;s the hydrogen peroxide working, and your gums will go back to normal in an hour.  Just make sure to rinse well after!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way this can hurt your teeth is if you misuse it.  The mouthguards really help because you won&#x27;t have the taste in your mouth and it&#x27;ll shield the product from getting on your lips.  As another customer stated, there&#x27;s more harmful chemicals in soda than in this, so as long as you don&#x27;t overuse it you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For only $5, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, then at least you only spent $5.  Other people spend $30-$60 on the white strips or other methods and get no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can expect great results from this if you use it with a whitening tooth paste and lower your intake of darker sodas, coffee, and cigarettes.  Try rinsing with 3% hydrogen peroxide too, it&#x27;ll kill left-over bacteria left from your tooth brush AND it does have a very mild whitening property.</li>
    <li> Price was right, ordered trays separately and gave it a whirl. Glad I did. My teeth look stunning!!! Note I had stopped smoking and this was my treat. Very pleased!!</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to pick up some white strips on the next trip to Costco.  Out of curiosity I decided to price them on Amazon.  The Crest product has changed considerably since I used them so I read the reviews.  I was dismayed by reports of burning and discomfort caused by the current day product sold under the brand name Crest.  Eventually I came across this &amp;#34;Plus White&amp;#34; gel and ordered a tube.  At the time I did not see any whitening tooth trays that got truly favorable reviews so I skipped them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m someone who needs at least 2 cups of coffee in the morning before I trust myself operating dangerous equipment... like the toaster.  So it is inevitable that I wage war against some staining of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived I applied some (roughly the size of a small blueberry or one of those Toll House chocolate drops) with a &amp;#34;super-soft&amp;#34; bristle toothbrush that was provided for use after oral surgery.  I expected at most to see a very gradual change and accepted the need to reapply over a week or so to achieve significant improvement.  I left the gel on until it had substantially dissolved with saliva, perhaps 12 to 15 minutes total time.  After only this first use I saw of very distinct and noticeable improvement.  No previous product has achieved that much change in any single application... Ever!  I would say this product achieved as much in 15 minutes as the very first Crest W/S did in three or four 30 minute uses.  But will my teeth be super sensitive???  Nope.  No ill effects whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day I mentioned how impressed I was with the product to my wife and she flashed me a toothy grin saying that she had applied some with a cotton swab and left it on while she put on makeup before heading off to work.  Like myself she was highly impressed with how substantial the whitening was from a single application.  We have both used the product three times without even a hint of irritation or any negativeeffects whatsoever.  I brush regularly with Sensodyne toothpaste so I would not be at all surprised had my teeth felt a change but so far that has not been an issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since ordered two different brands of heat forming teeth whitening trays and plan to try those.  I fully expect that to improve the overall effectiveness but even if those prove problematic to shape and use applying it directly to the teeth by any means is working better than my experience with the original Crest white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We LOVE this product.  And I&#x27;m just guessing here but based on how little it takes I suspect there is enough in one 3-ounce tube to whiten a bask of crocodiles.</li>
    <li> I will never buy anything again from unverified reviews. I suspect most of these are \\&quot;shills\\&quot;...As you can see I am a Verified purchaser. I did this product in mouthtrays twice a day over 10 min each time for over 2 weeks and NOTHING!!! not a single result from this.</li>
    <li> It totally works! My teeth are looking white for the first time in my life :)  And I smoked for 5 years, so you can imagine haha</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening gel is a miracle product. It is the only &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; product that lives up to its name. I love flashing my luminescent, pearly whites at all the boys thanks to this gel.</li>
    <li> I used as directed for 2 weeks, twice a day x 20 minutes to reverse staining. The results are questionable at best. If I had to recommend to someone, I probably would not.</li>
    <li> I have literally spend a 100 bucks on opalescence the last year.&lt;br /&gt;Sure it isn&#x27;t much compared to a dentist but I&#x27;m already blessed&lt;br /&gt;with very beautiful, white teeth naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I smoke on weekends, drink up to five cups of coffee a day/tea&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had I problem with my teeth until recently I discovered that two of my&lt;br /&gt;front teeth looked a bit darker than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been bleaching my teeth with opalescence 20 for about 6 months, twice a week&lt;br /&gt;over night and even though I did notice a difference I wasn&#x27;t all excited bc&lt;br /&gt;after all I ran out of that stuff pretty quickly. My friend recommended it and&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why but her teeth are extremely white after every use.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t sleep with my trays in my mouth. I wake up every morning, seeing them&lt;br /&gt;on my nightstand and I can&#x27;t even remember taking them out but I assume they&lt;br /&gt;just start annoying me during the night so I dump them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t want to wear that for a full night, not seeing a difference in the&lt;br /&gt;morning...no thanks!&lt;br /&gt;So I saw all the great reviews about Plus White Bleach and I happened to be at&lt;br /&gt;cvs and it was cheap so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the tube at home and half of the gel was all over my hands. It immediately&lt;br /&gt;turned my skin white and got really itchy and I was convinced: This is strong stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 15 minutes in my trays and WOW! What a difference!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I used way to much gel so I probably swallowed a ton of it which can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;be healthy but i&#x27;m still alive! My gums and teeth never got sensitive what I really&lt;br /&gt;surprising after the accident on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;But I  love the fact that I don&#x27;t have deal with it for 8 hours straight.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> ok,but won&#x27;t buy again only because its so running and messy. but it was okay with the whitening</li>
    <li> nothing quick about this process.  slow results if any.  best to go to a dentist for professional results.  saves money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I did not know about this product until I watched a YouTube video. It works great!  The 15 minutes for stained teeth worked.  I&#x27;ll do a 5 minute maintainence after that.&lt;br /&gt;You can buy this product with a whitening tray.  Don&#x27;t buy it!!!!!  It doesn&#x27;t work well at all!!!!!  Watch Kandee Johnson video on youtube on how to make your own whitening trays.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all and burns your gum!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whiteners in the past (from dentist as well as Crest White Strips) and while I wanted to try again I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. This gel works great and I&#x27;ve seen results in just a couple of applications. I&#x27;m just brushing a little each night &amp; rinsing after about 10 minutes. Definitely an inexpensive way to freshen your smile.</li>
    <li> Before it was sold at the local Walmart, I had no choice but to buy on Amazon, the products works, but better with the strips from colgate, I think.  Coffee drinker, or smoker, you will want to use this, but honestly better priced with a tray at Walmart, but hey, if you already have the trays.  No big deal, you can still purchase the tube without.  Keep smiling!</li>
    <li> Excellent inexpensive whitener.  I use it in my trays (from the dentist).  I&#x27;ve ordered this twice now and will continue too.</li>
    <li> I have had my teeth professionally whitened by my dentist twice ad I get the same results from using this toothpaste ever other day! loVE it. I plan on stocking up just in case it ever gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> it works good just need to use it constantly...</li>
    <li> This product works if you stick with it every day. Let it sit for about 15 minutes otherwise you won&#x27;t get the full effects.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my tea stains.  I have used this same product for many years with no problems.</li>
    <li> noticed on my Facebook pics that my teeth were not as white as before...bought this product from Walmart and i figured for the price if it did not work no harm done since it cost only 5 bucks...WELL.....this stuff WORKS!!..My teeth are so white now..i just brush my teeth with it like regular toothpaste twice/3 times daily..(do not brush on tongue)...I just recently took pics and added them to my Facebook Page and my teeth are shining white</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on for several years.  I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  Last year, I went to visit friends out of state after not seeing them for several years and they asked me right away if I bleached my teeth and if I went to a dentist to have it done, was it expensive.  Now and then, I&#x27;ll remember to use this as I am an avid tea and coffee drinker.  I&#x27;ll use it for 15 minutes on top and bottom, maybe 3 or 4 times a month.  I just bought those plastic gum devices in the sports section at the store - couple bucks and work just fine.  I was webcamming yesterday with my oldest son and he said, \\&quot;wow mom!  your teeth are bright\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t think about it until someone mentions it so thought I&#x27;d leave a review to let you all know - this does work.</li>
    <li> Based on so many good reviews I got mine at RiteAid. The results were nothing to write home about - my teeth were the same shade they were before I tried using this product a few times :((  Three months after I bought it the gel turned into liquid and now looks like it&#x27;s going to explode. I&#x27;m going to take it back and see if the store will give me a refund or recommend something else instead.</li>
    <li> It  works but only to a certain extent.  If you drink coffee or smoke, it has visible but limited results</li>
    <li> I havent used it every day but I did notice some whitening. Its cheap and worth the try. Once you open it, it wont stay good for very long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 weeks, and my teeth are much whiter.  My 5 year old daughter said to me yesterday... &amp;#34;Mommy your teeth really look beautiful.  They look just like the lady&#x27;s teeth on the box.&amp;#34;  That made me feel  good, because I was asking her just about every day since I started using it, and she would say &amp;#34;no they still look yellow.&amp;#34;  I started off the first week using it twice a day for abotu 5-10 minutes.  Then I changed to once a day for 20 minutes.  I felt like the bottle ran out really quick, but maybe I was using too much.  I will order another bottle, and continue using it.  It definitely works!</li>
    <li> This whitener works pretty good if you keep up with it. Just make sure to take breaks from it after a while, as your teeth will become sensitive after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dollar General just started stocking the whole kit with mouth piece and everything for about $6. So check your local stores first. It will save you time and money.</li>
    <li> This product may very well whiten teeth better than anything outside a dentists office, but it needs to come with a warning in HUGE red letters that you use this product at your own risk. And a risk it is! I received mine and used it immediately and followed the directions to the letter. I was NOT able to wear it for the recommended time as the pain was off the scale. The next day, I had to make an emergency appt. with my dentist as my tongue and gums were swollen, red and there were blisters! My dentist informed me that I had a very bad chemical &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; from the product and gave me an oral anti-biotic mouth wash and pain reliever. It took 4 days for the pain to go away. I threw the remaining product in the garbage and right now I don&#x27;t care if my teeth are neon yellow.......I NEVER want to experience that kind of pain again. Buyer beware has never been a more appropriate review!</li>
    <li> SURPASSED EXPECTATIONS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED IT AND WILL USE IT AGAIN.  WILL TELL MY FRIENDS AND EXTENDED FAMILY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK TO THE PRODUCER</li>
    <li> This product is ok.A helpful hint-if you want dentist quality then use the crest 3d white strips and the next day use this product.Provided you do both you will have the whitest teeth in town..</li>
    <li> 5 STARS so far I have used the product and I must say it really works. My teeth seem noticeable whiter and its only been 4 days. I really recommended the product. So far it has no side effects. I will update the review once the product is finished&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It Will not whiten Caps, Crowns or Veneers.</li>
    <li> You know why I&#x27;m giving this one star? Because of what became of this. I was so inspired tot ry this magical tooth whitening bleach, I was so ready to get rid of these ugly yellow teeth I own and trade them in fora beautiful white smile. I paid in advnace to get this item early so i could use it. When the day came- I checked the mail. Twice. Finally it arrived along with my teeth guard- I wasted no time in unpacking it. Upon unpacking the thin material on the inside was drenched.. Half the packaging was drenched in product. DRENCHED. I was very angry. Very VERY angry. I uncapped the cap and to my suprise.. The seal was still on. Sealed it shut. Yet the product was half empty. I squeezed the product for any holes - if  it had leaked in any way- Nothing. So, I was confused. Is this product supposed to be half empty? Anyways..The product itself I tried. It was amazing, it delivers as promised. The taste isgod awful and it&#x27;s very liquidy. Not like a gel atall. It&#x27;s the same liquid mass as water. SO it&#x27;s easy for you to drip it down your throat . Not fun. This product I am very dissapointed in. If theirs anyway I can get this product in a store ..Walmart or something PLEASE tell me. The shipping is too awful. It delivers poorly and makes the product look terrible when in fact I know it has potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It does whiten your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COns: Very liquidy ( like water. Be careful.) Poor packaging, half empty, Very small. Dissapointing overall.&lt;br /&gt;I would write this a better review if it was worth my money but from this first impression- it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Please be very careful using this product. It is very aggressive on the tooth enamel.&lt;br /&gt;It is a highly toxic product with a clear warning, so use with extreme care or you may end up at the dentist office or worse in the ER.</li>
    <li> The product delivered as promised!!!!!  I will definitely use it again and again and again and recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> This takes more than 5 minutes, but If you keep up for at least a week you will see results.&lt;br /&gt;10 minutes a day for a week and my teeth have never been whiter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big coffee and tea fan, so naturally my teeth started to pay for it and I wanted to whiten them. I have tried every whitening toothpaste and rinse available with no visible results, and have spent close to $100 dollars searching for a whitening strip kit that would do the job. Unfortunately I have no idea if any of those kits would have worked, because they caused so much sensitivity in my teeth that I had to stop using them after only a day or two. Then I stumbled on a recommendation for this product from a Youtube video and decided to try it out since it&#x27;s so cheap and I really had nothing to lose. I&#x27;m happy to say that not only does this product cause me NO sensitivity whatsoever (even using it for up to 15-20 minutes for many days in a row), but it also whitens my teeth fantastically! The gel works its way in and adheres to every nook and cranny in and between your teeth, so there&#x27;s no worry that the spaces between teeth will remain stained, as I&#x27;ve so often heard can happen with strips. In all, I will continue to exclusively use this product for my teeth whitening needs.</li>
    <li> After buying lots of whitening products over the years, I didn&#x27;t expect too much especially with the price. I read the other reviews and thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;Within 2 days I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing and after a week I was so pleased! I am an ex smoker and do drink a lot of tea so I was amazed at the results. The only drawback to it is that you can only use it for 2 weeks, I think as long as you give it a week or so break it would be ok to use it a couple of times a week.</li>
    <li> I used this everyday for a few weeks. I did not see a change nor did anyone ask if I was whitening my teeth (like the last pricey product). I am non smoker and do not drink that much colored caff. drinks. I&#x27;m wondering if this product would be for them.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this product I was a bit skeptical because it was so inexpensive ,but one i used it I saw results immediately. My teeth were at least 2 to 3 shades lighter!! I havent stop using it because for a year now because I get so many compliments and comments if i get my teeth professionally whitened! every time i use it I feel like my teeth lighten. SATISFIED</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty cheap and well worth it in my opinion. I have been using it for about 6 months and have noticed differences in my teeth for sure. Definitely did not make my teeth a perfect pearly white, but it also works much better than any whitening toothpaste I have ever used. Just buy a mouth guard for a buck and use that as a whitening tray and you are set!</li>
    <li> The whitener is easy to use and very effective! I had used it before with great results! Doesn&#x27;t burn or taste funny just works!</li>
    <li> have NOT done the whole shabang dentists office whitening BUT did get the custom made trays with the injectable vial product with good results, teeth are just too sensitive to follow directions for daily use so just waited for the sensitivity to calm and used again...  tried all the white strip types, the stick application product, arm &amp; hammer toothpaste, baking powder or is it soda?, and nothing worked as well for the least cost as this 5min gel... I typically apply a very small amount directly to the front teeth to reduce waste and then place the trays on top for 15mins and can definitely see the difference... I drink coffee, wine, green juices, and keep forgetting to use a straw so keeps the pearly whites whiter... pleased with results, not the movie star super gleam but much better than most folks my age who ignore this important aspect of facial expression... high recommend</li>
    <li> The jury is still out.  I see improvement, but have to admit I am not using religiously.  Arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a middle-aged woman who has been through a lot.  I have metastatic cancer and the last five years have been full of surgeries, chemotherapies, antibodies, drugs, sickness, near death and lots of doctor&#x27;s appointments.  And, of course, the most frustrating thing in my life is yellow teeth.  So I thought I would fix it.  Nobody wants to die with teeth that look like corn.  One of the drugs I&#x27;m on makes it difficult for me to go to a dentist so I have to be very careful about what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth.  It didn&#x27;t really whiten them either but I think that&#x27;s because the teeth are eroded and they won&#x27;t get completely white anymore.  I also was not faithful using it every day, just once in a while, when I need to take a picture or something. So maybe one day I will try it every day for a week.  Who knows?  For me, it&#x27;s a meh.  I wish the would come up with some kind of cosmetic you could paint on your teeth to whiten them for a couple hours or so, wouldn&#x27;t that be cool?  Yes, it would.</li>
    <li> Ive only had this product a short time and used it a few times, but I dont think it whitens as much as other reviewers say. Ive had better whitening with Rembrandt toothpaste. Will update. Free shipping was unbelievably slow from Amazon too.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at Walmart, first off. From the reviews it works for some and not others. It does burn if I get it on my lips, so it must be doing something, but I see an improvement in brightness, not a real whitening. I asked my friends to tell me if they noticed and improvement and they did not. Also using two kinds of Rembrandt whitening and one kind of Crest whitening toothpaste and no changes there. I have to admit I have not been long at trying to whiten my teeth so I will give it more time. How long does it take?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 5 years now and have never had an issue with it. It whitens like the expensive strips, it&#x27;s only 5 mins in your mouth instead of 30, it has a very light flavour and it&#x27;s CHEAP. I would recommend buying better mouth trays. The trays that come with it now are bulky and very loose fitting. They used to have much better trays in the box and the company went to these cheap ones that feel awkward in your mouth and allows the gel to ooze out. Don&#x27;t use it more than twice a day if you are worried about enamel damage. It&#x27;s a very safe product in my opinion and I&#x27;ve just had a full dental exam and passed with flying colours. No enamel damage and healthy teeth after 5 years of use. Sometimes when I need a quick pick me up before I go out, I will put a pea sized drop of it on my toothbrush and brush my teeth with the gel very lightly staying away from my gums and let it sit for a min and rinse. I really love this product! It&#x27;s one of those things I use all the time. I&#x27;d be super bummed out if they stopped making it.</li>
    <li> For some reason I seem to be the only one that has had unfavourable results. I used a personalized mouth tray as instructed by a lot of you tubers, I followed the directions according to the tube (25min 2x day for first 2 weeks etc). I have tried applying it the most effective way I can find, and no matter what, it has no effect on my teeth. I used this product for 4 weeks and did not notice any difference in the whiteness of my teeth.( took before and after pictures to see). I&#x27;m sure it works for everybody else but I am so sad that it didn&#x27;t work for me. I would still recommend trying it despite my review since it is so affordable. If it works for you, I&#x27;m jealous!</li>
    <li> this s*** is horrible.. worst thing ive ever bought in my life. plz dont waste your money. if I could give it less than.zero stars I would bjt it makes u ayleast give 1</li>
    <li> We decided to bought this product because we have read a lot of excellent reviews. My teeth has stained and my husband too.We leave the gel 15mins. WOW what a big difference.We highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> works wonders in just a couple applications</li>
    <li> Not much to say. It works perfectly. Whitens teeth as advertised. Impressed. One thing to note is do not do this more than 2 times a week, because the active ingredients in this product can hurt teeth enamel.</li>
    <li> I do not have very white teeth naturally and have tried a number of things to improve them over the years.  I have even had them whitened by dentists twice.  I have never noticed much difference.  With Plus Bleach Whitening Gel I noticed a difference right away.  I have caps on my front teeth, and they are a little whiter than the other teeth and stains, etc. start to show a significant difference quickly. The first time I used this gel, it seemed that all of the stains were gone and with continued use, they are whiter that I have ever seen them. My teeth will never be very white, but I have been pleased to see such an improvement.  Usually, I just spread a little on my teeth while doing makeup for a few minutes and rinse.  I find that works almost as well as 16 minutes with the mold.  This five minute gel works better for me than anything that I have tried.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see much a difference and am really disappointed in this product. I will not try again and if you want to try this product just beware that you won&#x27;t get your teeth sparkling white by any means.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, and as promised.  Very good job - thank you much.</li>
    <li> works well, be careful with the gums!</li>
    <li> Product is worth buying! The best teeth whitening product out there! I&#x27;m never going to buy the whitening trays at walmart for like $50 and then have to leave them in for 30 min - 1 hr when this is just 5 mins and you can see the change in just a few goes. I leave it in while I&#x27;m in the shower then brush my teeth when I get out. Great product!</li>
    <li> After using this daily, for 10 minutes in my mouth, for about two weeks I have noticed a little bit of a difference in the color of my teeth. They are a little whiter. Its not the best whitening product out there, but its an excellent cheap alternative!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this whitener for the past several months.  It works really well for me.  I wish I had discovered it before I bought expensive, custom-made, mouth trays from my dentist.  Even though I have custom-fit trays, I prefer to just use this product with my toothbrush.  It&#x27;s not necessary to use it everyday, either.  I use it about once or twice a week.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> So far I don&#x27;t see a difference will keep trying until gel is gone I still have another tube to use up</li>
    <li> sorry, I see some of the good reviews but I used this stuff religiously and all it did was leave a few white \\&quot;spots\\&quot; on my teeth.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again. I used the strips in the past with much better results.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing in 2007 to &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; my teeth, I used many days, and it destroyed my gums. Since then Im living with periodontal disease, bleeding, bad breath, 4-6 mm pockets.&lt;br /&gt;You are not gonna get white teeth, the only thing you are gonna get is a gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;Save your 5 dollars and 1000s for treatment. Im telling you.&lt;br /&gt;Im not sensitive, thats why I could use it for a few days, the only thing I did notice was white spots in my gums, but I thought they would be removed with saliva and brushing, but I was badly wrong. Dont buy, save your 5 dollars and 1000 for gum treatment. I really need a lawyer, Im thinking to sue this company.</li>
    <li> very good. i bought some tiny zippy bags from a $ shop. Cut the bag open and use it as a strip. For this cost effective paste.</li>
    <li> Works great but you really do need a mouth tray in order to use this product.</li>
    <li> I just began the one week beginner application and yes, I was impressed with only the first day.  Doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all and I did not have a problem with it touching my gums or any soreness at all.  I bought the el-cheapo mouth whitening trays (clear, see through) here on Amazon and cut one of them easily to fit my area.  My upper teeth for some reason were shades lighter and I wanted to lighten, brighten the bottom ones.  It was impressive with only the first day.  I can&#x27;t wait to do the rest of the week to see the results.  Certainly much cheaper than professional.  Matter of fact, the dentist told me that the OTC products are the way to go.  She said most work equal or better than the professional costly procedure.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t forget that your teeth are translucent.  By saying that I mean that getting this gel on the backs of your teeth is just as important as it is on the front.  If you really want to see a boost in the whiteness of your teeth, on your off days from using this product (I have off days because it makes my teeth sensitive) eat an apple from the core (don&#x27;t slice it up).  I used to do this religiously...  My teeth got so white, people began complimenting me right and left.  I have good teeth to begin with but if you don&#x27;t need a specialist to whiten your teeth because they are so bad, then this product works, just be consistent.  If you don&#x27;t use it, your teeth will go back to how they were (whatever your teeth darkening/worsening habits are i.e. soda, coffee, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is you only have to wear for a small amount of time because...  IT&#x27;S CONCENTRATED!  I wear it in the shower because a shower is about 5 minutes and then it&#x27;s easy to clean off while you&#x27;re in there (your teeth and the mouthguard)  The mouth guard that comes with the kit (they sell for $10) sucks big time.  Get a sports mouth guard and make it custom.  Read some reviews about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I stand by this product.  32 yr old male from St. Louis, MO.  I&#x27;ve even commented on a YouTube video about this product because the girl that made the video mentioned every thing that I said about it, besides the apple bit.  That&#x27;s from my own personal trial.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years.....Works great........Tried expensive strips that cost 10 times the price of this product.....Results are much better with this if used with the tray......And for 7.00 bucks (price has gone up in my area) to buy the refill you can&#x27;t go wrong......Like the tray because the whole tooth front and back becomes white and stays that way with regular use......No problem with sensitivity here.....</li>
    <li> I used to use Crest white strips back in the day... which only whitened the front teeth, and was a bit pricey in the beginning.  Then I used whitening toothpaste, which worked to some extent, but nothing amazing.  I even tried those professional grade whitening gel w the \\&quot;one size fits all tray\\&quot; ... which I am sure those would work over time, but they burned like heck and kind of put me off any \\&quot;serious\\&quot; whitening  for a while.  ...well I had a lot of early mornings recently, and the coffee I have been  consuming has NOT been kind to my teeth.. so I went for this 5 minute gel.  Ok I am really liking this... a LOT! It dosent burn, I use it on all my teeth, and in a reasonable about of time I have very significant whitening!! Lately I have been alternating a fortifying toothpaste so I can \\&quot;keep\\&quot; my results.  The price is really great for this whitener too.</li>
    <li> This product has recently disappeared from local shelves so I was pleased to see that it can still be obtained on line.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth spending money for! This actually works better than white-strips in a long run. If you want to whiten your teeth at home instead of paying visits to a dentistry, this is a solution. I used it everyday for five to ten minutes in a span of two weeks and I noticed that my teeth got whiter.</li>
    <li> Bought this a couple of weeks ago.  I have used it exactly as the directions stated (5 minutes) each use - 2 times a day.  But, I only had to use it about 3 days in a row.  Then I just started brushing my teeth, applying the gel and watching the clock as I got into the shower and rinsed while in there.  I know, silly, but it was easier than standing around while I tried not to swallow!!  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel never bothered me, or my gums.  It never even bothered my kinda sensitive teeth!!!  I am just now using this once every few days until I feel like the teeth are as white as I want them, without looking artificial and so far I have had really good results.  We had spent $600 on my husband whitening his teeth at the dentist and I just couldn&#x27;t see paying that.  His were worse than mine anyway, as he has the old &#x27;tetracycline&#x27; stain thing that&#x27;s an inner tooth discoloration PLUS he has coffee stains.  His worked &#x27;enough&#x27; but he doesn&#x27;t do any of the upkeep trays (ugh!) so I was thinking about steeling them but then someone told me that it might hurt my sensitive teeth.  So, I just thought i&#x27;d do the $5 thing from the grocery store and see what happened.  I have a crown on a tooth near the front that was done about 18 years ago and my teeth are now the same color as that.  So, I&#x27;m going to try to get them a little whiter (but not artificially crazy white) and then I&#x27;m getting the crown redone so I&#x27;ll have to do upkeep to keep them the same color.  The crown is &#x27;about due&#x27; if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, just wanted to share that experience.  Hope if you try it you get as good a results as I did.  I think for $5 and the little bit of time and efforts it&#x27;s been MORE than worth the money!!!  And no gum or tooth sensitivity for me at ALL!!!  So, I feel fortunate AND I saved $100&#x27;s of dollars!!!</li>
    <li> You have to do it a decent amount of times before you see major results but after you do you can use it mixed with your toothpaste to keep your teeth staying white</li>
    <li> This stuff really whitens your teeth if used correctly. I did it once a day and used a mouth tray and got great results.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly well. I am often complemented on my pearly whites. I&#x27;ve used this for several years and only need to apply it every one to two weeks</li>
    <li> I tried this using the brushing method. It does whiten your teeth; but you must be careful not to get any on your gums-it burns!</li>
    <li> I like it. I use it with a mouth tray and I use it about once a week it seems to keep my teeth white, Not sure if it really makes them much whiter but it keeps them protected going forward for sure.</li>
    <li> i love this original flavor gel but am not buying it anymore from this seller because he/she has doubled the price of it from last year which is rediculous! The product is amazing but i dont recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Did not like, could not make a mouthpiece to fit.</li>
    <li> Small amounts of peroxide in toothpaste is ok.  Any oral surgeon will tell you never use peroxide from the bottle, it changes DNA structure in your mouth and can quickly cause cancer. Never subject your oral health to peroxide from the bottle, it is too strong and kills tissue.</li>
    <li> After a year of wearing braces and drinking my daily coffee/tea, my teeth have gotten some awkward yellowing.  This gel seems to lift most of the stains rather well without leaving white streaks or spots (\\&quot;hot spots\\&quot;) like white-strips do.  Even the whitening gel my dentist gave me left spots; this stuff seems much more consistent because it contacts fully and is more gentle than the prescription gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, this gel has not caused any sensitivity unlike the strips and more powerful gel.  I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouthguard/tray that comes in the kit version is rather small (child&#x27;s size), so grab an adult one from the sporting goods section if you&#x27;re not dainty.  It&#x27;ll make the sting much less annoying.</li>
    <li> This works so well! I could not be happier!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously used boxed kits costing $40 - $60 (and they worked also) but this is much easier; the gel is just squeezed out across the line of your teeth, rubbed in and around the teeth with your fingers and then I recommend just lying down on your back with you mouth open so as not to disturb the gel with saliva or tongue movements! This works really well and after two or three applications I began to see definite results. I truly can&#x27;t understand how other reviewers have said it doesn&#x27;t work! I just don&#x27;t get how it&#x27;s possible for this not to work! Believe me, I don&#x27;t write a whole lot of reviews, but this is a topic I care about a lot and I really want everyone to know that this product does work and the value for money is unassailable! Good luck everyone!</li>
    <li> I started to use the product about a week ago, and because my teet were REALLY yellow, I&#x27;ve been leaving it on for about 20 minutes, once a day.  I started to notice that my teeth were getting sensitive to cold.  So I started to use Dr. Collins Restore toothpaste right after I wash off the Plus White (I use PLus White in some dental trays that came with another whitening product.)  Actually, I rubbed the Dr Collins on my teeth and let that sit for about another 15 minutes, then brushed my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The results were great!  Yellowness noticeably improved, and no pain on drinking cold water.  AND my teeth feel cleaner than they have in years.&lt;br /&gt;Try this protocol if you are having any sensitivity from the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a week now and can see an improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. I like this product.</li>
    <li> 5-minute whitening gel works that fast! I wanted to whiten my teeth before our wedding.  I could see a big difference after just a few applications.  So, I got the professional whitening look without the cost.</li>
    <li> Works as well with consistent use as expensive formulations from a dentist</li>
    <li> I just got this stuff today and used it. I put it on my teeth with my toothbrush and waited for 7 or 8 minutes. After I wash my mouth the result was amazing!! This is my first time that I have used teeth whitening in my life and seriously I love this stuff. You don&#x27;t have to waste your money on other products or doctors. And this is really cheap compare to other products. Cheap but amazing result. Just try. You will never regret!!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t burn my gums like some other whitening gels.  The product works to lighten my teeth.  I use it for 15-20 minutes a day with my own trays. Good price.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about where the product is coming from.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 03/03/2013: Working as promised - I have whiter teeth.  This product is so easy to use.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Help keep your teeth pearly white.  Use as directed and it will remove yellow stains Highly recomment this product.. I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> My teeth was lightly stained i used this once and noticed the staining was gone.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results.  The name is called 5 minute whitening.  I have put it on my teeth for about 20 minutes per session to see no results. The gel is thick, but I do understand why it thick.  It has to be able to stick to your teeth.</li>
    <li> just as expected &amp; just as described</li>
    <li> I leave it on my teeth for about ten to fifteen minutes on days that I remember to use the stuff...and it works.  It noticeably removes coffee stains in one use, but I have noticed increased sensitivity to cold drinks on days I&#x27;ve used it.  I would definitely recommend it to smokers and coffee/tea drinkers.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. especially at removing coffee stains,etc. Does not leave teeth sensitive. I would purchase again. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> My teeth are naturally quite white.  But I have been drinking so much black coffee the last year or two that I felt they really needed that extra bit of white since they seem to have dulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked well.  I could definitely see results when the 2-week cycle ended.  I havent really tried any other whiteners so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to them.  But it met my standards.  I could tell my teeth were slightly more sensitive (especially when I drank hot drinks), but it was nothing to whine over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously doubt you can get a better product for this price. Plus, I still have a good bit of the bottle left after the first recommended 2-week cycle.</li>
    <li> Keeps my teeth white by using it once every 2 weeks. I drink coffee and sometimes smoke a cigar so my teeth will get a little discolored. This stuff is easy to use and it really does work.</li>
    <li> I have noticed it works but it is kind of a pain to have to leave in your mouth for 20 minutes. I don&#x27;t think 5 minutes would really do anything for anyone and it would be more of a waste then anything. I have had no gum or lip discomfort. I apply it with a Q-tip and just close my mouth and try not to talk for 20 min. The mouth guard system is just too uncomfortable unless you spend the money and get custom fitted ones that are not all big and bulky. I would probably recommend getting something a bit more powerful but if you want something pretty cheap that works ok then go for it. Also, they sell this at walgreens for cheaper + you don&#x27;t have to wait for it, i found this out the hard way when i went to look for a mouth guard (they dont have mouth guards there).</li>
    <li> The instructions have you take these twice a day for 5-20 minutes, which I largely exceeded over a month.  I ended up not being able to use it twice a day, but I when I did it was for about 20-30 minutes at a time on average on a daily basis.  I saw some difference after that time, but only a little.  I would say my teeth were already a fairly pearl color (which I think is good for not using whitening) and in the end I did not see the more white results I was hoping for.  At the dentist&#x27;s they informed me that over-the-counter whitening agents have a lower concentrate of the chemical that causes results in whitening being effective, which coincides with my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a product that is very inexpensive, but for me, it required a lot effort with minimal results.  You get what you paid for, I suppose.</li>
    <li> Good product...I used to buy it at the store but can&#x27;t find it anywhere now. I put it on my teeth &amp; use a blow dryer on them for a couple minutes, it&#x27;s a trick I learned from a model friend that actually works!  I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than a couple times a week though because I&#x27;m afraid of it hurting my enamel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for a couple years.  In between I have tried the more expensive whiteners, including Perfect Smile.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this works just as well.  What a bargain.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it can burn the gums if it is placed too generously at the top of the tooth.  And usually it is the top of the tooth that need the most whitening.  The bottom of the tooth&#x27;s enamel can get easily eroded with too much whitener.  To help with this, I use this bleach gel in conjunction with an enamel strenghtening toothpaste.  Hope this helps!  Happy whitening.</li>
    <li> No major changes noticed after using it the first week. Will finish container to see if it will make a difference.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest and best whitening product I have ever used.  Hope you continue to keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> I feel like my teeth are weaker after using it, but I do think it makes my teeth a tiny bit whiter.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple of times but so far it seems to be working pretty well. It doesnt give dramatic or instant results though.</li>
    <li> This is the best tooth whitening gel. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this whitening gel on my ears so that when I&#x27;m riding my bicycle at night, my bright white ears reflect the light so that drivers see me.  There is one issue, and that is my curved concave-shaped ears have a tendency to focus the beam back at the drivers, temporarily blinding them.</li>
    <li> I notice results after a few days and it lasts a really long time</li>
    <li> wasnt sure if I am going to like it or hate it, I do have very sensitive teeth and after using strips last time I thought I&#x27;d rather shoot myself from pain it caused so I decided to give this a try... Love it - quick and easy! When I applied it my teeth started shooting right away and I thought I&#x27;ll be in worst pain ever but that was not the case - it did bleach my teeth noticeably (my teeth are of ok color but I drink tons of coffee and I am light smoker) and this actually did a great job, remember your teeth still getting bleached hours and days after you actually bleach them so be patient. I did use remineralization gel right after bleaching, look up on Amazon they are usually in blue syringe like tubes, the second I was done with bleaching I put that gel on and kept it for couple hours and that could be the reason why I had no teeth sensitivity, usually I&#x27;d be in brutal pain after bleaching.</li>
    <li> I used this for a week. Everything seemed great and my teeth were a little whiter. However, I started to notice white spots in my mouth, around my gums. I stopped using it. It&#x27;s been 6 months now and Ive been to one dentist and two doctors all of which haven&#x27;t been able to help me very much. I live with pain in my mouth DAILY now. I have a chemical burn now that wont heal but only worsen when I eat spicy foods or anything that&#x27;s hot in temperature. I called the number on the back of the tube and of course there was no answer. I left a message and no one returned my call. This is pure crap and if you buy it, you are putting yourself at risk to receive chemical burns. I would never have bought it if I knew I would be living in pain daily now.</li>
    <li> I sure was a skeptic. I started years ago with dentist office zoom and then zoom follows ups at $500 per.. I then went to the expensive day white and night white.. Sure, that works in only a few 30 hour sessions. My daughter tried this and it looked like it really worked. the price was right.. I tried it for 2 weeks, twice a day.. My teeth rock. Thrilled with it and since weaker than the more expensive gels, the teeth sensitivity and gum issues were virtually non existent. I just bought a few packs to stockpile, as this will be my new go to whitener!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a month ago and i took pictures from day 1 up to now.. for the first week or two, i&#x27;ve been following the instructions on the product using qtip and the tray and sometimes leaving it on longer than 20 mins but after the second week, i didn&#x27;t see any difference in my teeth. I stopped using it for a few days and used it again but using it like toothpaste and i&#x27;ve been doing that for more than a week. I saw no difference in my teeth when i look in the mirror but when i took a picture of it and compared it to my picture from day 1, the change in the color of my teeth is visible. note that i took both photos at the same place, time of the day and with the same cam. Also my lips sort of stings when the product touches it. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product. Maybe the effectiveness of the product is not that high but it&#x27;s still worth the bucks.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It whitens your teeth very good at a bargain price.  You do need to have one of those flexible rubber trays to put it into to mold around your teeth.  The first time I bought it the tray came included. The rubber teeth mold will last forever.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the more expensive products.</li>
    <li> I started bleaching way before it became the norm...I bleached for 10 years but had to stop due to financial reasons.  I only used dental bleach.  When I went back to it, I found for double the money you got less bleach, and instead of a big tube, they came in syringes.  I had professional molds done, so getting those was never a hassle until I moved.  I just couldnt afford to bleach the way I used to, and my teeth suffered.  Please note that my front teath are composite and were done when my teeth were at their whitest. I snap my teeth off from clenching due to stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this and saw the reviews, and while mine was just a tad more than $5.00 it was well worth it.  I read the reviews, I got some really good DIY trays that are rubbery instead of brittle, and this is my 2nd day using this, and this is a considerable difference.  I left it on longer than 5 minutes tho.  I read where one person went 20 minutes twice a day, so I did 1/2 hour a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was NO sensitivity.  If you have sensitivity, it means you best get to the dentist because a nerve is exposed that needs to be taken care of, the bleach is making you aware of your cavity.  I was blessed with very good teeth.  I also took someones advice and used a brush to fill in the trays and paint the trays with the gel, then I did the same to my actual teeth.  I let my teeth dry which is easier said than done.  I ended up taking my hair dryer on low on a cool setting and blowing it into my mouth to dry my teeth, then I put the trays in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont usually promote or discount items unless they impress me quite a bit.  This impressed me a lot.  I have bought the highest level bleach which is either 36 or 42 from the dentist, and this stuff works better.  The bleach when it first came out from the dentist was in a similar tube, but the companies caught on that they could rip you off with the syringes.  The original bleach from the dentist way back when was much better than whats out now and this is the closest I have come so far.and this is the closest I have come so far.</li>
    <li> Does a great job whiting teeth.........</li>
    <li> Not immediate result..</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this every single night for a couple weeks and his teeth are way whiter and shiny! I am going to start using it now. It is easy to use and last a long time. We have the mouth insert which makes it a lot easier then trying to smile the whole time you have it on your teeth and then you don&#x27;t taste it as much. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving four stars to this product because I&#x27;m still testing it.&lt;br /&gt;However, after  three day trial, it seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;I hope Iwill get back to this review to add another star .</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a big difference yet, but my teeth do feel smooth</li>
    <li> I drink tons of tea and my teeth have become pretty stained. My electric toothbrush and whitening toothpaste just weren&#x27;t enough. I used this whitening gel for 20 minutes for 4 days in a row and it noticeably lightened my teeth overall. If you look closely, there are still some stains but those have lightened also. Whitening strips tend to hurt my teeth/gums but this gel didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I applied a thick layer to my teeth with a cotton swab, applied a little more to a mouth guard I bought at Target for $1, waited 20 minutes, and rinsed thoroughly afterward. I plan to use once a week or less to maintain color.</li>
