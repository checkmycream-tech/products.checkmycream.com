      <li>This eyeliner is a good value and easy to apply.</li>

      <li>I actually use it as an eyebrow liner as it is a perfect match.  </li>
      <li>I have light skin with brown eyes, and I think the Espresso color is a nice shade for me.</li>
      <li>Love this eyeliner in the Espresso and it stays put</li>
      <li>I love how it never needs to be sharpened.</li>
      <li>and I will get a perfect crescent-shape below my eyebrow from this, only visible when I close my eyes but still.</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>You will have to be just a bit more thorough in removing it before bed -- that&#x27;s the price to pay for the staying power, however.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this every day to line my eyes on top.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s one of the more affordable makeup tools out there; you can get it on sale sometimes at Target for under $5.  </li>
      <li>Espresso is my favorite color.</li>
      <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s the only eyeliner I use because it has worked the best for me time and time again.</li>
      <li>All you have to do is twist, and you have more of the product.</li>
      <li>First of all, the convenience is amazing.</li>
      <li>It glides on smoothly and is easy to control.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Perfect Point Plus Eyeliner since I was in high school (over a decade ago), and I can safely say that this eyeliner works better for me than any other ever has.  </li>
      <li>the end of a full day, you will be pleased to check in the mirror and find that the line is exactly where you put it hours ago -- no racoon eyes.</li>
      <li>The tip is just the right size to make a fine line.</li>
      <li>They stay in place all day but remove easily with a gentle cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a faithful customer; no other eyeliner has applied as smoothly and easily as this one.  </li>
      <li>the price is right.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t run, and I get compliments on my eyebrows all the time (a strange but nice compliment).</li>
      <li>I typically use regular eye pencils that you sharpen.. and find the Covergirl perfect point plus is much easier to apply.  </li>
      <li>This product is a real winner from CoverGirl!</li>
      <li>As I said before, this eye pencil is of great quality and I will definitely order it again in the near future.</li>
      <li>The pencil lines well in a nice dark chocolaty color.</li>
      <li>I own the brown and the black.</li>
      <li>and I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also really fond of the angled smudger on the end</li>
      <li>and I absolutely have to use a primer with this, or it will end up all over.</li>
      <li>It goes on much smoother</li>
      <li>in all, this pencil liner is so much better that other liners I&#x27;ve tried -- and</li>
      <li>I have always come back here for a liner that can give clean feathered points or a glamourous smoky look without the need for eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The black is good, super dark, but it tends to smudge and smear as the day wears on.</li>
      <li>Clean, lasting lines that go on smooth in a nice dark brown color that covers the little purple veins in my eyelids.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I hope is that they add more colors to the current scheme.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this</li>
      <li>i have tried all kinds of eyeliners, from drugstore brands to high end brands</li>
      <li>So obviously the result is worth the hassle to me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;But the color is rich and dark, without the harshness of black, and it goes on smoothly!</li>
      <li>The white &amp;#34;blender&amp;#34; at the bottom will fall out in your makeup bag in the first week.  </li>
      <li>If you want a wider or more smudged line, you have only to use the other end to blend the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I especially like that it&#x27;s gentle on the skin</li>
      <li>Completely melted off.  </li>
      <li>An easy fix for that is to apply powder directly under your lower lashes with a small eyeshadow brush.</li>
      <li>so it glides on easily without scraping my eyelid like some pencil eyeliners have done in the past.</li>
      <li>There is simply no other explanation for the world&#x27;s weakest plastic compound to be used as the cap.  </li>
      <li>Today I put it on carefully and never touched it and the whole line was gone within 2 hours.  </li>
      <li>The liner is so soft and mushy that if you sharpen the point will be gone instantly.  </li>
      <li>I have tried the normal pencil and liquid versions as well as Maybelline and other companies.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s been around a long time</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how, I&#x27;m certainly not clear WHY, but they do.  </li>
<li> it helps me blend out hard lines and make my brow look natural.</li>

<li> have the PPPE in Espresso and Black and intend to stay with them.  </li>
<li> They send little elves to your house to break your caps.  </li>
<li> The Espresso is a very dark brown</li>
<li> I have very dark hair</li>
<li> You wont have it pushed up too far, you won&#x27;t have pushed too hard or done anything wrong.  </li>
<li> There is no need to sharpen it, like an ordinary eye pencil.</li>
<li> and you can either have a thick line or thick</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> This is the worst eye liner I&#x27;ve ever used,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the eyeliner I have been using for over 15 years.  A pencil lasts for months.  I love how it never needs to be sharpened. It glides on smoothly and is easy to control.  I have light skin with brown eyes, and I think the Espresso color is a nice shade for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl&#x27;s Perfect Point Plus Eyeliner for more than 10 years at this point.  I&#x27;m a faithful customer; no other eyeliner has applied as smoothly and easily as this one.  I especially like that it&#x27;s gentle on the skin; it doesn&#x27;t tug the skin as you apply it.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is great. I use the Espresso shade. I&#x27;m very fair skinned so black eye liner is too dark for me. The Espresso is a very dark brown so it works perfect for my skin tone. It&#x27;s sort of like a gel so it glides on easily without scraping my eyelid like some pencil eyeliners have done in the past. It lasts all day for me and I have very oily skin. It&#x27;s a small enough point that I can put it on just where I want it. It never gets blunt because of the \\&quot;self-sharpening\\&quot; aspect. Like I said, it&#x27;s the only eyeliner I use because it has worked the best for me time and time again.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and color and have been using it for years.  I actually use it as an eyebrow liner as it is a perfect match.  It doesn&#x27;t run, and I get compliments on my eyebrows all the time (a strange but nice compliment).</li>
    <li> There is no way to get a &amp;#34;perfect point&amp;#34;.  The liner is so soft and mushy that if you sharpen the point will be gone instantly.  It smudges once on.  Today I put it on carefully and never touched it and the whole line was gone within 2 hours.  Completely melted off.  This is the worst eye liner I&#x27;ve ever used,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pencil for years to fill in my sparse eyebrows. I have very dark hair so the expresso shade is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t look unnatural like black does and it doesn&#x27;t uave any red tones in it like a lot of brow pencils do. I&#x27;m also really fond of the angled smudger on the end it helps me blend out hard lines and make my brow look natural.</li>
    <li> happy with order will order again</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend.  She can never find expresso.  In a haste  of  excitement she opened the package only to find out was Khaki grey. Now I can&#x27;t send it back.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is a good value and easy to apply. The tip is just the right size to make a fine line.</li>
    <li> I use this every day to line my eyes on top. The pencil lines well in a nice dark chocolaty color. No need to sharpen since it is automatic. Would buy again</li>
    <li> As I said before, this eye pencil is of great quality and I will definitely order it again in the near future.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyeliner for a long time now. It is a really good product. I like the comfort and ease of putting it on. Espresso is my favorite color.</li>
    <li> I have used the Perfect Point Plus Eyeliner since I was in high school (over a decade ago), and I can safely say that this eyeliner works better for me than any other ever has.

The only thing I hope is that they add more colors to the current scheme.  A little green, a richer purple definitely can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.  It&#x27;s probably the last beacon of Cover Girl product I will buy.  I will give it 5 stars because of that but also tell you what I don&#x27;t appreciate.  But since it is the ONLY eyeliner I like, I have to give it 5 stars anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks are:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The white &amp;#34;blender&amp;#34; at the bottom will fall out in your makeup bag in the first week.  Just take it off and throw it away when you get it.  Save yourself the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;2.  About once per stick the liner will just &amp;#34;break off&amp;#34;.  You wont have it pushed up too far, you won&#x27;t have pushed too hard or done anything wrong.  Don&#x27;t take an extra Prozac because of it, it&#x27;s not your fault.  It&#x27;s a Cover Girl product.  If it didn&#x27;t have an issue like this, it would be a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The cap will break.  You can leave it on your counter and only pick it up once per day (like I do).  They send little elves to your house to break your caps.  I don&#x27;t know how, I&#x27;m certainly not clear WHY, but they do.  There is simply no other explanation for the world&#x27;s weakest plastic compound to be used as the cap.  It won&#x27;t break enough that your tip is in any danger, so just put a piece of tape around it if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet I still buy this Eyeliner.  EVERY time.  So obviously the result is worth the hassle to me.  Clean, lasting lines that go on smooth in a nice dark brown color that covers the little purple veins in my eyelids.  All with no sharpening (because we all know how much of your product that wastes).</li>
    <li> This pencil is great.  Love the color. The point on the pencil is perfect for lining your eyes.  You never have to sharpen it just turn it up until it&#x27;s gone!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is a real winner from CoverGirl! It&#x27;s been around a long time and I hope they never discontinue it. First of all, the convenience is amazing. There is no need to sharpen it, like an ordinary eye pencil. All you have to do is twist, and you have more of the product. The line it produces is so sharp, that you can use it right near your lash line for a dramatic yet a bit natural look. If you want a wider or more smudged line, you have only to use the other end to blend the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of a full day, you will be pleased to check in the mirror and find that the line is exactly where you put it hours ago -- no racoon eyes. You will have to be just a bit more thorough in removing it before bed -- that&#x27;s the price to pay for the staying power, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this pencil liner is so much better that other liners I&#x27;ve tried -- and the price is right. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I absolutely have to use a primer with this, or it will end up all over. I have hooded lids and I will get a perfect crescent-shape below my eyebrow from this, only visible when I close my eyes but still. If I try to line my lower lid, I end up looking like a raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the color is rich and dark, without the harshness of black, and it goes on smoothly!</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner in the Espresso and it stays put which is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;it has a built in sharpener and you can either have a thick line or thick&lt;br /&gt;depending on how you apply it. I&#x27;ve not used the eraser/smudger tip thingy,&lt;br /&gt;but the pencil itself is great! I would highly recommend this</li>
    <li> This is the only eyeliner i will wear, and they do not sell it in the small town that i live in. i have tried all kinds of eyeliners, from drugstore brands to high end brands and i still keep coming back to this. I own the brown and the black. the brown is great....does not smudge and stays in place all day. The black is good, super dark, but it tends to smudge and smear as the day wears on. An easy fix for that is to apply powder directly under your lower lashes with a small eyeshadow brush.Highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I typically use regular eye pencils that you sharpen.. and find the Covergirl perfect point plus is much easier to apply.  It goes on much smoother and I&#x27;m not constantly sharpening a pencil only to get clumps on my eye or the point breaking off.  I&#x27;d recommend this product and also plan to keep buying.</li>
