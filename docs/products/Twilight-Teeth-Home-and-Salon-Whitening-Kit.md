      <li>This product is AMAZING</li>
      <li>Just think of the home kit as a touch-up to your teeth, rather than something that can be effective used by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>This product is AMAZING at such a great price!</li>
      <li>This has happened to more than one bottle.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re a tanner, though, you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe that they sell it as cheap as they do, because they could get more for it.</li>
      <li>need to use it more to give a better review.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love using this product.</li>
      <li>MUST HAVE! :)</li>
      <li>My toothpaste does a better job</li>
      <li>Baking soda worked 50 times better.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll see results in noted 4-7 sessions, I&#x27;m 99% sure of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>THIS IS OK ,USED IT AT THE TANING BED</li>
      <li>Make sure to brush your teeth before every whitening session.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s happened both times safe to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I say this product works for sure.</li>
      <li>Well.... The light doesn&#x27;t even work!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s even better than you can use it at home or in a tanning bed.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>This product works much better than whitening strips.</li>
      <li>and i love it</li>
      <li>I see better results after the tanning bed but both work well.</li>
      <li>My best friend is a dental assistant and she swears my results are as good, if not better than the $600 treatment her dental office performs.  </li>
      <li>course, the tanning bed is always the more effective option, because the UV rays are much more powerful.</li>
      <li>Good price fast shipment!</li>
      <li>This works better in the tanning salon but the light works well too.</li>
      <li>Note to company, please make UV light work better for at home purposes.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as shown , &amp; I love it !</li>
      <li>But ok for a daily whitening between the more effective whiting strips!</li>
      <li>Use it while tanning once every other week for the best results!</li>
      <li>The home kit allows you to easily whiten your teeth at your convenience.</li>
      <li>Whitens, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth buying the LED light to do it in your own time.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this thinking it would be convenient forme to use while i tan, and an easy touch up between with the included light.</li>
      <li>The tanning bed works much better, your teeth will be bright white when you leave the salon, but for those who don&#x27;t use the tanning bed, the led accelerator does still work quite well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the light accelerator and also have used it without the light in a tanning bed.</li>
      <li>when i use the LED light i leave it in for 20 minutes also.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t need the light.</li>
      <li>Works fantastic.</li>
      <li>I have used this 4 times already-twice in the tanning bed &amp; twice using the LED light the package came with.</li>
      <li>i used the light and in the tanning bed.  </li>
      <li>Light was broke from the beginning.</li>
      <li>The light didn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ve used the rest when I tan and see no results.</li>
      <li>The UV light</li>
      <li>light didnt work...</li>
      <li>Although when I received the product, the light didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I have not used it at home with the light.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people review that there light didn&#x27;t work &amp;</li>
      <li>Put batteries in light and it flickered a bit but eventually went on.&lt;br</li>
      <li>product to teeth turned on light and started treatment.  </li>
      <li>It was shipped on time but the light up part did not work.  </li>
      <li>The light doesn&#x27;t do the job that the tanning bed does.</li>
      <li>i orderee 2 and the uv light never worked.</li>
      <li>You can use it while in a tanning bed or with the light.</li>
      <li>I got it and the light didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>The light to use at home doesn&#x27;t work as well but can be used to touch up.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works great, but works better when you use in the tanning bed. The light that comes with it doesn&#x27;t work great, almost like it doesn&#x27;t screw on tight enough.</li>
    <li> I have used it about a dozen times and I&#x27;m not sure that I see such a huge difference. I still have half of it left so we will see how it goes.</li>
    <li> My teeth when I was younger were so disgusting and yellow because I never would brush and I was just nasty. but when I finally noticed how crusty I was, I began brushing my teeth more and cleaning myself up leading to me having some pretty white teeth. but I wanted whiter! so I saw my friend using this and asked about it, then ordered it. I&#x27;ve gotten SO many compliments on how white my teeth are. and it&#x27;s even better than you can use it at home or in a tanning bed. I say this product works for sure.</li>
    <li> i just got this yesterday, and I used it for just 15 mins and I can already tell a difference in my teeth and how white they are becoming! &amp; I&#x27;m a very big coffee drinker and have a tint of yellow teeth and I can see the difference! Very good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once since I got it, but it is already showing results.  I&#x27;ve tried other products like white strips and such but nothing has worked better than twilight teeth.  Usually, when I used the other products my teeth would be sensitive afterwords, but I had no problem with Twilight Teeth.  I didn&#x27;t use a tanning bed so instead I used the LED Accelerator light, which worked great!  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants whiter teeth fast.</li>
    <li> This product works, and you don&#x27;t have to go to a tanning salon.  It is a lot cheaper than the dentist and a lot easier than the trays.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. Works fantastic. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bottle leaks if not stood up all the way, and the gel crystallized and basically glued it shut. This has happened to more than one bottle. Whitens better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth! I can&#x27;t use crest whitestrips because of the pain they cause, plus this stuff works much faster!</li>
    <li> This kit is awesome. Works great,  especially if you go to the tanning bed, but on one of these thati ordered the at-home light was dead upon arrival. Not sure yet if it&#x27;s just dead batteries or the device is broken.</li>
    <li> This product really works ive been using it for years now and the light really does work! I would totallly recommend it to anyone, no sensitivity to the liquid or anything its pretty legit!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t feel like the little light that comes with this product actually works.  But using the mouth piece and the whitening gel on my teeth in the tanning bed actually works. If you are someone that goes to the tanning bed and is wanting to whiten your teeth this is the product for you. You will see immediate results after using it.  immediately after using in tanning bed, I&#x27;ll get out and have white specks on my teeth that fade after an hour or so.  Also this product and the UV light from the tanning bed make my teeth feel like I just left a dentist cleaning.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, it does work much better in the tanning bed compared to the home LED whitener. It didn&#x27;t hurt to try but don&#x27;t spend extra money on the at home kit.</li>
    <li> Light was broke from the beginning.</li>
    <li> I had several friends, including my best friend, notice my teeth being a LOT whiter after only 2 sessions.  This product works and it works fast.  It&#x27;s worth buying the LED light to do it in your own time.  My only word of caution is to beware of how much you&#x27;ll drool if you&#x27;re walking around getting ready or cleaning while wearing the mouth tray.</li>
    <li> This deffinatly makes you teeth whiter - but I used it only in the tanning bed. The UV light it comes with did NOT work. When I opened up the package all the contents were just floating around outside of the box. But the product itself works great.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING at such a great price! I only used it ONCE before seeing results.. I am always weary with things like this but this truly knocks Crest Whitestrips out of the park!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and I think it is an excellent idea. Although when I received the product, the light didn&#x27;t work. It wouldn&#x27;t turn on and I don&#x27;t want to buy a new battery. Luckily I bought this product to use in the tanning bed so I don&#x27;t need the light. I love the outcome and my teeth look great.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much change. Not sure it&#x27;s as effective as the whitening strips. But ok for a daily whitening between the more effective whiting strips!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as shown , &amp; I love it ! Seems to be working good so far but only got to use it a few times yet .</li>
    <li> Im positive this would have been an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;The light was broken right out of the box and would not work, even with new batteries.</li>
    <li> Works better when used in tanning beds! but I have never been disappointed in this product</li>
    <li> The light doesnt work properly but at least I can still you the product in a tanning bed. Good price fast shipment!</li>
    <li> The light doesn&#x27;t stay on like the directions said it would, but other than that it works if I hold the button down the whole time.</li>
    <li> My teeth were WHITE after the first use. They did tingle a little and feel a bit uncomfortable. But they were white!</li>
    <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t order again.  Notice a little difference.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it consistently enough to see a huge change.</li>
    <li> The whitener hasn&#x27;t whitened my teeth at all... Not even 1 shade. The home UV light doesn&#x27;t work 99% of the time, so, u really HAVE TO use it in the tanning bed... I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product works much better than whitening strips. I&#x27;ve used the light accelerator and also have used it without the light in a tanning bed. I see better results after the tanning bed but both work well. You&#x27;re supposed to leave it in for 15-20 minutes so I usually just do it in my car on the way to work and it&#x27;s perfect. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am a teeth whitening Freak lol I have tried everything from home whiteners to the UV whiteners for tanning &amp; I can tell you(my experience with it), It works but doesn&#x27;t last long, Also you do not get a lot bottle very tiny, so for what you will spend to keep up using it when you tan you can buy the colegate strips for home, now yes I know there costly but you get a lot in each box &amp; with them once you reach a desired color you stay that way for awhile &amp; can stop them for a little bit &amp; use a teeth whitening tooth paste in between. The Twilight whitening  I didn&#x27;t see that much of a big deal &amp; the bottle is so so tiny &amp; you have to use a lot on your teeth for each tanning session, so it&#x27;s  gone fast then you have to buy another. I will give you a little tip (as I&#x27;am a teeth whitening fanatic and tried everything) lol. For tanning &amp; whitening your teeth you can buy the teeth pens in the drug stores or wallmart s or one called 5 minute  tooth whitening gel -found in cvs or rite aid wallmart targets  which is a few bucks &amp; put that on before you tan and yu can use both at home with no light or with a light if you already have one &amp; it works great. Keep up with them for a little bit &amp; the color lasts longer than the twillight &amp; they give yu a good amount of product  that lasts forever and does even better for me. See any teeth whitener can work in a tanning session, my dentist told me that shhsss lol.. When i spent hundreds to get my teeth whitened I started trying other at home ones and found pretty good results with strips (for home only not tanning) &amp; 5 minuite tanning gel &amp; others but this id work but your color don&#x27;t last, crest white strips &amp; colegate strips last &amp; others mentioned.I just wanted to share my experience but everyone is different. Good-luck &amp; Happy Whitening!</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would be convenient forme to use while i tan, and an easy touch up between with the included light. Well.... The light doesn&#x27;t even work! The gel doesn&#x27;t whiten your teeth... This was a waste of money and time... do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I am not 100% sold on the at-home aspect, but the gel definitely works in the tanning bed.  My teeth are whiter than they have ever been!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF ACTUALLY TURNED MY TEETH YELLOW!  DENTIST SAID REGULAR WHITE STRIPS ARE FAR BETTER.  THIS MADE MY TEETH LOOK DISGUSTING.</li>
    <li> The lights were burnt out.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product! Use it while tanning once every other week for the best results! Best way to whiten in minutes!</li>
    <li> This item would be 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for how chappy the led light is half the time it doesn&#x27;t even turn on and if it doesn&#x27;t the life of it is only tops 1 week don&#x27;t expect this item to last longer than that I&#x27;ve bought it twice and it&#x27;s happened both times safe to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again</li>
    <li> I saw no improvements.</li>
    <li> Waste of money! I think the seller buys in bulk, and stuff is probably old. The light didn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ve used the rest when I tan and see no results. Your better off using the teeth whitening Listerine mouthwash!!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS OK ,USED IT AT THE TANING BED WORK SOME WHAT BUT AFTER TWO DAYS YOUR TEETH GO BACK</li>
    <li> I have used twilight teeth for years in the tanning bed to help keep my teeth white.  It dries quickly and does work but don&#x27;t expect dentist white teeth with this.  I use a professional bleaching product (Opalesence 35%) with my bleaching trays to get better results but this is in addition to that.  I have not used it at home with the light.</li>
    <li> Bought this product in prep for a long few weeks of business travel.  Product arrived prompltly ( that was obviously Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;opened product, read &amp; followed instructions. Put batteries in light and it flickered a bit but eventually went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;applied product to teeth turned on light and started treatment.  after several minutes I looked down and saw no glowing light from the activator.  light never came back on even after changing batteries and trying to restart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tried to contact the manufacturer to have them send a replacement light--and when I called the \\&quot;Questions / comments call toll free 800 #\\&quot; I simply get an automated attendant which  has no routing to a person &amp; no forum to leave a QUESTION OR A COMMENT--Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if this product worked for you --congrats--I guess I&#x27;ll never find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;requesting refund from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive an email from someone at Twilight teeth stating they would send out a replacement-that said it was not a very No apology &amp; No contact # or information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I receive a replacement, I&#x27;ll follow up with an update and adjust my rating accordingly...for now I am giving them back 1 more star for at least responding via email-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to the Manufacturer: stand behind your product and have someone answer the phone if you&#x27;re going to advertise an 800# for \\&quot;Questions &amp; Comments.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The product is relatively mess free. My teeth didn&#x27;t hurt or become sensitive while using the product, but I saw no difference after I was done using it. I used this product for a few weeks, and unfortunately there was no change, which is super disappointing because like I said it didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive like most other products do.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit along with another refill of the gel that you apply to your teeth.  The teeth guard is comfortable and unlike some other products, does not prove to be uncomfortable.  After using this product for a week, I can definitely say that results are evident.  My teeth are slowly getting whiter with every application and I am continuing to use this product every day.  One suggestion, instead of applying the UV light for only 20 minutes, do it for 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on how long you can tolerate it.  While using the product, saliva does tend to build up and drool out of your mouth so have a towel ready to place underneath while using it.</li>
    <li> Great teeth whitening product. You can see the results already just after s few uses of the product. Would buy it again</li>
    <li> I have had friends who have gotten zoom teeth whitening done and theirs was painful and expensive. I used twilight teeth and get the same result. If we both have bright white teeth, whats the difference? Money, time and pain. I am so happy I discovered twilight teeth. I use it in the tanning bed and even after ONE use you will swear by this product. I have seldom used the led light but after discovering what the tanning bed can do with twilight teeth, I would not be one bit surprised if it whitens just as well. MIRACLE PRODUCT! MUST HAVE! :)</li>
    <li> I thought I would try an at-home whitener before looking at Zoom as an option.  I bought this one based on the generally good reviews.  I&#x27;ve used the entire (incredibly tiny) bottle of whitener on only my upper arc, to compare to my lower, and I can&#x27;t see any difference at all.  I brushed my teeth, then applied the whitener and used the light every day for 30 minutes at a time (there was no time recommendations that I could find on the box or bottle).  There is just no difference that I or my girlfriend can see between my upper and lower teeth.  Wish it had worked...</li>
    <li> This system was easy to use but The instructions did not tell you how long to leave on for. I did it for 30 min 5 times, no improvement. Would not buy again...</li>
    <li> This product does work to a degree but not as well as I had hoped. It is well worth the cost and does make the teeth whiter. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> nothing too special. Whitened a tiny bit, nothing too spectacular.</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning corporation where this product is twice the price at noted salon; however, just to compare and contrast, I ordered the product off Amazon once my last supply ran out (which took FOREVER).&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;The light is a bit tricky, but it&#x27;s nothing that putting a piece of CLEAR office tape--on top of the battery--won&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;Use the LED light as long and as often as you would in the tanning bed, if not a little longer (as long as your teeth don&#x27;t become sensitive). Remember, teeth whitening strips take quite some time to affect your teeth, so don&#x27;t expect a miracle with a 4 minute single home session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, caking on the gel is a waste of your money. Putting a thin layer on your teeth will do the trick, as long as it&#x27;s even. Let it DRY before starting up the home kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the tanning bed is always the more effective option, because the UV rays are much more powerful. Just think of the home kit as a touch-up to your teeth, rather than something that can be effective used by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a tanner, though, you&#x27;ll love this product. It only needs to be used about 4-7 sessions, and then put it down for a month or so. You&#x27;ll see results in noted 4-7 sessions, I&#x27;m 99% sure of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different at home whitening products.  The mouthwashes, toothpaste, and crest whitening strips all either took too long to work or HURT.  I have sensitive teeth so I&#x27;ve always been too scared to get them professionally whitened.  I had WAY whiter teeth after using Twilight Teeth just once for 12 minutes in a level 1 bed...seriously best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  It does leave a few white spots immediately after like people said, but they disappear in like 10 minutes and leave you with perfectly whiter teeth. Haven&#x27;t used it with the LED light yet though, only in the tanning bed.  DEFINITELY TRY THIS!</li>
    <li> light didnt work...dont buy</li>
    <li> This works very well! Whitens, and easy to use. The only problem I have with it is that while it&#x27;s in my mouth I drool, so for the twenty minutes I have it in I have to carry a cup under my chin.</li>
    <li> I loved using this in the tanning bed but I don&#x27;t tan anymore. The light doesn&#x27;t do the job that the tanning bed does.</li>
    <li> I purchased this expecting it to make my teeth a couple shades brighter. All it did was make my teeth look blotchy and gross. Baking soda worked 50 times better.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Easy way to whiten your teeth and so convenient to carry around! I love Twilight Teeth!</li>
    <li> First of all, I am a whitening teeth fanatic. My goal is to have dentist white teeth, without that price tag. There are pros and cons to using this product versus white strips. I have used Twilight teeth both with the led accelerator and without it in the tanning bed. The tanning bed works much better, your teeth will be bright white when you leave the salon, but for those who don&#x27;t use the tanning bed, the led accelerator does still work quite well, it gives you the same result as a level four Crest white strip. This product is also much cheaper than white strips, but, I can&#x27;t stress this enough, you really have to pile on the gel in order to get a really nice whitening effect, and, sadly, this product&#x27;s results don&#x27;t last as long as white strips. For me if I&#x27;m going to tan I&#x27;m going to use this product because nothing works better, but if I ever do decide to stop tanning, I&#x27;ll probably switch to Crest white strips because I get the same amount of whitening, but the results last longer. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked at the negative reviews for this product. I bought it because I went tanning prior to a trip and noticed all the girls at the tanning salon had gleaming white teeth. First of all a reminder, it&#x27;s $14.  You can&#x27;t buy whitestrips for that and the strips make my teeth painful and sensitive.  I noticed considerable results the first usage. I was nervous immediately after because I noticed the whiter spots that other reviewers mentioned, but they fade away in no time. After 5 applications my teeth are white as snow, far whiter than they&#x27;ve ever been. The bottle might be small, but it lasts.  I only do a touch-up now every 2-3 months. My best friend is a dental assistant and she swears my results are as good, if not better than the $600 treatment her dental office performs.  Like I said, $14 - what do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> Received this never got to use it because it was dead even replaced the expensive batteries it didn&#x27;t work it was broken</li>
    <li> This is the only whitening kit that does not give me tooth sensitivity. You can use it while in a tanning bed or with the light. I love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff works so good</li>
    <li> Did not do the job that it said it would. Also made my teeth more sensitive tan they already were. Would not recomend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a tanning salon for myself and then I bought this one for my 17 year old daughter. I&#x27;m a smoker and I drink a lot of coffee, so I haven&#x27;t found a lot of whitening products that work well for me. This works better in the tanning salon but the light works well too. I honestly can&#x27;t believe that they sell it as cheap as they do, because they could get more for it. For the price, and how well it works, this is the best whitening product that I have ever tried and I have tried a lot! A++++++++++++++++++++</li>
    <li> used consistently and as specified but I don&#x27;t think this product really works.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I used this product every day and used the entire tube up. Used for 30 minute sessions...notice no results. returned for refund since I think the product was expired.</li>
    <li> Really easy to apply, taste is just a little minty, and there was a huge difference right away.  My teeth aren&#x27;t too bad (don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee) so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on someone with heavy stains.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all not in the tanning bed nor at home I would not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using this product. The home kit allows you to easily whiten your teeth at your convenience. It does not make your teeth super sensitive and there is a minty taste. Worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> so i heard this product was good i applied it for bout 3 weeks nothing changed in my teeth im not sure is it my teeth or the product but they did not improve i recently bought another teeth whitening product if this doesnt work its just my teeth but if it does its just this product. All in all i can say this product is waht you pay for i was not missing any pieces or anything and recommended if it works for you make sure you lay down when your using this saliva everywhere if you dont.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Works good!</li>
    <li> I was told by a relative that this is a good product and i should buy it. i orderee 2 and the uv light never worked.</li>
    <li> This was the first product for teeth whitening I tried out for a tanning bed use and must I say to look no further! Twilight Teeth does the job and more! Visible whiter teeth after just one use!</li>
    <li> My wife got this just on a whim. I was skeptical and for good reason. It does not work and is a pain to use. The on and of switch is loose and just not worth the money in the end.</li>
    <li> I have tried this in the tanning bed and at home. It didnt whiten even one shade lighter. I would never but this again, in fact I threw it away. My toothpaste does a better job</li>
    <li> This stuff works well if you use it in the tanning bed.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything after using it for a week, but the very first day I used it in the tanning bed my teeth were drastically whiter!!  The down side is that it leaves bright white spots on your teeth immediately after tanning.  They do go away after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;The other reviews are right, you will drool a lot.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good product for the money.  But only use it in a tanning bed if you want results.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is relatively easy to use, and does not make my teeth sensitive like Crest Whitestrips and other over the counter whitening products usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well, however the only drawback is that in order to fully coat each tooth before tanning, each tube only lasts about 5-6 tans; not the 10 or more it advertises... that does not stop me from continuing to purchase and use this product though. It works that well.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product. I got it and the light didn&#x27;t work. Got a second one and it still didn&#x27;t work so I sent it all back.</li>
    <li> I used Twilight Teeth a couple years ago when I worked at a tanning salon but back then it used to only have the mouth piece (no home light) &amp; was exclusively for tanning bed use. I ordered this one recently when I started tanning again &amp; I LOVE IT!!!  After my first use (in tanning bed) my teeth were at least 2 shades whiter! Make sure when putting the mouth piece in that your lips are on the outside with front teeth exposed. When applying to teeth make sure to brush on all teeth exposed then use the brush down the sides of teeth (like in between your 2 front teeth) you only need to apply a thin layer otherwise you will just be wasting it. Considering this product was originally made only for use in a tanning bed, you will have better results in the bed. I have only used the home light a few times because lately I&#x27;ve been tanning at least everyother day. This product is AMAZING everyone has noticed how whiter my smile is since I starting using again! I smoke &amp; drink a lot of coffee so my teeth were looking pretty yellow before, I also have sensitive teeth I can&#x27;t use crest strips bc it feels like they&#x27;ve striped my teeth after use, seriously my teeth would kill for days after. But this does not hurt my teeth one bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people review that there light didn&#x27;t work &amp; if you read the side of the box it says to remove batteries &amp; REMOVE BATTERY SAVER!!  Then put batteries back in &amp; it will work. It sucks that so many people can&#x27;t read the directions &amp; are leaving low reviews saying the light didn&#x27;t work! Come on ppl if your on here I know you can read! This product should have more than 3 stars! Oh yea did I mention this product is AMAZING :)))</li>
    <li> I use this every other week noticeably different in my teeth</li>
    <li> You do get what you pay for... But it does work. I got this for my husband who really wanted his teeth whited, but we could not afored it. So we tried this. And his teeth after a few sessions where noticeably whiter!</li>
    <li> I have used the product twice. I have noticed some change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;I need to use it more to give a better review.</li>
    <li> i have used this for 10 days and i can see maybe a shade of difference. i brush before and go 20 min. i used the light and in the tanning bed.  i will try a different product</li>
    <li> I have used this 4 times already-twice in the tanning bed &amp; twice using the LED light the package came with. WOW!!! my teeth are noticably whiter from just 4 uses. Usually it takes me a whole box of Crest Whitestrips to see the same results. My teeth were a bit sensitive the first use, but it doesnt harm your teeth, the sensitivity is normal as stated on the box. I highly reccomend this product, its awesome for the price. AMAZING! i bought mine on Ebay though. No, you will not get moviestar white teeth, but it whitens enough to notice a difference. Not sure why there are bad reviews on here about it. Make sure to brush your teeth before every whitening session. &amp; i do 20 minutes tanning sessions &amp; when i use the LED light i leave it in for 20 minutes also.  Thanks Twilight Teeth! i&#x27;ll no longer have to waste money on whitestrips</li>
    <li> This really works have been using it forever</li>
    <li> Twilight teeth are great while tanning! The light to use at home doesn&#x27;t work as well but can be used to touch up. I love this product this was my second bottle!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  You can use it while doing housework, however the ingredients activate and work much better under facial lamps in a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Do not recommend. Did not work as promised on the website or in the descriptions. I saw no change whatsoever, and would not buy again.</li>
    <li> i have  been using this for about a week and my teeth are so much whiter. it doesnt leave a bad taste eather.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see fast results with the at home light. Used only twice in the tanning bed and my teeth are very white :)</li>
    <li> It was shipped on time but the light up part did not work.  Tried new batteries and everything and could not get it to work at all very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the tanning bed and decided to pay the extra dollar and get the uv light for home.  Box clearly says &amp;#34;light will stay on until you turn it off.&amp;#34; Mine however did not stay on and I had to hold the button. New batteries did not help.</li>
    <li> um yeah so it makes me drool and theres no noticeable difference. granted it is &amp;#34;safer whitening&amp;#34; than the bleach method but i&#x27;ve started using brightwhite 5 minute system and i love it</li>
    <li> This product does seem to work well as long as you are in a tanning bed. I&#x27;ve used it out of the tanning bed four times and have noticed 0 difference. My only complaint is, I only go tanning twice a week and only for 10 minutes each session. So, unfortunately, I don&#x27;t get as great as benefits as someone whom may go tanning for 20 minutes. Note to company, please make UV light work better for at home purposes.</li>
    <li> so, for the price, you woudnt expect the results. but im one who is very very impatient, meaning i hate waiting for results. With this product, you see instant results in one tanning session. It was packaged excellent, great shipping time, use it every time i tan &amp; am planning on purchasing the refill (: highhhhlyy recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;much love from Flint, MI !!!</li>
    <li> It really whitens your teeth! It works best in the tanning bed but either way it makes a difference and it isn&#x27;t expensive or timely!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was a little skeptical at first, but bought it anyways because you can&#x27;t beat the price, especially when whitening strips are $50+. I use it in the tanning bed and can tell immediately afterwards that my teeth are whiter, and my co workers have even noticed a difference!</li>
