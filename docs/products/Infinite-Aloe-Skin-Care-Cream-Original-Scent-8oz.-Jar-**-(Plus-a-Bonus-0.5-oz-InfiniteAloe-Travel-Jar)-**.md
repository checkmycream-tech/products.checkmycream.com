    <li> A friend gave me a partial 0.5oz jar to try on some very stubborn dry skin on my elbows.  After noticing a significant difference in the appearance of my elbows, I started using some on my face and neck.  It has made a significant difference in my skin&#x27;s feel and appearance in a very short period of time.  I decided to also try the scrub and am sure I&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Helps your skin and gives you a nice glow. Works on normal, oily and dry skin. Not sure about eczema. Family has eczema and they explained to me it make spots feel like a burning sensation and want to apply  more and the cream does not fix issue. Overall its a great product. Helps with stretch marks and youthful look of skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it morning and night ... Under eyes and even on lips! I would recommend it for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I use this as face cream along with hand and it is the best I have found. My face feels so smooth all day.  My daughter uses this for eczema on her hands. Before, prescription medicine was the only thing that would work for her. We did notice that we couldn&#x27;t use it we didn&#x27;t catch it and her hands got real bad. It would burn.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this product. It removed many acne scars and rough skin on my face and helps him with his dry, sensitive skin. We have tried several other similar products and personally saw the most results with this one so after out first supply ran out we were quick to repurchase. We both use a little a day and it last a long time. (Over a year for us). Normally we wouldn&#x27;t spend this amount on a face cream but we are so glad we tried it.</li>
    <li> Wife and I use this.  Brown patches going away. Very good product.  I will purchase this product every 6 months or as needed.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this by a friend and I really am very happy with it.  I also recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin lotion that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Works great ! My hands crack a lot because I wear canvas gloves at work so they dry out often,it also works on peeling areas from to much sun. Good product highly recommend...</li>
    <li> Recently, while at a firearms school, my friend and I got windburned and sunburned, even though we slathered on sunscreen each morning.  My friend had this cream with her and offered it to me to try.  Really soothed the wind and sunburn and each morning, my skin looked and felt &amp;#34;back to normal&amp;#34;.  I was a believer...bought myself a big jar and now use it every nite.</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as it states. My skin feels great once applied but after a few hours my skin is dry again. For the price you would think it would help retain moisture. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer, leaves face feeling soft  and supple. It lasts all day and can be used again at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky or greasy.</li>
    <li> Got a trial size from a friend due to a skin rash.  Liked it well enojgh to order a full jar.but It hasn&#x27;t performed as well as expected but it minimized skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I have never had a face cream that I love as much as this one.  It is light weight and does not clog my pores.  I am older now and need to take better care of my skin, this moisturizer does the trick.</li>
    <li> During radiation, my skin began to show signs of burning.&lt;br /&gt;I did not know it was suppose to do this.  So - I bought&lt;br /&gt;this cream; which worked the same as what I had been&lt;br /&gt;using - except this cream was twice the price....It is&lt;br /&gt;not easy to find products with a lot of aloe in them.</li>
    <li> I have had acne and acne scars for about 2 years. I received a sample of this lotion in the mail and I began to try it for a week until it was done and oh my goodness my skin  began to clear up rapidly! So i decided to buy the jar and so far I&#x27;ve used it for a month and it has definitely shown results! my scars are going away and i basically dont have any pimples left:) My skin is unbalanced(oily/dry) but it works great for anyone! Even though this product is a bit pricey, i highly suggest buying this product! You get results!</li>
    <li> Got a bad rashes on the face last week, used it for three days three times a day and it cleared up pretty well. No more red bumps and itches. I&#x27;m a happiest customer. The Best thing I have ever used for my skin!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this cream.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and had used this product successfully on it before. The product I ordered seemed thinner then the original product I&#x27;d purchased.. more liquidy, and agitated my psoriasis. If you have psoriasis, I would use with caution. If you want to just moisturize your skin and want to spend the money, it&#x27;s not half bad.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works very good on my face!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> thIS IS THE BEST SKIN CARE CREAM i HAVE EVER FOUD.  I HAVE ALWAYS USED OIL OF OLAY - LAST YEAR MY BOSS GAVE ME A TRIAL SIZE OF THIS CREAM AND I HAVE BEEN HOOKED EVER SINCE.  NOT GREASY FEELING AND IT LASTS ALL DAY.</li>
    <li> my daughter needs lotion for her dry skin....this aloe is perfect...started buying it years ago in vegas...ran out recently and found it on amazon...she is happy cause it is easier to purchase</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been dealing with dry skin most of my life.  I tried many products out on the market and found this product to help my skin.  I really love this product and would recommend it to anyone with dry skin!</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. I went to a fair in Tahoe and as I was leaving and limping from my right foot. This guy says \\&quot;try some aloe vera\\&quot;. I said No thanks and kept limping by. Then he said \\&quot;It will take that foot pain away\\&quot;. I turned around and told him if he could take the pain away I would buy what ever he was selling. I have been suffering with my right foot for a year and the pain was getting intolerable. I&#x27;ve been to the doc and took a series of 3 shots. I went to the Good Feet Store and walked out of there shocked at the $700.00 they wanted for 3 pieces of plastic. As soon as I rubbed this on there was a difference and now 1 week later my foot is almost 100% back to normal!!!! I don&#x27;t know what the magic stuff in this cream is but it is totally worth the price. Thanks fair guy for yelling my way. God bless!</li>
