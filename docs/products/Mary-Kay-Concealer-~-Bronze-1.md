<li> Ever since Mary Kay switched from the signature its been hard to match up the right color.</li>

<li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so the tube will last a long time.</li>
<li> I am unable to use product because the color is too light.</li>
<li> As for how long it lasts, I&#x27;ll have to see about that.  </li>
<li> Carefully choose your color.</li>
<li> Color was a bit lighter than I expected.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> It is one of the few brands that matches so well with my skin tone.</li>
<li> Not too bad, it does not conceal the spots completely.</li>
<li> this was two shades lighter then my actual shade was disappointed and it gives you a pale look so wouldnt recommend this concealer to anyone</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
<li> I am obsessed with this concealer.</li>
<li> I bought the wrong color....</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> What else can you say if it&#x27;s Mary Kay, it&#x27;s excellent. Mary Kay concealers are great.  This is a more natural looking concealer.</li>
    <li> Item would have worked well but was a shade too light</li>
    <li> The color was lighter that I anticipated.  Other than that I thought the product was very good.</li>
    <li> Not too bad, it does not conceal the spots completely. I like it anyway</li>
    <li> Great, product arrived just in time</li>
    <li> Perfect color for me nice neutral under tones not too much red or yellow the right balance not oily  nice</li>
    <li> This item  works perfect for me.  I use it over my make right under my eyes. When I don&#x27;t duse make up, I just use this item under my eye.  It works perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I wish this concealer was the correct color! Ever since Mary Kay switched from the signature its been hard to match up the right color. The new series of concealer also seems a bit watered down. As far as the seller, thanks for the fast Shipping. I just wish it could have worked out better.</li>
    <li> It didnt do the job. I had to buy another beans from another retailer. Very disappointed. Needed a darker color.</li>
    <li> I actually wasn&#x27;t the color that I was looking for. I have the bronze foundation and I was looking for the matching concealer but this color actually doesn&#x27;t match the foundation. Purchasing the bronze 2 might have matched better.</li>
    <li> Carefully choose your color. Color was a bit lighter than I expected. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so the tube will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Good concealer- covers very well&lt;br /&gt;I only gave three stars because I can&#x27;t use it...I bought the wrong color....I needed bronze 2</li>
    <li> I like that you can litterally squeeze a drop out and its good for both undereyes! super natural and lightwieght. good job MK!</li>
    <li> Love this foundation. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. It blends beautifully into skin and leaves a matte finish. I&#x27;ve stuck with this for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over five years..nothing compares..I&#x27;ve had mac but i love this more because it last long</li>

    <li> Great product, matched exactly, easy to use, easy transaction</li>
    <li> Great product have been using it for years to hide undereye darkness. Better than all the other products I have ever tried,stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I rated this item a 4 star after an initial customer rating of only 1 star. I changed the star rating because after the seller contacted me, I was able to get a refund after sending the product back. I was very&lt;br /&gt;satisified with the outcome of this transaction. I appreciated the seller reaching out to me.</li>
    <li> I really like this concealer. It&#x27;s the perfect color and exactly what I was looking for.  Mary Kay always has quality products so I never expected less than the best.</li>
    <li> this was two shades lighter then my actual shade was disappointed and it gives you a pale look so wouldnt recommend this concealer to anyone</li>
    <li> I ENJOY USING THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This is all my wife uses.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this concealer. It matches my completion perfectly in both winter and summer. Also, I don&#x27;t need to apply any foundation with, it acts as one itself. It leaves a very light application, no oily residue. Would recommend to anyone. Great for a caramel/bronze skin tone.</li>
    <li> This concealer is good for me to keep as a back up with the concealer I use as my primary concealer.  This goes on well and smooth and the coverage is good.  As for how long it lasts, I&#x27;ll have to see about that.  I love the price, which is always a bonus.  Happy with this purchase and the seller had this to me very quickly!</li>
    <li> I am unable to use product because the color is too light.</li>
    <li> love this and a little drop is plenty ! I mix it with a darker shade of my makeup to custom blend for my complexion</li>
    <li> The Mary Kay Concealer ~ Bronze 1, is the only concealer I use and have been using it for many years, I love Mary Kay products.</li>
    <li> Im definitely a bronze 2. But I still give this 5 stars because when you get your exact color, you can wear this concealer alone without foundation or powder. Mary Kay is the best.</li>
    <li> goes very well on me and even cover the tiniest acne on my face. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again et recommended to my friends</li>
    <li> Excellent for doing highlights and concealing a area on your face I have used this product for 2 years and have been very happy since</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay Products. It is one of the few brands that matches so well with my skin tone.</li>
    <li> It not only do a great job to hide the flaws on the face, but it makes it look natural and new. I have used it approx. 15 yrs now</li>
    <li> This concealer is my favorite for highlighting underneath my eyes because i have dark skin. It&#x27;s good but it tends to look a little ashy at times so it&#x27;s not perfect. But its the closest to the perfect highlight i&#x27;ve gotten. And it gives full coverage and a mat finnish!</li>
    <li> The product would have been perfect except it was a little too light for my skin type. So I ordered Bronze 2, don&#x27;t dismay, I&#x27;m using Bronze 1 as backup. Great plan!!. I&#x27;m sure I will use your products again. Thanks</li>
