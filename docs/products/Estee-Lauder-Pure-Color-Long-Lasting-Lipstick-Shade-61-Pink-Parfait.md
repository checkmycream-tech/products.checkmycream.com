    <li> I love this shade of Estee lipstick.  This was a much more affordable option than purchasing through the Estee counter.  I bought two!  The lipstick was in a sealed plastic bag and brand new.</li>
    <li> The product is good. I was unhappy with the condition I received it in. The top cover had been quashed and the lipstick tip broken. This did upset me.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for, and when you buy it online, the color isn&#x27;t going to be the same as if you were seeing it with your naked eye. So, it&#x27;s ok. :)</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this as I love the feel of Estee Lauder lipstick.  The color is much lighter than I thought it would be, and doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as my other Estee Lauder lipsticks.  The texture is creamy.  I will use it as a general moisturizer around the house, but would not get this color again.</li>
    <li> It was not the same color as the last time I ordered it Said same name,as first one. Gave it away.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color for the summer months.  This is my second purchase and if available next summer I will purchase again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years and love the color.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I like this color. It&#x27;s a very natural pink with a lot of shimmer in it. Great for an everyday look. I didn&#x27;t find it more lasting than regular lipsticks tho.</li>
    <li> Its a sample,that you can have for free on macys.com if you buy more than $35 in Estee Lauder&#x27;s products.I did not like it,and I do not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I love it ! I have bought twice and I&#x27;am thinking to buy another for a gift .&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful color !&lt;br /&gt;The seller did really good , the packages arrived fast , good quality of product !&lt;br /&gt;👍</li>
    <li> Color did not last long at all!! It was like wearing tinted chapstick. Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> I love the color on me but it doesn&#x27;t stay on, but a nice smooth feel on my lips.</li>
    <li> im very pleased,a pretty color ,a great price ,a quality name brand and it was shipped in a very timely mannor,thanks</li>

    <li> This lipstick was a shade lighter which I loved cause it was more of a light pink than it shows in the picture.  Feels good and looks great. So if you are a pink lady like myself you will love this color.. Great price.... Looks Great....</li>
    <li> love this lipstick from EL, great price, too!</li>
    <li> I expected a safety seal on the lipstick case.  I threw it away.  I am not trusting lipstick without a safety seal.</li>
    <li> Great color, price, and coverage. I used this to replace an Estee Lauder color that I could no longer find. It&#x27;s much less expensive and just as good.</li>
    <li> wonderful texture, smooth.  pretty color</li>
