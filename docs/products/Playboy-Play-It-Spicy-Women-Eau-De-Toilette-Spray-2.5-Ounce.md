      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Smells great and the smell lasts a decent amount of time when you are wearing it.</li>
      <li>Love yhis light and airy scent</li>

      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>

      <li>For the price this perfume is certainly worth</li>
      <li>ONLY thing is if could only be longer lasting by 3 more hours it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>and this is my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the 8</li>
      <li>The overall smell is clean, and absolutely lovely.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fade right away</li>

      <li>This has a slightly sweet, slightly citrus scent that is definitely sexy with a bit of warmth.</li>
      <li>It is not over powering but is strong enough to be noticeable.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>-it does have a spicy smell and lasts very long-almost like an oil.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It smells very spicy and feminine.  </li>
      <li>It does smell nice, but does not last very long, so carry the bottle with you to use several times a day.</li>
      <li>The package came early, always a plus.</li>
      <li>well worth the money we spent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it&#x27;s certainly worth the price</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheeper than my Victoria secret perfumes and smells just or better than them</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the cheap price trick you into thinking it&#x27;s not a good perfume.</li>

    <li> This perfume smells fantastic! It is not flowery - more of a spicy smell. It is not over powering but is strong enough to be noticeable. I just love it!</li>
    <li> I GET THIS AT WAL MART ... IT&#x27;S LIKE THE ONLY PLACE THAT HAS IT. LATELY, THEY DON&#x27;T REALLY SELL IT ANYMORE ... SO HAPPY I JUST FOUND IT ON HERE. GOING TO BE ORDERING IT ONLINE MORE OFTEN; ESPECIALLY SINCE WAL MART DOESN&#x27;T HAVE IT ANYMORE.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy perfume often but I bought this for a birthday present for someone. I tried it on in the store and liked it and I could still smell it at the end of the day so I ended up buying another bottle for myself! I really like it-it does have a spicy smell and lasts very long-almost like an oil. (I&#x27;m a little embarrassed it&#x27;s by Playboy but no one needs to know that...!)</li>
    <li> The product was great. All the bottles were out of the boxes by the time it got here but they didn&#x27;t break :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! The price is great and it smells amazing. I put a little on my wrist to see how it smelled and I washed my dishes about 30 min latter, when I was done the smell was still there! It has a sexy sweet flower smell. It does not smell like most cheap perfumes. I will deff buy this again and I cant wait to try other Playboy perfumes.</li>
    <li> I love this smell!  It smells very spicy and feminine.  The overall smell is clean, and absolutely lovely.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Got it just as expected. I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Gift for mom (i know..who would buy this for their mother) but it was great she loved it and so did i since i used it for myself once  or twice may 3 times but yh. ONLY thing is if could only be longer lasting by 3 more hours it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the smell lasts a decent amount of time when you are wearing it. Doesn&#x27;t fade right away</li>
    <li> My all time favorite perfume. Arrived quickly. Awesome smell awesome price. Very happy.</li>
    <li> My wife received a bottle of this perfume from a coworker recently. The stuff is intoxicating and has a fragrance that is floral in nature, with a hint of exotic spices. It is very sexy and wonderfully delicious. So I purchased another bottle. This perfume will make a great gift for that someone special in your life. I am not much of a perfume fan but when she wears this fragrance it makes me crazy and all I want to do is wrap myself around her. An amorous potion that casts it spell of attraction and romance.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
    <li> Playboy&#x27;s Play it Spicy is my go to perfume. The staying power isn&#x27;t great but for a little while it&#x27;s an extremely sexy scent. For the price this perfume is certainly worth it- I&#x27;ve tried more expensive perfumes as well and this is my favorite so far. Would have never guessed that it&#x27;s made by playboy.</li>
    <li> This play it spicy cologne is exactly what I was looking for. Definitely worth the 8 $ spent. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It does smell nice, but does not last very long, so carry the bottle with you to use several times a day.</li>
    <li> I could not believe my mom bought this for me for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I love this fragrance.  My friends and I fell it love with it.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this perfume on Amazon. It smells absolutely wonderful and the scent lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap price trick you into thinking it&#x27;s not a good perfume. I absolutely love it. Lasts a good 6 hours...</li>
    <li> In love with this scent. I want to say it smells a little like vanilla if you know how that smells it gives you an idea in what &amp;#34;scent range&amp;#34; it is. Incredibly awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tough to please when it comes to perfumes. I like designer parfums that last, like Gaultier Classiqe, Elie Saab, Marc Jacobs Classic and Bvlgari Rose Essentielle. BUT, if I come across a cheap fragrance that smells good, I&#x27;m buying it! This has a slightly sweet, slightly citrus scent that is definitely sexy with a bit of warmth. It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but it&#x27;s certainly worth the price (it DOES last longer than many of my celebrity fragrances like Lady Gaga and Rihanna). The bottle is cheap and is nothing special, but the actual perfume is very nice. I purchased the perfume because I trusted a brand like Playboy to make me smell good. They know what they&#x27;re doing when it comes to making women feel sexy.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love the smell!  I normally buy her Sexy by Playboy but she actually likes this scent better; but both smell great!</li>
    <li> Why is Play It Spicy going to be discontinued? it&#x27;s the best one!</li>
    <li> my wife loves it but I don&#x27;t because it doesn&#x27;t linger. Great value</li>
    <li> My wife really enjoyed this perfume. So did i later on. well worth the money we spent. i will fef. be buying some more</li>
    <li> Excellent..couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere..great price also</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff. Money wasting achieved. Level 2&lt;br /&gt;(:</li>
    <li> Love it it&#x27;s cheeper than my Victoria secret perfumes and smells just or better than them I love it and it arrived faster than I thought . Thank you</li>
    <li> Best service ever. The package came early, always a plus. It was such a great deal for it too! I was surprised to find free samples in the box, nice bonus &#x3D;) I&#x27;m not getting my perfume from anyone else now!</li>
