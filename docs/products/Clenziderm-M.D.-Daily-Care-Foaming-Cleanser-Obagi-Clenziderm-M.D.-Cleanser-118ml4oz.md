    <li> I have been buying this for a couple of years for a granddaughter. She really likes it; it works well.</li>
    <li> Works great!!!!! Cheaper ordering thru amazon . Dermatologist charge 10 to 14 dollars more must use daily to prevent break outs</li>
    <li> Clenziderm foaming cleanser works great.</li>
    <li> it cleanses fine, but the bottle is much smaller than I realized. So, I&#x27;m disappointed and probably won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> Works well, I am older and have oily skin that has blemishes. This seems to be better than most, I&#x27;ve tried everything out there. At 53 I hate getting blemishes....</li>
    <li> I use this for my pores and it worked wonders. The toner itself is enough. So next time I might not get this one.</li>
    <li> I like Obagi products, and this was a great price for this item.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle now and I love this wash.  It&#x27;s $20 more at the 5 star Spa near my home.  You only need to use a drop so the bottle goes pretty far.</li>
    <li> adult acne skin, this works the best out of any product I have tried. Its a little pricey but worth it. the toner and benzoyl peroxide cream work just as good too and I also get the moisturizer. its non greasy and helps prevent irritation.</li>
    <li> My doctor&#x27;s office put me onto this product. I have been having hormone replacement therapy for 18 months now and even though it is wonderful, a side effect is sometimes acne because of increased oil production in your skin. This product is excellent for this. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. Now my 24 year old son is stealing it from my bath for his breakouts. I&#x27;ve had to start buying extra bottles to accommodate him!!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a must to try obagi products...no words can describe how great it is...just try it to believe it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and suffered from acne until I started using this product.  I use it in the am and pm.  I allow it to dry for 10 minutes then I use Skinceuticals Conditioning Solution.  The two work very well together and I no longer have blemishes.  It took about 3 weeks to see a difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year and don&#x27;t plan on stopping, my skin looks great!.  I also use Tretinoin .05 at night, this is a prescription and cannot be purchased over the counter.</li>
    <li> I have battled with cystic acne my whole life. I think it gets even more embarrassing when you are in your mid 30&#x27;s and you have break outs everywhere. I use step 1 and 2 of the clenziderm system and it clears my acne better than anything else. It gives your skin that healthy glow even after the first use. I use the step 3 lotion every once in a while but I don&#x27;t find that part of the system a necessity for great skin. I find it really stings bad and causes a little redness so I use it once a week almost as a boost to unclog pores. I will use step 1&amp;2 and use a good moisturizer with SPF and continue with beautiful skin. I won&#x27;t purchase anything else now. These are wonderful products!</li>
    <li> Works great for oily or combination skin. I use it 2x day in combination with Obagi-C day/night lotion. As a result my skin never looked better as it does now.</li>
    <li> I tried this product based on the reviews and my desperation to clear up my recent breakout. This product completely cleared up my acne (which was really bad) within 2 1/2 weeks of use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best cleanser for acne.</li>
    <li> Love it, really helps and my face is so clear.</li>
