<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was given this product for a review. It is easy to apply, a just-right thickness consistency texture, before I used another brand mud mask which was too liquid that I don&#x27;t really like; this Dead Sea mud mask cleans skin very well I can see my nose is much clean after the mask, lots black heads out while skin not that dry.</li>
    <li> This is HUGE container of Mud Mask. I could probably get 40-50 masks out of it, just guessing. The product smells good. I washed my face with face wash and pat dried. I put on a decent layer on my skin and waited 15 minutes. The mask was completely dry and my face was stiff as a board. (kind of like when I botox my forehead and i can&#x27;t move it a week later). I got into the shower and washed the mask off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face was baby soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My pores feel clean and detoxed.&lt;br /&gt;And my face seems slightly lighter than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended with some moisturizer and under eye cream. I didn&#x27;t know they recommend a serum before moisturizer on this product. The only minus is really the information on the bottle. It doesn&#x27;t say much. Unless everyone is supposed to know what a mud mask does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if I was looking for a good mud mask, I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I was offered a promotional discount to test and give my honest opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets start off by saying I have used products like this in the past. But most of them you have to mix with vinegar or water. this one is already mixed and ready to go. you put this on your face i usually put one nice even layer and let it dry. The drying usually takes about 15-20 minutes to completely dry out. After it is dry i take a wet warm wash cloth and scrub off the mask. When this stuff is drying out you can feel your face getting tighter and tighter (this is normal and a great feeling) Even after one use you can already notice a little difference. Your face might end up red for about 20-30minutes so I tend to put them on close to when i am going to bed. This stuff is great! it goes on rather easy and dries up nice. A little does go a long way. you can apply more but the time to dry will take alot longer. Your face will feel extremely smooth after you remove the mask. if you have never done a mask before I would highly recommend this product. Even if you have used a mask before this product is for you. its simple and it works. i cant wait till the next mask ( once a week). Oh and this helps with acne as well. It cleared up a little pimple I had overnight. This stuff is amazing! I wish I bought this sooner! I will be buying more! Don&#x27;t spent tons of money getting a facial when you can do it at home for cheap!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great . Took the redness out of my skin and it feels so soft and glows after I use it . Feels very moisturized. Love it !</li>
    <li> The first time I used the deep sea mask it I made my face feel I a little itchy as It was drying so I was hesitant on using it again but I have tried it again and I have been noticing slight improvement on my face</li>
    <li> This mask left my face feeling Amazing! I absolutely LOVE the fact that it&#x27;s completely natural and organic as I have to be very careful what products I use on my face. No harsh chemicals or additives, 100% natural is the way to go. My pores are smaller and the skin is incredibly soft. I have combination skin so I have to watch for anything that will irritate and dry my face out as well as products that will leave me feeling oily and this one does neither. I am extremely happy with this product. There is an overall glow to my skin after using it and I really feel like it&#x27;s bringing out the best in my skin. I hope you found this information helpful for you. I received my jar free for testing and reviewing purposes but my review is solely based on the actual experience I had using it.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time and it feels so refreshing on my skin! I&#x27;ll update this review after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> The Azure Naturals Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask container is HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the quantity and size, this product will last many months, especially since it is suggested to apply it only once a week.&lt;br /&gt;When I peeled the seal, I noticed a thick odorless gray substance. It is light gray and according to the container, it is cruelty free, all natural, and paraben free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied a generous amount of the dead sea mud, after using a cotton pad to clean my face with Neutrogena&#x27;s Alcohol Free Toner.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I proceeded to wait around 15 minutes for the mask to dry. When the mud mask dries, your face feels tighter and it actually feels kind of uncomfortable(especially if you apply a lot). As well as that it takes longer for the mud mask to dry if you apply a lot of sea mud on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinsed my face with warm water, my face was kind of red. Supposedly, it&#x27;s because it increases circulation, since &amp;#34;facials stimulate blood flow and body masks or wraps do the same thing&amp;#34;. It made my skin feel clean and smooth. It did shrink down my pores to the point in which it&#x27;s less noticeable and alarming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount/or free in return for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> After using this mask a few times, I have some points of note:  It has no fragrance, which is honestly preferable to an over-perfumed mask I have that tries to choke me to death when I use it.  It has a slightly odd, jelly-like texture when scooping it out, likely from the mix of shea butter and clay.  Getting it to spread in a thin, even layer takes a few minutes due to the slippery texture, but it&#x27;s not impossible, and applying in a circular motion as the directions say helps.  It takes longer to dry than the directions say, closer to 20-25 minutes in a dry climate.  Rinsing it off is a breeze compared to other clay masks I&#x27;ve tried. Normally I can only wash them off in the shower, but this one can be taken off at the sink.  I&#x27;ve used this mask about four times, and there isn&#x27;t a huge improvement in my skin texture. It might be a little clearer, but my skin is already mostly blemish-free. I&#x27;m 26, with very oily skin. It did seem to suck all the oil out of my face, so using a moisturizer after is a good idea, especially for dry skin. My skin tends to be mostly indifferent to any and all manner of products I try on it, so take my experience with a grain of salt.  The overall experience of using this mask is better than average, compared to other masks I&#x27;ve used. It does lose points for the high (in my opinion) price point. I would give a rating of 3.5 stars, but since Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow halves, I rounded it up to 4 stars since these types of products are very subjective.  Product sample provided at no cost for evaluation and reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> Azure Naturals did a good job with this Dead Sea Mud Mask. It has great texture, I usually don&#x27;t use masks of this kind because they burn my face this one didn&#x27;t not. It was a little hard to get off my face afterwards. Still one of the better masks I have used. There are lots of natural ingredients which is a plus. You don&#x27;t need a lot so it will last a good while. My pores reduced instantly. Overall this is a great mask, even the smell is pleasant. Good job Azure you have a winner!</li>
    <li> This product was Ok it was a Little Too rough on my face and I was not fond of the smell to be honest . It did exfoliate good and left a clean smooth finish but wasn&#x27;t for me .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is based on unbiased opinion I paid for these products and cannot receive them for free</li>
    <li> Great masks. My face feels so soft and fresh after using it.  It did bring out a few pimples, but no more than other masks.  I was given a coupon to use this and loved it.  Great feeling skin.</li>
    <li> Loved the product and it gives good visible results. I was able to see the difference withing 2 weeks of use. I would recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and my skin feels really clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product for free for a honor review. When I applied this to my face it burned my forehead at first. I did let it dry and stay on for ten minutes. It did leave my face feeling smooth and soft, but the burning is what I&#x27;m concern with. It did not leave any burn marks or anything, but at application to the forehead it did burn. The ingredients are pure dead sea mud, organic shea butter, organic jojoba oil, organic aloe vera juice, organic calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.The direction are to use once a week. I will try again next week, because the results were positive.</li>
    <li> Love love love . Was sent this to give my honest opinion and I love it! I cleanse then use this and after its rinsed off I use my azure naturals skin repair and anti age serums!</li>
    <li> Best mask I have ever tried! Wow! Love it! I started with a clean face then I put on the mask for 15 minutes. I felt it dry and tighten my face. I then rinsed it off and wow it make my face hydrated and shine. I glow from this product. My husband said I look really good since using this product. I wished I had this mask years ago. It didn&#x27;t dry out my face. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this facial mask since June and this is October and it has really hydrated my face even more. I now use it 2 to 3 times a week and it don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all. The trick is to rinse with really cold water. It is incredible stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars for sure and I recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt; I received this product for free or for a discount in exchanged for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I got this product cheap to review, Great size will last while. My only issue is that i with the mask was a little softer. I am not sure if its just the one i got but its solid in the jar. but its a good product.</li>
    <li> I like how it makes my skin feel and look, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used mud masks for years so I am very familiar with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put this mask on I wasn&#x27;t looking in the mirror, I just scooped some out and put it on my face. When I went to look in the mirror I was very disappointed because most of the mask was a thin veil of mud and I thought no way will this stuff be effective. I let it dry on my face and I was surprised to feel how well it dried on my face even though it was a very thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could feel my face tighten nicely, but it didn&#x27;t make my face itchy like some other mud masks have done. I did notice my pores were temporarily smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is by no means the tightest mud mask I have tried, it is a good mask. One of the tightest masks I&#x27;ve used is the one that comes in powder form that you mix with water or ACV. I can totally see myself using this mask more often than the other simply for convenience, plus this mask tightened enough to my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason it is not easy to find masks in my local drug store, so I will probably buy this product when this jar runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azure Naturals provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! I receive it free and I used it the night when I was having a bubble bath. OMG! This product is awesome, at first it was a little itchy but it was ok, I did left it on my face for 15 mins and I rinse it with warm water. Wow! I felt that my pores were tightened closely. It feels relaxing just like you have a facial cleaned on a saloon. I would love to recommend this to my family and friends! I really loved it! Feels fresh on my face!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received this mask because it was a pretty big sized tub. It went on smoothly and dried to a nice gray color. After rinsing my skin was so soft and felt so clean. I have been using it once a week and have been noticing a difference with my skin and pore size. My skin feels and looks even and clear. I also haven&#x27;t been breaking out as much as I used to. I will definitely be buying more soon!</li>
    <li> it help me to smooth my face, i love it,</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a very cheap price in order to leave a review so here it is. This stuff was surprisingly awesome. Left my skin feeling so smooth. It was so good that my husband even tried it and loved it haha! Thank you for the great product!</li>
    <li> This product is nothing but the truth. I was alittle skeptical at first. But after one use. My skin was soft and glowing.</li>
    <li> This helped out on my oily face. I didn&#x27;t like the smell but the way it made my face just smooth not oily. It did take the shine out of my face. I would say that some of my pimples are going away. I have been using this for three weeks now two times a week  because my skin is so oily and it works for me. I did get this to review. I did get it for free.</li>
    <li> Decent! Looks kind of gross but that&#x27;s the beauty of face masks. Packed with lots of good-for-your-skin things.</li>
    <li> I have never really used any mud masks before, because I guess it seemed that mud was the opposite of what you would want for cleaning your skin. I was SO wrong. This stuff has made my skin the softest, clearest, and brightest it&#x27;s ever been. Along with the cucumber peptide moisturizer from the same company, my skin feels like it did when I was a child. I have always had a major blackhead problem, along with general dryness and occasional pimples and such. I haven&#x27;t had one single pimple since I started using this product twice a week, and amazingly the blackheads on my nose are almost nonexistant. I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin, as well. Never had any problems, other than itchiness when the mud is drying (but that&#x27;s perfectly normal). Great product!</li>
    <li> I received this Facial Mask a week ago and have used it twice since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I can&#x27;t say enough about how much oil it sucks out of your face. You feel it leaving almost immediately. The actual mud paste is not as thick as you would think, they mixed it with other ingredients. It&#x27;s got a rich and dark look to it and the texture of lotion. After application, you start feeling the skin tighten at 7-10 minutes for me and that is when that feeling of oil getting sucked out happens. I think 15 minutes was a little bit too much, I started getting itchy and irritated. Some have mentioned that theirs lasted for a while but after washing off, mine disappeared a few minutes after. After waking up in the morning, I don&#x27;t even need to use face wash or anything - this was great for my face! I only have done it once a week. I&#x27;ll update this as I try and finish the bottle!</li>
    <li> I love this product, my face feels smooth and fresh</li>
    <li> The Dead Sea mud facial mask left my face feeling very smooth and moisturized and rejuvenated. I have tried many Dead Sea facial mask before, and none of them compare to this one! I liked it so much I even got my husband to let me use it on him as well. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review. I rated this product 5 stars because I was a hundred percent satisfied with the overall product. I have been getting compliments on my skin for weeks now and have been recommending this product to all my friends and family. I was very pleased to see that my face did not break out after using this product because I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of facial products. So for people who have sensitive skin this is a great product for you! I definitely will be a return buyer and highly recommend others to try the ultimate Dead Sea mud facial mask by Azure naturals!</li>
    <li> Dead Sea mud has many benefits.  Smooth feel on face.</li>
    <li> Feels great! My pores were smaller and my face seemed less greasy at the end of the day. Will definitely keep using!</li>
    <li> I received this Facial mask for free to review! I am so grateful I did. I love it! Easy to use of course. I felt like my skin was brand new after the fist initial use. I have used it several times since. The outcome of it just keeps getting better. Ive notice my skin has become more soft and supple. It has made my skin tighter but not to tight! This product is amazing! I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This mask works very well. It has a calming smell and will make your skin feel very soft after using. I used this mask once a week after washing my face and it adds back the moisture that I lost from my facial cleanser. This huge tub will last you a while as you only need a little to cover your face with a thin layer. It drys within 15 minutes of applying if the layer is not extremely thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. MY OPINIONS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE BASED ON MY OWN HONEST AND UNBIASED EXPERIENCE USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Loved This Product!!!  Made my skin feel soft and vibrant!  If you like mud masks you will love this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never done the mud masks at the spa because I&#x27;m rather self-conscious... I know that people won&#x27;t bat an eyelash at a girl with her face covered in mud there, but that doesn&#x27;t really comfort me. So a mud facial mask at home is the perfect solution -- it also helps that I got this for free. I love all the products I&#x27;ve tried from Azure Naturals and this one is no exception! I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s better or worse than other DYI-at-home mud masks, but it does work and I love it!</li>
    <li> Skin feels amazing after used this product!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! This mask is amazing! My face has never felt this amazing! I got this free to test and review and let me just say I am NOT disappointed! This will be a regularly purchased item from now on!</li>
    <li> Was so easy to apply and really could feel it working!!  I have a problem with large pores and i felt that it really cleaned deep down. Rinsed off easily and left my skin feeling smooth, soft and clean!</li>
    <li> First I must disclose that I have been provided this product to test with the understanding that I will write a product review that is accurate and completely honest.&lt;br /&gt;I have “tried” a number of different masks over the span of 30 years and it has been a couple years since the last time I applied one. No mask I’ve tried has ever been as smooth and creamy as this one. It’s texture reminds me of one of my favorite things - Kozy Shack Chocolate Pudding! This is not one of those masks that you cake on your face, applying a thin layer is all you need. When I rinse off the mask each time I am amazed at how great my skin feels to the touch, like none before. I am very likely to stick with this stuff and finally start a regular regimen this time. After trying a few of the Azure Naturals products I am a believer - I am getting premium products at very affordable prices. This 16oz supply should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I loved this. It make my face feel cool and I loved how after it dried it and I showered it made my skin feel and look amazing I would definitely  recommend  this  to  everyone looking for a good mud mask.</li>
    <li> I love the way this has helped improve my skin.  My father has psoriasis and he also is using it to improve his skin and it&#x27;s working wonderfully.  The organic ingredients are terrific, shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera juice, calendula oil and hickory bark extract are all very beneficial for the skin.  My skin is so soft and my complexion has improved a great deal.  I use the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask once a week as part of my facial.  I was offered a free product for my unbiased opinion.  It&#x27;s a large supply that will last me quite awhile, thankfully.</li>
    <li> Amazing mask, feels great. Moisturizes skin.</li>
    <li> I have been trying many dead sea masks lately and this is one of the better ones.You can put it on face,neck just about anywhere you can think of.It claims to  minimizing pores, reducing redness. I have used this a few time and my pores do look smaller and my skin tone seems to be clearing up.So I can say it does seem to do that.It goes on nice and smooth and it&#x27;s not clumpy.With a money back guarantee,again like I said you can&#x27;t go wrong. It is worth the try .I DID RECIEVE THIS AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
