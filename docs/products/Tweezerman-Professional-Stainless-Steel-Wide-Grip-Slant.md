      <li>perfect tweezer with easy to hold grip</li>
      <li>very good at gripping.  </li>
      <li>These do an excellent job and fast too!!</li>
      <li>They are generally a great tool, well crafted, outstanding grab.</li>
      <li>great tips and easy to hold, but</li>
      <li>I bought a pair for my daughter after my own pair arrived</li>
      <li>By far the best pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>I love the design.  </li>
      <li>The original tweezerman is much better!</li>
      <li>Maybe I need the Oscar Madison model instead of this Felix Ungar version :-)</li>
      <li>need I be more elaborate about the workload?</li>
      <li>Tweezeman is still the best quality but the flat edge protects my skin.</li>
      <li>nice design for comfortable gripping, but that doesn&#x27;t really help when the tips aren&#x27;t good at all at grabbing and removing hair.</li>
      <li>They are the best tweezers I have found yet for tweezing out eyebrow hairs in one single tug.  </li>
      <li>I remembered having had this tweezer a while back and thinking it was incredible for some reason...</li>
      <li>It seems like a good deal but the aren&#x27;t very snappy about about service...</li>
      <li>I hope the quality improves before I need more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for making the exchange so easy for me.</li>
      <li>accurate.  </li>
      <li>This stainless steel one looks nice and doesn&#x27;t have paint on it that will eventually chip off.</li>
      <li>I will never buy a cheap pair again.</li>
      <li>I use tweezers constantly throughout the day so with the beginning of arthritis, these tweezers are exceptional and comfortable to hold!</li>
      <li>brilliant shape, sharp n</li>
      <li>the ergonomic grip is still good and comfortable but doesn&#x27;t get hair as well as the regular fine point tweeerman</li>
      <li>No disappointment here!</li>
      <li>The coated pair that was shipped in error in my first order worked better for me</li>
      <li>Good quality, heavy, nice balance</li>
      <li>The round parts of the grip are wonderful for my older, weaker, somewhat arthritic hand and the tips are so precisely ground that I can pull out the shortest, thinnest hair easily.</li>
      <li>The thumb hole makes it much steadier to use making it very precise</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
      <li>Still not quite as good as a previous one - but they are better than anything that I have purchased at a department store.</li>
      <li>The wide grip allows for excellent presission and control, and the hi-quality steel makes for quick and easy personal grooming.</li>
      <li>This is not as good as the old one, the old one is actually much nicer, more precise.</li>
      <li>The wide grip feels good in the hand and is a nice alternative to the traditional tweezer</li>
      <li>This is ok, but I bought it to have a backup one like my old one.</li>
      <li>Far too many hairs slide through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually behind the best product I can afford ..</li>
      <li>Tweezerman breaks my hairs FAR more often than the much cheaper Revlon tweezer</li>
      <li>The little hole fits my thumb and forefinger well and provides a good place for them to grip.  </li>
      <li>Avoid the frustration with these - they make short work of shaping eyebrows or eliminating an errant strand on the chin. :)</li>
      <li>Compared to the drugstore brands I&#x27;d been using, the Tweezerman brands grabbed the hair on the first try, every time.  </li>
      <li>They are very sharp and work perfectly, much better than the cheap $3 junk I had before.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these tweezers to anyone looking to spend a few extra dollars for a good quality product!!</li>
      <li>when I say this one ( perfect for my big hands ) double thing due to price just a tweezers ..  </li>
      <li>I have large hands.</li>
      <li>Really gets those fine, short hairs with ease.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer these because they are easier to hold</li>
      <li>My old tweezers are being sent for &amp;#34;sharpening&amp;#34; and if they aren&#x27;t able to fix them, they will send a 50% off coupon for the next pair - which doesn&#x27;t really help me now, so I&#x27;m hoping the coupon doesn&#x27;t have an expiration date.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work on course hair very well</li>
      <li>Much shorter than I was expecting,</li>
      <li>I needed a straight edge tweezer to solve my chin hair problem.  </li>
      <li>They will not, however, fit in the exact same super tiny spaces where you may store &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; tweezers, so if you have space concerns regarding storage they might not work for you.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable grip and super sharp tips to rip out unwanted hair with style!</li>
      <li>These pluck better than any other pair I have used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Drugstore tweezers are good for removing ticks from your dog, but if you want a serious grooming tool, Tweezerman is it.</li>
      <li>but I can imagine when I am this will be an even bigger plus for me) and they look so cute with the big circle grips.  </li>
      <li>I think the regular grip ones actually provide more force, I feel it looses some structural rigidity with the loop.</li>
      <li>I sent it to the company, and they fixed it, or sent me a new one, I can&#x27;t really tell, but it would have been infinitely quicker to return it through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Would suggest to anyone who needs a new pair of tweezers</li>
      <li>It never breaks hairs and easily accomplishes a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would completely recommend these tweezers.  </li>
      <li>I have used Tweezerman tweezers for nearly 15 years.</li>
      <li>They can have all the old drugstore ones they can find around the house, but if they ask me if I have any tweezers they can borrow, I lie...)</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m not that old yet</li>
      <li>I have one of these that is about 10 years old.</li>
      <li>I have about six &amp;#34;granny hairs&amp;#34; - coarse beard hair that older women sprout.</li>
      <li>Very reasonable in price compared to other brands too.</li>
      <li>No other brand I&#x27;ve tried comes close.</li>
      <li>My sister talked me into spending the big bucks for a pair of Tweezermans several years ago, and they were worth every single dime.  </li>
      <li>If they get dull, you can send them in for a free fix.  </li>

    <li> brilliant shape, sharp n accurate.  you want this... game changer</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on course hair very well</li>
    <li> Good quality, heavy, nice balance</li>
    <li> great tweezers.  Grip about any out of place brow hairs.  Would suggest to anyone who needs a new pair of tweezers</li>
    <li> Got these for my son who was impressed with mine.  He said they are great.  Bad tweezers are almost worse than no tweezers.  These are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have to say these are about the best tweezers I have ever purchased!! These do an excellent job and fast too!! I highly recommend these tweezers to anyone looking to spend a few extra dollars for a good quality product!!</li>
    <li> I have used Tweezerman tweezers for nearly 15 years. My favorite style is the wide grip, which can be very difficult to find. I have always had the enameled ones and found the plain stainless to be somewhat slippery. I remedied it by giving it a coat of textured nailpolish. Now an excellent grip for my fingers along with the grip on the hairs!</li>
    <li> nice design for comfortable gripping, but that doesn&#x27;t really help when the tips aren&#x27;t good at all at grabbing and removing hair. totally useless for my fine, short hairs.</li>
    <li> The thumb hole makes it much steadier to use making it very precise ~only 1 pull necessary. I have large hands.</li>
    <li> I am an Esthetician and the job I currently have is as a Wax Specialist.  I use tweezers constantly throughout the day so with the beginning of arthritis, these tweezers are exceptional and comfortable to hold!</li>
    <li> And I am a miniature hobbyist, so I have a LOT of tweezers!  I bought these are for the super-fine, post-menopausal, chin hairs I couldn&#x27;t seem to snag with any of my other tweezers. The round parts of the grip are wonderful for my older, weaker, somewhat arthritic hand and the tips are so precisely ground that I can pull out the shortest, thinnest hair easily.</li>
    <li> I remembered having had this tweezer a while back and thinking it was incredible for some reason...the ergonomic grip is still good and comfortable but doesn&#x27;t get hair as well as the regular fine point tweeerman</li>
    <li> I have bought several Tweezerman tweezers and they ALL break hairs! That is... those  hairs these tweezers actually can grip. Far too many hairs slide through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m flabbergasted. I keep reading about how wonderful they are... well, not for me. I have about six &amp;#34;granny hairs&amp;#34; - coarse beard hair that older women sprout. I&#x27;m NOT going around sporting six beard hairs on my chin! I have a few thin hairs on my upper lip that are a bit dark - these tweezers break those, too. Tweezerman breaks my hairs FAR more often than the much cheaper Revlon tweezer I bought - the Revlon is slanted and has rounded corners. THAT is the best tweezer I ever used. It never breaks hairs and easily accomplishes a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Tweezer-Slanted-Tip/dp/B001B8K1L8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1397325896&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;revlon+tweezer</li>
    <li> These are the only tweezers I would ever get.  I&#x27;ve got 3 pairs.  Cosmetic bag, travel bag and purse for work and wherever an occasion comes up, like a splinter.  I believe they are guaranteed for life.... but read up on that.</li>
    <li> My tweezerman tweezers broke.  I ordered these and there is just something wrong with the tips.  They don&#x27;t grip in quite the same way.  I&#x27;m disappointed and thinking of sending them back to Tweezerman for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I have one of these that is about 10 years old. This is not as good as the old one, the old one is actually much nicer, more precise. This is ok, but I bought it to have a backup one like my old one.</li>
    <li> Weird thing to be excited about, but this is the very best tweezer out there.  No other brand I&#x27;ve tried comes close.</li>
    <li> My sister talked me into spending the big bucks for a pair of Tweezermans several years ago, and they were worth every single dime.  Compared to the drugstore brands I&#x27;d been using, the Tweezerman brands grabbed the hair on the first try, every time.  Done in no time.  After one of my kids &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; (aka LOST) my Tweezermans, a saleswoman talked me into getting this style as a replacement for them.  This &amp;#34;Wide Grip Slant&amp;#34; is the BEST!  The little hole fits my thumb and forefinger well and provides a good place for them to grip.  Adds just a touch more ease when using... PERFECT tweezers.  Love these. If they get dull, you can send them in for a free fix.  (I hide these from the kids.  They can have all the old drugstore ones they can find around the house, but if they ask me if I have any tweezers they can borrow, I lie...)</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> Still not quite as good as a previous one - but they are better than anything that I have purchased at a department store.</li>
    <li> I love the design.  great tips and easy to hold, but I still manage to misplace it. Maybe I need the Oscar Madison model instead of this Felix Ungar version :-)</li>
    <li> The wide grip allows for excellent presission and control, and the hi-quality steel makes for quick and easy personal grooming. By far the best pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve owned. Definitely recomended.</li>
    <li> Using an inferior set of tweezers can just about push me over the edge. Avoid the frustration with these - they make short work of shaping eyebrows or eliminating an errant strand on the chin. :)</li>
    <li> last pair endured 10 years of use on a Mediterranean face...need I be more elaborate about the workload?</li>
    <li> The Tweezerman tweezers I received may have been a bad batch so I exchanged them and found the replacement tweezers no better than the first batch.  The coated pair that was shipped in error in my first order worked better for me but it wasn&#x27;t anything special.  I now have 3 pair (one coated, two uncoated).  I hope the quality improves before I need more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for making the exchange so easy for me.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are not up to Tweezerman&#x27;s usual quality.</li>
    <li> very good at gripping.  they measure 3 3/8 inches in length.  Much shorter than I was expecting, but I can still grip them because of the circular thumb area.  comes in a plastic case.</li>
    <li> I had a pair like these in black that I used for years. I dropped them the other day and although they didn&#x27;t look too beat up, they went out of alignment and stopped working properly. The tweezer blade is super thin and will grab the most annoying and stubborn of hairs. This stainless steel one looks nice and doesn&#x27;t have paint on it that will eventually chip off. The wide grip feels good in the hand and is a nice alternative to the traditional tweezer design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drugstore tweezers are good for removing ticks from your dog, but if you want a serious grooming tool, Tweezerman is it.</li>
    <li> I hemmed and hawed about whether I should go with the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; tweezers or the wide grip.  I was worried the wide grips might interfere with my ability to see what I was doing, but they don&#x27;t at all.  I much prefer these because they are easier to hold (I&#x27;m not that old yet but I can imagine when I am this will be an even bigger plus for me) and they look so cute with the big circle grips.  They will not, however, fit in the exact same super tiny spaces where you may store &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; tweezers, so if you have space concerns regarding storage they might not work for you.  They are very sharp and work perfectly, much better than the cheap $3 junk I had before.</li>
    <li> It breaks half the hairs you pluck. I&#x27;m not happy for the price that I paid. I&#x27;m still looking for the pink one I had from tweezerman that&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Best tweezers on the market.  Comfortable grip and super sharp tips to rip out unwanted hair with style!</li>
    <li> Hate this tweezer! It doesn&#x27;t grasp at all. The original tweezerman is much better!</li>
    <li> actually a little awkward to use.  shipping was good but disappointed with the tweezer itself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually behind the best product I can afford .. when I say this one ( perfect for my big hands ) double thing due to price just a tweezers ..  but you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed with the product you get ..</li>
    <li> These pluck better than any other pair I have used. I will never buy a cheap pair again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the quality of Tweezerman beauty tools is no longer the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tweezers went bad really fast, the spring lost its resistance, the tip lost its grip.&lt;br /&gt;If you ask me it is a bit of a rip off to send it back to the manufacturer in order to get it fixed/sharpened.</li>
    <li> I would completely recommend these tweezers.  They are the best tweezers I have found yet for tweezing out eyebrow hairs in one single tug.  I bought a pair for my daughter after my own pair arrived and I found them to be so great.</li>
    <li> I needed a straight edge tweezer to solve my chin hair problem.  Grey hair has a hook like base under the skin and it drives you crazy trying to pull it out.  Tweezeman is still the best quality but the flat edge protects my skin.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman make the best!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never need another tweezer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent service.</li>
    <li> Really gets those fine, short hairs with ease.  No disappointment here! Very reasonable in price compared to other brands too.</li>
    <li> Well made and they do a great job. It is difficult to find good tweezers that work on hard to get small hairs. This works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I think the regular grip ones actually provide more force, I feel it looses some structural rigidity with the loop. This could just be me over analyzing and doing that incorrectly as well, so take it with a grain of salt.</li>
    <li> perfect tweezer with easy to hold grip</li>
    <li> Strange looking but works well, giving that extra control when needed.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time customer of Tweezerman tweezers. They are generally a great tool, well crafted, outstanding grab. They are hand filed and well packaged so you&#x27;d think there wouldn&#x27;t be any duds in the bunch. The one I got was mediocre for some reason. I sent it to the company, and they fixed it, or sent me a new one, I can&#x27;t really tell, but it would have been infinitely quicker to return it through Amazon. My old tweezers are being sent for &amp;#34;sharpening&amp;#34; and if they aren&#x27;t able to fix them, they will send a 50% off coupon for the next pair - which doesn&#x27;t really help me now, so I&#x27;m hoping the coupon doesn&#x27;t have an expiration date. It seems like a good deal but the aren&#x27;t very snappy about about service...6-8 weeks without tweezers is an eyebrow emergency.</li>
