      <li>it&#x27;s just amazing!!!</li>
      <li>Product is wonderful for the face in helping to prevent premature aging while also enhancing the tan.</li>
      <li>Great buy!</li>
      <li>But I won&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ll do my best to prevent accelerated aging.</li>
      <li>product is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I am so gonna piss them off and tell them about the great deal online.</li>
      <li>Great product, can&#x27;t beat the price or the product.</li>
      <li>The product is not greasy and has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all kinds of good for your skin.</li>
      <li>I was so happy I love this lotion</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s priceless, and I bet you can spare $20 ;)</li>
      <li>I ordered this product off eBay instead, &amp; it is truly an amazing product.</li>
      <li>Smells great, gentle on skin and works good</li>
      <li>Smells great, quick shipping</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have DHA, so the color is my own, &amp; I don&#x27;t have to worry about streaking, turning orange, washing hands after application, etc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell but made my face break out.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I also love that it has great anti-aging ingredients, because, let&#x27;s face it, tanning isn&#x27;t exactly good for your skin, so a little help in that department is always welcomed.</li>
      <li>After three or four times in the sun my face became very tan and my skin looked bright.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic facial tanner with great anti-aging ingredients.</li>
      <li>I know that people can fill used bottles with cheap product and ship it out.</li>
      <li>Crystal Faces by Australian Gold is also good, but Cypher takes the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luckily I got a refund from Amazon since the seller never responded.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make it loyally sticky</li>
      <li>It does have a natural bronzer, Erythrulose, which helps give you great color without the aforementioned side effects of DHA.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.</li>
      <li>Bought this product and was extremely excited to get it because I thought I had saved so much money from having to buy it from my tanning salon.</li>
      <li>This high-end product provides excellent skincare ingredients for tight, radiant, even-toned facial skin.</li>
      <li>I think maybe I need to actually tan more often like 3x week to notice a difference.  </li>
      <li>Since facial skin extends down the neck and to the beginning of the chest, make sure to use it there as well for healthy, youthful skin.</li>
      <li>Amazon is great about refunding you quickly if something goes wrong too.</li>
      <li>if you order it from a different seller than I did, it will be fine.</li>
      <li>However, it does soak in fast and seems to prevent burning.</li>
      <li>it really does make my face tanner while protecting</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t get me much of a tan in my face, it&#x27;s to pricey for the quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about cypher that I had to buy</li>
      <li>Because the money has already been spent I will attemp to smack the lotion out of the bottle in to my palm to see if the actual product is any good.</li>
      <li>Product is as exactly as sold in the tanning salons and for a whole lot cheaper (like 1/2 or more less than buhying in the salon).</li>
      <li>went to the tanning bed the next day and was excited to use this face</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try it a few more times</li>
      <li>Cypher Face moisturizers better than any other facial tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only 18 but tan avidly.</li>
      <li>Attempted to use this lotion twice before completely taking apart the bottle to see if there was any lotion inside because nothing would come out.</li>
      <li>I worked this bottle for a good twenty minutes until I got a just a little splatter which made me even more mad.</li>
      <li>I was very apprehensive towards purchasing expensive, top shelf tanning products off of Amazon.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smooth, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>and that might be why I&#x27;m not really noticing much on my face.</li>

    <li> I ordered this on November 4 2014, and on the bottom of the bottle it says 2/72014. Expired? This is under the batch number, where the date typically is.</li>
    <li> Great product, can&#x27;t beat the price or the product.</li>
    <li> Bought this face tanner about two weeks ago and the product is unbelievable. My face is the darkest It&#x27;s been in quite a while.  The product is not greasy and has a pleasant fragrance. After three or four times in the sun my face became very tan and my skin looked bright. Will never use another face tanning product. Won&#x27;t start my summer without it!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic facial tanner with great anti-aging ingredients. Unfortunately, the one I purchased on Amazon from the seller Market Solutions was sent to me either empty or defective, as it wouldn&#x27;t pump out any product. Luckily I got a refund from Amazon since the seller never responded.  I ordered this product off eBay instead, &amp; it is truly an amazing product. I can see a big difference as soon as I get out of the tanning bed. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have DHA, so the color is my own, &amp; I don&#x27;t have to worry about streaking, turning orange, washing hands after application, etc. It does have a natural bronzer, Erythrulose, which helps give you great color without the aforementioned side effects of DHA.  I also love that it has great anti-aging ingredients, because, let&#x27;s face it, tanning isn&#x27;t exactly good for your skin, so a little help in that department is always welcomed. This costs $47 at my tanning salon, &amp; I got it for $20! I&#x27;m sure if you order it from a different seller than I did, it will be fine. Amazon is great about refunding you quickly if something goes wrong too.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to see that cypher face was so heavily discounted as compared to the tanning salon i was going to buy it from unfortunately i can not get the product to come out so i cannot properly review the product. i was very disappointed to have wasted my money.</li>
    <li> It smells like bad dough or playdough. However, it does soak in fast and seems to prevent burning. Don&#x27;t rely solely on it for bronzing.</li>
    <li> Smells great, gentle on skin and works good</li>
    <li> I wish I had looked at the prices here on Amazon.  I was gullible enough to purchase at the tanning salon for $50.  I feel like an idiot now!  Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure if this is working for me or not.  I use it sparingly b/c I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance. I think maybe I need to actually tan more often like 3x week to notice a difference.  I&#x27;ve only been going 1-2x week and that might be why I&#x27;m not really noticing much on my face.</li>
    <li> The staff at the salon I visit use this as a facial lotion and not just for tanning.  I can&#x27;t afford that, but it does the trick while baking in the sun.</li>
    <li> Smells great, quick shipping</li>
    <li> Cypher Face moisturizers better than any other facial tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used. It goes on so smooth, and a little bit goes a long way. This high-end product provides excellent skincare ingredients for tight, radiant, even-toned facial skin. Since facial skin extends down the neck and to the beginning of the chest, make sure to use it there as well for healthy, youthful skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and was extremely excited to get it because I thought I had saved so much money from having to buy it from my tanning salon. When I received the product and went to pump it nothing would come out. I worked this bottle for a good twenty minutes until I got a just a little splatter which made me even more mad. I thought that I had just gotten a bad pump on the bottle so I took it apart and NOTHING was in it!! The bottle was also outdated on the bottom, expired in 2014. I was so upset because I had worked myself up for this lotion that I&#x27;ve wanted for awhile now! I do not recommend buying this product from this seller.</li>
    <li> I love this I bought this at my salon and realized I was paying like $100 and I found it on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t believe it I was so happy I love this lotion it really does make my face tanner while protecting and it doesn&#x27;t make it loyally sticky doesn&#x27;t smell bad it&#x27;s just amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time and use it as a face moisterizer! I love it</li>
    <li> Cypher Face lotion came in the mail, I opened it and everything looked legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the tanning bed the next day and was excited to use this face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pumped the lotion out and all I got was a spitter splatter..... The bottle was empty!!!! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was highly sad!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about cypher that I had to buy and I went tanning this morning and it brought out my freckles more (which I hate) The people at my salon said that it should prevent that and help the rest of my face. I&#x27;m going to try it a few more times but if it continues to do this then to the trash it will go!</li>
    <li> Attempted to use this lotion twice before completely taking apart the bottle to see if there was any lotion inside because nothing would come out. After I did I found that the suction straw was missing which renders the product almost useless. Because the money has already been spent I will attemp to smack the lotion out of the bottle in to my palm to see if the actual product is any good. Cypher Face was recomended to me by a friend and I can say that I will atleast not buy from this seller again. As for the actual product, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> You will see a difference after the 1st time!</li>
    <li> Product is as exactly as sold in the tanning salons and for a whole lot cheaper (like 1/2 or more less than buhying in the salon). Product is wonderful for the face in helping to prevent premature aging while also enhancing the tan.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Quality product, and by ordering it from Amazon instead of buying it in a tanning salon, you save tons of money.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I ordered the 2011 California tan cypher facial bronzer tanning lotion and I was sent a tube of Pauly D&#x27;s lip buddy Chapstick... Definitely not tanning lotion!!!</li>
    <li> I believe this product works. My face seems hydrated and getting darker. It does not have a nasty smell to it and is very smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but made my face break out.</li>
    <li> Helped even out some of my face freckles how ever it did cause some breaking out</li>
    <li> I was very apprehensive towards purchasing expensive, top shelf tanning products off of Amazon. I know that people can fill used bottles with cheap product and ship it out. This- however- was NOT the case with Since 1901. I received the bottle on the 4th and my order was placed on the 31st. It didn&#x27;t arrive sooner, because two of those days were the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re big concern, the legitimacy, can stop worrying you. IT&#x27;S REAL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is perfect for me. I&#x27;m only 18 but tan avidly. I do not want to throw my facial health away. To prevent myself from doing so, I should stop tanning. But I won&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ll do my best to prevent accelerated aging. That&#x27;s what this product will do. It&#x27;s all kinds of good for your skin. Crystal Faces by Australian Gold is also good, but Cypher takes the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. It&#x27;s priceless, and I bet you can spare $20 ;)</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t get me much of a tan in my face, it&#x27;s to pricey for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;My face isn&#x27;t the same shade as my body.</li>
    <li> I must say I am so pissed at the tanning salon that I tan at! They charged me $80.00 for the body and wanted to charge me $80.00 for the Cypher face. But I told them I would get Cypher face next time. I am so gonna piss them off and tell them about the great deal online. I only paid $20.00 for Cypher face on Amazon! Never again will I buy from the tanning Salon! And this product is absolutely great! Feels great and enhances your tan!</li>
