### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>what a great product!</li>
      <li>Great longevity, my nails out grew the shield!</li>
      <li>These serve as protection and are very attractive.</li>
      <li>This are just great! :D</li>
      <li>My nails look great!  </li>
      <li>The best nail product!</li>
      <li>What a great product!</li>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>May I please request tops for a perfect curve under the cuticle/moon.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>As someone who cannot paint my own nails to save my life, these are a wonderful alternative!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting my own supply!</li>
      <li>So, I was pleasantly</li>
      <li>/&gt;These strips are easy to apply and the results look wonderful.</li>
      <li>A good all around nail protection if you garden, cook, etc.</li>
      <li>Good idea, but would need to use superglue to make it work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for something that would give my nails a nice, neat, great shine without having to go through a lot of work to keep them looking so.  </li>
      <li>My nails also split vertically, so i want something that would make my nails look good, and these lasted almost 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Find the best fit, apply over nail, rub and file nail edge.  </li>
      <li>Nails must be totally clean before application for best results.</li>
      <li>They go on easily and look great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since they work so nicely and stay in place, I will buy them again</li>
      <li>NICE TO HAVE AN ITEM LIKE THIS</li>
      <li>I liked putting nail stickers over them too</li>
      <li>If I can lift the strip from either end, that alone makes more art options for mixing colors, creating my own patterns and style.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ll be able to have nice looking nails with color and without the fuss of liquid polish.</li>
      <li>This is the greatest new product, I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  </li>
      <li>love this product and my nails</li>
      <li>like most I hope to get two uses out of this product.</li>
      <li>These were some of the very best beauty products, including the solid color &#x27;Salon Effects&amp;#34;...that I every purchased.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased when I discovered these nail shields.</li>
      <li>I polish over top with my favorite color</li>
      <li>- 10 is more like it.</li>
      <li>And, buyer beware, I did not realize this was not part of the free shipping deal, so I paid $2.50 for the product and $3.99 for the shipping!  </li>
      <li>These Nail Shields are fantastic!</li>
      <li>Or, maybe you could make one strip curve in on top and curve out on the bottom for the nail tip.</li>
      <li>but these are perfect and i even cook and do the dishes and they remain exactly as the first time...</li>
      <li>I am looking at the shielded thumb 10 days later and it is perfect!  </li>
      <li>Be patient, you will be glad you did.</li>
      <li>These in particular did a great job of strengthening and smoothing my nails.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You will have to deal with your own cuticles which is easy enough, but I think they look great</li>
      <li>So far, I am very satisfied!  </li>
      <li>on top of that, i get mine for FREE because i do surveys online that pay for this stuff.</li>
      <li>the most important thing to remember is to rub.</li>
      <li>This could add the nail art effect yet easy to do.</li>
      <li>But with this product they&#x27;re doing just fine.  </li>
      <li>Smooth the closest fit on each nail and get to work without worring about my polish.</li>
      <li>look fabulous in spite of my always forgetting to wear my work</li>
      <li>These are a good way to protect your nails especially if you put a top coat over them.</li>
      <li>more request, my old hands dont want plaids and zebras, just beautiful feminine shades, I&#x27;d even buy lots of clear if I could.</li>
      <li>Super easy to apply, no time needed to set.</li>
      <li>I understand that &#x27;gel&#x27; is the new thing, but please don&#x27;t ask me to buy a $60 device plus more strips; I love the Salon Effects strips as they were...</li>
      <li>For a 2 week manicure, it is completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
      <li>wipe nails with rubbing alcohol first:)</li>
      <li>First, I make sure my hands, nails and tools are perfectly clean.</li>
      <li>If you can get it at a good price it&#x27;s a good product for hard working hands.</li>
      <li>Great concept, but once you open the package, use them right away.  </li>
      <li>I would gladly buy more of the solid shades in various colors, just because of the easy of application, the amazing amount of time it takes to get a chip, and because of how many compliments I have gotten on my nails.</li>
      <li>I have left on over a month because they still looked great and simply top coat to coat new nail</li>
      <li>Made my nails grow super fast and they are really strong.</li>
      <li>Pretty!</li>
      <li>I anticipated this would be the same, but it was more rigid than the strips, did not go on as easily, and I did not like this color at all.</li>
      <li>Since I can&#x27;t get to a nail salon regularly, I have to do my own nails</li>
      <li>My latest attempt lasted 16 days -- removed the product only because my nails had grown too much!!</li>
      <li>After I do that, I wash my hands in hot water (as hot as I can stand, using soap)</li>
      <li>remove this cover first, apply to nail and remove this side last.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>They are a bit tricky to put on as they are very fragile but adhere well and are easy to shape with the included emery board.</li>
      <li>No long waits for each coat to dry and they truely do protect and nourish while looking lovely.</li>
      <li>I am a huge Sally Hansen fan and do like the products, especially the strips.</li>
      <li>As much as I would recommend the strips, I would not recommend these.</li>
      <li>The basics were fantastic and I wish you would bring them back.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise, it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>The sheers, which I ordered have a very sublte opal finish in them.  </li>
      <li>I really have had problems growing my nails.  </li>
      <li>And my nails grow so long and strong, zero breakage over 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>First time using this product and I was very surprised that it worked as well as it did.  </li>
      <li>I think that if you need an emergency manicure that only needs to look good for a few hours, the Nail Shield strips will do the trick.</li>
      <li>However, if my nails did crack under the quick, I just put an extra one over the crack and it kept it in place until it could grow out.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE SELLERS FOR ITEMS LIKE THIS.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these for toes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Much, much lower than any retail store by far, even when factoring in the shipping charge.</li>
      <li>I wore these on a cruise vacation (lots of time in water and sand), and on normal routine.</li>
      <li>when I used these over the nail strips, it keeps them looking new for days and days.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The second time I used this product, it did not stick immediately to my nail like it did the first time</li>
      <li>THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR A DISABLED PERSON TO USE..</li>
      <li>The one positive aspect to this product is that the finish is nearly instant.</li>
      <li>They do smell rather potently, just like new nail polish, but only for a few hours.</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen Hard As Wraps lasts longer, protects my nails better, and is far easier to remove.  </li>
      <li>I tend to use conservative, neutral nail colors and this &amp;#34;Sheer Shell&amp;#34; is almost clear with just a hint of iridescence.  </li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>My old eyes dont see so well anymore and clearer</li>
      <li>and I wanted something that would protect and nourish my nails since I often wash my hands and my hands are busy.  </li>
      <li>This particular sale was way below the regular price.</li>
      <li>true, they do dry out after the first use, but clear fingernail polish placed on the nail before applying the 1/8 strip holds it in place, then once i have all 3 strips in place i usually cover the entire nail with 2-3 layers of clear fingernail polish</li>
      <li>even though I kept pressing it down, it kept puckering and seemed like it would slide right off.  </li>
      <li>If anything, it helped the stickers stay on longer than a regular clear coat of nail polish.</li>
      <li>So, I was pleasantly surprised for the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time I used this nail shield, it adhered immediately to my nail and all I had to do was press it down and file off the overage.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure they will last the full two weeks, but an expensive salon manicure honestly lasts me until I get home</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the [[ASIN:B003Q8WAHO Sally Hansen 14 Day Nail Shield, Sheer Shell, 0.329 Ounce]]. I usually think of Sally Hanson as having quality products so I was very displeased that this product completely failed to work as advertised. I followed the directions to the letter but the nail shield will not stick to your fingernails. The shields immediately start pulling up at the sides and peel off. It doesn&#x27;t matter how long you hold them down, they don&#x27;t stick - period. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they dramatically improve it.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest new product, I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  I&#x27;ve been digging in the yard, moving rocks, etc. and no nail breakage or even polish chips.</li>
    <li> While I did not have the application problems that many other negative reviewers had, I found the performance results of this product to be extremely disappointing. I work with my hands and a typical manicure lasts about three days before the tips start to chip. The \\&quot;14 Day Nail Shield\\&quot; did not last even one entire day before the tips were completely chipped off all my nails. Sally Hansen Hard As Wraps lasts longer, protects my nails better, and is far easier to remove.  The one positive aspect to this product is that the finish is nearly instant. You don&#x27;t have to worry about drying time at all, though there is an strong, unpleasant odor. I think that if you need an emergency manicure that only needs to look good for a few hours, the Nail Shield strips will do the trick. For any other purpose, they just are not worth the expense.</li>
    <li> The best nail product! Lasts so well, with no chipping until earliest day10. And my nails grow so long and strong, zero breakage over 2 weeks. Super easy to apply, no time needed to set. I wore these on a cruise vacation (lots of time in water and sand), and on normal routine.</li>
    <li> My sister put one shield on my perpetually splitting thumb nail over a week ago.  I quilt a lot, which is notoriously hard on hands.  Also wash dishes daily.  I am looking at the shielded thumb 10 days later and it is perfect!  I&#x27;m getting my own supply!</li>
    <li> Seems simple enough.  Find the best fit, apply over nail, rub and file nail edge.  Well you cant size on the sides of your nail unless you cut the strip you can only file over the tip.  The strip doesn&#x27;t stick at all and it just looked fake.  Ugh! Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are garbage and I threw them away within an hour of having them arrive in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;I put them on a few nails and it looked as though I had saran wrap on my nails. Very odd and not attractive.</li>
    <li> What a great product! There is a little learning curve, but really application just takes a little time. You can cut the strips in half and get two applications. the most important thing to remember is to rub. rub, rub the shield on your nail. I do it while watching tv. Great longevity, my nails out grew the shield! Made my nails grow super fast and they are really strong. Be patient, you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Lasts just as long as advertised and helped my nails grow out. I liked putting nail stickers over them too and it didn&#x27;t damage the nail shield. If anything, it helped the stickers stay on longer than a regular clear coat of nail polish.</li>
    <li> I am a huge Sally Hansen fan and do like the products, especially the strips. I anticipated this would be the same, but it was more rigid than the strips, did not go on as easily, and I did not like this color at all. As much as I would recommend the strips, I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> NICE TO HAVE AN ITEM LIKE THIS THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR A DISABLED PERSON TO USE.. RECEIVED PROMPTLY. GREAT PRODUCT. A+  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE SELLERS FOR ITEMS LIKE THIS.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased when I discovered these nail shields. No more messy nail polish or broken, split nails. These serve as protection and are very attractive. I constantly get compliments on my nails since I started using them.</li>
    <li> I wish I had tried these sooner! As someone who cannot paint my own nails to save my life, these are a wonderful alternative! They go on easily and look great. I&#x27;m not sure they will last the full two weeks, but an expensive salon manicure honestly lasts me until I get home so these are a definite improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have to deal with your own cuticles which is easy enough, but I think they look great and they do protect your nails and help them grow longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a total nail polish strip converter!</li>
    <li> Great concept, but once you open the package, use them right away.  They won&#x27;t store for even a week without getting stiff and no longer want to stick to the nail it is applied to.  I polish over top with my favorite color and they last without chipping, until you remove them with polish remover.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something that would give my nails a nice, neat, great shine without having to go through a lot of work to keep them looking so.  Well, I think I found it!  I just applied it.  My nails look great!  So far, I am very satisfied!  If it works for 14 days or even close to 14 days, like it says, I will be a permanent customer!</li>
    <li> I have difficult nails that polish will not stay on for 2 days. My nails also split vertically, so i want something that would make my nails look good, and these lasted almost 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I hate the fact that Sally Hansen has not only discontinued this product but all of the solid color Salon Effects products.These in particular did a great job of strengthening and smoothing my nails. These were some of the very best beauty products, including the solid color &#x27;Salon Effects&amp;#34;...that I every purchased. I would gladly buy more of the solid shades in various colors, just because of the easy of application, the amazing amount of time it takes to get a chip, and because of how many compliments I have gotten on my nails. I understand that &#x27;gel&#x27; is the new thing, but please don&#x27;t ask me to buy a $60 device plus more strips; I love the Salon Effects strips as they were...I don&#x27;t need nor want them in ridiculous patterns. The basics were fantastic and I wish you would bring them back.</li>
    <li> These are very difficult to apply and peel off easily.</li>
    <li> These are very sheer, the photo made these look pinker than they actually are so next time I&#x27;m going to try the Sheer Blush, which doesn&#x27;t look pink in the photo but the name says pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who thought there were only 12 in the box, there are 4 strips hiding behind another piece of foiled paper. The bigger thumbnail size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the fashion strips these are in a single foiled pouch, I put the rest in a freezer baggie in the foil pouch and pushed all the air out, like most I hope to get two uses out of this product. Will update on life of product later, I just applied them today. (01-11-13)</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended using this product as an alternative to gel nail polish and the required UV light.&lt;br /&gt;These strips are easy to apply and the results look wonderful. My latest attempt lasted 16 days -- removed the product only because my nails had grown too much!! I tend to use conservative, neutral nail colors and this &amp;#34;Sheer Shell&amp;#34; is almost clear with just a hint of iridescence.  The price cannot be beat. Much, much lower than any retail store by far, even when factoring in the shipping charge. Needless to say, I have ordered more in this color and in several others. Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I really have had problems growing my nails.  They split or break all too often.  But with this product they&#x27;re doing just fine.  Thank you Sally Hanson!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B008UG6DGQ SALLY HANSEN 14 Day Nail Shield - Sheer Blush 3502]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Excellent product! First, I make sure my hands, nails and tools are perfectly clean. Smooth the closest fit on each nail and get to work without worring about my polish. No long waits for each coat to dry and they truely do protect and nourish while looking lovely. I have left on over a month because they still looked great and simply top coat to coat new nail growth.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am spoiled and want to refine my use. May I please request tops for a perfect curve under the cuticle/moon. I like this unpolished to keep oiled and moisturised. This could add the nail art effect yet easy to do. Or, maybe you could make one strip curve in on top and curve out on the bottom for the nail tip. If I can lift the strip from either end, that alone makes more art options for mixing colors, creating my own patterns and style.&lt;br /&gt;One more request, my old hands dont want plaids and zebras, just beautiful feminine shades, I&#x27;d even buy lots of clear if I could. My old eyes dont see so well anymore and clearer remove this cover first, apply to nail and remove this side last.&lt;br /&gt;Love love this product and my nails look fabulous in spite of my always forgetting to wear my work gloves!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> These Nail Shields are fantastic! I have gotten obsessed with the Sally Hansen Salon Effects Nail Strips and the Incoco Nail Strips and when I would use a top-coat, the strip would lift, when I used these over the nail strips, it keeps them looking new for days and days. I highly recommend these for toes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to push the cuticles back, file and buff the nails to desired length and shape, then use rubbing alcohol over your nails. Next, place the nail strips on your nails according to directions. After I do that, I wash my hands in hot water (as hot as I can stand, using soap) then I dry my hands and place the Nail Shields over them. For a 2 week manicure, it is completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> Horrible product. They did not stick to my nail at all. Good idea, but would need to use superglue to make it work.</li>
    <li> WOW! i dont use an entire strip, i use maybe an 1/8 at a time; i put a bit on each side of each nail, then i cut a 1/4 bit to go across the tip of the nail and i still have 5 left! true, they do dry out after the first use, but clear fingernail polish placed on the nail before applying the 1/8 strip holds it in place, then once i have all 3 strips in place i usually cover the entire nail with 2-3 layers of clear fingernail polish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and on top of that, i get mine for FREE because i do surveys online that pay for this stuff. what a great product!</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and was never able to get the strips to hold/stick to my fingernails. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Never had a Sally Hanson nail product fail to stick before -- have used the gel nails -- but these will not bind.  Possibly defective - can&#x27;t say.</li>
    <li> so thin and fly away hard to even control. all the effort will not even show on your nails. I threw them away!</li>
    <li> I use this product to protect individual nails that have a problem- Doing very careful application, it works-but once you open the sealed package, the stickum starts to dry out- so often i am using only one or two of the nail shields and then can&#x27;t use rest later</li>
    <li> I ordered this as part of a Christmas present.  The Sally Hansen box was shipped in an envelope just big enough for the box.  The box was absolutely crushed.  And, buyer beware, I did not realize this was not part of the free shipping deal, so I paid $2.50 for the product and $3.99 for the shipping!  There is no way that it cost $3.99 for the company to ship this product in the tiny, unprotecting envelope they shipped it in.  Wow.  In addition, the box claims it includes \\&quot;16 Strips;\\&quot; but this box contained only 12.  As it is a Christmas gift, I cannot speak for how well the product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I contacted the company and they apologized and are sending a replacement.</li>
    <li> I already knew this product. This particular sale was way below the regular price. A good all around nail protection if you garden, cook, etc. Nails must be totally clean before application for best results. (hint: wipe nails with rubbing alcohol first:) I don&#x27;t think it lasts 14 days. 7 - 10 is more like it. If you can get it at a good price it&#x27;s a good product for hard working hands.</li>
    <li> This are just great! :D I&#x27;m allergic and cant use regular nail polish but these are perfect and i even cook and do the dishes and they remain exactly as the first time... 100% recomended</li>
    <li> I am hooked on these nail shields.  Just the basic ones, not the gels which are more expensive and no stronger than these.  The sheers, which I ordered have a very sublte opal finish in them.  Pretty!</li>
    <li> the so called shields do not stay even half an hour, despite my following instructions etc, so much effort to apply and all for nothing</li>
    <li> I bought these because my nails are very thin and always breaking and peeling. They are a bit tricky to put on as they are very fragile but adhere well and are easy to shape with the included emery board. They do smell rather potently, just like new nail polish, but only for a few hours. They didn&#x27;t crack and peel like nail polish does on me, because I use my nails like a Swiss army knife, but it didn&#x27;t stop them from splitting and peeling. However, if my nails did crack under the quick, I just put an extra one over the crack and it kept it in place until it could grow out.</li>
    <li> These are a good way to protect your nails especially if you put a top coat over them. I can wear them about ten days to two weeks before having to replace them. Thank you.</li>
    <li> First time using this product and I was very surprised that it worked as well as it did.  Since I can&#x27;t get to a nail salon regularly, I have to do my own nails and I wanted something that would protect and nourish my nails since I often wash my hands and my hands are busy.  The first time I used this nail shield, it adhered immediately to my nail and all I had to do was press it down and file off the overage.  These nail shields stayed put on my nails after washing with soap, shampooing my hair, rubbing my hands with lotion, preparing food, etc.  They did not come off or become loosened.  So, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used this product, it did not stick immediately to my nail like it did the first time even though I kept pressing it down, it kept puckering and seemed like it would slide right off.  So, I just left it alone but fully expected it to come off.  Much to my surprise, it didn&#x27;t.  The next time I checked my nails the shields were laid firmly to my nails and there was no more puckering or air holes.  So, I was pleasantly surprised for the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they work so nicely and stay in place, I will buy them again but I will choose one with color instead of sheer because you don&#x27;t have to wait for them to dry like nail polish and they don&#x27;t chip.  So I&#x27;ll be able to have nice looking nails with color and without the fuss of liquid polish.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen folks, if you are reading this, please bring this product back!! I have scoured the Internet looking for places that have it in stock. This product does last 2 weeks, no lie. And work with my hands all day (what woman doesn&#x27;t?).</li>
