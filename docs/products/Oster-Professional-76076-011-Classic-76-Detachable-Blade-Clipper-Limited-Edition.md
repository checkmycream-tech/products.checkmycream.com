    <li> I purchased these clippers about a week and a half ago thinking I would also be getting the set of guards as shown in the photograph. Clippers came, no guards. Had them resend the product, still no guards. I really needed the clippers for work and really wanted them in pink, so I ended it up just sucking it up and buying the guards at Sally&#x27;s. Clippers work well and everything but they shouldn&#x27;t have shown them with the guards and bag, a bit deceiving.</li>
    <li> We have a barbershop and the Oster 76 is a true classic.  Very well built - the Pink color also makes it special.</li>
    <li> bought these expecting new and got used, opened and in a different brand box...the item them selves work fine and i like them..but wld not buy from this seller..when he agreed to settle since they were open for a monetary refund he gave me 5 dollars out of 140 back..bull crap!</li>
    <li> it is an oster 76 classic, need i say more? precise and clean &#x3D;) i use it everday at work and i love it</li>
    <li> They get kind of hot and there is no place to oil the motor</li>
    <li> My blade fell apart after using the clippers for a week&lt;br /&gt;I had to replace the blade from Sally&#x27;s because I needed it for my next client I spent 40 bucks disappointed</li>
    <li> Kinda noisy but very fast. Well made and easy to oil and clean. I got tired of cheap clippers that just quit working after a year or so. I think these are going to go the distance.</li>
    <li> Bought them for the ol lady and she loved um</li>
    <li> This product has been working perfectly. I love the color, and it runs well. However, the picture is a little deceiving because it shows the guards and it did not come with guards. I had to go out and purchase those myself. That aside, it is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Have always used Oster Classic 76 clippers. My two sisters and i have been hairdressers for over twenty years now.&lt;br /&gt;Bought the pink ones for my big sister as a birthday gift. She loves them!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product..the pic that was shown included clipper guards. They have since changed their photo. They charged more than other sellers. I thought because guards were Included. After clippers arrived w no guards, i emailed seller. Very poor customer service. I would not recommend this seller to anyone.</li>
    <li> I finally got to use them love them!!  I have to get use to the clipper size conversion from old to new.</li>
    <li> My husband love these clippers... Although they are pink and have flowers he wasn&#x27;t ashame to pull it out in front of the boys in the barber shop lol. besides it was a gift from his daughter so it was perfect. They cut very good as well.. And it comes with a year warranty ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure what I got are knock-offs. They don&#x27;t look exactly like the picture and don&#x27;t have the ball bearing for grease on the outside. Also they get a little warm. Still work well, time will tell if they&#x27;re as sturdy as the original oster76.</li>
    <li> I love them they work great</li>
    <li> Works great just gets hot to fast</li>
    <li> Gave it to my daughter for Christmas. I am king! Very solid trimmer with attachments. I don&#x27;t expect it to need replacing for a long time</li>
    <li> The one I received was defective it didn&#x27;t have to oil hole on it so I returned it. I also didn&#x27;t like how heavy it was. I&#x27;m a Pretty small girl and I&#x27;m used to cordless clippers and I just could not get to hang of these.</li>
    <li> Packged arrived quickly, contained the correct product and has awesome performance.  My girlfriend absolutely loves her new clippers.  Very satisfied customer with both the service and the product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Professional grade. Purchased it as a gift for a student barber and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Love it, works perfect, in excellent condition, I use them a lot at my work so I needed a good sturdy clipper. The oster is the best clipper I have used, I also got the baby oster trimmer and I love that one too!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something  wrong power not strong</li>
    <li> Best ever! I have used these for years and my old ones just died, so I replaced them immediately. I decided to go pink this time and I am really happy with them. Amazon had the best price of all the places I looked, and they came really quick, so I was satisfied every way....</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, these clippers will most likely last a lifetime with somewhat regular consumer use. Over built like a tank and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> these clippers not only work amazing but also are soooo addorable i love oster have been using them for years and all my blades from my old set fit perfect</li>
