    <li> For some unknown reason, I cannot purchase this particular breath spray in any of my local stores. I was ecstatic when I found it online and ordered a whole case of 12. The sprays were delivered quickly and the package was in good shape when it arrived. I&#x27;ll have fresh breath for a long time now that I have a good supply. I will order again when I run out.

    <li> Item is always great.  Fast delivery!!!</li>
    <li> Heard about this on a tv show.  An actress stated it is frequently used by actors. Great product, very refreshing, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> What can I say I&#x27;m an 80&#x27;s baby!! Just get them and use them for stocking stuffers, or office gifts. I have on at my desk, in my cars, at home and in my purse, and my briefcase. I&#x27;m addicted!!</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as the original Binaca drops of years ago, but still the best breath spray/drops available.  Compared to those little sheets of paper that Listerine wants us to dissolve in our mouths, these Binaca sprays are a sweet mist from heaven.  And they don&#x27;t jingle and jangle in your pocket like Tic Tacs.</li>
    <li> Great refreshing product. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you’re new to Breath Sprays and you’re not sure where to start to sort through all the hype and find what’s effective,&lt;br /&gt;you’ll be glad you started here.&lt;br /&gt;I take use this everyday&lt;br /&gt;No strange side effects!!&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing bad to say!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy this with confidence!!&lt;br /&gt;Five Stars!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;Aaa nnn ddd I must say!!&lt;br /&gt;which I always do!!&lt;br /&gt;Peace!!&lt;br /&gt;The LumberJack</li>
    <li> Not quite as good or effective as the old product which used to be available at the supermarket, but it is close!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and it was sent to me ahead of the designated time line. This is all I need to say.</li>
    <li> Always the best.  Hard to find except for Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Hard to find in store very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Only sugar free breath spray that works.</li>
    <li> i always carry one in my pocket,  and give them to my friends, i don&#x27;t like to smell like smoke</li>
    <li> WAS INTRODUCED  TO BINACA IN SWITZERLAND A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AT THAT TIME THERE WAS ONLY ONE FLAVOR, SHORTLY THERE AFTER IT WAS IMPORTED INTO THE U.S. MANY YEARS LATER THEY STOPPED THE IMPORT FOR SOME FEABLE EXCUSE THAT IT INTERFERED WITH  DRUG TESTING. THE NEW FLAVORS ARE O.K. BUT THEY DO NOT COME CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL.</li>
    <li> Stated on listing (Pack of 12) but was really only 3&lt;br /&gt;Vendor stated vendor typo error Have a nice day sucker</li>
    <li> fastblast work the best love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheaper to buy these in bulk from Amazon than individually in local store. No issues with the spray function on any of them. Small enough to carry in pocket. Tastes good and &#x27;freshness&#x27; lasts longer than expected. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the new package, but it is what I expected.  The vendor who sold me the item was excellent---fast and correct.</li>
    <li> What was on the picture was not what I rec&#x27;d...there are different types of containers of Binaca....I wanted what the picture showed......</li>
    <li> this product is good and long lasting i will order this agan and the price is very good binaca is a very good product</li>
