      <li>It&#x27;s a great mousee, I&#x27;ve been using kerastase volumactive for many years, I can&#x27;t tell if any different from this one.</li>

    <li> It is great at providing volume to my otherwise limp hair, but I do find that it makes my hair greasy sometimes, especially when I use it with a heat protectant. However, it is the best mousse I have found for my fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> I like so much is my first time that I am using but I like how is my hair</li>
    <li> got it- thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Kathryn Parish</li>
    <li> Simply the best!  I&#x27;ve tried everything else, but i keep coming back to this product despite the price.  It gives my fine hair volume without drying it out or leaving a gunky mess.  Love it and would buy a gallon if they would lower the price!</li>
    <li> Very effective.  Get inquiries on how I get such volume in my hair often.</li>
    <li> My hair looks great.  What a find</li>
    <li> Do not know why they stopped producing this product.  It is a great volumizer  for fine hair!  Not only that is is soooooo Pricey!</li>
    <li> re-order and use it all the time---makes thin hair look fuller</li>
    <li> I purchased this item twice, once by mistake.  Both cans malfunctioned and the foam simply would not come out of the can.  If I did manage to get some foam, it did absolutely nothing for my baby-fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Nothing I have used previously to this even compares.</li>
    <li> Provides good volume for my hair.</li>
    <li> There are no English directions on my bottle and no paper instructions.  Are you supposed to apply to wet hair?  Unfortunately I can only speak and read English.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Same as full price version at salon. Keeps hair soft and manageable while adding needed volume. Highly recommend product!</li>
    <li> Great product, but there must be something wrong with the way it is manufactured. It is very difficult to get the product out of the bottle</li>
    <li> gift for sister she loves this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great mousee, I&#x27;ve been using kerastase volumactive for many years, I can&#x27;t tell if any different from this one. Anyway I think that either of them are second to none, I&#x27;ve tried other products and you can&#x27;t compare. Pricey? maybe but it&#x27;s worth in my opinion. I&#x27;m a man with not so short fine straight hair. Towel dry thoroughly before applying.</li>
    <li> Best Volumizing mousse ever!! Tried loads of the other products before and now i found my perfect mousse without which i would not travel. Love the way it makes my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Kerastase is wonderful even if it&#x27;s pricey.</li>
