      <li>You have to keep with it and take the recommended dosage for the best benefits!!</li>
      <li>I also has the best rating at Men&#x27;s Health for effeciveness.  </li>
      <li>awesome product great for enhancement for men</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>and I am going to buy more for best result.</li>
      <li>this PHGH is great, after 3 days of trying, I kind of like it</li>
      <li>On PHGH the orgasms are way stronger and I noticed a good size increase in the amount of sperm and length it can be shot.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the good news.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
      <li>tried it and found that your better off eating M&amp;M candy !</li>
      <li>Pretty good!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing this sort of product makes it to the market place....</li>
      <li>by far the best is the Hardazon sold at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>All in all I am impressed and satisfied with the results and thankful that it is all natural.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay but not as I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m spending NO money :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been off PHGH for 5 months now and the good effects have gone away, but I still have trouble ejaculating, especially more than once.</li>
      <li>product does not work, you are better off going to Doctor and getting an Testosterone injection.</li>
      <li>I am hoping by taking the 2000mg capsules that I will start noticing more results.</li>
      <li>Does everything that it says it does, stronger libido, stronger erections, more staying power, and more satisfying orgasms.</li>
      <li>After taking PHGH I have to fight to orgasm more than once and even the first is sometimes a challenge to finish.</li>
      <li>This is well worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>Im really excited</li>
      <li>a product is good, that should be enough time??</li>
      <li>Used product as directed for 2 full</li>
      <li>Only good marketing (website promotion, newsletter, etc).</li>
      <li>I would rather gamble the money I spent on this product as my odds are better for a better outcome!</li>
      <li>However, 100% Authentic and I highly recommend this PHGH Product.....</li>
      <li>WARNING to all, the bottle gave a great long list of those who cannot use it, along with high blood pressure, and associated complaints,Diabetis etc, that was not told on purchase, did take them though</li>
      <li>I EXPECTED MORE,,,,REALLY NEED THREE OR 4 PILLS TO GET A GOOD RESULT</li>
      <li>I am able to maintain and my spouse was also was surprised.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work reasonably well!</li>
      <li>The effectiveness was noticed within the first week.  </li>
      <li>so it only helped and increased my already healthy experience.  </li>
      <li>perhaps they realise as word spreads, they won&#x27;t sell many units and want to rake in as much cash as possible.  </li>
      <li>It will be interesting to see if there are long term positive results.</li>
      <li>He has tried other products as well but the overall results he gets from PHGH is great.  </li>
      <li>This product really takes awhile to see results..</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a real bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has helped the circulation throughout his whole body.  </li>
      <li>This product does absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>it works really well.</li>
      <li>Might work better when combined with other herbal supplements.  </li>
      <li>I have been doing some research on this and other products and this one is the most highly rated product out there that does not require a prescription.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to orgasm twice back to back and then again with a 5-10min break between.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED..</li>
      <li>However, it honestly was negative there.</li>
      <li>IT WAS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT FOR THE PRICE</li>
      <li>live and learn...</li>
      <li>, thank you RPnurtition for your fast shipment and communication with me, I really respect that and will do bsuiness with you in the future.  </li>
      <li>also prolonged sex and made me last longer, though that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me in the first place.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YIOUR MONEY!</li>
      <li>Every cloud has a silver lining though as a result of this I figured out that diet alone has the ability to clear up ED.</li>
      <li>That does not stop the company from charging what is clearly a way out of line price....</li>
      <li>you be really surprised</li>
      <li>I bought a 3-month supply directly from website.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
      <li>: It took about 8 months after getting off PHGH to return to normal and back where I was before ever taking any.</li>
      <li>Why pay 70.00 when their are offers with the same product for $50.00.  </li>

<li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
<li> : It took about 8 months after getting off PHGH to return to normal and back where I was before ever taking any.</li>
<li> Why pay 70.00 when their are offers with the same product for $50.00.  </li>
<li> did not do much for me, maybe being diabetic affected results, used entire bottle as directed saw very little difference</li>
<li> I was only on product for a month, so mabe that wasnt long enough, but</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t believe the positive reviews that some people have put down for this product !!!</li>
<li> Complete waste of time and money</li>
<li> As long as the quality of ingredients is maintained, this product works for me.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not an extreme and immediately noticeable reaction but definitely made a difference.  </li>
<li> just like it recommends evrey single day</li>
<li> I have been trying this product for the last three weeks, unfortuanately it has had no effect whatsoever, still running at the same steam I was prior to using it, wife not happy nor am I, but at 64 I suppose you have to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
<li> I thought it would have made me much harder but not really.</li>
<li> as expected..</li>
<li> Like I said, its only a waste of your money, if you dont take the product or skip</li>
<li> I take a cpl other supplements too.  </li>
<li> If you have trouble staying hard or lasting very long then scoop some up.</li>
<li> Like many of these products, PHGH is totally worthless.  </li>
<li> but as I say sadly still a short lasting floppyish cock.</li>
<li> Not sure how it would work as a remedy for impotency or other issues.  </li>
<li> waste of money just another gimmick</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Waste of my money</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> Waste of time and money</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage.</li>
<li> I had no sexual problems, just wanted to get a boost.</li>
<li> Not sure if permanent</li>
<li> I purchased this on its reviews, but I am not sure if this is for me, Snake oil.</li>
<li> recommendation: if you have no sexual issues DO NOT BUY PHGH.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s hard to ejaculate and</li>
<li> Every where from at least a .5 inch already.  </li>
<li> I can stay hard after two times but it&#x27;s impossible to finish again.</li>
<li> It is too expensive for not working.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult</li>
<li> Something wrong here.</li>
<li> I did not notice any ill side effects and seemed to help my stamina and energy before sports games too (I play hockey)</li>
<li> but I said what&#x27;s 40$ ill try it anyway .</li>
<li> What a disappointment! -</li>
<li> so what a bottle of crap.</li>
<li> Bad Product!</li>
<li> I was very disappointed with the PHGH for what it cost.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but not as I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;I use it one time daily but not perform as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely nothing. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star if that was an option. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage.</li>
    <li> This product really takes awhile to see results..Like 3-4 weeks...and even then the results were not as&lt;br /&gt;strong as expected..for example: after 3-4 weeks you WILL  have stronger libido so your desire for sex&lt;br /&gt;will be stronger. The downside is even tho you want sex,- your erections are not that stronger..&lt;br /&gt;So this product is kinda of a letdown..I was only on product for a month, so mabe that wasnt long enough, but&lt;br /&gt;if a product is good, that should be enough time??</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a difference using this product.  It added sensitivity and power to my experience.  It&#x27;s not an extreme and immediately noticeable reaction but definitely made a difference.  Of course I wasn&#x27;t in need of a pill like this so it only helped and increased my already healthy experience.  Not sure how it would work as a remedy for impotency or other issues.  I did not notice any ill side effects and seemed to help my stamina and energy before sports games too (I play hockey) but I&#x27;m not 100% on this cause I take a cpl other supplements too.  Might work better when combined with other herbal supplements.  All in all I am impressed and satisfied with the results and thankful that it is all natural.  Would not buy it if it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Works for me after about 2 weeks. Does everything that it says it does, stronger libido, stronger erections, more staying power, and more satisfying orgasms.</li>
    <li> IT WAS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT FOR THE PRICE I EXPECTED MORE,,,,REALLY NEED THREE OR 4 PILLS TO GET A GOOD RESULT</li>
    <li> Did not work at all! It is too expensive for not working. I would rather gamble the money I spent on this product as my odds are better for a better outcome!</li>
    <li> I have been doing some research on this and other products and this one is the most highly rated product out there that does not require a prescription. My problem is the pricing. You can go to their website and order 2 bottles for the same price. Something wrong here.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this product for the last three weeks, unfortuanately it has had no effect whatsoever, still running at the same steam I was prior to using it, wife not happy nor am I, but at 64 I suppose you have to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;A WARNING to all, the bottle gave a great long list of those who cannot use it, along with high blood pressure, and associated complaints,Diabetis etc, that was not told on purchase, did take them though but as I say sadly still a short lasting floppyish cock.

    <li> Complete waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Like many of these products, PHGH is totally worthless.  That does not stop the company from charging what is clearly a way out of line price....perhaps they realise as word spreads, they won&#x27;t sell many units and want to rake in as much cash as possible.  It&#x27;s amazing this sort of product makes it to the market place....live and learn...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. The product is a scam.  Would not buy this product. Do not waste your money.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I am hoping by taking the 2000mg capsules that I will start noticing more results. I just hope I can swallow the larger capsules.</li>
    <li> product does not work, you are better off going to Doctor and getting an Testosterone injection. The injections are the only thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> this PHGH is great, after 3 days of trying, I kind of like it and I am going to buy more for best result.</li>
    <li> I can say without a doubt this product works.  I am able to maintain and my spouse was also was surprised.  I have not had any reaction to this product and it works.</li>
    <li> I took the 3 month supply as directed and never felt any difference.  I have tried several with varied results and by far the best is the Hardazon sold at Amazon.  I also has the best rating at Men&#x27;s Health for effeciveness.  I was very disappointed with the PHGH for what it cost.</li>
    <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.. PRICEY BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for alittle over a month now and I love it.  People who dont see results stop taking it here and there and are not consistant with it.  Ive been taking it just like it recommends evrey single day and I see results.  Every where from at least a .5 inch already.  The bottle recommends 5-6 months and I already cant wait until I reach that. Im really excited and I thank either the RPnutrition or RLGnutrition I dont remember whichone.  However, 100% Authentic and I highly recommend this PHGH Product.....Go Falcons!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daryl&lt;br /&gt;From ATL Georia</li>
    <li> It seems to work reasonably well! It&#x27;s difficult know if it actually works. It will be interesting to see if there are long term positive results.</li>
    <li> WAST OF MONEY AND SANDER DID NOT KEEP THERE WORD.</li>
    <li> waste of money just another gimmick</li>
    <li> Waste of my money it did nothing for me, I did not see any results from this products. Try something else</li>
    <li> As long as the quality of ingredients is maintained, this product works for me. Allow some time for it to take effect</li>
    <li> I got this hoping that it would help my ed and it messed me up it made me non functional. dont even screw around with this go to go to gnc and pick up this product called Mega Men: Performance and Vitality...not only does that product work it works really well. you be really surprised</li>
    <li> Phgh worked for me, but not what I hoped for. I took it for 2 months as directed. I had no sexual problems, just wanted to get a boost. Immediately I had stronger errections and wanted sex nonstop. That&#x27;s the good news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also prolonged sex and made me last longer, though that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me in the first place. However, it honestly was negative there. I used to be able to orgasm twice back to back and then again with a 5-10min break between. After taking PHGH I have to fight to orgasm more than once and even the first is sometimes a challenge to finish. I stay errect and turned on but it&#x27;s hard to ejaculate and twice is now the max. I can stay hard after two times but it&#x27;s impossible to finish again. On PHGH the orgasms are way stronger and I noticed a good size increase in the amount of sperm and length it can be shot. However, I&#x27;d give that up to be back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been off PHGH for 5 months now and the good effects have gone away, but I still have trouble ejaculating, especially more than once. Not sure if permanent but it&#x27;s a real bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: if you have no sexual issues DO NOT BUY PHGH. If you have trouble staying hard or lasting very long then scoop some up. It works as it should, just too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It took about 8 months after getting off PHGH to return to normal and back where I was before ever taking any.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
    <li> Takes a while before it gets into your system. If I add a another enhanment  to it stars shoot from both parties</li>
    <li> Pretty good!!! I thought it would have made me much harder but not really. But it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for a year.  He has tried other products as well but the overall results he gets from PHGH is great.  It has helped the circulation throughout his whole body.  The effectiveness was noticed within the first week.  This is well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions and use this product the way your suppose to and do not stop taking it, you will see the benefits.  I think people, take the pill and think it should work automatically.  You have to keep with it and take the recommended dosage for the best benefits!! I love and obsessed with this product, thank you RPnurtition for your fast shipment and communication with me, I really respect that and will do bsuiness with you in the future.  I recommend all of you do the same.  Why pay 70.00 when their are offers with the same product for $50.00.  Like I said, its only a waste of your money, if you dont take the product or skip days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I bought a 3-month supply directly from website. Read a bunch of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; reviews before buying. Used product as directed for 2 full months.&lt;br /&gt;Result:&lt;br /&gt;1- Loss of Libido.&lt;br /&gt;2- Erections were actually &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;3- Stamina decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total product dissatisfaction. What a disappointment! - Don&#x27;t believe the company &amp; product hype (ex-Adult film star, etc). Only good marketing (website promotion, newsletter, etc). Bad Product!</li>
    <li> I should have listen to the reviews but I said what&#x27;s 40$ ill try it anyway . Well that being said and I followed the instructions I had 0 gains so what a bottle of crap. I don&#x27;t believe the positive reviews that some people have put down for this product !!! Don&#x27;t waste your money it won&#x27;t work besides I didn&#x27;t need it anyway lol</li>
    <li> tried it and found that your better off eating M&amp;M candy ! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> did not do much for me, maybe being diabetic affected results, used entire bottle as directed saw very little difference</li>
    <li> awesome product great for enhancement for men</li>
    <li> HAS NO AFFECT . DO NOT WASTE YIOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> I reordered some of this because it worked a bit and they sent me pills with mildew spots in them. I emailed pics and called them and got no response. I then mailed them back asking for a replacement and nothing. For that reason I obviously can&#x27;t recommend them. Every cloud has a silver lining though as a result of this I figured out that diet alone has the ability to clear up ED. I ditched gluten, vegetable and seed oils and dairy and I have no problems now. And I&#x27;m spending NO money :)</li>
