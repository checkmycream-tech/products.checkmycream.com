<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Oh my my newest favorite pampering tool for sure! I received this yesterday for testing purposes and I am so pleased by it&#x27;s ability to do what it says it will do. It requires 2 AA batteries (not included), it comes in a very sturdy box and included is one extra callous remover head, and a mini brush to clean off the dead skin particles left behind. It also has the wet/dry option. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend submersing it in water - but you can use in the bathtub and wash/rinse it off. In my experience with this fabulous pampering tool, I found it easy to use, and very successful at smoothing my feet quickly. The little head spins around as it&#x27;s placed against the foot, and it spins rather quickly - allowing for some serious dead skin removal. In my opinion this will not cause harm to your skin unless of course you held it on the same spot until - the battery&#x27;s went dead. However with common sense that wouldn&#x27;t be needed. It does it&#x27;s job well and I have already recommended this to my friend whom is always complaining about how sand paper&#x27;y her feet feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Note this product and it&#x27;s effect on my body may differ from another while using.</li>
    <li> Wet/Dry callous remover works better when there are fresh batterys in.  Easy to hold and feels great when working on your feet. No extra skin shaving all over the house.  Very easy to clean and change out the rollers.  Doesn&#x27;t cut into your skin in a painful way. Would highly recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this a good try before I reviewed it. I found out the hard way that rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t work, and if I could take just half a star for that. I would. Other than that problem though? I have to say I don&#x27;t really have any complaints! The callous/callus remover works VERY well, but be careful not to press too hard or hold it in one spot too long. The friction can hurt a bit, but that happens with anything like this.&lt;br /&gt;My S/O has... well I should say HAD really gross callouses on his big toes, they were so bad and so hard I was worried I was going to have to CUT them off just to get rid of them. Until I came across this product, which I was thankfully sent one in order to try and review. So very happy for that!&lt;br /&gt;I used it on myself as well, it comes with two heads so I use one for me and one for him. My callouses weren&#x27;t as bad, so I didn&#x27;t take pictures of them.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the only real relief I have ever had in treating the pain caused by callous build-up on the bottom of my feet. I will never be without this tool again!!!!!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:be99f2cf47ae3b0b020f0daf3c7290d6]] I already own a similar callus remover of similar construction and I like it a lot. When I got an offer to review this one I gladly accepted so I would have a spare. I had high hopes for this one, but unfortunately it was a total disappointment. My unit did not work at all. It just did not turn on when I put in batteries (and I tried three different sets). The battery compartment is misaligned. It is so purely constructed that in order to get my batteries out I had to use pliers. The orientation of the batteries is marked on the holder, so I am sure I had them inserted correctly, but the fit is so tight it did made proper contact no matter how hard I push them in and how many different fresh batteries I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are wondering if all callus removers of this construction are the same and just branded under different names... I discovered they are not the same. The grinding rollers from this callus remover did not not fit my other callus remover, they have a slightly different construction and did not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I provided by Life&#x27;s Best. This callus remover was a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> if i could give this more than five stars, i absolutely would.&lt;br /&gt;i have one of those PedEggs, which works just fine for me, since my feet aren&#x27;t in that bad a shape. however my husband probably has the most disgusting feet i&#x27;ve ever seen. so bad that we&#x27;ve been trying to look for a doctor that would take our insurance so we can get him looked at.&lt;br /&gt;i sat him down, and turned this bad boy on his feet, and he just sat back and relaxed like he was getting a massage. he said it tickled at first (it tickled me, too), but then it just felt really good. after a while, i was able to feel smooth skin. i asked him if he could ever recall his feet being considered smooth, and he laughed and said no. i must have worked at least half an hour for each foot. i did the ankle bones, up and down the bottom of the feet, and the sides. the ONLY time it hurt was when i accidentally dinged him on the tip of his pinky toe.&lt;br /&gt;be warned, that if you have really bad feet, you&#x27;re going to want to put a towel down. i didn&#x27;t realize how much STUFF was going to come off of him lol. when i sent him to clean up, he came back in the room saying, i feel like i just got a pedicure! i&#x27;m going to rub lotion on them, and probably do it all over again in a day or two. i&#x27;m hoping this helps his feet. we are absolutely amazed with this product!&lt;br /&gt;Sample was provided for free for testing and reviewing purposes. No compensation was given for a review.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I went ahead and purchased my husband his own, and his feet have never looked better. I use mine once a week or so, since I&#x27;m on my feet all day, and it helps keep them feeling healthy. I have yet to have to replace the head or battery.</li>
    <li> This thing is fun.  I know it isn&#x27;t intended to be fun but just ask my feet....  they love it.  We are coming off a harsh winter here so my feet haven&#x27;t seen sandals in at least six months.  That&#x27;s when the real callouses will form.  Nevertheless, they&#x27;re feet which means that there is always some tough skin in spots.  I used this on my heels and up near my big toe and from the looks of the dust pile I accumulated, this thing was doing a pretty good job of taking off the dead weight.  It is absolutely painless and as I said, its fun.  I started to get carried away....  I wanted to see what else I could sand down.  I ran it up and down my leg a few times and watched the dry skin go up in dust.  I held it to my face (kids, don&#x27;t try this at home) just to see what it would do and how it would feel.  It is oh so gentle.  As I was testing it on different body parts one of my nails splintered awkwardly.  I put the callous remover on the job.  Ahhh.... not so well suited to nails.  That&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s not supposed to be suited to anything but feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, how does it work?  I am not sure it turned my foot as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind, but it did make a noticeable difference.  It smoothed things out and took off all those little dead skin snaggy things that heels are prone to.  I would say this works at least as well as some of the pedicure equipment from your local nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes packages very well with two grinding heads (so you and your partner don&#x27;t have to share dead skin cells - yuck.... I hardly want to share my own) and a cover as well as a little brush to clean the dead skin cell dust from the grinding head.  It is all very easy and satisfying to use.  As I said, I&#x27;ve been playing with it kind of non stop.  I should note that I received this as a free review sample but I would definitely pay to own it.  It&#x27;s a fantastic little gadget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  I have no hesitation highly recommending this little callous remover.  It is powerful without being in any way painful, and it gets the job doneul without being in any way painful, and it gets the job done</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised with the results! My feet were dry and had small calluses, which it removed with no issue. That is not what is so impressive though, my husband was intrigued after he saw me use it, so he wanted to try also. He has nightmare feet, and that is no exaggeration.. He has calluses everywhere, hard spots on the outside parts of his toes, and his skin feels like sandpaper all over from the boots he has to wear for his work. After we did one foot, we were so amazed that there was a normal foot underneath all the digustingness, that we took a before and after picture of the second foot we worked on. As you can see, this little callus remover is tough! It didnt have any trouble removing the hard callus thing on his toe. We are beyond excited to have had the opportunity to review this product, as it is great quality. Would recommend to anyone needing softer feet.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c90fa109e5926efcdf2fea376ca3f042]]My family takes care of our feet but most of the tools we were using are old fashioned. This new foot pedicure tool helps you remove calluses, rough patches of skin on your foot and smooth those areas out quickly and easily. This tool does a great job of helping you take care of your feet and making them healthier and better looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in the box?&lt;br /&gt;* The pedicure tool itself&lt;br /&gt;* A grinding head&lt;br /&gt;* A replacement grinding head&lt;br /&gt;* A cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;* A plastic safety cover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent tool and the key is to use minimal pressure and short timed strokes to remove the rough and callused areas of your foot. It is amazing at how much skin it removes quickly.  Don&#x27;t grind too long as you may take off more than you need or want too.  It is better to make several passes. Remember, the calluses didn&#x27;t form in one day so don&#x27;t try to get rid of them in 5 minutes. The tool quickly removes dead skin using light and quick passes of the grinding tool. If you press too hard it will stop the motor but that is a safety precaution. Make sure that you use it on dry skin as it works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my video I show how to clean the machine and how to remove the grinding heads and change them. My wife loves the product and since she is just about to start wearing her summer shoes this helps her to get the ready for the showing! The tool is nicely designed and it is pink in color. It also has a safety switch to turn it on so that you have to press down and then slide up or down to turn it off or on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that we use a lot of eneloop rechargeable batteries in our home and they would not fit into the machine.  As a matter of a fact my wife had jammed them into the machine and I had to use a pair of pliers to remove the batteries as they were stuck very tightly.  A set of Alkaline batteries (Not supplied) fit into the machine but tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product and I rated it at 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation. A review was not promised to the supplier in exchange for the sample but I stated that if I provided a review that it would be fair and honest.e for test and evaluation.

    <li> Works as promised, just make sure you don&#x27;t put too much pressure as your using it, the roller will stop...</li>
    <li> I have been looking into buying one of these and was very lucky to receive one free to try and review! I am a very active person and usually use a pumice stone on my feet every time I shower. It&#x27;s very hard to get around my toes and I am never able to get all the dead skin with my pumice stone. Not to mention how hard it is to stand while sawing back and forth. But not anymore! This callous remover is awesome! Just turn it on and let it do the work! It was also easy for me to use around my toes and toenails. When I first got it, I did have a little trouble getting it to turn on but emailed the supplier and got a prompt response. It just ended up being that the batteries weren&#x27;t touching both posts. Easy fix :)</li>
    <li> This product is better than I expected. It is easy to use and works as described. I have used dry and in the shower and it works well both ways. My feet feel wonderful!</li>
    <li> motor not strong enough</li>
    <li> I have thick calluses on my hands that dry and crack. This shaves em down painlessly and quickly. I tried to make it hurt and I had to press pretty hard to the point of stalling the tool. Unless I was down near the skin it did not really hurt. One note is it produces a lot of skin flakes real fast that can serve as food for dust mites so use it outside or in the shower but NOT while showering/bathing. You will ruin it if you get it wet enough. You CAN rinse the grinder head off with running water.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good callus remover. I got it in the mail yesterday and I decided to use it right away and washed my foot and dried it as said in the direction then begin to go to work. It takes quite a few times to actually get the dead skin off, however it does get a job done. This is made with a very good quality and has two different rollers to use on your feet. One of them seems to be a little more prikoli than the other one so you can choose which roller to you according to how sensitive your skin is. I love the fact that this seller shipped so quickly and I got my item on time and undamaged. I would definitely recommend this callus remover to anyone. I was able to try this out at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review. All opinions are my own and I&#x27;m pleased with this callus remover. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Okay so I normally do not leave feed back however, I love love this product. I just got my callus remover,  it is nice to look at and most important it works awesome. My feet crack on the heels and side of my toes from always wearing flip flops, this product made them soft and clear of them ugly cracks. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Works great on the lighter calluses.</li>
    <li> great for keeping my heels smooth</li>
    <li> I received this callus remover via other means. But I absolutely LOVE it. I am always trying to make time in my busy schedule to go get a pedicure, but never have enough time to do so. I always get dry skin, calluses, and etc but with this callus remover I never have to worry about getting embarrassed about how bad my feet look before I can make it back to the nail salon. Definitely recommend this product to anyone who is like me and just doesn&#x27;t have the time to get to the nail salon every time their feet look like elephant skin.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried when I ordered this. But wow! This is the smartest home care tool! I live in southern California and ware sandles most the year. My poor feet look horible. I get grossed out by the communal foot baths at the pedicure shops. I have used the faithful pumas stone, even the egg shaped scraper.....not anymore. very easy to use. End results are what matter. My heels look great! Quick and easy....and no nasty shared feet tubs for me! For what I pay for just one pedicure, this should last long time.</li>
    <li> I have tried several callus removers and none of them compare to this one. It is way better than the one that Walmart has currently. My feet tend to be dry and I get a lot of calluses. Especially closer towards Spring and Summer. I&#x27;m walking and running a lot more. I have used this remover roughly 3 or 4 times and I can really tell the difference. My feet are a lot more smooth. I have been using a moisturizer after I use the remover and it is working wonders. I don&#x27;t have those cracks or big rough spots anymore. This callus remover requires no effort at all. It really does all the work for you. Unlike other removers that I have owed, this remover does not stop or slow down when as you press down. It fits great in your hand and it feels really comfortable. I did get this product for free in exchange for my honest review. And overall, I am extremely happy with it. It really does work better than all of my others. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Feels safe. Feet feel great.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power.  Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing! I have really horrible looking feet, within two days of using a pumice stone in the shower and using the Life&#x27;s Best Electronic Callus Remover, my feet are ready for the sun and the sand. This product works very well with only two double A batteries, This product relieves any dry, dead, or ugly skin from your feet, leaving them feeling smooth and looking great! I would definitely recommend this product to all of my friends, my mother has already asked to borrow it. Thank you Life&#x27;s Best for making such an amazing product. My favorite part is that its portable and I can take it anywhere I go.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Life’s Best Callus Remover about a month ago and I absolutely love it.  I have the world’s worst calluses and have been working on getting rid of them for years.  I’ve had foot surgery in the past and that creates imbalances on the feet which creates calluses.  I’ve had my foot doctor shave them off with a razor blade.  I’ve spent many dollars on pedicures in an effort to get rid of the calluses.  I’ve bought inexpensive and expensive callus removers.  I even resorted to buying sandpaper blocks in all grits in an effort to remove them.  Nothing works as effectively as this callus remover.  It’s easy, I don’t have to continually spend money or sweat equity (when I sand my calluses!) to get a better result.  I’d highly recommend this to my daughter, my sisters, and my friends.  I&#x27;m definitely a Life&#x27;s Best Callus Remover convert.</li>
    <li> This is nice. I have used a lot of other products for feet, and this is good and it does work.</li>
    <li> I have used it a few times. So far it works beautifully. I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am glad I made this purchase. It works as expected and does a great job. So much easier that using a razor remover. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> You get it all with the Life&#x27;s Best Electronic Callus Remover. Easy to clean, replaceable blades, comfortable handle and it&#x27;s cordless. Give yourself a professional pedicure and get rid of that ugly calloused skin. Just as the description says, the Life&#x27;s Best Electronic Callus Remover you get a fast and effective pedicure without the salon price tag. Literally pays for itself in just one or two uses!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife, as she has rough calluses on her feet and gets tired of filing them manually.  A couple passes with this baby and her feet are smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  Happy wife, happy life!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely amazing!  Very well made little rotating sander for rough calloused tootsies, and it comes with a spare drum.  I was actually kind of surprised at the amount of powder this thing sanded off my heels - make sure you use it over a sheet of newspaper or paper towel to keep from having to vac the floor.  (And obviously, you don&#x27;t want to sand too deeply at one time - space the sessions every couple of days or you&#x27;ll make your feet sore.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is very nice to find a product that actually does what it claims.  The first one of these things that I tried (different seller/different brand) would not even turn on.</li>
    <li> Product did not turn on or work at all</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long, but it did an amazing job. My feet look fabulous.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy myself things that I call a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34;  item, but boy am I ever GLAD I got THIS! ! ALWAYS have had extremely HARD calluses on the side off the big toe, base of pinky toe &amp; balls of the feet. Not so much on the heel area, so these areas are probably caused by ill fitting shoes. I NEVER can find shoes that really fit right!  Going for professional peddies are both expensive and time consuming. I thought I would give this a try since &amp;#34;filing&amp;#34; these down took forever and seemed like I was needing to do it almost on a daily basis. This thing IS THE bomb! ! In a GREAT WAY! ! It takes so little time, absolutely NO pain, is simple to use, relaxing and I have NEVER had such soft feet from a professional peddie, even when they would use what I call &amp;#34;the cheese grater &amp;#34; ! Ladies and men alike would be amazed at how great this works! ! My feet are baby soft even in what are usually hard to get to areas. I bought it for my wife and she has NEVER been happier!  She says her shoes hurt so MUCH less having those callouses GONE! ! Believe my wife, the price was great, shipping 2 days as promised, and you WILL NOT regret this purchase if calluses are hurting your feet! This is a 5 star, but she says it&#x27;s a 10! She will be getting another!  It&#x27;s made durable and IF YOU ladies had to sell them, they&#x27;d go over better than ANY Tupperware party you&#x27;ve ever been to. Rarely write reviews, but now her feet don&#x27;t hurt so that&#x27;s SO worth it !!</li>
    <li> These are the best help for feet. I love it. I have used it several times, no drawbacks. Get it, makes it easier.</li>
    <li> I love this it works better than a pedicure!!!</li>
    <li> They all seem to work about the same.</li>
    <li> Works great!!!  I get a pedicure once a month - but I also wear sandals almost every day - so my poor pedicurist breaks a sweat trying to smooth out my feet.  She will be so surprised when I next see her!!  This product is easy to use and does everything it claims to do.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!!!</li>
    <li> This is a nifty device. It is like a file for your heels without the need for manpower LOL. No need to buff and smooth it out manually with this. Just turn it on an go. You do have to be careful not to leave it in the same area for a long time and do not press too hard. I prefer to use it on dry heels vs wet. It needs 2 AA batteries which does not come with the device. There is a replacement head and a guard to use when not in use. If you are in need of something to remove or soften your rough spots on your feet, I think this is a good device to try out. You will not get brand new baby feet, but it will remove those dry and rough spots. One more thing, very important to moisturize after as to prevent it from reoccurring so quickly. Remember to not press too hard and slow and steady will get the best results. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts, opinions or experiences.</li>
    <li> Never worked...returned</li>
    <li> works great ,make sure you read the directions first, guess it works better than I hoped for. didn&#x27;t read the directions and dug a hole in my foot</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. The customer service is even better. Thanks so much Lydia for all you did.</li>
    <li> I love it...Bought one for my daughter-in-law!</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware!  If you buy, it,prepare for a plethora of very, very long-winded, chatty, gushing emails from the alleged owner/inventor!  I received two such emails of a page+ each from her before I even received the product!  The first one was annoying, but I chose to roll my eyes and overlook it.  The second one was just too much,  A page each of trying to convince the buyer that it is the best invention since sliced bread and, rather pathetically, all but begging for a review, preferably 5 star, thank you.  I asked to unsubscribe to the email list after responding to the alleged owner.  In the process Amazon lost all or most of my trust by their sharing the email address (private data) and allowing this annoying process.  So annoyed, I have yet to open the product after finally receiving it yesterday I may just send it back and buy the PedEgg equivalent locally.</li>
    <li> WOW I love being a “HERO” in my wife’s eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this Callous Remover wonder tool for my wife, and now I am a Hero.  My wife does not have time to make it to a salon to get a pedicure, so this little wonder when used properly solved that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This callous remover tool is powerful enough to rub of the dead skin, but gentle enough to perform well.  Do not press down too hard or you will stop the roller and possibly injure your skin.  Just use a light touch and make a few passes over your foot and you will see the dead skin collecting in the roller head, but also you might want to use this over a towel so you do not make a mess, and you can also use this in the shower or tub because it is a wet / dry tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife shares a lot with me, however after over 25 years of marriage, she will not be sharing her callous dead skin Remover with me, and so I will be buying my own.  I also see this as a nice gift for our whole family!&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a clear cap to protect the roller when not in use, and also comes with an extra roller, and a small cleaning brush, and I seen how well the brushed worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to have two AA Batteries when your Callous Remover arrives, my wife has been using this Callous Remover wonder for over two weeks, and we do not see it draining the batteries yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife says I am her Hero for thinking of her when I find a product that makes her life easier.  But truly she is my Hero !!  Thank you Life’s Best Callous Remover for this product</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today.  An awesome tool!!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> As advertised,  quick shipment, works great.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today and it is awsome. I&#x27;m so glad I had got this one. It does exactly what it suppose to do. I work in a shop and stand on my feet all day and it did wonders for my feet. I will ALWAYS use this forever now that I have been introduced to this great product.</li>
    <li> I was so exited to get this callus remover, it works perfectly for my feet. I&#x27;m glad I got it before the summer.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this product as I have used several different products to smooth my rough callused feet, this Callus Remover is absolutely AMAZING!!!! I used it on myself as soon as I received it and cant imagine using anything else! My husband is a Vet and has very rough heels due to the boots they wore everyday, especially in the conditions overseas, he is in LOVE with this product and speaks very highly of it! I think I&#x27;m going to have to get him a blue one LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, very well worth it! BEST callus remover and foot smoothing product I have EVER used (including professional nail salons-pedicures)!</li>
    <li> It works fantastic. Works on my corns as well as dry skin. Got one for my mother too!</li>
    <li> best thing for ones feet. I had lots of dry skin and product removed it quickly. I would recommend this product for anyone</li>
    <li> Works well and gets my feet smooth.  Only thing I would like to see is if there was a guard or a catcher to prevent the dry skin from flying all over.</li>
    <li> Effective, easy to use</li>
    <li> Love it...just wish I had gotten the electric one.</li>
    <li> Even though I get regular pedicures, I&#x27;m a barefoot gal and it does not take long for my feet to start getting rough with calluses. So when this little item arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. It does exactly what it says it will do. I was surprised at the amount of dry skin it removed from my feet and around my toes. In less than five minutes, my feet were smooth and callus free. Great little Item and worth the money.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this and it works great. I have dry cracked feet with callous heels.Now my feet look soft and sexy.Handles easily while using.Its lightweight and cleans easily.I never thought my feet could look so nice.My daughter seen me using it and seen the results. Now she wants one too.Great Product! I would recommend this to anybody with callous dry cracked feet even men.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are impressed. We hope it lasts a long time</li>
    <li> This callus remover is amazing! It is tough enough to remove my calluses and gentle enough to remove dry skin from my 6 year olds feet (we are at the pool 7 days a week) Customer service is also amazing, the seller had contacted me twice now to make sure that if I have any issues (I haven&#x27;t) to let her know and she will fix it. Get it!!</li>
    <li> I love my new Callus Remover by Life&#x27;s Best. I am on my feet 18 hours a day being a nurses aid at a nursing home and give showers 2 hours out of the 18 hours. I have rough dry skin and calluses on the outside of my feet and no matter what I do they come back. My husband works in construction and we both have nasty feet. I used it on him first and it was so easy just turn it on and let the magic begin. I used it on my heels and the sides of my feet I just buffed them out and now my feet and my husbands feet are baby soft! It&#x27;s waterproof and fits in my palm of my hand perfect! I received this gift for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This item made my feet look nice again!  The emails from the company are annoying, either unsubscribe right away or mark it as spam so you won&#x27;t get bombarded with their emails.  I am seriously considering purchasing this for my sister and mother.</li>
    <li> Unless you press really hard, this little tool will run over the most rough and cracked heels! In the summer I wear sandals a lot, and my feet crack and peel. Just using lotion doesn&#x27;t do the job. But this thing really works. As a guy, I would have preferred a different color... but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay 3 more bucks for the Blue one. (it&#x27;s a guy thing)  This is the one to buy if you want a strong little foot sander.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations given the reviews that battery operated callus removers get in general, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the device will stop if too much pressure is exerted but honestly you could do some real damage if it didn&#x27;t. I used it on dry feet and found that working from several different angles produced the best results. Plan to spend some time if your feet are badly callused but it will be worth it!</li>
    <li> Love this! I was surprised on how it worked. My feet have bad callouses bc of me wearing flip flops and sandals constantly. It comes in a convenient box as well as a little brush to help clean it. I was provided this product for a review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have tried 2 other foot files which were similar to this one and didn&#x27;t have much luck. This Callus Remover is constructed well and seems of very high quality. It even came with an extra roller which the others we tried didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both have really rough feet which are also very sensitive. I almost couldn&#x27;t use some of the other foot files we tried because of how sensitive my feet are. This one actually feels great when I use it and doesn&#x27;t tickle my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no pain associated with using this. I am also diabetic and having dry, cracked feet was always a concern to me. After using this today, my feet are not only smooth but the FEEL GREAT! Especially after following the advice to put some lotion on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with this product and will not be buying any other foot files other than this (and from this seller to!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller also provides very good support and even sent me an email with some tips on how to get the most out of the Callus Remover. Very helpful and some great tips also.</li>
    <li> Very good quality product, and easy to use. Most importantly it does not hurt and is very gentle on the skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have super sensitive feet, and whenever I get a pedicure it is very uncomfortable for me when they scrub my feet with the file. I love how this product works effectively in removing my callouses on my feet without my feet getting ticklish. The Life&#x27;s Best Callous Remover is very powerful and effective, making my heels very smooth and soft. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Shorted out or something about 2 months after purchase, very displeased, also ran through batteries at an alarming rate. Recommend getting one of the charging ones if you don&#x27;t want to pay a lot for batteries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week but it&#x27;s doing a great job.  When I first took it out of the box and put the batteries in it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I emailed Lydia and explained what I&#x27;d done and asked if there was a trick or had I received a faulty unit.  Lydia wrote back right away with a couple suggestions on how to insert the batteries and she was right.  Her first suggestion worked and I appreciate such a quick response.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as needed and do recommend it.</li>
    <li> This unit does not perform well. I should have sent it back. It stops working at the slightest pressure.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Keeps my feet smooth and looking nice in my sandals.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:e9c675e2a16c1ce80b917d17316b71b]] i have been using callus removers from a long time and they are some really cool stuff to own. they work great on your dry feet and are very gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;this one comes with extra head and a cleaning brush. the quality is very good and does the work great. its very easy to use and clean. just run under water and its done.&lt;br /&gt;life has become so easy with this gadget. no more embarrassing dry heels which you need to hide. it just takes 2 minutes and you have clean feet again.&lt;br /&gt;i received this for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Really fast and gentle - like  it very much.</li>
    <li> With a toddler at home, I rarely get &amp;#34;Me&amp;#34; time. One of results is cracked heels. I started wearing socks whenever I go to the family events or gathering and have to leave the shoes at the door because I did not want anyone to see my cracked heels. But not any one. Now I can show off my brand new feet with no cracked heel. I am using Life&#x27;s best callus remover for my feet and it is working great.&lt;br /&gt;This is a such an amazing callus remover product. It comes in a box with a callus removing device with a head on it, an extra head and a brush to clean the head after use. The device is in pink and white color. Perfect combination for any woman. It takes 2 AA batteries which are not included in the box.&lt;br /&gt;To use the device turn the cap on the bottom of the device and take the whole cap out, add batteries,close and turn the cap back. There is a pink button to turn on/off the device. I have used the callus remover on my both feet and now I feel my heels are so soft and smooth. Using the callus remover is not harmful to your skin. It is all safe and works faster. It removers the callus, corns and all dry/dead skin. It can be used on dry and wet skin. When you are done use the brush to clean it off.&lt;br /&gt;You can take this callus remover with you any where. I wish I had found this product before. I remember that my heels used to stuck on my bed sheet at night due to callus. I am impressed with the performance of Life&#x27;s best Callus remover.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it due the its performance. It gives you result instantly. Also the shipping is really fast.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to get the callus remover on a promotional discount in exchange of an unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;(I have before ,after and during use photos)</li>
    <li> I must say i was skeptical about this item but with much success it was really good buy the&lt;br /&gt;Callus Remover not only removed and smoothed out my callus i used it on the rest of my foot and it made my feet baby smooth i would recommend this item to friends i really liked it  great job thank you</li>
    <li> This file is not electric but battery operated. It does file but with very little power. I returned this item.</li>
    <li> This is a great callus remover, it is not only fast and effective but is cordless and provides a very comfortable experience. The Quartz and mineral grinding help reduce the overall time required to remove the calluses.  Great Product and Great Price</li>
    <li> Since I love to wear sandals my feet take on a lot more exposure making them dry and rough.  This compact callus remover makes it easier to smooth my dead skin and I&#x27;m sandal ready and my feet look great!  The one I have now has a long handle and this one fits perfect in my traveling bag allowing me to take it along on  my trips.  Love the design!</li>
    <li> Love it, good price and works well .&lt;br /&gt;Have suffered for years with very hard skin around heels and toes ,this works great&lt;br /&gt;use it 2-3 times a week at the beginning and now only need to use it once a week&lt;br /&gt;to keep my skin nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Now have great feet for my vacation!</li>
    <li> These things work great.  Have one in night stand, living room and bathroom.  I&#x27;m addicted to smooth feet!!!</li>
    <li> I like the callus remover.  Much easier way to remove calluses.</li>
    <li> This works well to smooth out your feet, and take down calluses.  However it will not remove them completely.  But great add on to foot care between pedis.</li>
    <li> Saints be praised! My wife is the prettiest woman I know and I have to admit that I was a bit nervous to give her Life&#x27;s Best Callus Remover... but, I did and it&#x27;s done. To my sweet surprise this little tribute has been the gift of gifts. I told her that I was aware of her devotion to her feet (due in part to the Pedicure bill) and simply wanted her to bask in moments of divine leisure. The woman has raved over the simplicity and ease that this little tool offers and has used it to pamper herself again and again. Needless to say, I am constantly rewarded with her devotion and praise for being a sensitive fellow who knows his wife.&lt;br /&gt;One visit to any salon that offers the service this Callus Remover provides and you&#x27;ve paid for it. As I see it, Life&#x27;s Best Products lives up to its name. I, for one, am a believer! Great product and an awesome return on investment. Thanks Life&#x27;s Best Products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wade C.</li>
    <li> I love my new Life&#x27;s Best Callus Remover! I had never realized what I&#x27;d been missing out on until I first tried it. I never had a problem with dry skin when I was younger. But, the older I&#x27;ve gotten the more dry skin seems to appear around the edges of my feet and heels. It was embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;As I look back it&#x27;s sort of funny, I told my husband how much I wanted something to help with this issue. Well, to my surprise, I came home one day and he had the Life&#x27;s Best Callus Remover laying on the bed for me! I immediately found some batteries and started to read the instruction guide... it was so simple to figure out and just as easy to clean with the neat little brush that comes in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;The Callus Remover did just that, it took away the dead skin and my feet were much smoother. I was no longer embarrassed to be seen in an open shoe!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have time to go to a fancy nail salon every week, much less pay money every time my feet feel dry. I can use the Callus Remover whenever I want in the privacy of my own home. Thank you Life&#x27;s Best Products for my smooth feet and the ability to wear all my shoes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara C.</li>
    <li> I love it! So easy to use.</li>
    <li> It was a gift to my daughter and she loves it. Her feet were like sandpaper and now they are soft !!!!!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:2d567cafbd6a8421a81f96f44e57c9b3]]Wet or dry this is the best thing I have found to remove those dry patches and callouses or just to get a little of the dry skin off to keep you feet feeling and looking great no matter what time of year.  It comes with instructions and an extra file and a brush to clean it.  If your anything like me you enjoy soft smooth feet that don&#x27;t grab at you r socks or pantyhose.  I like how my look in my sandals and intend to keep them that way. Thank you for the chance to try and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Being a Diabetic I have to look after my feet to make sure that any issues are spotted early. This nifty little tool is just what I needed - every night before bed I use this to leave my feet feeling nice and smooth - this routine also means I am checking my feet daily for any signs of problems caused by the diabetes. It&#x27;s comfortable and pain free to use and takes just a few minutes if you do it regularly.</li>
    <li> I just love my new Life&#x27;s Best Callus Remover! I was given this callus shaver as a gift, and used it as soon as I got it.  I could not believe how&lt;br /&gt;easy it was to use. I could feel the difference immediately after using this great product.  My feet were softer and had a fresh&lt;br /&gt;feeling to them.  I have had to use it a few more times to get all the dead skin off, but wow...what a difference.  I just love my feet now.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great concept, great price.  I will definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
