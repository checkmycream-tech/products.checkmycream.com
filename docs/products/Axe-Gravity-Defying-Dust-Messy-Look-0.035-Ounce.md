### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe there&#x27;s a super-secret method for using this to its best effect, my experiences however have me sticking to the paste (</li>
      <li>, this stuff is great!</li>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>Axe products are my favourite as they work great and smell great as well.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>Once it is applied to the hair, it stays on fairly put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a great scent not to over powerering but nice for it to be notice.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>It does smell good, but you need to make sure you give your hair a good tousle</li>
      <li>Defying Dust is just an incredibly amazing product.</li>
      <li>As for hold, I don&#x27;t think it is effective</li>
      <li>kind of didn&#x27;t do anything to his head of hair.  </li>
      <li>That worked much more effectively.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Women love the results, as do seniors.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mysterious and awesome.  </li>
      <li>Try it and some of you will love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an interesting product.</li>
      <li>THIS MAGIC</li>
      <li>It is way better and more convenient than this or the jarred stuff.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t disregard this product since many find it useful, and Axe puts out great products, it just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
      <li>dust is unique and is very easy to use with.</li>
      <li>It has good hold and keeps the style he wants.  </li>
      <li>I have o say that this made my hair look fuller as well as easy to manage.</li>
      <li>So, not so easy to use as the paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I could easily hand style my hair during that period, but would have needed to replenish the dust thereafter.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair strongly either.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing that way.</li>
      <li>Do NOT freak out, just grab a brush, and you will be fine, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a fine dust that you shake into your hair and shape it or thicken it.</li>
      <li>Then use it and enjoy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that given the impression that you have dust or dandruff in your hair, was not the intention.</li>
      <li>They look best when they are more natural but not real</li>
      <li>/&gt;Certainly, the Axe products are marketed to guy&#x27;s  in the 15 to 25 range, but It may well be of greater value to those who are more mature.  </li>
      <li>It reacts with your natural scalp oils and creates this amazing hold that lasts well over a day.</li>
      <li>Really cool.  </li>
      <li>Of course it being what it is, you won&#x27;t be able to rock a greasy pompadour with this stuff, but it&#x27;s sure strong enough to hold one a mile high!</li>
      <li>When used right, this stuff can make a guy&#x27;s hair look really cool.  </li>
      <li>or you work out a lot, so you actually need to wash your hair more frequently, this product is a pretty good compromise.</li>
      <li>Amazing INSTANT results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is great for the messy look but it also helps to absorb excess oil.  </li>
      <li>Worth a consideration.</li>
      <li>love all those young guys in my life: my son, my daughters&#x27; boyfriends, son-in-law, and all the friends.  </li>
      <li>, then this is the right product for you.</li>
      <li>If you have never used hair dust or hair powder, you may find this product kind of strange.</li>
      <li>My son, super cool 11 year old that he is, loves hair products.</li>
      <li>Pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He especially loves Axe products and we have tried most of them.</li>
      <li>It does exactly</li>
      <li>This product works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a similar product by [[ASIN:B000VZM09S Aveda]], which I love.</li>
      <li>In application, it&#x27;s kind of like that powdered dry shampoo, without being so much like talcum powder.</li>
      <li>I rubbed it in to my roots and it made my hair look more \\&quot;matte\\&quot; and maybe gave me a little volume, but if I wanted these things I think I&#x27;d probably try a different product that is easier to use and a better value!</li>
      <li>That was the biggest positive about it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a new generation and with the new generation, new and better things come to the surface.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a good product but not a great product...too much effort to use and clean up after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;3/5 for him.</li>
      <li>It seems to work as more of a dry shampoo, removing oils from my hair, than a styling product.  </li>
      <li>Plenty went into the air around me (based on the dust I saw in the sunlight streaming in the window), but some certainly went on my hair.</li>
      <li>&quot; my head doesn&#x27;t seem smart, as it&#x27;s an abrasive and shouldn&#x27;t get in the eyes.</li>
      <li>My wife, just for kicks, tried it in her fine curly blonde hair; it didn&#x27;t look like it did anything.</li>
      <li>It does not say how much to use which may be part of the problem.  </li>
      <li>No fragrance, very small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What is did do, is give it a bizarre plastic, glue, gross feeling.</li>
      <li>It messes up his hair (and not in the way he wants) and it messes up our bathroom counter when he has an OOPS moment.</li>
      <li>Of course, the Aveda product costs about 3 times as much as this one.</li>
      <li>How much should I use?</li>
      <li>The dust from this container is much lighter weight than that powder.</li>
      <li>it does sticky up the dryness of the hair, but maybe I&#x27;m using too much since it looks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely very sticky and holds up hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it just didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all to change the look of his hair.</li>
      <li>may well be the Hollywood Secret that you will only mention to your BEST friends.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is tiny, just make sure you spread it out on your hands instead of directly applying it on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unique, affordable and essential.</li>
      <li>When you get it on your hands, you have to take extra care to clean it</li>
      <li>I like my hair best about 2-3 days after a shampoo, when it&#x27;s a little heavier and less fluffy than freshly washed, with just enough oil to make it look good but not enough to make it look flat or greasy.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really neat, no messy gels or creams that get all over everything, and it doesn&#x27;t harden or flake, so restyling or re-combing throughout the day doesn&#x27;t ruin the hold.</li>
      <li>dust particles come out as soft and goes on very sticky.</li>
      <li>Then we figured out that baby powder would pretty much do the same thing.</li>
      <li>, the end result isn&#x27;t as nice as the Messy Look paste, which, when the hair dries, doesn&#x27;t feel like any product is actually in there.</li>
      <li>This powder has the exact opposite properties compared to graphite.  </li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>As at least one other reviewer mentioned, this is more effective as a dry shampoo than as a styling aid.  </li>
      <li>Just apply (shake it) on your DRY hair and spread the fine powder out using your ten fingers</li>
      <li>My son, along with other guys, can make their hair look really cool.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure the right style of hair for this product, but medium-long isn&#x27;t the right one.  </li>
      <li>I can get a few good styles by using just a little bit.</li>
      <li>The dust comes out practically clear, like pixie dust.</li>
      <li>This one is by far his least favorite.</li>
      <li>early 80&#x27;s</li>
      <li>that would take day old hair and kinda \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; it.</li>
      <li>My teenager seems to have developed a cowlick on the front of his head from his winter caps.  </li>
      <li>Which he does fairly frequently.</li>
      <li>and it makes the hair look really natural.</li>
      <li>I gave my husband this to try and he was kind of confused.  </li>
      <li>My hair, which is less fine (also less present), seemed to be better suited for the product, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll be dusting my hair again in the future.</li>
      <li>First of all, if \\&quot;messy\\&quot; is the look you&#x27;re going for, this is a contender, but it might not be worth the mess in the bigger sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Magic in a small bottle!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Drawback: touching your hair after you put it on is pretty creepy.</li>
      <li>product requires a little work on your behalf, but it is better than slicking your hair with gels, which I know dry out your hair.</li>
      <li>I got this for my son to try out as he is a high school student and is constantly on the go...especially in the AM when he has to get on to his bus at 6.45am.  </li>
      <li>SO I was interested in trying this new Axe product on my 13 yr old grandson&#x27;s messy look</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Allergic problems with me.  If your skin is sensitive.......beware.</li>
    <li> If you only use the messy gel, this may have happened to you. If your hair is wet, the gel tends to stay longer, but not in the shape that you want it to. This fix that problem and it makes the hair look really natural. Try it and some of you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it is kind of weird. Like dust. And it will leave your head feeling a tad sticky, but it is a weird sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> My son has used every product Axe makes and is looking forward to making this a part of his grooming routine.  This is something a bit different from the usual styling product bit it definitely works.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product. It is a fine dust that you shake into your hair and shape it or thicken it. I&#x27;ve seen some other reviews that say it is for giving a \\&quot;dusty\\&quot; look. I&#x27;m pretty sure that given the impression that you have dust or dandruff in your hair, was not the intention. Not sure what the makeup of this product is or if it is damaging to your hair, but I would assume that it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product requires a little work on your behalf, but it is better than slicking your hair with gels, which I know dry out your hair. It&#x27;s a new generation and with the new generation, new and better things come to the surface. I, for now, will assume, that this product is an improvement on what has been done in the past.</li>
    <li> If you want a really messy hair style, this is for you. Just apply (shake it) on your DRY hair and spread the fine powder out using your ten fingers and you&#x27;re good to go. This product doesn&#x27;t have any smell unlike other Axe hair gels. It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair strongly either. This product creates a very natural and messy hair style. Personally, I would stick to the \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; hair gels.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son to try out as he is a high school student and is constantly on the go...especially in the AM when he has to get on to his bus at 6.45am.  He tried this once or twice and his thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Yes, it does give your hair a messy bed head look.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is powdery and a mess to use on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;3. When I am rushed and have not washed my hair in a few days then it does help get the oily shine out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He does say that it does not provide any hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product but not a great product...too much effort to use and clean up after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;3/5 for him.</li>
    <li> WOW! Axe Gravity Defying Dust is just an incredibly amazing product. The stuff is like a little can of powder and you shake a very small amount out into your hand and run it through your hair. It reacts with your natural scalp oils and creates this amazing hold that lasts well over a day. This stuff is really neat, no messy gels or creams that get all over everything, and it doesn&#x27;t harden or flake, so restyling or re-combing throughout the day doesn&#x27;t ruin the hold. Of course it being what it is, you won&#x27;t be able to rock a greasy pompadour with this stuff, but it&#x27;s sure strong enough to hold one a mile high!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Axe&#x27;s Messy Look paste for quite awhile, it has allowed me to ditch the hassle of a comb altogether, and just go with a tousled look that my hair doesn&#x27;t naturally get. The paste requires me to use while my hair is still damp after the shower; this dust purports to work on dry hair. Awesome! I get to spend even less time on my appearance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In practice, however, the stuff isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. It comes in a little shaker-bottle, like salt or pepper (my hair&#x27;s not quite there yet), but I&#x27;m unsure how to get it to the majority of my hair evenly. Pouring a little on the palm doesn&#x27;t work, as the dust is really a little adhesive in quality, so it goes to its initial contact-point with my hair and stays there. \\&quot;Salting\\&quot; my head doesn&#x27;t seem smart, as it&#x27;s an abrasive and shouldn&#x27;t get in the eyes. So, not so easy to use as the paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the end result isn&#x27;t as nice as the Messy Look paste, which, when the hair dries, doesn&#x27;t feel like any product is actually in there. The dust, on the other hand, leaves a vaguely oily, unnatural texture that I don&#x27;t really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe there&#x27;s a super-secret method for using this to its best effect, my experiences however have me sticking to the paste (not literally, mind you).</li>
    <li> Back in the day, there was a product called Psssssst! that would take day old hair and kinda \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; it. Then we figured out that baby powder would pretty much do the same thing. SO I was interested in trying this new Axe product on my 13 yr old grandson&#x27;s messy look hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the stuff come in a black container, impossible to see inside. The powder is a very VERY fine dust that is also impossible to see. The directions say to shake it into your hair. Yeah. Not gonna work. You cannot tell if any of it is getting into your hair! Obviously, you need to shake it into your hand instead and then apply it. That worked much more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;However, it just didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all to change the look of his hair. What is did do, is give it a bizarre plastic, glue, gross feeling. He washed it out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;For us, this product is a \\&quot;fail\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> My son uses this.  It has good hold and keeps the style he wants.  He really likes the other Axe styling products because he says it feels dirty, but to me it looks just fine.</li>
    <li> I gave my husband this to try and he was kind of confused.  It basically just makes your hair look dusty.  So I tried some too - I found the bottle tiny and poorly designed.  You barely get any product out, and when you do it looks like weird bread mold from outer space.  I rubbed it in to my roots and it made my hair look more \\&quot;matte\\&quot; and maybe gave me a little volume, but if I wanted these things I think I&#x27;d probably try a different product that is easier to use and a better value!</li>
    <li> This is some really weird stuff. It&#x27;s not exactly something you want on your head.  First of all, if \\&quot;messy\\&quot; is the look you&#x27;re going for, this is a contender, but it might not be worth the mess in the bigger sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dust is the opposite of graphite.  Graphite is a dry powder lubricant that cuts down on friction.  It&#x27;s mysterious and awesome.  This powder has the exact opposite properties compared to graphite.  It&#x27;s sticky, and grabby, and tacky.  It takes things that should have slid effortlessly against each other and makes them stick together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how badly do you want your hair to look messed up?  It would be easier to put in some hair gel before you go to bed and make yourself some nasty bed-head.  But this stuff clings onto your hair and makes a big mess.  If you spill any of it on your counter, it makes an even bigger mess.  When you get it on your hands, you have to take extra care to clean it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blech.</li>
    <li> Axe products are my favourite as they work great and smell great as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you like the gravity defying messy look, which I do once in a while, then this is the right product for you.</li>
    <li> I have o say that this made my hair look fuller as well as easy to manage. It has a great scent not to over powerering but nice for it to be notice. I can get a few good styles by using just a little bit. Once you rub it in your hair it basically dissolves .Great product a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The Axe Gravity Defying Dust Messy Look product really lives up to it&#x27;s name: it&#x27;ll take flat, oily hair and make it fluffy, messy and matte looking. It&#x27;s pretty amazing that way. The dust comes out practically clear, like pixie dust. Pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawback: touching your hair after you put it on is pretty creepy. It feels odd, fake and chemical-ly. I changed my pillowcase after sleeping on it with my &#x27;axed&#x27; hair. I haven&#x27;t used it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it&#x27;s one of those products you&#x27;d use for those special occasions (i.e. big fake eyelashes or cucumber in pants) and want awesomely big hair. Then use it and enjoy it&#x27;s Gravity Defying Messy glory.</li>
    <li> My son, super cool 11 year old that he is, loves hair products. Spiking, messing, tousling, etc. He especially loves Axe products and we have tried most of them. This one is by far his least favorite. It messes up his hair (and not in the way he wants) and it messes up our bathroom counter when he has an OOPS moment. Which he does fairly frequently. If you&#x27;re looking to add some spiky, messy style - go with the gum. It is way better and more convenient than this or the jarred stuff.</li>
    <li> Magic in a small bottle!  This invisible powder make thin, or thinning hair look FULL and in control!  Amazing INSTANT results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a SMALL amount * you can NOT see it *  and work into the root area, and don&#x27;t flip out, your hair will be BIG. Yup like a 1960&#x27;s Troll doll, or the late 70&#x27;s early 80&#x27;s \\&quot;punk\\&quot;  (RAMONES-yeah!) look.  Do NOT freak out, just grab a brush, and you will be fine, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very similar product has been used in hair/make-up trucks on Film and TV set&#x27;s/productions, at half the size - that product retails at around $45 a pop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, the Axe products are marketed to guy&#x27;s  in the 15 to 25 range, but It may well be of greater value to those who are more mature.  Women love the results, as do seniors. No fragrance, very small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may well be the Hollywood Secret that you will only mention to your BEST friends.  Unique, affordable and essential.</li>
    <li> This is great for the messy look but it also helps to absorb excess oil.  If you have to run out the door but no time to wash, this will help your hair look and smell fresher!</li>
    <li> I like my hair best about 2-3 days after a shampoo, when it&#x27;s a little heavier and less fluffy than freshly washed, with just enough oil to make it look good but not enough to make it look flat or greasy. This product gives a similar effect to slightly-dirty-but-not-yet-greasy hair. In application, it&#x27;s kind of like that powdered dry shampoo, without being so much like talcum powder. For my money, I&#x27;d just as soon wash my hair less, but if you work in a smoky or stinky environment (bar, restaurant kitchen, etc.) or you work out a lot, so you actually need to wash your hair more frequently, this product is a pretty good compromise.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1YWTNSB6NQWM]]It works okay. It does give some texture to hair, without a sticky gel or creme hold. The bottle is very very small, as seen in the video, but a little powder goes a long way, and it does work easily without much fussing.</li>
    <li> My teenager seems to have developed a cowlick on the front of his head from his winter caps.  He doesn&#x27;t seem to take them off anymore.  I told him he looks like a mall girl from the 80s but he doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.  He tried this but it didn&#x27;t work on getting rid of that so I took him for a buzz cut.  That worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It kind of didn&#x27;t do anything to his head of hair.  He has very thick hair but other styling products have worked in the past.  It says it absorbs oil but wouldn&#x27;t any powder do that?  None of us have oily hair so I couldn&#x27;t check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also did not have the signature fragrance that gives advance warning when it is coming into the room.  That was the biggest positive about it.</li>
    <li> Anyone with thin hair that needs lots of conditioner knows that there are times when freshly washed hair looks flat.&lt;br /&gt;ENTER THIS MAGIC DUST!&lt;br /&gt;If you either like the messy look, or could care less about spending lots of time on your hair, this stuff is great! Rub your fingers on your scalp and then shake your fingertips to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;NOT for someone that wants a structured look, or to tame your unruly hair. This stuff is MEANT to look messy. If you complain that it doesn&#x27;t hold your hair, use a gel, balm, or any product for hold. Don&#x27;t blame &#x27;Axe Gravity Defying Dust MESSY Look&#x27; for giving you a MESSY LOOK!</li>
    <li> I have used this dust several days now and I have yet to determine if it is actually doing anything.  It seems to work as more of a dry shampoo, removing oils from my hair, than a styling product.  It does not say how much to use which may be part of the problem.  It does smell good, but you need to make sure you give your hair a good tousle so it isn&#x27;t visible in your hair.  As for hold, I don&#x27;t think it is effective but maybe I&#x27;m not using enough.</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well. I have to admit, though...putting this stuff in your hair is weird. But it does do what it&#x27;s supposed to, so for that, it&#x27;s recommended.</li>
    <li> As at least one other reviewer mentioned, this is more effective as a dry shampoo than as a styling aid.  Well, at least for a moderate long hair like I&#x27;ve become.</li>
    <li> The dust seems to be a unique item, and I was startled to see how small the container was that it came in.  I tried using it for several days, but found that it simply made my hair frizzy, and when I tried to run my hand through my longer hair (like i normally do) it pulled and stuck.  I&#x27;m not sure the right style of hair for this product, but medium-long isn&#x27;t the right one.  At least not my wavy, thick hair wasn&#x27;t the right type of hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t disregard this product since many find it useful, and Axe puts out great products, it just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
    <li> I rated Axe Gravity Defying dust messy look 4 stars because it does give a \\&quot;messy look\\&quot;. Your hair does not look wet and feels odd. The product itself is tiny, just make sure you spread it out on your hands instead of directly applying it on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not sure about this product. I have to still experiment with it and figure it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using pomades and gels, so I thought I&#x27;d try this out to see how its different.  The bottle almost feels empty - this dust is really gravity defying... its a lot like a transparent powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is to give a dry messy look.  But I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m using the correct amount... it does sticky up the dryness of the hair, but maybe I&#x27;m using too much since it looks like I have dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep experimenting with this product because its just so odd, but, for right now I stick to gels for my finish work.</li>
    <li> The look you get from using this dust is not for everyone. The nature of the dust creates a messy, dry look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dust particles come out as soft and goes on very sticky. Once it is applied to the hair, it stays on fairly put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product alleges that it absorbs oil and creates volume and lift. It does exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dust is unique and is very easy to use with. It&#x27;s definitely very sticky and holds up hair. Worth a consideration.</li>
    <li> I expected to open this small container and have powder fall into my hand - like baby powder, I suppose. The dust from this container is much lighter weight than that powder. It&#x27;s also translucent and somewhat difficult to see. How much should I use? I can&#x27;t see it and can barely feel it. Then I put some in my hair and rubbed it around. Plenty went into the air around me (based on the dust I saw in the sunlight streaming in the window), but some certainly went on my hair. My wife said it made it feel \\&quot;sticky,\\&quot; a feeling which was present for an hour or so. I could easily hand style my hair during that period, but would have needed to replenish the dust thereafter. My wife, just for kicks, tried it in her fine curly blonde hair; it didn&#x27;t look like it did anything. My hair, which is less fine (also less present), seemed to be better suited for the product, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll be dusting my hair again in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this to soak up some of the oils on my head. But notice that my hair felt \\&quot;hard\\&quot;, you couldn&#x27;t run your fingers through the places that had powder. The \\&quot;hard\\&quot; hair felt like cement, and it made my hair feel \\&quot;fake\\&quot;. The powder has a odd chemical scent and it goes everywhere if you are not careful. The bottle is REALLY tiny but you only use a little bit at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps to absorb excess oil, I just didn&#x27;t like the texture of my hair afterwards.</li>
    <li> If you have never used hair dust or hair powder, you may find this product kind of strange. I&#x27;ve used a similar product by [[ASIN:B000VZM09S Aveda]], which I love. Of course, the Aveda product costs about 3 times as much as this one. If you are looking for a hair dust/powder at a low price point, I would enthusiastically recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Axe Gravity Defying Dust Messy Look.  Really cool.  When used right, this stuff can make a guy&#x27;s hair look really cool.  It is a dusty, talcy texture.  My son, along with other guys, can make their hair look really cool.  I especially like this product, because it gives it a natural look that is so becoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all those young guys in my life: my son, my daughters&#x27; boyfriends, son-in-law, and all the friends.  They look best when they are more natural but not real messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
