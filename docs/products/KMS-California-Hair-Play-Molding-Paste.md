<ol>
    <li> Great long-lasting hold all day... even during humid weather.  Non-greasy feel.  My favorite hair product hands down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using KMS Hairplay for 5+ years and I really love this product. It provides a firm yet pliable hold that adds texture without excess shine is never sticky. I&#x27;ve lived in humid climates and never have a problem with hold either. If it gets a little wet (I now live in the Pacific Northwest and we know rain!) it will still hold nicely as it dries. There&#x27;s also little or no fragrance in the product so no strong smells if you&#x27;re sensitive to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used this product in the past and the change in packaging confused you, as it did me, fear not! It&#x27;s the same great product in a new packaging.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Just gets really dry and not spreadable in my hair really quick. I was trying to find similar product to oasis foreplay. Just use a little less at a time and work smaller areas.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product and its super affordable through Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff! Great price and we love getting it shipped to the house!</li>
    <li> I have very, very thick hair.  No other product works for me except this.  It does the job.  It makes my hair do what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I have had many ladies comment on how good it smells and it also holds well without looking too unnatural. I just moved so I was glad to find it on amazon for cheaper than I was paying at my barber.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use gel for my that much&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and just don&#x27;t need it BUT this stuff is amaZing !!!! It does not look or feel like gel but it functions like one&lt;br /&gt;Does not flake and versatile&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> Has great hold without build up and provides a full body look without looking weighed down. A must have if you have short hair!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel fuller, it sticks on your hand but doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel sticky at all, it does not have shine so I add a little pomade after I have worked it through my hair.</li>
    <li> Would have liked to have given 5 stars but like other products I have used like this, it seems to give out or dry up midday and loose it&#x27;s effectiveness. The search continues...</li>
    <li> pretty good definition, lacklustre delivery on volume..  BEST feature: neutral smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> KMS Hair Play adds just enough texture and hold without being sticky.  It&#x27;s the new, &amp;#34;a little dab will do ya!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is the only product my husband will use. It makes his hair shiny and stay put. I order a large one for home and a small one for his travel bag. He can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> While my wife likes my hair to be presentable, she also enjoys running her hands through it. With traditional gel or other products, my hair is sticky and stiff. With KMS hairplay, however, it stays &amp;#34;in place&amp;#34;, but is soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this, but I didn&#x27;t like it and don&#x27;t feel this hair product adds volume. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The hair salon I frequent uses this product and I bought a bottle to try. Love it as it&#x27;s not too sticky but still provides sufficient hold for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 16 year old guy (straight) and I love to use this product to get my hair to stick up and give it that \\&quot;just got out of bed\\&quot; look.</li>
    <li> This is perfect hair paste even for thin hair isn&#x27;t goopy and stays all day. A MUST try if not already using!</li>
    <li> This paste is great, and alittle goes a long way.  I use a tiny drop and spread it out on my fingertips and put it through my hair.  Its really a great product and the price on here is much cheaper than any salon or Ulta.</li>
    <li> This was referred to me by my hairdresser and she gave me samples to take home.  I have very thick straight and fine hair with horrible cowlicks at the top of my part.  This paste helps keep my hair swept over to the side without my longer bangs hanging in my face.  Wonderful product!</li>
