<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  It works very well to get colors and creams out of my brushes.  A little goes a long way, as well.</li>
    <li> i loved it! it makes the brush really smell good and takes out all the nastyness and stink. i buy it again if its gone</li>
    <li> It works. I couldn&#x27;t get some of my brushes all the way clean again even after 6+ washes with it. However, it had been about as many months that they&#x27;d gone without washing.   I&#x27;d tried some other brush shampoos and was unable to use the brushes again after because they got stiff or completely lost their shape. With this one, the brushes were so much nicer after. The shapes mostly came back. However, lately they&#x27;ve failed to regain their softness after washing with this (washing on regular basis now).   It comes out super fast so be careful and ready!</li>
    <li> This was exactly the product advertised. My wife would have spent $40 more for full price. The seller was quick with the shipping too!!!</li>
    <li> I use all bare minerals make up and this brush shampoo/condtional keeps all my brushes in amazing condition.  You will NEVER buy a new applicator brush again!</li>
    <li> I was initially hesitant about the real need to buy a specific product just to clean my make-up brushes.  Wouldn&#x27;t something like hair shampoo work just as well??&lt;br /&gt;After counting the number of Bare Escentuals brushes I had, the amount I had invested in them, and realizing I wouldn&#x27;t want to be spending that money again, I purchased the Brush Conditioning Shampoo in the 4 0z tube from Amazon&#x27;s BE selection.&lt;br /&gt;Approximately 2 years later, I am still glad I did.  The shampoo removes all traces of make-up in record time and with very little massaging of the brush.  All traces of the shampoo rinse out very easily leaving your equipment practically brand new again.  No soaking, no scrubbing, no trying a toothbrush to remove stains etc.&lt;br /&gt;I wet the brush thoroughly, add a drop or 2 of shampoo and gently work the shampoo into a light lather.  Rinse the brush completely under a gentle stream of lukewarm water.  I gently squeeze out the excess water, re-shape brush a little and stand on end to dry.  I regularly use 4 or 5 brushes and wash approximately every two weeks.  Perhaps more often is recommended.  I stay on the two week cycle, works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;As you work in the shampoo you notice all traces of color immediately leaving the brush.  Even the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; or blush brush comes completely clean with very little light rubbing.  Products and brushes I have used in the past usually ended up in the trash.  Never came clean and brushes ended up quite \\&quot;splayed\\&quot; and useless.&lt;br /&gt;The combination of quality equipment cared for properly means I have not had to replace a BE brush in the 14 or 15+ years I have been using them.  All are the originally purchases brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t come across this product until I had been using the products for several years.  The \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; brush was quite stained and a looking a little sad.  Ordered this shampoo (because it was less expensive than a new brush) and voila...I have saved my original brush from extinction.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo leaves the brushes easy to reshape and rinses out really easily and thoroughly.  The texture of the brush stays exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the original tube of shampoo I purchased and don&#x27;t foresee needing to order more any time soon.  Lasts forever.  You only need a drop or two.&lt;br /&gt;Washing all of my brushes @ the same time takes under 20 minutes.  Keeping on this schedule also ensures everyone of them is clean when I need it.  If your skin is sensitive or prone to breakouts, you may want to decrease the time between shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo paired with a \\&quot;specialty\\&quot; BE brush would make a nice little gift - thoughtful and quite affordable.

    <li> My go to brush cleaner. So great!</li>
    <li> I think this brush cleaner is a essential for every makeup diva! I have Entire Mac Makeup Brush Collection,BareMinerals Brush Set,&amp; Sigma Set.I use this shampoo for all three.I cleanses well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this product works!  I was gifted some expensive makeup brushes and just love them!  I use one for applying liquid makeup (hint: great for coverup of dark spots) and i figured I would just have to buy another when it became unusable.  But I used this brush shampoo - it got the makeup out very easily and I left it to dry overnight - and my brush is like BRAND NEW!  So soft and wonderful again.  I am lovin it.  you will too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much cleaner my brushes were after using the brush conditioning shampoo as opposed to when I&#x27;d wash them with baby shampoo. Excellent product. Absolutely would recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Received this item fast and the product is great!  You only have to use a little bit and it cleans all the makeup right out of the brush within seconds.  The brush is dry by the next day and clean and soft like the first day you bought it.  You definitely need this product if you use bare minerals makeup on a regular basis.  This would also work for any makeup brush.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I wanted a way to keep my bare minerals brushes clean and I wanted to use their product to do so. This did the trick and it keeps your brushes in supreme condition. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Works great for cleaning my make up brushes!</li>
    <li> Works on my brushes very well and my brushes are not bare mineral either. It is easy to use and the price is great!!</li>
    <li> Thia bottle is big for the cheap price I paid ($5) it does make my brushes soft and definitely takes all the powered out! The only downside, my face was pretty irritated after the first few times I used it after cleaning it..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush cleaner, but I prefer using my eco friendly dish soap and olive oil. Oh, and it arrived with a slice in the tube, almost like a box cutter had cut it. I know this didn&#x27;t happen in shipping and that it was already like that when they packed it because the bag it was in was pristine and not one cut on it. Save your money and use what you have! :)</li>
    <li> Love bareminerals products, Wanted to do a better job cleaning my more expensive brushes. This shampoo does the job! Great gentle cleanser that gets out a lot of old makeup from brushes. Leave brushes feeling like new!  A little goes a long way! Love this!</li>
    <li> This is excellent, easy to use, and does indeed clean my brushes!!!</li>
    <li> I have had my brushes for years and have had friends say oh just use baby shampoo to clean them well I tried that and believe me, it doesn&#x27;t work that well!  I went back to this shampoo for my precious brushes really quick!!  It DOES make a difference what you clean your make up brushes with let me tell you!  Those brushes are expensive and this stuff relaly works and prolongs the life of your brushes!  I won&#x27;t use anything else on them again!</li>
    <li> I cleaned 3 brushes with this, after they failed to be cleaned by makeup remover and my facial cleanser.  The eye shadow brush cleaned well and was in great condition. The foundation brush (big and fluffy) and the concealer brush (small and dense) both felt oily and did not dry well after 2 days. I had to rewash and rinse carefully and they were better but not perfect after the second cleaning.  Overall, works better than what else I had used and I would recommend. Just not as easy as I had thought it would be from the other reviews.</li>
    <li> good product for the price. may have to use a couple times but i really it! gets my brushes really clean</li>
    <li> I like to keep very good care of my brushes, and I&#x27;m sure many people feel the same way considering how expensive they can be! This brush wash is gentle enough to use on all of my brushes and multiple uses.</li>
    <li> I like this brush cleaner, but not enough to bother repurchasing; I&#x27;ll just use Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo from here on out.</li>
    <li> I bought this trusting in the most recent reviews which said this product was good for cleanings keep brushes. When I received it, I quickly opened it and rushed to the bathroom to try it out on my Sigma brushes. On the first wash, it did little to nothing. I had to keep massaging more of this product onto my brushes and running them through with water. I must have been standing in my bathroom for a good 30 minutes trying to get the eyeshadow off of my brushes. This product was no good for me.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time the other day and was pleasantly surprised.  The shampoo rinses out of the brushes quickly and effectively.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to clean my brushes and it is fantastic I happy that I purchased the product. My brushes get nice and clean and my brushes remain soft.</li>
    <li> This cleaned my brushes pretty well.  With the exception of my foundation and liner brushes (I use cream liner).  It cleaned my powder and shadow brushes with one rinse and repeat.  But every time I use my foundation brush I need to wash it 4x before water runs clear-ish.  I haven&#x27;t had this very long and it won&#x27;t last long at this rate.  I clean my foundation and liner brushes after every use so they shouldn&#x27;t be THAT dirty.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.  If you are only cleaning powder and shadow brushes then you should be satisfied with this product.  If you are trying to wash off \\&quot;wet\\&quot; make up, you will be frustrated!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I had been using baby shampoo, as recommended by someone from the Bare Escentuals store years ago. But then I tried the Well-cared for and can&#x27;t believe the difference! The make-up comes out almost instantly. And the brushes are left feeling soft and like-new!! Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had the 4-oz tube for a long time. I&#x27;m not stingy with it, and it just lasts and lasts!</li>
    <li> Love this cleaner...works great on my brushes, keeps them both clean and in good condition. Would recommend this product to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> No matter what product you buy from the Bare Escentual/Bare Mineral line, you will be happy. I have super sensitive skin and a ton of allergies... I use this product line exclusively for make up and skin care.</li>
    <li> Cleans my brushes well.  We all cover blemishes and it keeps the germs away so I don&#x27;t get repeat acne from dirty brushes</li>
    <li> I rinse my brushes after each use, and then once a week clean them with this and warm water. You can see all of the makeup running off of it. Then I just set them to dry overnight, or if it&#x27;s nice out, put them outside to dry quickly in the sun. I had no idea my brushes were so dirty, and I feel less worried about bacteria living in them when I use this.</li>
    <li> Good stuff for cleaning makeup brushes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly over-the-moon about it. After one use, my brushes were kind of stiff. I know I rinsed enough. By the third time, my Full Flawless BE brush has all kinds of damaged bristles all in the center of it, crumpled in and broken. I feel it&#x27;s chewing away the quality of the brushes. The brushes are expensive and I bought this to help, not damage them! I heard castor oil is good for brush cleaning, so I think I&#x27;ll try that sometime. I have to look into how to get the castor oil off--I don&#x27;t want it leaving oily layers on my expensive brushes but I&#x27;m torturing them using this. For my Featherlight BE brush, its white at the tips and I did like how it took out all of the pigment and brought it back to its former whiteness, as if I hadn&#x27;t used it.&lt;br /&gt;Note that you should dry your brushes horizontally, not vertically. I assume its so that water doesn&#x27;t rust any metal on your brush and so that it doesn&#x27;t soak inside the handle and make it moldy, or just do damage if it&#x27;s a wood handle soaking in water from the bristles. Just a tip. It does say that in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;You do get a lot of product. I feel this would honestly last a life time for me, especially with my dread to use it spacing out my cleanings longer than they should be. I won&#x27;t waste it, I will use it, but with dread and very carefully. I may not use it on my nicest brushes. Those may just have to hang in there until I find a very decent brush cleaner. Next time, I&#x27;m definitely going to try to size DOWN on my cleaners until I find something worth investing in that I&#x27;d be happy to have around for a long time.</li>
    <li> The cleanser is amazing. It leaves the brush hair so soft and feels so nice on your skin! And it is definitely better than paying 14 dollars for it at the store!</li>
    <li> I needed a product to clean my makeup brushes. If that&#x27;s what your looking for then this is it. Easy to use and keeps brushes like brand new.</li>
    <li> When I run water over my brushes, nothing. But as soon as I add a drop of this cleanser, all of the built up make-up just falls out of the brushes. It makes me think of how gooky the brushes are if they don&#x27;t get cleaned properly. My brushes react well to the product and fell silky soft afterwards. I&#x27;d buy more.</li>
    <li> this brush cleaner doesn&#x27;t clean as well as some I have used in the past but it does the job. The instructions say to massage the cleaner into th brush under running water but I have found that putting some cleaner in a cup with warm water and then agitating the brush in the water works better.  Compared to others (NuBrush --if I can ever find it again I will buy a case) I have to work longer at getting the oils and makeup out but really it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I love it! It left my brushes like when i first bought them. wish i could have bought it earlier cuz i messed up my other brush by just washing it with regular soap :/ but maybe it can still be rescued lol the shipping was awsome too.</li>
    <li> I love this for my makeup brushes! It leaves them super soft</li>
    <li> I have used this product for my make up brushes since I started BareMinerals products a few years ago. My brushes are still in great shape!</li>
    <li> Works really well on my stage brushes - everything from high def foundation to basic eye liner and shadow. A bit greasier than expected - more like a shampoo than a soap - but left the brushes very clean and good feeling.</li>
    <li> It really cleans my brush effectively. Only takes a little each time. Love the product. I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well it worked. My brushes were getting rather gunked up and washing with soap and water was not cutting it anymore. This shampoo cleaned them up better and seemed to be more gentle to the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a huge amount of product and will last an incalculable amount of time - probably through a few brush sets. It works fine, but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> I never knew they made shampoo and conditioner for brushes it&#x27;s great to have plus leaves my brushes nice and clean when I run out I will definitely be getting more</li>
    <li> I was nervous to wash my brushes for the first time because my friends have done it and it always came out terrible! The brushes were rough and ruined but this conditioner could not have made me happier. I followed the directions step by step and my brushes feel bran new!!! Im now going to wash them once a week so they stay nice and clean!! Thank you again bare minerals and amazon for a great product!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for your brushes. Cleans very well, and brushes are soft after they dry. - products last super long too!</li>
    <li> Get this for your makeup brushes! It&#x27;s amazing! I even used it on other cheap brushes and it worked amazing on those as well!</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking it would be incredibly awesome considering it was made exclusively for the BareMineral brushes.  The products does just what it says it will do...cleans and conditions the brush without leaving residue; but so does baby shampoo or anything else with no harsh detergents...for a lot less money.  Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great product to wash brushes. It does take a lot of product and several washes to clean one brush.</li>
    <li> I have nice soft brushes... some natural hair, some synthetic, and after I use this cleaner they are brought back to life, nice and soft. The only problem is, I have to wash them, rinse, then wash them again. Sometimes three times depending on the type of brush (how big it is and how much makeup it holds). I&#x27;m not the most diligent brush cleaner. I wipe them off on a towel after every single use, but only use the cleaner about every other month. If I did it more often I may not have to repeat the cleaning so many times. The bristles in my brushes have never had any falling out problems, regardless of cleaner. Very faint scent, it&#x27;s pleasant, just smells clean. Your fingers will be nice and soft too after massaging each brush :)&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to go over again so many times. I use SO many brushes on a daily basis, that to clean all of them takes quite a chunk of time.</li>
    <li> Oh yeah I love this cleaner it keeps the brushes beautiful</li>
    <li> This product cleans your brushes quickly and thoroughly and rinses out easily.  Keeps brushes fresh and soft.  Highly recommend you clean your brushes monthly and this product does a great job.</li>
    <li> Excellent job of cleaning my makeup brushes. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I rub my fingers over the makeup brush bristles with a small stream of running water. I leave the brushes out on a shelf to dry during the day. This product seems pricey but good makeup brushes are not cheap so in light of the investment I make in good brushes, this product is worth every penny. The product will last me a long time which is a great plus.</li>
    <li> First time getting a brush cleaner, I usually just use water and soap but this does wonders. Everything comes off the brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brush shampoo and this is the one really works very well. It can remove all the residual makeups and keep your brushes clean.</li>
    <li> Great to clean makeup brushes. I use it with my Real Techniques makeup brushes and it works great. Foams up quick and is easy to rinse off.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt buy it again because I can just use any liquid facial wash to clean my brushes.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s an alright brush shampoo. It&#x27;s not that great at cleaning off foundation on brushes and doesn&#x27;t get the color off. I tried washing my foundation brush 3 times and there was still foundation residue. It&#x27;s also really really runny. Right when you open it the shampoo all just comes spilling out, you don&#x27;t need to squeeze it at all so just be aware of that.  It did do an alright job on my other brushes (powder, eye shadow, etc.) But in my opinion there are a lot better brush cleansers out there, even dish soap mixed with olive oil works much better than this..I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are expensive! this stuff really brings the brush back to the way it was when I first bought it. It is a must for anyone who owns this stuff.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this shampoo, and I was definitely not disappointed! It seems to realllly get your brushes clean as well as condition them. Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> OK, so being pretty darn frugal here, I had to ask at the store - \\&quot;Why would I buy this - why can&#x27;t I just use people shampoo?\\&quot; They explained to me why this product is better for the brushes and I bought it. When I finally cleaned my brushes (poor things) I was astonished at how amazing this stuff is. Now I have to tell the World! I am on a mission. If you use brushes of any kind - you need this cleanser. It is such a good feeling starting with a nice clean brush. Once a month they said - so it will last quite a while. Buy it! You will not regret it!!!!</li>
    <li> OK, so have been washing my rather costly brushes in gentle hand soap :-( as a result they were stiff and scratchy. This brush shampoo is definitely worth it, it restored the soft feel of my brushes but also got out all the powder and oils easily and quickly. I can tell because my brush hair is pink so could watch the almost instant change from brown to pink. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> After using many different products to clean my brushes, this is the best product I have tried. They are clean, soft and it was easy to use.</li>
    <li> This worked great for all my brushes. I immediately saw how dirty my brushes were! yuck! No scent to it so that&#x27;s good, but over all my brushes are really clean now, and i don&#x27;t even need alot for it to work, so its great!</li>
    <li> I just got this today in the mail and just finished cleaning my brushes. A little goes a LONG way. No smell to it so your brushes will not be left with a perfume or funky smell. Rinsed out nicely. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of cleaning my makeup brushes. It leaves my foundation and eye shadows brushes clean and smooth. It did seem to leave my bronzed brush a bit stiff, but that may be due to the shape of the brush to begin with. If you have sensitive skin, and plan to wash several brushes at the same time, you may want to consider wearing gloves as it is a bit harsh and drying to the fingertips.</li>
    <li> nothing too amazing about this product i could probably just bought a cheaper one with same results</li>
    <li> This product is not a bad product and for the price I&#x27;m satisfied with the result. It gets fluffy brushes clean with ease, although one of the bruches I cleaned leaves residue in my mineral veil cap. I don&#x27;t notice it on my face so I don&#x27;t worry too much about it. The issue I found is that it does not clean brushes made for tighter application that well. Brushes that you use to apply cream or liquid based foundation and eye shadows. For that you need a more heavy duty cleanser. I would recommend MAC. It&#x27;s double the price but it works much better. That is why this items is just okay. For the price it works and i will continue to use it as a intermediate cleanser but for a deep clean I will have to buy something more potent.</li>
    <li> This product not only cleans well, but conditions brushes. I bought it for my new brush, but tried it on older ones I thought I&#x27;d have to replace. Now they&#x27;re like new again.&lt;br /&gt;The price for this on Amazon was half what it is on other sites.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products for quality make up brushes.  I also use it daily on my clarisonic brush head after I wash my face.</li>
    <li> This product worked exactly as expected. My only complaint is that it came out of the tube a little fast so the first time I used it some got wasted.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done...I wish the cap was more controlled. I always end us wasting large amounts of it because it oozes out whenever I tuck it away into the cupboards.</li>
    <li> This brush shampoo is effective and does what it says. I like that it leaves no discernible scent. If I am using a cream or liquid product, I have to first use a solvent based brush cleaner to &#x27;break-down&#x27; or dissolve the product first, or the water will not even touch the bristles. I have different methods of cleaning my different brushes, and I adjust that from time to time. There is no single cleaning method or product that can be used for cleaning all brushes all the time that is optimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: When you need to shampoo your brushes, this BE brush shampoo gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do! No weird residues/ smells and the brushes dry quickly (I leave them overnight). The brushes always feel nice after cleaning, very soft. You only need a small drop per brush, so this bottle will last you a LONG time. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and works as it should.  Although, there are cheaper ways of cleaning brushes with the same effectiveness.  This means I most likely won&#x27;t buy this cleanser again.  My recipe is equal parts of dish soap and olive oil.  Dish soap cleans and olive oil moisturizes.  It really produces the same results!</li>
    <li> I wish I needed this more often. It came in a huge tube. Now it just sits in the closet. Lol</li>
    <li> The brushes are like new after every wash. You only need a small amount to clean. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I use mandelic acid for my hyperpigmentation. The formula is too strong to apply with fingers so I use a brush. I squeeze some of this into a cup, stick the brush in, and fill with warm water. Swish is around and throw away the water. DONE. It&#x27;s one of the easiest and effective brush cleaners I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s easy enough to use daily and takes no time at all.</li>
    <li> It made my brushes feel soft and new again and it got all the leftover make up and face oils out no problem</li>
    <li> I needed something to clean my makeup brushes with and my manicurist recommended this product. I am glad I asked her about it.</li>
    <li> It is very delicate and cleans the brushes very well! I love it and I will definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> Cleans my brushes very well. Gentle enough to be used daily. Best price I&#x27;ve seen so far, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> exactly what i ordered thanks! bought in October, still have over half the bottle left! fantastic stuff, works well, conditions my brushes, and it doesnt take much</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and item is exactly as listed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the price, but the shampoo/conditioner left my brushes feeling very soft and amazing. It had been a while since I&#x27;ve washed them, but this definetly got the job done! I should have bought the pump bottle...</li>
    <li> This brush shampoo is great! It cleans my make up brushes easily without having to use very much product and it rinses clean without leaving any residue. I&#x27;ve only had the product for a month now and used it 3 times without anything but amazing results, it&#x27;s too early to tell if it helps extend the life of my brushes, but time will tell! As of right now I am very satisfied with is product!</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t clean the brushes as thoroughly as it should. It helps as a start up in the cleaning process, but I still have to use an additional antibacterial detergent to get all the make up out of the brushes.</li>
    <li> This stuff really get the makeup out and I mean all of it. The only thing is that after the brush is dry, it is not the same until you keep using it then it will go back to the way it is.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. Cleans your brushes and keeps them looking like new. You also don&#x27;t need that much shampoo so use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery! The bottle is bigger than I thought! It was a lot cheaper here than the stores I went to.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time.  I use my brushes a lot and I am cleaning them a lot and this product cleans really works well.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush cleanser I have ever found. Removes all the grime and keeps my higher end brushes like new.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff like once a week on my good makeup brushes. It keeps them well conditioned and keeps them nice and clean. The cleaner makes my brushes clean enough that my skin doesnt break out now. well worth the money to keep bacteria off your brushes and face.</li>
    <li> I bought Mac brush cleaner for $13 plus tax and it was just a surface brush cleaner. This Bare Minerals cleaner was recommended by my friend and I just love it. It deep cleans and maintains the fluffiness of my brushes. The dirty, grimy make up just washes off and the brush bristles return to its original color.</li>
    <li> This keeps all my brushes happy and healthy. ;) It works great and is very easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t have any sort of offensive smell and is gentle on my hands and the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brushes are still fluffy and soft. They are like brand new. I clean them about once a week.</li>
    <li> BareMinerals brush conditioner works great. I use it on my bareminerals brushes and other brushes too. They clean up nicely! I was very nervous that my brushes wouldn&#x27;t be as nice and soft after I washed them, but that was certainly not the case using this stuff. I think it&#x27;s important to clean your brushes to get all the bacteria off of them and this product makes that an easy task to accomplish.</li>
    <li> very  good, i have used few times and liked very much</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very rich so only a little will do. I don&#x27;t have BareMinerals brushes, just ones from Sephora but the shampoo works great on them. It made them nice and fluffy. It also really cleaned the brushes very nice.</li>
    <li> gentle enough to wash all my brushes often! the amount of extra makeup and grime it takes off is amazing!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery- Awesome Product!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Folks, I know you think this is a great product because it cleans your brushes, but I need to warn you, this product is dangerous. I saw that my friend was using it and was appalled at the chemicals and preservatives in it. It is mostly preservatives, then water, and some aloe. That&#x27;s it.  The cleaning you think is happening is because of the sodium lauryl sulfate, which just is a lathering agent and does no cleaning at all.  I posted a review to the BareMinerals site about this and the company rejected it, which leads me to believe their site&#x27;s reviews are completely monitored and inflated. Please, if you care about your skin, at least google the ingredients or cross-check them at the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s site. Save yourself some money; use soap and water.  Don&#x27;t just think that because this company has some natural products that all of them are safe and natural. They aren&#x27;t. This product comes free with some BareMinerals kits and now I see why. It is just cheap, toxic, preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us never bother to look at ingredients labels, but we should.  There are plenty of alternative makeup products out there that aren&#x27;t toxic or bottles of preservatives. Larenim is a good example.</li>
    <li> well packaged and sealed. happy customer. thank you 👏 fast shipping 👍</li>
    <li> By far my favorite brush cleaner! It deep cleans your brushes and keeps your bristles nice! I have no problem using this with my very expensive brushes! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I use this to clean my bare minerals brushes. I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Leaves my brushes feeling like new again.</li>
    <li> Do not like this product.</li>
    <li> This did not come packaged as it is shown, but I believe the size was the same.  The bottle was a squat round bottle.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the time to actually go and buy the little bottle of this wonderful product. It&#x27;s my first time ever washing my brushes--and this shampoo was wonderful, the directions are listed on the back, and the product arrived fast and safe. Use it as recommended, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed, just remember if you&#x27;re like me (someone who hasn&#x27;t washed their brushes since they bought BareMinerals--2-3 months, you might have to wash each brush 2-3 times using the recommended amount). It works so well, my brushes are soft, and clean. ALSO! if you&#x27;re like me and you have sensitive skin, and chose the BareMinerals synthetic brush--the shampoo works just as well on those, just give all your brushes time to dry (roughly 1-2 days).</li>
    <li> Works well to clean bare minerals brushes.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s soft enough to not dry out my brushes, yet gets them clean every time.  I will say it is a bit expensive for &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Item as promised. Have some makeup that is really difficult to remove from brush and it does a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I was spending a generous amount of money on shampoo for a makeup brush (feeling a bit silly).... But you really do get a good amount of product for your money. The product says to use a dime size amount for each cleaning, so it will last a LONG time :)</li>
    <li> I had no idea that using this product would make such a difference in my makeup brushes, but it did! It made my brushes seem new again.  I would definetly recommend this product.</li>
</ol>
