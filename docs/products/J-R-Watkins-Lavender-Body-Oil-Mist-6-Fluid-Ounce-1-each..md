      <li>I disagree with the user who said it was too strong.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and calming.</li>
      <li>great for my back, cause</li>
      <li>I thought the scent was great and very soothing - particularly at night before I do yoga.</li>
      <li>Just love the mist, it is light and works very well.  </li>
      <li>Makes my dry skin happy</li>
      <li>I have noticed how much smoother and softer my skin feels and this body oil has quickly become a favorite.</li>
      <li>If a product has a particular scent in its name, you should be able to smell it, period.</li>
      <li>I had never used this type of product before, but I will certainly continue to use this one as it absorbs very quickly.  </li>
      <li>and my whole kitchen was instantly filled with the scent of lavender.  </li>
      <li>Extra benefit is it smells nice.</li>
      <li>i wish it were more readily available, local dept. store or something...</li>
      <li>Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>The initial fragrance of lavender is lovely, but it fades quickly.</li>
      <li>This really hydrates my dry skin, I just love it!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly what it says though it&#x27;s an oil.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product overall.</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy from them again :)</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
      <li>I am most definitely NOT complaining about this, however I bought the oil to put on all over myself after my showers and with the strength of the scent</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s warm spray due to the oil.</li>
      <li>Love it for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really want an oil-more of a non-oil body spray</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>still love it, but tend to wear some perfume with it anyway, as it&#x27;s just not quite what I expected.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Boo all-around.</li>
      <li>I purchased just for the lavender scent since Mom likes the scent so much.</li>
      <li>Lightly scented, non-greasy (yes even though it&#x27;s oil) and a bottle will last you ages.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
      <li>I really like this oil.</li>
      <li>The difference in smell between this product and actual lavender essential oil is astounding.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>Maybe this stuff is incredibly diluted because its meant to be sprayed on the skin but as a fan of a strong lavender scent, I&#x27;m really disappointed.  </li>
      <li>This is superb for spraying on the middle of your back where it&#x27;s hard to reach with your hands.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it highly if you like to use oil on your skin.</li>
      <li>High quality oil in convenient spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>Also a nice but subtle fragrance.</li>
      <li>Came in fast , was packaged decently and is exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to do that.  </li>
      <li>Relieved my 86 year old Mother&#x27;s neuropathy, arthritic &amp; muscle pain.  </li>
      <li>It is not strong at all but does leave a light scent on the skin.</li>
      <li>It has a light scent; not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>One thing I did note was that bottle itself, particularly the spray action, could use a little work.</li>

    <li> Tiene un olor delicioso y es de fácil adsorción en la piel.</li>
    <li> Relieved my 86 year old Mother&#x27;s neuropathy, arthritic &amp; muscle pain.  Purchased it along with some other lavender scented items made by other companies for Mother&#x27;s Day.  I purchased just for the lavender scent since Mom likes the scent so much. However, she told me that when she rubbed Jr Watkins Lavender Body Oil  into her feet and other painful areas the pain relief was the best she&#x27;d experienced in years.  She shared it with a friend in her 90&#x27;s who also received pain relief.  What a surprise.  I knew lavender has some medicinal effects but nothing like what my Mother has experienced.  Thank you so much.  I will be purchasing more in the future.  Lee in Lincoln, CA</li>
    <li> Came in fast , was packaged decently and is exactly what I expected. I love the light smell of it and that it&#x27;s an oil you can spray. I would definitely buy from them again :)</li>
    <li> This is superb for spraying on the middle of your back where it&#x27;s hard to reach with your hands.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to stain my clothes, yet keeps me from having dry skin issues.  Nice!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and is very relazing</li>
    <li> I love this body oil.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and smells wonderful.  The packaging wasn&#x27;t very good. Some oil leaked and the box had oil stains. thankfully nothing else in the box was damaged from the oil.</li>
    <li> I love this Body Oil. It&#x27;s not too heavy and absorbs nicely. I thought the scent was great and very soothing - particularly at night before I do yoga. Since I have started using body oil vs. lotion I have noticed how much smoother and softer my skin feels and this body oil has quickly become a favorite. One thing I did note was that bottle itself, particularly the spray action, could use a little work. It tends to go everywhere and can make the floor a little slippery. I found it best to spray into my hand and then apply.</li>
    <li> High quality oil in convenient spray bottle.  The lavender is great to apply at night for a relaxation.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> Kinda pricey but I like it.</li>
    <li> i wish it were more readily available, local dept. store or something...but amazon is as good as got. love them too.</li>
    <li> great light oil that moisturizes and leaves a great lavender scent.</li>
    <li> more affordable----amazing scent</li>
    <li> Not overpowering scent. Makes my dry skin happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a number of years and was happy to find it being sold online since i used to be able to buy it at Walmart and they stopped carrying it.  It lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light mist, smells wonderful and is not greasy,</li>
    <li> We got ours for flea/tick protection for our dog.  Extra benefit is it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Nice mosquito repellent!</li>
    <li> This is okay body oil but I would have thought the smell would have been stronger. The oil is not greasy. This oil is okay but I like others better.</li>
    <li> This is definitely an oil.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, but, after reading the reviews, I expected the smell to be a bit stronger and a bit longer-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I still love it, but tend to wear some perfume with it anyway, as it&#x27;s just not quite what I expected.</li>
    <li> Lightly scented, non-greasy (yes even though it&#x27;s oil) and a bottle will last you ages. Good purchase for those of us who sometimes cannot be bothered to go through the whole lotion ritual. Also calming before bed, as of course lavender is known for this.</li>
    <li> Love lavender but the Vanilla was my all-time favorite. I will always love the vanilla. Bring it back JR. Don&#x27;t bring JR from Dallas back, bring the vanilla back!!! :) Regardless, love their spray oils - perfect for kids who get scratchy backs etc....in dry climates like beautiful colorado....</li>
    <li> Just love the mist, it is light and works very well.  I use it often and it has helped my skin look better and feel softer.  I had never used this type of product before, but I will certainly continue to use this one as it absorbs very quickly.  I recommend it highly if you like to use oil on your skin.</li>
    <li> I like it. It surprising moisturizes pretty well, the vitamin-e does its part considering. Not greasy. The initial fragrance of lavender is lovely, but it fades quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. I&#x27;m a fan of lavender and this smells just perfect. The spray bottle is great and the oil is not greasy.</li>
    <li> smells delicious. moisturizes nicely. made my chest skin break out though so I use it only on my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Love this. It&#x27;s warm spray due to the oil. I absolutely love the scent &amp; it goes on so silky smooth. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong &amp; use it all the time.</li>
    <li> It has a light scent; not overwhelming. The scent doesn&#x27;t stay too long though. It&#x27;s also moisturizing</li>
    <li> This really hydrates my dry skin, I just love it! Its smells lasts long on me too. This is great!!!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to hold scent long but other than that its fine,not sticky etcc</li>
    <li> awesome, yes i would buy again.  great for my back, cause it&#x27;s hard to reach, also the lavender scent is very soothing.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is a good value it&#x27;s exactly what it says though it&#x27;s an oil.  For an oriole it&#x27;s wonderful that I should&#x27;ve paid better attention I didn&#x27;t really want an oil-more of a non-oil body spray but it smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Nice smelling oil and soothing to the skin.</li>
    <li> love it! smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> the smell is wonderful and the cooling ability of the powder is just what I needed working with patients all day! I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> As expected, have had this before. It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin. The scent is light and calming.</li>
    <li> I sprayed just one pump of this on my arm when I got it and my whole kitchen was instantly filled with the scent of lavender.  I am most definitely NOT complaining about this, however I bought the oil to put on all over myself after my showers and with the strength of the scent I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to do that.  I think I may keep this one for after night time showers and buy the coconut oil one for an all over type oil.  Other than that it&#x27;s silky and luxurious and I love it!</li>
    <li> I expected a lavender smell from this oil. It smells like liniment only.  The feel of the oil is great but I was very disappointed in the scent.  Instead of sending this purchase back, I added peppermint oil. If a product has a particular scent in its name, you should be able to smell it, period.</li>
    <li> Hardly any lavender smell, unfortunately :(</li>
    <li> Soothing to dry itchy skin. I use it after a bath or shower. Also a nice but subtle fragrance. I&#x27;ve tried others but came back to this one. I have also used the vanilla scent in this brand which is nice too.</li>
    <li> Love it for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have some actual lavender oil I&#x27;ve been spraying on my pillows to help me settle into bed.  The difference in smell between this product and actual lavender essential oil is astounding.  Maybe this stuff is incredibly diluted because its meant to be sprayed on the skin but as a fan of a strong lavender scent, I&#x27;m really disappointed.  Leaves a bit of a greasy layer on my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boo all-around.</li>
    <li> This oil has a nice lavender scent. I disagree with the user who said it was too strong. It is not strong at all but does leave a light scent on the skin. The oil is dry and not greasy. I am pleased with the product overall.</li>
    <li> I really like this. The smell is not too overwhelming. I like that it is a spray bottle and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Light oil that blends into the skin immediately, lovely scent and leaves a beautiful glow on skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender. It smells like alcohol</li>
    <li> Love this, smells heavenly,use it every day.</li>
    <li> This is hard for me to spray and very greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I have purchased since my husband has been using it for his dry contractor hands! We love it...leaves no greasy film on hands or body</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lacking in in the lavender scent.</li>
</ol>
