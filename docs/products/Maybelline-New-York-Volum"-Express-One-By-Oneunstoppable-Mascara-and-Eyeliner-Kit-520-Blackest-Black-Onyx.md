      <li>wish I would have gotten a better quality eye liner with it for that type of money .</li>
      <li>The mascara is okay</li>
      <li>I am mutual but siding more with dislike with this set.</li>
      <li>and if you have no worries of your eyelashes of touching your face or eyelids touching as well.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, but seems to go fast.</li>
      <li>im glad I bought it here.</li>
      <li>Love the mascara.</li>
      <li>&amp; Ive ordered more.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I absolutely love the unstoppable eyeliner &amp; with a mascara thrown in for under $3 I had to have it.</li>
      <li>it was a good deal, and I was surprised at how much I love the mascara!</li>
      <li>I love how this mascara works for me, and i love just how smooth the eyeliner is.</li>
      <li>this product was what I expected, fulfilled my expectations and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>, there&#x27;s not a bad thing to say about this product!</li>
      <li>and im guessing it was pretty popular because everytime i went</li>
      <li>The eyeliner is cheap and breaks off easily though.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
      <li>Its definitely worth it :)</li>
      <li>Okay.. ordered this item very optimistic!</li>
      <li>Neat and sealed packaging, clean product, everything I bought came no problem.</li>
      <li>The mascara was dry but the eye liner was very nice</li>
      <li>It works great and my eyelashes look fuller that they do with other mascara.</li>
      <li>I love it, and will probably keep buying it especially since it is sooo cheap!</li>
      <li>Oh the eyeliner works good too, nice opaque black shade &amp; It doesn&#x27;t smudge that much on me.</li>
      <li>Love the mascara, and the eyeliner is pretty good too, but the makeup will come out too far quite frequently.</li>
      <li>I got the falsies in waterproof and was very disspaointed, this one was a great choice, makes my lashes look very long and full.</li>
      <li>I love the Maybelline New York Volum&#x27; Express mascara and eyeliner.</li>
      <li>and its super cheap i will be ordering much more in the future</li>
      <li>This product is amazing and last forever and always day!</li>
      <li>Seller was great though, and I use the mascara everyday.</li>
      <li>I got exactly what us pictured, and it arrived rather quickly.</li>
      <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve lost probably a good inch of eyeliner due to that design.</li>
      <li>The eyeliner is soft but really easy to use.</li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t go on very easily and the brush is strange and doesn&#x27;t give any length to my lashes.</li>
      <li>Today is the first day I have used it</li>
      <li>It pumps out the lashes, and really seperated them!</li>
      <li>It was my first time trying this mascara</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s another product from the same brand much better.</li>
      <li>The one I currently use tends to smudge all over my eyelids (bottom and top).</li>
      <li>I was very excited when it came a couple days earlier!</li>
      <li>It came pretty fast.</li>
      <li>I think overall this would be a good set if you have dry skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only $3.89 with free shipping for this whole package.</li>
      <li>It goes on very faded and translucent without a lot of pigment.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide too much volume</li>
      <li>The mascara really catches each lash as it advertises one by one.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>It does have much make up on the wand when I put it on.  </li>
      <li>i bought this mainly for the unstoppable eye liner.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend if your thinking on buying.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended on both.</li>
      <li>you get the liner as well which normally sells for three or four dollars.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty generic.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, the eyeliner is too sensitive &amp; the lead is too light.</li>
      <li>i love this eyeliner and onyx is hard to  find where i live</li>
      <li>The mascara is okay, but the smell of it is kinda funny &amp; weird.</li>
      <li>The stick of eyeliner that comes out is also broken very easily.</li>
      <li>The eyeliner is great and the mascara isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
      <li>After washing my hand, the mascara was completely removed, but part of the eyeliner remained on the back of my hand.</li>
      <li>I was actually able to get it to screw back down, but it&#x27;s hard.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used to buy this mascara in the stores but was always unhappy with the high price as I like to stock up on cosmetics. The price is great for the idea you get the liner as well which normally sells for three or four dollars. Its definitely worth it :)</li>
    <li> The mascara is okay, but the smell of it is kinda funny &amp; weird. On the other hand, the eyeliner is too sensitive &amp; the lead is too light. Overall, the lead breaks before it touches my eyelid.</li>
    <li> The mascara is okay but nothing amazing. It clumps just like other mascaras and it&#x27;s pretty generic. The eye liner is fairly bad. It goes on very faded and translucent without a lot of pigment. The stick of eyeliner that comes out is also broken very easily. I&#x27;ve lost probably a good inch of eyeliner due to that design.</li>
    <li> Makes lashes so long and plush, looks like falsies. Lol.</li>
    <li> Eyeliner works great the mascara clumps bad and leaves eyelashes looking bad</li>
    <li> I get everything in order the product. this product was what I expected, fulfilled my expectations and arrived in perfect condition. I thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! It pumps out the lashes, and really seperated them! And they eyeliner is great! And it&#x27;s so cheap, there&#x27;s not a bad thing to say about this product!</li>
    <li> I got the falsies in waterproof and was very disspaointed, this one was a great choice, makes my lashes look very long and full. Recommend this to everyone, eyeliner was a gift, not the best, but it was free ;)</li>
    <li> I love these value packs! The eyeliner is great and the mascara isn&#x27;t too bad. It was my first time trying this mascara and I usually like maybelline but I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this one. The brush is very thin and makes a fine lash line. It doesn&#x27;t provide too much volume but overall I like it because I use other mascaras too make my lashes fuller.</li>
    <li> this product is too perfect !! and its super cheap i will be ordering much more in the future (:</li>
    <li> It came pretty fast. Today is the first day I have used it and I really like it. It really makes my eyelashes look good! I love it, and will probably keep buying it especially since it is sooo cheap!</li>
    <li> Nice but there&#x27;s another product from the same brand much better.</li>
    <li> It lives up to the name &#x27;one by one&#x27;, defining my lashes without clumps and separates them one by one.Honestly the eye liner that came with it sucked, always breaking off, But I didn&#x27;t need it anyway so it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and last forever and always day! Lol,  only problem is that the packing was sorta open at the bottom and also, the eyeliner was terrible!!! But, I love the mascara!! It&#x27;s amazing! Good product!  I will definitely buy the mascara again but, not the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> PEFRECT!!! I have NEVER had a mascara that has came on like this one. I LOVE IT!!! The eyeliner is cheap and breaks off easily though.</li>
    <li> Okay.. ordered this item very optimistic! The mascara clumps my lashes :( and the eyeliner is poop! So thin and light. Piece of crapppp!</li>
    <li> you should buy it! within 2 days my mascara had arrived. you wont regret buying it. i bought it twice and i had no problem with that.</li>
    <li> It shipped so fast, so that was very pleasant and the products work great! Same thing that you would pick up at the drug store but cheaper!! I love it.  I will definitely be purchasing from them again and I have already recommended it to my friends!</li>
    <li> The eyeliner unfortunately is not smudge-proof :( But other than that, it&#x27;s a good product. Love the mascara. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I absolutely love the unstoppable eyeliner &amp; with a mascara thrown in for under $3 I had to have it. Now, the Maybelline one by one is my favorite mascara &amp; Ive ordered more. I use all Maybelline&#x27;s products &amp; plan on stocking up before these items are discontinued. I priced this set at Wal-mart &amp; its $9.48. The seller recently went up .10 but its still way to good to pass up. Highly recommended on both. This mascara isnt water proof but the eyeliner is &amp; withstands sweating, &amp; playing in the pool with my two toddler&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I got this cz it was a good deal, and I was surprised at how much I love the mascara! It&#x27;s great, but seems to go fast. The eyeliner is so-so.</li>
    <li> love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got exactly what us pictured, and it arrived rather quickly. However, it doesn&#x27;t go on very easily and the brush is strange and doesn&#x27;t give any length to my lashes. Won&#x27;t be buying this mascara again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was alright the eyeliner in it sucked !&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have gotten a better quality eye liner with it for that type of money .</li>
    <li> It does have much make up on the wand when I put it on.  My eyelashes don&#x27;t make a big statement.</li>
    <li> It was ok. A little too clumpy for me. I had to comb my eyelashes to separate them and get the clumps off.</li>
    <li> The deal seems great but the eyeliner was cracked before I even used it. The mascara is good quality and doesn&#x27;t clump! It also gives volume without looking too crazy like the fake lashes version of maybelline.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin, so I need waterproof mascara and eyeliner. The one I currently use tends to smudge all over my eyelids (bottom and top). I found this package, and I thought it was a good deal. It&#x27;s only $3.89 with free shipping for this whole package. I think overall this would be a good set if you have dry skin and if you have no worries of your eyelashes of touching your face or eyelids touching as well. The mascara smudge on my bottom of my left eyelid by the end of the day. I was really disappointed and embarrassed that I worked an entire day with a messed up eyelid. The eyeliner seems to do well. I wanted to test these products out, so I put the eyeliner and mascara on my hand to seem how it will test if I smudge it and water it. The mascara was smudge proof, but the eyeliner smudge like heck. Both products seemed to be waterproof, but when you rub the mascara after it&#x27;s wet, it flaked out eventually. After washing my hand, the mascara was completely removed, but part of the eyeliner remained on the back of my hand. I am mutual but siding more with dislike with this set. Act with precaution if you would like to test this set out. It is a good deal and may work for others, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for, i was looking for this mascara and eyeliner at walmart and im guessing it was pretty popular because everytime i went they never had this mascara. I love how this mascara works for me, and i love just how smooth the eyeliner is. i highly recommend if your thinking on buying.</li>
    <li> The mascara was dry but the eye liner was very nice</li>
    <li> No drip. No clumps. Love it! This is perfect! Im impressed! It doesnt smudges and it stays all day. You can cry and it wont run! The eyeliner is also amazing but Im in love with the mascara! Would buy again and recommend to a friend! Good luck!</li>
    <li> Love the mascara, and the eyeliner is pretty good too, but the makeup will come out too far quite frequently. I was actually able to get it to screw back down, but it&#x27;s hard. I also wish it could be sharpened. Seller was great though, and I use the mascara everyday.</li>
    <li> [...]    Please watch my review on youtube my channel is cocotommi512 and i upload a lot of videos! Subscribe, like, and comment! Thanks</li>
    <li> I love Maybelline mascara and this value pack is great. Its is long lasting and i dont have to carry it around for touch ups.</li>
    <li> I love this sets! The eyeliner is great and the mascara is just what I wanted! The eyeliner is soft but really easy to use.</li>
    <li> The mascara really catches each lash as it advertises one by one.  Not a fan of the eyeliner, it doesn&#x27;t stay on and I end up with black bags within an hour of applying.  The mascara has a nice formula that you can somewhat play with before it dries.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when it came a couple days earlier! Neat and sealed packaging, clean product, everything I bought came no problem. Very good mascara, doesn&#x27;t clump but I still like to run a spoolie through just for maximum separation. I&#x27;m really sad maybelline discontinued this, but im glad I bought it here. Oh the eyeliner works good too, nice opaque black shade &amp; It doesn&#x27;t smudge that much on me. I would reccomend this &amp; thank you</li>
    <li> The product was good for the price.</li>
    <li> i bought this mainly for the unstoppable eye liner. i love this eyeliner and onyx is hard to  find where i live</li>
    <li> I love the Maybelline New York Volum&#x27; Express mascara and eyeliner. It works great and my eyelashes look fuller that they do with other mascara.</li>
