<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very reasonable and good to use.</li>
    <li> Got as a s to king stuffer for my husband and.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> works like a charm runs on one battery for months</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly, was easy to clean. Did everything I expected it to do.</li>
    <li> It works okay, not great.  It just barely takes away the hair after several passes.</li>
    <li> It works well..as expected. My nose is full of hair and its turning gray...so it always looks bad.. The trimmer has cleaned it up and I&#x27;m not worried about it anymore. I recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> The one I have been using for nearly eight years has been very good. The switch is so hard in this one and it doesn&#x27;t cut the nose hair cleanly.</li>
    <li> Have not had it too long yet, but it works well.  No complaints for what I paid and it&#x27;s performance, a solid product.</li>
    <li> It takes a little too long to trim the nose hairs. I have to do it every other day. Light weight and quiet.</li>
    <li> Orders @ first one missing a piece. Order replacement one &amp; missing the same piece. Requwested refund this time.</li>
    <li> Cheap piece of crap that doesn&#x27;t work good at all. I was surprised because the reviews didn&#x27;t seem that bad. Whal just went down hill big time, I bought a Wahl set of clippers that were a cheap piece of crap also. I will no longer buy there products and its as shame because they use to be the best.</li>
    <li> I have had two others and this one works great.  The others did a crummy job.  Not this one! Rally pleased!</li>
    <li> Husband really likes it, it&#x27;s easy to use and cuts well.  The light only helps slightly, and only if someone else is using it.  Don&#x27;t buy it for the light.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a good product.  However, the eyebrow and sideburns triming feature is not nearly as good as the nose and ear hair trimming.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer that I have ever used. not only is it great for my ear, nose and brow.It trims my mustache so easily. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazon was gracious enough to take back a Panasonic trimmer that not only didn&#x27;t work, it was painfull to use. I  received the Wahl Trimmer and have been happy with the results. It trims nose &amp; ear hairs without clogging right away and without the pain of being pulled out. I recommend the Wahl 5546-200 Deluxe Trimmer.</li>
    <li> This thing does everything it says it will. I am very happy and it cost less then 10 bucks. Not sure I really need the light, but as long as it trims my brows, I&#x27;m a happy camper. I have spent more on lesser products, I recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it!  The additional heads seem to be working great, it&#x27;s so nice not to see his nose hairs.</li>
    <li> I am a lady in my sixties and have left behind the small scissors to do the job.  This little apparatus works great and it does not pull or nick and I am finished in 60 seconds!  I do recommend this for nose hair removal.  Also, I benefitted from Amazon&#x27;s unbeatable pricing, packing and free shipping.</li>
    <li> This product is made of cheap plastic.  After inserting the battery the trimmer lasted about 20 seconds before it broke. Do not waste your time and money.  I am looking for something better right now!</li>
    <li> The best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. Really gets the nose hairs. Why only 4 stars, well because as a eye brow clipper or side burn clipper or ear hair remover its only fair.&lt;br /&gt;Updated&lt;br /&gt;From four to 2 stars died to fast.</li>
    <li> Can not recommend this product. Cutting is terrible for a trimmer. I have had other Wahl products that worked great and I expected the same not so.</li>
    <li> Great price. Nice made. Suggest to everyone!</li>
    <li> Pretty good over all. Feels a little cheap in the hand compared to previous models.</li>
    <li> ok.  I prefer the comb style units.</li>
    <li> Perfect Nose Trimmer! So easy to use, and trims Perfectly. Have a light too, so that you never miss a hair.....Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Finally if its one thing my husband needed to get rid of was the nose hair.. this thing is great pulls them right out and fast no pain</li>
    <li> Very well built and inexpensive. Same great quality you can expect from all Wahl products. Well worth the ten dollars.Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> We all have hair in our nose. The older I get the longer they grow. I got tired of using sissor type trimmers so I bought this device. I received it today &amp; tried it. No nicking, no pulling &amp; no hairs left in my nose as before. Also took a lot less time. I&#x27;m a female, but no matter what gender you are I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product I bought it because of other reviewer&#x27;s commments and i am okay with it so far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace on that I used for years and finally died........&lt;br /&gt;this one doesn&#x27;t whack off the hair in my nose and ears at all........&lt;br /&gt;(can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing this--getting old sucks)</li>
    <li> Though this is the first product of this type I have ever used, this product seems to be efficient enough. It was a bit smelly at first, but this may just be due to newness or simply the way they all are. No pulling of hairs, no pain. Overall, it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I ordered the trimmer on 10/13 and received it on 10/15/13 before 12pm  This the best multi purpose trimmer. I have ever purchased . It  easy to operate, clean and works better then electrical trimmer. I highly recommend Wahl5546-200 Ear, Nose and Brow trimmer .</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Wahl trimmer for keeping the weed patch inside my nose under control and it was great - until the blade dulled after many years.  So I replaced it with the newer model, which is just not the same quality.  The motor made a constant squealing noise that did not inspire confidence.  It was not the cutter but the motor since the sound was the same with the cutting head removed.  It did spin but it was unnerving for something that goes up your nose.  The cutter tended to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; hairs at times (ouch!) and never seemed to get it all like the previous model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually threw it away as junk since it didn&#x27;t do the job well and the squealing was quite annoying.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on other reviews I had read.  I have had other nose hair trimmers that worked, but hurt when used.  This one works and does not hurt.  It&#x27;s operation is smoothe and pain free.  Thank you prior reviewers for steering me to this product.</li>
    <li> Wimpy. Won&#x27;t be surprised if it breaks next time my boyfriend uses it. Spend the money on something nicer.</li>
    <li> Far too loud to have anywhere near your ear.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of similar products before buying this.  I previously had the Panasonic, which was excellent and trimmed very closely, the way you would want it to on parts of your face.  Unfortunately that one is no longer made, and we are left with a variety of inadequate trimmers to select from.  I chose this one because it&#x27;s Wahl and they make excellent horse trimmers that trim very closely, which actually gives me an idea, I should probably buy another one of those and try it on me, because it would probably work better than this or any of the others available for human use.  I suspect all the manufacturers are afraid of getting sued if someone gets cut so they&#x27;ve retracted the cutting blades so much that the trimmers are completely ineffective.  My advice is to buy the cheapest one of these because none of them are going to do the job anyway.  The light is totally useless, so don&#x27;t waste any extra money on it.  Buy a good pair of tweezers as you&#x27;ll need them to actually pull out unwanted hairs.</li>
    <li> I suppose if you have peach fuzz in your ears and nose this might work. This trimmer takes significantly longer than my older Panasonic trimmer, and it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as the Panasonic. I own a Wahl beard/mustache trimmer that works well, so I&#x27;m quite disappointed that this trimmer is so poor. Fortunately it was cheap, but in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 hair trimmers from Amazon....this Panasonic, the Phillips Norelco and the Wahl 5546-200.  Wahl and Panasonic easy to use and they work really well.  Philips Norelco one star and very difficult to use and figure out.  So if u r in the market, I suggest either this unit or Wahl...they are similar...do not buy Philips Norelco NT9110</li>
    <li> Looks great,but haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it yet.</li>
    <li> The nose hair part is good but the other attachment is useless.</li>
    <li> This device is well-designed and so far it has worked well for me. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the light feature or what, but this doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful. Does the job, but takes extra time compared to similar models.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the cheap price</li>
    <li> This is what I have been looking for. I have in the past bought a number of nose hair trimmers but them have all fallen short of what I was looking for. The small light that comes with this is just a brilliant idea and makes it so much easier to use.</li>
    <li> Like the title says. It&#x27;s simple, effective, and seems fairly robust. Nothing spectacular, but it does what it needs to so hey</li>
    <li> This product work fine to my experience, the nose clipping is perfect, but if you want it for the purpose of trimming eyebrows,&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t bother the attachment is basically useless. So I&#x27;m only judging this product base on the job of nose trimming with it does just fine.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is perfect for me. The light at the cutting tip is real nice. Getting old and more light is appreciated. So far I like it and it works every time I turn it on.  Once again my shopping made easy thanks to Amazon.</li>
    <li> terrible item.  i had one for 5.oo long ago and was great, this one is junk--opps 4 more words required.</li>
    <li> It trims pain free, but the light went out the first time I used it. Glad it was only $10 :0/</li>
    <li> For the price and quality Wahl works.  You have wide open slits and rotating blade for reaching real man hairs unlike competition that are smaller have high performance motors but dont cut worth a flip. Wahl is best bang for buck.</li>
    <li> decently priced and works well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very effective;  my husband had to go to a Dept. store and find me something more effective; it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> It works just fine, but the best part is, it has stopped my wife complaining about those errant nose hairs.</li>
    <li> I use the rotating cutter so I won&#x27;t comment on the other two that are included. First one of these I&#x27;ve used that actually does what they say it does! Cleans those pesky ear hairs and nose hairs nicely. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This thing does not work and has no serial number on the back, it demands one on the website.  It never finishes the update process either, stuck at 93%.  There is a spot for the serial number on the back - empty (oh, it says &#x27;S/N&#x27;!)</li>
    <li> product works better than the cheap one I bought at K mart</li>
    <li> I purchased both the Panasonic ER-GN30-k and the Wahl 5546-200. I had high hopes for the Wahl, but it didn&#x27;t cut hair as close as the Panasonic did. There were some hairs that it just wouldn&#x27;t touch (even though they&#x27;re right there!). The Panasonic didn&#x27;t have any problems.    The difference might be related to the design of the end of the blade guard, as the Wahl is wide open, where the Panasonic blade guard kind of wraps around the top or tip of the blade.     I would recommend the Panasonic over the Wahl by a mile.</li>
    <li> No problems Got for husband bday and he seems to like I a lot.  So far so good everything works great. Buy it</li>
    <li> not a lot of power.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I would buy a rechargeable one next time.  I</li>
    <li> My wife not subtlety hinted a few days ago that I needed to consider trimming my nose hairs. Being only 41 years old it is not something I had other considered before and was not very comfortable with the thought of putting a blade up my nose and into my ears. But, this device was very comfortable and easy to use--absolutely no pain so I am completely satisfied and would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I gave this one star because they couldn&#x27;t go any lower but really very disappointed on this product I had it one day and that already broke motor burned up on it I never buy another one of the days thank you very much. Bjwolf</li>
    <li> Has anyone else noticed that as you grow older, all your hair migrates from the top of your head into your nose, ears and onto your eyebrows? This is like the Border Patrol for immigrating follicles only without the 4-wheel drive vehicles, badges or weapons. The built-in light is perfect for those late-night, covert ops. Talk about some serious trench warfare...this little item will solve all your ECA (Extra-Coiffure Activities) and put that smile back on your neatly-trimmed face. Disclaimer: Item will NOT restore scalp hair growth unless Super Glue is purchased separately.</li>
    <li> Used the rotary head to trim my nasal hair, and the Wahl did a very good job.  I was surprised at how well and effortlessly it removed the hair.  There was no pulling hair period.  Next I used the detail head with the brow guard attached to it.  Happy to say my eyebrows now look like they should.  The guard stayed on and never moved.  Don&#x27;t know about the durability of the Wahl because I just got it, but it does have a three year warranty which is nice.  Overall, I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and it does the job. He doesn&#x27;t want to take the plunge and get his nose waxed. Not sure why you would need a light on it but then again why do you need a light on your vacuum cleaner?</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say that I am returning this item. Based on the other reviews I thought this was a winner. Maybe I just got a bad one.  CON: 1) The battery door came open every time I have tried use to the nose trimmer. The nose trimmer is supposed to be usable in the shower. I can&#x27;t imagine what water would do to the trimmer upon entering the the battery chamber. 2)The slick, as in slippery, chrome \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch will not slide with any kind of finger pressure. I had to place a finger nail behind the switch and push from the back to turn the trimmer on. I am a mechanic and this thing just won&#x27;t work.  PRO: The motor is very good. It cuts well. Feels solid. Well, what good is that if the above referanced problems exist.</li>
    <li> So many of the other reviews for products of this nature go on and on about part number this, or name brand that. Really? All I wanted to know is if it does the job advertised. And this one does. It cuts without pulling. I don&#x27;t feel like its gonna go crazy and drill my brain out. It just works. The little light at the end could be useful if I had a seriously huge nose....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but if you&#x27;re looking for an effective product, get this one. It does the job it says it will.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a simple device that gets what I wanted done, done. If you are taking this as a travel tool take the battery out. The only &amp;#34;fault&amp;#34; i would give it, is that there is no way to lock it as off, in case any jostling should turn it on.</li>
    <li> The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that it the motor could run just a little faster.</li>
    <li> I never worked very well and is now broken</li>
    <li> Best tool for a guy it works well..</li>
    <li> Works well for the nose but difficult for use on the ears.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve written in a journal for many years, and this is my go-to brand for the past several years.  It&#x27;s simple and, most importantly, has a page for every single day of the year--even weekends.  I use it to keep track of my very busy life, and I also like that the pages are made of recycled paper.  And I NEVER throw them away!  I plan to keep them all forever.  And believe me, they&#x27;re durable enough to stand the test of time.</li>
    <li> Used maybe 6-8 times over the course of a year or less and it just stopped working. Why does stuff have to be so crappy these days?</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised. Works well for me. Light does nothing to help, but still a good product. Tried another brand with long snout, but am happier with round cutter.</li>
    <li> Used this to trim some nose hairs and it works great. I like the fact that its completely sealed so I can rinse it when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I like this item because it is battery powered which makes it nice. It has changeable heads also make it nice. I use this item to trim unwanted nose hairs and ear hairs.</li>
    <li> I love it. It shapes and cuts without pulling.</li>
    <li> Would have had more stars with a cap to protect the blades and two speeds like the one I lost and can&#x27;t remember the brand. Cuts okay.</li>
    <li> Very noisy when trimming ear hair, like breaking glass in your ear.  Does not go far enough into nostril. Should have researched farther before purchasing.</li>
    <li> This unit just doesn&#x27;t trim very well. Don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s just a bad blade design or what.</li>
    <li> I tried many of these and found this set to be superior to any I have used in the past.  I thought they were all junk until I bought this set.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s barber was not doing as good of a job as I had wished, so I made this purchase to fine tune the grooming at home. Works well, well made, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Received this item yesterday. It feels really sturdy &amp; easy to handle. Don&#x27;t want to sound stupid but I can&#x27;t figure out how to attach the attachments. The instructions are not very detailed. I can&#x27;t see how the attachments fit on to the head. If anyone who has used the attachments can help me out I&#x27;d be very grateful. I tried it with the nose hairs &amp; it worked fine so I give it 3 stars to start. If I can figure out the rest of it I&#x27;ll be happy to change this rating.</li>
    <li> I am ashamed to say it, but I am a young man that has a terrible nose hair problem. I used to just use the scissors but painfully decided to try something better. I have been through several \\&quot;trimmers\\&quot; that were all very cheap and rightfully so...they were terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew  that I had to find something better. At first I was a little hesitant because of the price, but ultimately gave this a chance based on the name \\&quot;wahl\\&quot;. Every Wahl product I have ever used has been wonderful and shouldn&#x27;t have expected anything different from this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does such a great job at getting rid of those pesky nose hairs that can be very embarrassing, especially for such a young, good-looking guy like myself. To my surprise it does&#x27;t snag hairs nor does it miss any. It got every hair that it came across and now I can see no visible hair in my nose. Probably will only use this for my nose, but will update if I use it for something else.</li>
    <li> Works great as promised!</li>
    <li> CAME IN MAIL PUT THE BATTERY IN AND IT DID EVEN TURN ON. DEFECTIVE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!</li>
    <li> Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
    <li> IT DID EVERYTHING IT IS ADVERTISED TO DO.</li>
    <li> Hi all  I was looking for one of those for my father for a long time, it&#x27;s an excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
    <li> This product was &#x27;cheap&#x27; and effective! Which was just the combination I was going for.. No complaints so far.  D</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband &amp; he likes how it trims regardless of the size of area he wants to trim.</li>
    <li> Does a good job on ear/nose hairs. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my father and he appears to love it, because he never has wild hairs sticking out from any strange places now</li>
    <li> I had a septoplasty and sinus work done done to resolve breathing problems and the surgeon recommended I buy a nose hair trimmer. I checked out the various trimmers and the Wahl seemed like a good bet, so I bought it. When I received it, I unpackaged it and found that the overall construction was surprisingly solid! I was expecting it to be flimsy and very plasticky, but really, the construction is fairly solid for what it is. The only criticism I have with the construction is the switch knob is a little cheap compared to the rest of the unit. The case consists of a combination of rubberized-coated plastic and what appears to be brushed stainless steel or aluminum.  The cutting heads are changed by twisting the head counter-clockwise approximately 1/10 of a turn then lifting it, and there is an obvious firm detent holding it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first turned it on, the light seemed unimpressive. I thought it was going to be useless (but read on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it immediately, since after the septum and sinus surgery I have been using small scissors to trim the nose hairs. I found that the trimmer cut the hairs very close and cleanup was a cinch. Also, at no point did I experience any pinching, scraping or any other sensations one might fear from sticking a rapidly spinning blade up one&#x27;s nose, and the vibration was not enough to cause any pain whatsoever nor did it nick my septum - a concern since my septum is still a bit tender.  Also, I was pleased to find that the light is actually perfectly-suited for helping guide the cutter in my nostrils, helping me to see any hairs I missed.  My previous impression of the light is now not a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cutting heads go - the nose trimmer is fine. The eyebrow trimmer is another matter: the snap-on guide is a bit chintzy; it does not clamp on well, and seems poorly designed. The feature seems as though it is nothing more than an afterthought so the marketing folks could add another bullet point to the packaging.  The trimmer itself seems fine - I usually leave my brows to my hairdresser, but I decided to try it out. It does what it is supposed to, but I could see someone losing the guide very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way when I opened it, I found that it came with an alkaline AA battery - a really thoughtful detail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a nose trimmer, I am very pleased with it and rating it a 5, since the other features do not matter to me.  As an eyebrow trimmer, I would give this unit a miss, unless you want to glue the trimming guide on.to the packaging.

    <li> I spent a few more dollars to get a product name I trust. I have a Wahl trimmer that I&#x27;ve cut my hair with for 30 years and it works like new, so this name means a lot to me. I owned a Panasonic plastic version of this trimmer for a few years, but it literally fell apart. It worked ok, but seized up regularly unless the battery was very fresh. This Wahl, so far, seems to be of much higher quality, seems to work better (the interior of my nose hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years!), and I believe will last much longer than the cheaper alternatives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an an old Remington I&#x27;ve been using for like 7 or 8 years.  I remember back then it was hard to find a battery operated nose/ear trimmer that worked on regular batteries.  Anyhow, the Remington is too dull now so it was time to replace....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this particular Wahl because it came with the light.  And I often use a little flashlight to make sure I got all the &amp;#34;jungle trees&amp;#34; cleaned out.  If you&#x27;re a man over 40 you don&#x27;t need that explained to you.  This coming from a man who only needs to shave his face about twice a week, but needs ear and nose maintenance every other day.  So anyways, I thought cool, a light right on the end of the chainsaw.  But forget about it.  The light is way too dim too be of any use.  Hence the 4 instead of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a trimmer, this Wahl rocks!  I hadn&#x27;t realized just how dull the old Remington was until I used the Wahl.  Nothing really special about the Wahl.  It does work without any issues.  The Remington never did.  It had a problem staying on and often needs to be hit like an old crappy flashlight.  Not the Wahl.  Been a couple weeks and it&#x27;s still cutting like a champ.  It was about $10 from Amazon.  Buy the one without the light if it&#x27;s cheaper because the light really is useless.  Both of the cutting ends work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I really like how hard it is to turn on the switch.  It takes some force.  The Remington didn&#x27;t and used to come on by itself when in my luggage.  Try explaining that one in the airport security check line - buzzzzz.  I&#x27;ve learned to remove the battery from the Remington or it&#x27;ll be dead by the time I get anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping the Remington in my travel bag and the Wahl in the bathroom as my daily trimmer.  For $10, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Ive owned for about a month. No complaints. Works even better than I though it would. great buy!</li>
    <li> sons birthday present, he had wanted one for a while, but waited till we found a wahl, found it here !</li>
    <li> Just wish it was rechargable, like their multi-trim &amp; groom kit. Make it so and i&#x27;ll give it five stars.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works fine but the design is top-heavy, causing it to tip over easily when it is stored standing up ( as in a medicine cabinet). Other than that, I really like the way it works</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Excellent for all types of trimming. Works great on eye brows keeping them in check. Light does not do much for enhanced trimming. Like that this unit is battery operated.</li>
    <li> Upon opening this product I was missing the eyebrow guide piece. Other than that my boyfriend says the product works great.</li>
    <li> The Wahl cuts closely without pulling. I almost ordered a trimmer from another manufacturer, until I discovered that this one uses the same motor and costs less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of these little multi-tool trimmers in the past and most are pretty cheap and you always get what you pay for. I can say about this unit that while it is cheap it does work pretty well. Removes the unwanted hair with ease and comfort. Nose and Brow trimming works perfectly fine for me with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few reviews that said the little clip doesn&#x27;t stay on well. Mine does. It comes with two little notches on each side and theres 2 indentations on the unit that they go into. The little clip is rather small so i can see how someone might not clip it in properly. If you take the time to look at it and clip it in properly it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and the battery last. definitely helps trim the nose and brows with ease. So for you hairy guys this works</li>
    <li> I saw in a catalogue &amp;#34;rated the best.&amp;#34; So, I purchased it and I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works ok, doesn&#x27;t give close trim.</li>
    <li> After using a Panasonic model and one from the Sharper Image for the past 10 years I needed something better. The Panasonic was weak and could not cut nose hairs even with a brand new battery. It was literally like trying to cut tall grass with an electric lawn mower -- just not enough power for the job! The one from the Sharper Image was not much better. However, I bought this Wahl unit, having already a Wahl trimmer with multiple heads for beard, sideburns, moustache and touch up that I have been very pleased with for the past 3 years. This one does not disappoint! It does not lose power at all, and trims the nose hair like a tractor with a bush hog! I mean it! It does not pinch, pull hairs, or bog down, and that is exactly what I was hoping for. Get one. You will see for yourself.</li>
    <li> so far works ok, the light is a joke. unit is a little big and clunky but at least it works</li>
    <li> The best little product ever. Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Works well, good blade, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used your brand throughout my lifetime.  The tradition was handed down from father to son.  I started noticing hair in my nose and ears.  I was grossed out at first but then I took preventive measures and purchased your product online.  I am hair free in places that should never of hair hair growing in the first place.</li>
    <li> I bought many many brands and this one is superior!  Excellent and easy to use.  Wished it would have come with a holding case, but a clear makeup bag works as well.</li>
    <li> I no longer look like a mastadon foraging for food.</li>
    <li> Failed to work out of the box. Sometimes it would run, but most of time it did not have enough power to start or continue running.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. As advertised.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes wonderful products.  This is one of them.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, and he thinks it&#x27;s great.  Good value for the cost, and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Quiet, powerful smooth-running motor,  Worked right out of the box.  Blades are shielded so no fear of snips or snags.  A great deal.</li>
    <li> Hello Wahl ear and nose clippers and goodbye to poking myself in the nostril with scissors or slicing my ear with my razor.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to store, easy to clean and PAINLESS/CUTPROOF.  But don&#x27;t count on the microscopic sized &amp;#34;integrated mini-spotlight&amp;#34; for any airport landing strip quality lighting when it&#x27;s buried inside of your nose or ear.</li>
    <li> This nose/ear/brow hair shaver is great. It does exactly as expected and the price is fantastic compared to the in store prices. The light is a great added feature. It does not use up batteries very quickly. It is a very quiet shaver and it is the quality of a WHAL. I take it on vacation it is a great size to put in my suit case.</li>
    <li> This item was a total waste of money. The trimmer guard for eyebrows broke off the first time I used it, and the motor stopped working after about the third time it was used. While it did work, it did a terrible job on nose hair, pulling or not cutting at all.</li>
    <li> it did not work at all and I did not save the receipt.  so I through the device away,  it may be good, I don&#x27;t really know</li>
    <li> This is a really good trimmer. I would recommend it and would buy one again. It&#x27;s great quality and trims without any cuts.</li>
    <li> I have a few machines by this brand and for some reason i was expecting it to be a bit more powerful than it is but i guess it will have to work tell i could replace it.</li>
    <li> Works great and the prce is just right. As will all Wahl products this one lives up to the Wahl name</li>
    <li> Item works as advertised.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to use, works very well &amp; the price is right.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money! Works as good as a more expensive one. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have thought about buying a trimmer for quite a while.  After this purchase, I can only wonder why I waited so long.</li>
    <li> Great Trimmer! Quiet and effective. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These tools just don&#x27;t work well this is our second and it is no better than the first, good idea but not working</li>
    <li> GREAT JOB ON THAT PESKY NOSE HAIR...AND NO PULLING!!!</li>
    <li> Works fine, although I liked my older model better.  No real problems with this one, except it keeps tipping over when I try to stand it on a shelf.  Maybe they could flare out the bottom a little to help it stand.</li>
    <li> My husband was actually really excited to break it open and check everything out. He said it really worked for him and he was pleased with it so far. He did not encounter any pulls of snags. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use on his nose, ears, and eyebrows. I debated between a few brands but ultimately went with this model because we&#x27;ve always been happy with WAHL products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband reports that there is a slight amount of tugging with this trimmer but nothing more than a mild discomfort. It does a great job of trimming hairs - what more can you ask? So many of the trimmers on the market are cheaply made, do a sub-par job, and break or stop working after a few uses. He has used this one multiple times now and is pretty happy with it. I&#x27;m glad we finally found one that works as it should and seems to be solidly built.</li>
    <li> This product does not fulfill its promise.  The nose clipper attachment does not get close to the skin, so you are left with hair you dont want.  The clipper, when I tried it, did not even clip the hair around my ears - it just mangled the hair a little.  Look elsewhere for a quality product.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband for a gift.  It&#x27;s sturdy and well built, very happy with this purchase.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Delivery was as indicated. This product is hard to turn on and doesn&#x27;t cut the nose hair easily.</li>
    <li> The batteries lasted longer than the trimmer.......Wish you could get quality products and didn&#x27;t have to keep purchasing junk and throwing them away.</li>
    <li> I was worried that this might be uncomfortable to yes but so far it&#x27;s been working great.  Tickles a little but other than that no discomfort and it does a great job trimming those pesky hairs.</li>
    <li> Use for nose and ear hair trimming.  Plus, occasional re-trim around ears.  Great that unit uses common batteries.  Not sure how light contributes to effectiveness.</li>
    <li> its great  long battery life  does a good job like all the attachments  and the ease of cleaning it !!</li>
    <li> Wahl makes quality products at affordable prices and above all all of their products that I have purchased works well.  This device is no exception.  Not only does it cut those little annoying growths with ease it is quiet and easy to clean.  I seldom have need for the light and have yet determined if the light can be cut off which is as minor a distraction as can be.  I would have designed the protective cover for the cutter a little larger so that careless folks such as I would not lose it but that too is no big deal nor above all is it a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Just right and dependable.</li>
    <li> Same thing I said before not just toss it in the hallway. Next time I ll think twice before ordering.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. How many products meet that standard anymore? Wayward hairs? Get this. Problem solved.</li>
    <li> I had a Wahl similar to this for years that worked perfectly until it wore out.  This one, supposedly a step-up, not so much.  Blades aren&#x27;t as sharp.  Frankly I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> this is a quality product. comfortable to hold . easy to learn to use. holds a charge for a long time, easy to clean,and when you are done, it makes you feel good.</li>
    <li> Wahl Nose &amp; Brow Trimmer works so much better than the past 2 brands that I had previously purchased.  Extremely satisfied!!</li>
    <li> First time I have used this product and find it to be efficient and reliable.  I was unhappy and discarded My Remington product-it would not do a thorough job, and it tended to overheat--unless I had a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> works great. i bought this cause i lost my last one and wouldn&#x27;t you know it as soon as this one gets here i find it.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made product that does the job nicely.  It was very easy to use, and is a very good combination of utility for ear, nose, and eyebrow grooming.  The Wahl design fits nicely in my hand and makes it easy to use.  The micro light is nice, but I don&#x27;t find it particularly that useful.  It&#x27;s not distracting, but doesn&#x27;t have enough light to really make a difference.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great! It provides the kind of service one would expect from a company like Wahl. There is no pain what so ever&lt;br /&gt;when used. It is easy to use and the quality is superb.</li>
    <li> Works better then any project I have tried.</li>
    <li> These are great for us old guys that have to keep out nose hair trimmed. I&#x27;ve bought and used several other brands and these are by far the best. They work great and seem to be a quality product.</li>
    <li> This has been a great replacement to my previous trimmer.  It cuts well and the blade moves fast, so there is no pulling.  The way I use it, the light has little use.  I have just used the light a few times when I have  a few stray hairs around my mustache that I use this for to get as I check the mirror.  Nice grip, too. I used it once for eyebrows, and wasn&#x27;t too thrilled.  Also, the attachment it came with for that more easily comes off.  So I&#x27;m just rating it for the other things. Recommended for those hard to get places!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not great. Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as it should.  And there is no hair catcher, as other devices have, so you have hairs all over the sink and in your nose after a good trimming.  Been using it for a few months now and it still works and it has not nicked me or pulled any hair.</li>
    <li> The regargeablility is a nice feature vs. new batteries all the time, yet the &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; is not perfect. If you are buying this for nose hair removal, just know that it takes a long time to go over and over the same area to truly remove all the hair.</li>
    <li> 2nd purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done...  Not the most powerful clipper I used but it works.  Just wish it had a turbo.</li>
    <li> This product was a definite upgrade from my previous one, and very easy to clean as well.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Still misses some hair...had to pass it over hair stands a few times before being comfortable with how clean it trimmed hair.</li>
    <li> Used one time. Does not cut anything.  What a waste of money. Go to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and get a good one cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like the light and and the size of this unit.  It was a gift and he absolutely loved it.  It shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I had a &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; type nose and ear trimmer that lasted several years.  When it started biting me instead of triming I replaced it with the Wahl.  This has been a good product so far.  I rate as a 4 instead of 5 because it leave some short (very short) stubble I can feel.  I can not see the stubble, so it has to be very short.  I would recommend this product to friends</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a Sharper Image trimmer that really didn&#x27;t do much of anything; it never felt like it trimmed any nose or ear hair for me. This one definitely trims hair off, at the expense of a slight pull or tickle in my nose. It is bearable, but makes trimming a little uncomfortable. The other attachment for trimming outside ear hair or eyebrows works very well. For the cost, it is a good value and does the job. The LED is pretty useless though...unless you plan on trimming in the dark!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> As far as hair trimmers go I actually really like this one. It get&#x27;s a little hot sometimes but other than that it works great. Wahl is a good brand too.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times now and it works great! It does what it is supposed to do. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> all of the features i need plus no extra bulk to fill up my medicine cabinet.  A+A+A+A+A+A+A+  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> looks great its a awesome product no complains here.</li>
    <li> Works just as described, love it!</li>
    <li> Cheap and does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Worked fine initially but stopped working after a few uses.  Will be returning it.</li>
    <li> This is a very low quality product. Do not buy if you want something that actually works. That is all.</li>
    <li> It works as expected.  It&#x27;s cheap but does the job.</li>
    <li> Great quality and my husband loves the light feature, says it makes a huge difference!</li>
    <li> √muy buen articulo compre desde venezuela saludos</li>
    <li> bought item for my husband. He does like it very much.Works very well so far.He uses it for nose and ear hairs.</li>
    <li> not the highest quality trimmer Ive ever owned but it does the job fine for the price</li>
    <li> It looks cool and well built, but it doesn&#x27;t do the best job in trimming nose, ear, and eyebrow hair.</li>
    <li> x Blade wears out quick and it eats batteries.</li>
    <li> Feels very cheap and light.  It cuts nose hair alright.  The built in light is completely useless. The device stopped functioning after about 3 months of use.  Opened it up to see if I could fix it, and it looks  like my first impressions about it being cheap were right: the motor had burned out.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer for nose and ears works well:-)  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had difficulty with nose and brow clippers for years.  My daughter-in-law said she liked the Wahl.  Buying from Amazon was a good idea.  The price was less than in the stores, and it was delivered quickly.  The Wahl exceeded my expectations.  Finally I have a clipper that works.  Thanks, Jean Oman</li>
    <li> Works well, but battery life short. Light in end is useless.</li>
    <li> Far too loud. Additionally, the blades on the trimmer are too far apart, which makes it really tough to get a close trim.</li>
    <li> worked fine....thank you</li>
    <li> My husband loves it is light and works really well, it was a very good purchase for him.  It also is easy to travel with, another plus.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great.</li>
    <li> I hate this  product - it died after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he was hesitant to use it.  The two heads make it so easy for personal grooming for him.  It is lightweight and very easy to use.  The nose head is a little trickier to attach than the ear head.</li>
    <li> Just got it today and tried with nose hair. Worked perfectly!  Did not try other functions yet, but like it. Would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY WORKS NOT A PIECE OF JUNK. It works well seems well made  and like most wahl items should hold up longer then the cheap trimmers that I have thrown away.</li>
    <li> I do not find it very useful.  It does not trim hair very well and I expected more out of it.  Why is there a flashlight? The flashlight is useless.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment! Product is as described, bought for boyfriend for Christmas. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! . . .</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for a relative who is very pleased that I purchased this sooner than Christmas just because!</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are bushy, like on some old men.  If I let them grow wild, it can be embarrassing, so I use eyebrow trimmers.  After the last one died, I decided on something that looked more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Wahl trimmer was a great buy.  It has a solid construction and is more versatile than my old [[ASIN:B002D1MZ34 Remington Mpt3500 Dual Blade Facial Trimmer]] and [[ASIN:B000FRVA8O Finishing Touch]].  I can use it on my eyebrows or in my ears or nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a trimmer in my nose, but I tried it with the Wahl and it doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit.  On the eyebrows, I get great results shortening them up.  I tried it for shaping, but it&#x27;s not good for that -- not even close . . . literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer can be used wet or dry.  I like it dry, but it&#x27;s nice to be able to just run it under water to wash.  No worries about batteries, it comes with the trimmer.  My only wish for it is to have a little compartment to hold the eyebrow attachment.  It&#x27;s so small, it could easily be lost if it should fall off.  If I lose that piece, I will be very sad.  I love my trimmer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present, so I haven&#x27;t personally used it myself; but I have seen the results! :)It works great, it&#x27;s easy to use, &amp; it was exactly what he needed! LOL Ladies, this is a great stocking stuffer, or add-on present for a birthday for your guy!</li>
    <li> Bought this for Christmas gift to my Dad and he likes it very much and he uses it often to groom himself.</li>
    <li> Nothing worked in the one I bought.The eyebrow piece broke in half the first time I used it. The other heads would not fit onto the top. I threw the whole thing away after trying to put it together for two days. It&#x27;s made in China.No quality control.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well and fits hand well. Cuts hair in nose and ears without pulling/pinching, although it takes a lot of repetitive movements to get it all. I have to push fairly hard to get it deep enough to get everything. It would be better if the cutter head was a little longer, long enough to reach deep into ears and nose, but short enough not to reach the ear drum. The LED light is useless, not bright enough to be of any use, plus when pressed against the ear or nose, the light is blocked. I previously tried a model with a longer flat cutting head, but it pinched/pulled and nicked so I returned it. There are not a lot of options for this process, so the 5546 is an OK choice.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Real easy to use.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great for the intended use, but I am a little dismayed at the build quality - the sliding switch that powers it on seems fragile and the light is mostly useless, but I have not encountered any real problems yet</li>
    <li> works well and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs. it cuts them easily and the light on the end is useful. i like that i can replace the battery rather than charge it (1 AA).</li>
    <li> Good price, compared to retail and delivered on-time. Well constructed and performs as advertised.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done.  As I get older I notice I like hair less and less.  I don&#x27;t want nose hairs, and this thing does a pretty good job at going after them.  I&#x27;ve had it a few months now and use it once a week and it has held up just fine.  For the money and the fact that this is a brand that&#x27;s well-known, it was hard not to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me, I didn&#x27;t really want it (thus the 4 instead of 5 stars) but I have to say it&#x27;s far less painful than my last nose trimmer.  No more yanks.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered. I&#x27;ve got the nose and ears and eyebrows covered. That&#x27;s something right there - an all in one. The blades are safe enough that I could probably groom the baby (not that I ever would), and yet, it can handle my coarser hair. It doesn&#x27;t take long to saw through it, either, which is a real bonus.</li>
    <li> Trims nose, ear and eyebrows as advertised using one AA battery. Pros: has a small LED, heads change easily and it does the job. What more would you want for the money? Cons: heads will get lost unless you find something to keep them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose trimmer is the circular kind, just turn on &amp; insert a couple of times and you&#x27;re done. The ear trimmer is a narrow \\&quot;saw\\&quot; type blade like most of these, and the eyebrow trimmer is actually just a plastic \\&quot;guide\\&quot; you snap over it to raise it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow guide isn&#x27;t as convenient as my old beard trimmer because it&#x27;s very narrow. However, it is quick and works well - read the directions because you should run WITH the direction of your hair... otherwise you can cut more than you may want.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to test it out and was surprised that no matter how many times I would go over my nose hairs and ear hairs, this trimmer would not cut them all.</li>
    <li> Good product and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Runs smoothly but could trim hair a little closer and has a slight odor when operating.  Overall works very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great tool for everyday needs.</li>
    <li> nice unit no pulling or cutting the inside of your nose with this one. Has met all my expectations. Light is also a nice feature</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to. I like it. Before this Wahl, I always bought Panasonic. I made the right choice with Wahl. I initially thought the light at the tip was a silly idea, but I like it!! I&#x27;ve used it for 6-8 monthe.</li>
    <li> I just bought this WAHL \\&quot;Ear, Nose &amp; Brow\\&quot; trimmer at a well-known bed and bath chain.  On-line from that chain it would have cost $26, but in-store there is no shipping cost and I used a $5 discount coupon; so, I got it for $15.89 with tax--not bad, and sorry Amazon, but your price wasn&#x27;t right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Shortcoming:  Unfortunately, the title is a bit of a bait and switch.  If eyebrow trimming is wanted one has to purchase that \\&quot;Eyebrow Guide\\&quot; attachment separately, even though the box SAYS it&#x27;s in there, it isn&#x27;t, and isn&#x27;t pictured--confusing.  Also, I could not remove the \\&quot;cutting head assembly\\&quot; (maybe with a pair of pliers?) in order to remove the nose trimming apparatus and replace it with a sideburn trimmer or a \\&quot;Detail Head\\&quot;--whatever the latter is; or simply to clean the trimmer better. But none of these shortcomings bother ME since all I wanted was a nose/ear hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I&#x27;ve always used manicure scissors to cut nose and ear hair, but have never been satisfied.  This trimmer DOES cut such growth quite short, with repeated probing.  I did not experience any hair pulls or receive any nicks no matter how close I pushed the trimmer head to the skin.  One is warned not to insert the trimmer too far, but that&#x27;s hardly likely.  It does heat up, but not uncomfortably.  I could hear that it seemed to run into a couple difficult hairs, but struggled with them only temporarily.  Over all, I prefer this method to the scissors or even a manually, non-powdered nose/ear hair trimmer which I have also tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer does not deal well with longer hairs on the outside of the ear or the earlobes--just can&#x27;t seem to catch them.  So..., a slight use the scissors may still be needed.  Maybe that non-existent \\&quot;Detail Head\\&quot; would handle this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  Well worth the discounted price of under $16; I would have balked at $26.  And it does have a three-year warranty and a 30-day money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 20, 2014:  Second thoughts.  I let several days go by and decided to use this hair-cutting tool.  It was disappointing.  It took me much longer than I&#x27;d hoped, couldn&#x27;t handle the longer nasal hairs, and I had to continually probe in all directions.  I ended up using my trusty manicure scissors to REALLY remove those pesky nose and ear hairs.  And I could do the job both faster and better.  So..., for those who don&#x27;t have the flexibility or patience, I suppose this device is better than the alternative:  using competing devices.014:  Second thoughts.

    <li> WORKS REAL GOOD AND THE LIGHT IT HAS REALLY HELPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE TOLD SOME FRIENDS ABOUT THIS HANDY ITEM AND I THINK 2 OR 3 OF THEM MOST LIKELY ORDERED ONE.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. He loves it enough for me to be able to rate it a 5 star rating</li>
    <li> Super personal trimmer for men of all ages, love the ease of use and the design, works perfectly as described. Surely and recommend</li>
    <li> I had one before and it finally wore out so this new replacement is better than ever. Try it and you will like it.</li>
    <li> got the product on time and at a great price. it works good and the little light helps out too</li>
    <li> Honestly I have tried many different types of nose hair trimmers. The first Wahl I had was from about 10 years ago and those worked really well and it didn&#x27;t pull any hairs out. Then when it came time to buy a new one I ended up buying the Vortex by Panasonic due to their excellent reviews. But I stopped trimming my nose hairs for awhile because it pulled hairs out and I didnt like using it. This caused me to not cut my nose hairs for a few months and I ended up using some Crayola scissors but s*** was getting out of control. Then I bought these.. No Pull Guaranteed... definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Junked several alternatives. Got this  Perfect!! Ears happy. Nose happy. Now if I could just grow hair on top my head as easily as in my ears ....  ;-)</li>
    <li> Very easy to change and clean the heads. A very nice replacement for my old nose-hair trimmer with the added benefit of being much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Works very well and does not make much noise. Exchangeable heads easy to swap out. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> this works great and better than expected</li>
    <li> Just received this trimmer and I started to use it right away. It&#x27;s very easy to use and works great! Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again.</li>
    <li> As a balding gent in my dirty 30&#x27;s I am experiencing what many have said would come. The hair on my head is lacking but flourishing everywhere else. This trimmer was priced right and works great for my ears and nose. It even came with an attachment to trim facial hair or your lightning bolts. I guess you could have mutton chops too. Either way, if you&#x27;re looking at reviews trying to decide, you have a satisfied customer here. You hairy beast!</li>
    <li> Works great the only thing that could be changed is the batteries need to lith ion otherwise its great .</li>
    <li> Good price.  Works reasonably well.  It takes longer than I expected to trim hairs, but if you keep at it, it&#x27;ll get &#x27;em all.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was rechargeable rather than battery powered.</li>
    <li> It simply didn&#x27;t last long.  It worked well enough for the price point, but it literally fell apart.  The top would come off after it was secured according the instructions and after a couple times of that, it simply didn&#x27;t work.  It would make noise and the blades would move, but it couldn&#x27;t cut anything. I&#x27;d recommend looking for pretty much anything else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for me and it works. I have no other experience with other hair trimmers, but this one seems good enough for the price. It did what it was supposed to do. The only thing is the little comb attachment is kind of useless, but who really needs that?</li>
    <li> This product did a good job of trimming, much better than a couple others I&#x27;ve tried. The built-in light did not seem to help much.&lt;br /&gt;I had better results using a small mag-lite). Very convenient. I also own a Wahl hair trimmer, so I stayed with a company that has given me satisfaction. My dad&#x27;s nose is full of hair and did a great job with him. I should add, there is something good about having a lot of nose hair....it helps prevent colds and viruses from passing through mucous membranes, most of which reside in the nose. Nature has placed hairs in our nose for a reason. Sorry for getting off the subject. Just limit the amount picking can help stop more colds. A nose full of hair has some benefits, My 98 year old dad never gets a cold!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my nosehair and a little uni brow. My nose hair was trimmed nicely but it did not do much to my Uni brow. I attempted to trim my ear hair but i felt a little sting as i was about to start trimming so i have not attempted my ear hair since. Overall for its price its an OK product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son as a Christmas present and he loves it. He&#x27;s wanted one for a few years now.</li>
    <li> Not exactly the strongest performer, but it works OK.</li>
    <li> As you get older more hair grows where you don&#x27;t want it and more hair drops out from where you want it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d try another one if I had it to do over. The head is so small, it takes forever to do the job.</li>
    <li> WORKS OK.  KIND OF CHEESEY.  QUALITY LACKS. NOT GOOD FOR &amp;#34;BIGFOOT&amp;#34; OR A HAIRY GUY.  DOES NOT COLLECT SHAVINGS LIKE THE OLD WAHL PRODUCT.  EAR HAIR EVERY WHERE.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer&#x27;s claim on the box states no pull/no snag guaranteed. I used this straight out of the box and it was flawless. It cut my nasal hairs effortlessly. Clean up was a breeze. I have very course hair and thought I&#x27;d have trouble with pulling, but this product came through. I recommend this trimmer. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> the first one i got did not work ,Amazon replace it but i would not recommend this one . is work but i have to move the battery so it could make contact with the unit. a no to this one</li>
    <li> This trimmer works really well to trim the ears, brows and nose.  I ordered one for my husband and our son and they both love them.  The price for the brand Wahl is really good, the trimmer is not loud and I would highly recommend getting one for this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Item works well and no cutting the inside of your nose or ears.  Safe to use and trims well.  yae</li>
    <li> I like this thing. Easily trims hard to reach hair and battery lasts a long time. Had it for a while, still trims well.</li>
    <li> Good, well worth money spent.</li>
    <li> It worked great for a little while, but of the two heads that came with it, I can&#x27;t for the life of me get the trimmer one to stay put - it just doesn&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;latch&amp;#34; into place after just one use - ???  Manufacturers!  Quit making stuff out of plastic!!  It doesn&#x27;t last!!!</li>
    <li> First time using, good job with those pesky nose and ear hairs. I got tired of the cordless trimmers that quit working after two minutes. This one seems a-okay.</li>
    <li> great product. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim close enough.</li>
    <li> Works great no issues! I have a small nose so the light which could be useful, does help me.</li>
    <li> I am only able to use the nose clipper which seems to work the same as any other. I was disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t get the ear and brow attachment to function as they don&#x27;t connect properly.</li>
    <li> The motor gets hot really fast, and if you are trimming your nose too long you&#x27;ll start to smell a burning rubber type odor. Also the guard makes it so I can&#x27;t get the hairs as short as I&#x27;d like. The light is just okay, I don&#x27;t personally need a light that much, I&#x27;d rather have a product that doesn&#x27;t get hot or kill batteries too fast. And if you get this trimmer wet the cutting power slows to a crawl for a couple moments until it shakes the water off. In conclusion, I have had better trimmers, and don&#x27;t think this is the best purchase. For a comparable price I&#x27;m near to sure one could find a better one on the market.</li>
    <li> Works nicely as expected</li>
    <li> Ugh.  I&#x27;ve gotten older and needed to get one of these to trim unsightly nose hairs.  It does the job but the light isn&#x27;t really needed.</li>
    <li> This is a nice unit wth ample power to cut your nose hairs without the usual painful snags on cheaper trimmers.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product, it is great! It works great for both me and my husband...has an eyebrow attachment that I love!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a more substantial unit from Wahl.  Came with some small plastic attachments - one of which was so small it snapped off and went down the drain.  Can do as well at Wal Mart for less.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He likes this item for cleaning up the hard to reach places on his face. He never looked so good. It makes his life easier to be well groomed. I would recommend this to my friends for their husbands as well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work as well as others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. Arrived quickly. Great product!! Even the eye trimmer attachment is totally great. It is also very quiet.</li>
    <li> Very simple solution to unwanted hair that scissors or a razor cannot reach. Highly recommended. I absolutely love this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well especially on the ears.  Thought it would be much stronger.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find this in the store anymore&lt;br /&gt;it is actually better quality than the old version</li>
    <li> Used less than 10 times before it just stopped working.  Product just not made well, oh well, at least it was cheap.</li>
    <li> excellent product. does what it says. will buy again for myself and friends. attachments are great pieces and they work well. and it&#x27;s battery operated.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer -- I wasn&#x27;t happy about the fact that it&#x27;s battery *only*, because there&#x27;s always that time when you need to use it and the battery is low. I&#x27;d prefer to be able to recharge it with a cable, but considering those are difficult to find for a lower price, I took a chance on Wahl (whom I consider to be a leader in hair/grooming products) and I&#x27;ve not been disappointed. I like the rotary style nose trimmers much better than the side-to-side trimmers, because the nature of the area -- you otherwise have to twist it around to all angles to try to get everything, whereas this Wahl trimmer works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars for a great option, would have been five if they had an option that included a rechargable/corded model.</li>
    <li> this is a great product</li>
    <li> Poor quality, blades dull, battery life minimal.....go with Remington product, or sharp stones and flintrock, for they will cut better than this did.</li>
    <li> Very nice clipper, powerful and quiet, just as pictured and just as described</li>
    <li> It works ok.  May need to put better batteries in it.  But decent for the price.</li>
    <li> The nose trimmer works outstandingly well! the brow trimmer is alright, but i mainly bought for the nose trimmer and was not let down!</li>
    <li> Item as described and shipped in a timely manner, thank you.</li>
    <li> The light doesn&#x27;t illuminate anything so I found that part pretty useless. It&#x27;s still working after about a year, but I&#x27;ll probably go for a higher quality product once this one dies off.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 Star for the price and quality Wahl makes nice personal grooming products! We own their hair clippers too.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my dad.  He LOVES it!  Says he uses it all of the time.</li>
    <li> Works okay, but I have had others that worked better!!!</li>
    <li> Great product - no problems after several uses. I don&#x27;t find the light valuable, but the product and rest of the attachments work well. Really like the eyebrow trimmer attachment.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what is states it will do. The light doesn&#x27;t really help, but the trimmer works perfectly. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was scared to death to use this product... had to really talk myself into turning it on. But no pain at all! Not one bit! And it does a good job! Only wish it cut the front top and sides of my nostrils a bit better. But I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Hubby is happy with it...so I&#x27;ve got my fingers crossed because I picked it out and purchased it for him. You know how that goes..lol</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Great price, fast shipping, excellent quality</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 3 uses:((</li>
    <li> nothing special; trims so-so&lt;br /&gt;not a top quality trimmer but gets job done, albeit not as quick and sharp and effective&lt;br /&gt;as I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Gr8 I will use this seller again.</li>
    <li> Feels solid, holds a charge for a long time, razor sharp trimmer. One quick buzz in each nostril and I&#x27;m good to go...</li>
    <li> Beat plucking nose hairs. Does a descent job painlessly. Operates on double a batteries, can&#x27;t be re-charged. Low price on a well known name. Hard to go wrong.</li>
    <li> This nifty little hair trimmer worked pretty well for about 5 months, then one day it died. It does not work. Won&#x27;t turn on. Yes, I replaced the battery, but it was not the battery :(</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product good quality and blades and works great!</li>
    <li> Great for the price, it does eactly what I needed it to do.&lt;br /&gt;the light however does not really come in handy.</li>
    <li> Not all attachments that were shown on box were in the package, otherwise a very capable product and versatile product</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got about 6 months of light use with the Wahl trimmer - he maybe used it a dozen times - before it died. The trimmer was never dropped or mistreated, but the metal bit in the top kept falling out. The plastic piece holding the top part together finally broke after many times of putting the metal trimmer back in. I bought a slightly more expensive trimmer with better reviews, so we&#x27;ll see how that one holds up.</li>
    <li> Excellent product  . I had one before and it lasted 4 years</li>
    <li> This product is okay for trimming the nose, but not very useful for the eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I have used it twice and I feel that the second time hair cutting was not so sharp as the first time. I wonder whether spare heads are sold.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job. It is small and compact and easy to use. Arrived when promised, and well  packaged. Iam happy with this product.</li>
    <li> has worked great for a few years now!!</li>
    <li> Gives me everything I need. Quality could be better, which is why it lost a star. But very good overall.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well.  in one word ....junk</li>
    <li> Yes, the motor is too loud.  I was afraid it would break my eardrums, so I use it with ear-plugs that I saved from a transatlantic airplane voyage.  In the States, there used to be a simpler trimmer, that was not near so noisy, but I couldn&#x27;t find that one on Amazon.  I don&#x27;t need the rotating thing, that all the ones on Amazon have.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about getting this - I have had other trimmers  before and they left a lot to be desired.  I am glad to report that this one is - as I stated above - excellent.  It does what it is supposed to do and is easy to operate and maintain.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Finally got frustrated with the panasonic trimmer which apparently had a bent shaft. This works great, though the light is not real great.</li>
    <li> so far works great had other types before but this one seems to work the best hope it last and don&#x27;t have any broblems</li>
    <li> I gave this trimmer 4 stars because it really does the job it says it can do.  Nose and facial hairs fall easily to these blades without your feeling a thing.  It misses 5 stars because its ability to do brows is very limited unless you have squirrel&#x27;s tails above your eyes.</li>
    <li> A  piece of ofal,  Won&#x27;t cut, weak power, complete waste of money, certainly changed my estimate of Wahl products</li>
    <li> What exactly can you say about a nose and eyebrow trimmer?  It works, and it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> The product is nice but as a trimmer I expected it to have a little more power.  It did not trim as well as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> This works well and my husband thinks it is one of the best things he has bought.  Keeps him nicely trimmed.</li>
    <li> It is practically impossible to find a decent men&#x27;s ear, nose, and brow trimmer.  From the reviews I was hoping this was going to fit the bill.  It arrived quickly and I immediately tested it out. It would not trim my nose hair one bit, the light was a nice feature but if the product doesn&#x27;t cut, what is the point?  I tried the other attachments and simply found this product to be worthless.  Returned to Amazon for a refund, purchased a conair model that fits the bill better.</li>
    <li> This was a decent purchase, the price was very good and I am hoping it will last a long time, I&#x27;ve only had it a month so far</li>
    <li> Worked great wahl  makes a great product and really liked the light</li>
    <li> Works great! Does get a little warm, but glad to have a good working trimmer again. My old one was too &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; to cut/trim the hairs unless you spend a very long time at it. This one like my first does the job in a short amount of time an is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is suppose to.  No worries about hurting your skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not sure you can get better value than this Wahl trimmer. I use this product namely for nose trimming and must say it does the job. Functional and priced well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
    <li> My expectations for quality were definitely exceeded for this price. It doesn&#x27;t trim as fast as I would like, but I have a forest up there and shouldn&#x27;t be complaining.&lt;br /&gt;It is waterproof, and the light at the tip is useful for your nasal trimming explorations. A light on a nose trimmer sounded dumb to me at first too, but I&#x27;m now convinced.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed. The light is pretty much a non factor. Not very bright. Clippers work OK. Not much better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past. Just OK.</li>
    <li> High quality product. Does the job well.</li>
    <li> Havent used it yet but I&#x27;m really impressed at the way it looks and the add on small tools that do all the little things that need doing around your face</li>
    <li> Frankly I was disappointed in this products performance. Had trouble removing nostril hair,did not meet expectations.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and I love them</li>
    <li> Does,nt do the job,the light is useless,sick of trying to buy a good trimmer, and I don,t have wire hair.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my boyfriend!</li>
    <li> A great product for my husband but not a close enough shave for me. My old Panasonic does a better job!</li>
    <li> I just sent my complaint about the Wahl and I can&#x27;t use it because I don&#x27;t have all the parts. I was very disappointed and problems with packaging and had to throw some packing away.</li>
    <li> Better then the previous models! I would but this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok and works fine. I don&#x27;t use it very often so I do not know the longevity of it.</li>
    <li> Works well, I have no major problems with it.</li>
    <li> The package says &amp;#34;No pull, no pain guaranteed&amp;#34;.  They can also add &amp;#34;no cut&amp;#34;.  I have tried many different styles of nose trimmers and the ones that work for me (none of them ever work very well) seem to pinch or pull once in a while.  Even the best of the ones I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t last very long as they seem to loose power within 3 or 4 months. Hammacher Schlemmer markets this as &amp;#34;best ever&amp;#34; which prompted me to give it a try.  This one was only 12.99 so it&#x27;s not worth my time to return it.  I&#x27;ve used this for 5 months and it cuts poorly and has lost power.  I would gladly pay $50 for a nose trimmer that really worked.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been invented yet.</li>
    <li> seems like doesnt do anything</li>
    <li> Not bad, but at times, it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair easilly. It takes longer than expected.</li>
    <li> Noisy motor, poor power, needs higher quality components.</li>
    <li> Very good value, with very quick shipping</li>
    <li> Works great...fast and easy to use</li>
    <li> great product/transaction</li>
    <li> The batteries for both ear, nose and brow trimmers were dead on arrival.  After I installed my own battery, the unit worked.  It didn&#x27;t cut many of the hairs in my nose.  I can&#x27;t recommend this trimmer.  The attached light is useful to see the hairs that the trimmer didn&#x27;t trim!</li>
    <li> This Wahl ear, nose, and brow trimmer I expected more from based on the quality that I have known Wahl to have in other products. However, I do not think it does an excellent job at its specialized job of trimming ear and nose hairs. For trimming the brow, I have not tried that, so I cannot give a judgement on the performance for that. I had wished for a better nose trimmer that you didn&#x27;t have to second-guess yourself on.</li>
    <li> It actually works and doesn&#x27;t yank at your nose hairs. It doesn&#x27;t clip them as closely as I&#x27;d like, but I&#x27;m pleased with it for the price.</li>
    <li> If you have some unwanted nose or ear hair, get this trimmer. It takes AAA batteries and works great, get it.</li>
    <li> This came in a nice fancy box - and it looks good too. The trimmer isn&#x27;t very sharp and the LED light is just plain dim.  (I did try a second new batttery).  I have an old trimmer (the same brand) that has several years of use. It is very well worn, yet seems much sharper than this one.  Maybe these sharpen themselves with use?</li>
    <li> I did not use trimmer before, this is my first. Overall a good built and handy. I use it for my brow but feels that the shave might be to close and my brow has become rather short now LOL. I just have to readjust my shave so that i don&#x27;t go to close but hey that is not automatic!!!!!</li>
    <li> clipper did not work at all!</li>
    <li> does what is suppose to do , not like my original shaper image that was bought 10-15 years ago, much sturdier, Does job well</li>
    <li> I recommend to purchas this product, thiswill be the best producxt that you will be glad that you purchased. The use you will get out this will prove to be very beneficial.</li>
    <li> The product arrived at time. I used it as a nose trimmer and I am very satisfied with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, now if I don&#x27;t lose the head this time, I won&#x27;t have to buy another one for some time.</li>
    <li> This works well and the light is nice so I can trim in the dark..so romantic by candle light. So, far it cuts the hair well and have to see if it continues to do its job. Hair today gone soon after.</li>
    <li> My husband had one like this a long time ago and had not been able to find one he liked until now.</li>
