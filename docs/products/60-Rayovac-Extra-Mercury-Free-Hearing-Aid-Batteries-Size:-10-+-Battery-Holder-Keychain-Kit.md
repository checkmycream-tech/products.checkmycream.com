<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent batteries and excellent service. I will buy again as needed. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Work very well in wife&#x27;s hearing aid. I bought this because it came with the spare battery holder.</li>
    <li> They were good and the price was very good and make them even better.  Receipt of them was time efficient.</li>
    <li> They came with a good charge, unlike some bulk batteries I&#x27;ve gotten before. They last in my hearing aids about 5 long full days. Happy with the product, happy with the price.</li>
    <li> My Audiologist includes free batteries for the life of the hearing devices purchased from him, but they are not mercury-free, and somehow almost never quite last long enough between office visits. The batteries I received are very fresh, by the way, so will not be out of date before I use them all. The price is an excellent value in and of itself, never mind trips to the drugstore, and then often they don&#x27;t have the mercury-free in stock or whatever.</li>
    <li> I bought the Rayovac batteries after reading the many reviews and it looked like they would last longer than the German made batteries I used previously. I was getting an average of 3 days on a battery. I&#x27;ve gone through 2 packs of these so far and they are inconsistent on how long they last. I changed one out this morning and had to change it again 3 hours later. I don&#x27;t like that &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; of the batteries don&#x27;t last and some do.</li>
    <li> Longer lasting than Costco batteries.</li>
    <li> Buy these for my mother who gets about a week from her hearing aid batteries.  She loves these, says they last as long or longer than the other more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I purchased these batteries for my wife. she said these are lasting much longer.  that made me feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;thanks again for your service.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE</li>
    <li> Excellent product  I received it much faster than  they said I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I found these batteries to be inferior to the PowerOne batteries I have ordered previously. They last for significantly less time and one of the boxes received was even the wrong size.</li>
    <li> Mom has used these for the last couple years. They work well an last a long time and shopping online is so convenient.  We also appreciate that they are mercury-free.</li>
    <li> Rather than but these batteries anywhere else, buy them her and save 50%.  They are the same batteries in any store.</li>
    <li> Oh, my gosh!! I am sooo tired of spending $$$ on batteries at the grocery store to have them die the same day I put them in. Grrr. These are sooo STRONG and stay ALIVE for DAYS on end!! YAY!!! No beeping just hours after putting them in. I am soooo happy!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality for my wife &#x27;s hearing aids!</li>
    <li> Seem to last longer than Duracells bought previously. Price was very good and free shipping.</li>
    <li> My apologies for the late&lt;br /&gt;review, but everything was&lt;br /&gt;as I had hoped. A good price&lt;br /&gt;and exactly what I had hoped for, Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great deal. Brought same batteries some where else. No more.</li>
    <li> By the time I get to some of the batteries they are dead or have very little life to them. Was hoping they would last longer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really dissatisfied with your batteries, about 1/3 of them are about half strength, they last about 3 to 4 days were the others last a week, It&#x27;s pretty consistent in each pack. According to the box their expiration date is Feb 2018 AAFPS, other code is 10AE-6ZM. I&#x27;ve used your batteries in the past with positive results, your prices are very good. Hope it&#x27;s just a bad batch situation.</li>
    <li> Expiration 2018, excellent price.AAA+++</li>
    <li> were prompt delivery and have not had any problems</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this brand since they seem to be the best available for my hearing aids.  These  batteries have a life of about five days assuming the hearing devises are turned off over night.  Amazon has the best price and delivery offerings on the market.  I&#x27;m sticking with Amazon for future purchases.  Jim C</li>
    <li> The batteries arrived sooner than I expected. So far they are working better than the batteries I received with my hearing aids.  I am getting approximately 8 days of use before I have to replace them.  I am very pleased with these batteries.</li>
    <li> only kind i buy for ny hearing aids. seem to last the longest of all brands. have used them since i first tried them years ago</li>
    <li> More than half oh these batteries were DOA (Dead on arrival).  I would place them in the earphone and they were depleted, or soon to be (minutes, not even hours).</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Delivered in timely manner.</li>
    <li> I recently had to start using a hearing aid and bought this set of batteries as I have always had good results with Ray-o-Vac batteries. Plus this set comes with a keychain battery holder to always keep a couple of spares.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life has been as expected. I get 5-6 days of use per battery.</li>
    <li> I researched hearing aid batteries and found that Rayovac had the longest life.  So far this is true.  I used to get 8 days with another brand.  I get 11 days with these.  I am very happy with these batteries.  While they cost a few pennies more, the extra life more than makes use for the price.</li>
    <li> I partcipated in a program that provided 6 different mfr of hearing aid batteries and a chart to track performance and longevity..for my hearing aids (and it IS probably different for different products) Rayovac was the best.  I&#x27;d been buying these from a Microbattery website and then discovered by accident that i could get the same (...a little bit cheaper but w/out shipping cost per conditions) at Amazon.  So, win win.  Best product for me; best price.  And Amazon ALWAYS delivers well</li>
    <li> Just received these hearing batteries and the first one out of the pack was a dud. A second one has fizzles out.I will keep a close check and report back as necessary. Service was very good.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my Dad and the keychain holder addition is a nice extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price for the quantity. Fast shipping and pleased. We will purchase these again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with these.  Mine have lasted anywhere from 6-8 days.  A couple of times I&#x27;ve had a battery die overnight.  I don&#x27;t put my hearing aids on until I&#x27;m at work and the batteries tend to move around in my case.  Don&#x27;t know if the little magnet pen could have affected them or not.  Besides that issue, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the longevity.  I had used duracell batteries previously and they didn&#x27;t last as long as these.  Good batteries.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with 50% of the bateries, empty.  Because I used outsaid US I can&#x27;t change it</li>
    <li> Work great, last a long time at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think they lasted extra long.  I have to wear two hearing aids, lately one 24 hours as I have a husband that is ill&lt;br /&gt;and rely on a monitor at night.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Excellent batteries will reorder as when needed .  much longer life</li>
    <li> Many times I have shopped online and at local stores looking for quality No. 10 Batteries.  I have tried all different flavors.  For me and my type of hearing aids (Audible) the Rayovac lasts the longest.  Ordering 60 at a time is not only time saving but the price was great too.  I will be reording this item again.</li>
    <li> Got the item on time. working excellent</li>
