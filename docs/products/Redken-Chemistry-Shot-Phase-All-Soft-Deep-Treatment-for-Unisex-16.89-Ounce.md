      <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>and Ive got gorgeous hair.  </li>
      <li>I paid for this in salon and loved it.</li>
      <li>Also, CT Beauty has the best customer service I have had in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted them after a blip with the product, which they replaced at no cost to me, and added some wonderful samples from Paul Mitchell and Dermalogica.</li>
      <li>I loved the treatments and am thrilled I can now do them at home.  </li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the most amazing product I have ever purchased!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s really nice.</li>

      <li>Although I wish it was more cost effective.</li>
      <li>Love this product leaves your hair feeling healthier.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Product came perfectly packed and actually arrived faster than some items I ordered using Amazon</li>
      <li>Greater shipper.</li>
      <li>Love it, always works.</li>
      <li>I love the way this product feels on my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this treatment and everything it does for my hair.</li>
      <li>Love this project.  </li>
      <li>most times this does it jus fine</li>
      <li>I am very grateful for the awesome experience and as soon as I run out of this product you can bet I will be back to buy from them!</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my daughter that has very thin curly and brittle hair and it has significantly softened and hydrated the hair, I&#x27;ve tried to use many masks and intensive conditioners, this product is the best!</li>
      <li>Super conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s for salons, though, so you should probably get familiar with salon terms and products beforehand, just so you don&#x27;t damage your hair, you know?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not extremely difficult.</li>
      <li>Love how soft my hair is.</li>
      <li>going to use this once a week for the next month to see how much more my hair improves.</li>
      <li>I use this along with 3.5 phix phase spray and it makes my hair super soft and voluminous.  </li>
      <li>Really works to soften your hair.</li>
      <li>much cheaper and easier than going to the salon.</li>
      <li>Mine gets very frizzy and this helps somewhat</li>
      <li>I rinsed really well</li>
      <li>Im following it up with the full All Soft line to boost the results.</li>
      <li>I use it as my nightly conditioner routine &amp; add my normal conditioner after for added softness if I want but</li>
      <li>Almost thought it was broken for good when enter this baby - along with the shot phix 3.5 this performed a miracle in just one application.</li>
      <li>This was explained more in the other reviews, though, so I&#x27;m going to review the entire treatment:&lt;br</li>
      <li>a natural brunette but color my roots once a month to keep up my back length light blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>You need to order pHix pHase 3.5 with it to make it a complete process.</li>
      <li>(which for me was the problem).&lt;br /&gt;The second part of the system made my hair feel really brittle...</li>
      <li>I have tried a million conditioners but THIS leaves my hair silky soft.</li>
      <li>so far United and Redken have been doing the trick.</li>
      <li>Soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I have silky soft hair that is almost as soft as it was before I went blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and then did an All Soft deep conditioning treatment.</li>
      <li>I keep this in my hair for much longer than stated on directions, I would say 20 min to half hour</li>

<li> I alternate this system with Redken extreme strength builder for deep conditioning every Sunday night</li>
<li> I was thinking Id have to loose some inches but not now!&lt;br</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be in the dark like I was when ordering this.</li>
<li> It softens my hair and weighs it down a bit when it gets too frizzy.</li>
<li> So if you&#x27;re just looking for that little add-on thing, they do have those products, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d</li>
<li> I mean, there is another product to purchase with this:</li>
<li> if you know what I mean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the best conditioners I have ever used.  Your hair will feel totally rejuvenated and the texture will be like silk.  Must be used with the 3.5 Phix Phase spray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Redken Chem-Shot before. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
    <li> i use this with the 3.5 &amp; 5.5 I find both work equally well. Love how soft my hair is. I use it as my nightly conditioner routine &amp; add my normal conditioner after for added softness if I want but most times this does it jus fine</li>
    <li> After three chemical procedures in a row, my hair fine, nordic hair was left dry, brittle, broken... Tried all kinds of shampoos, conditioners and tratments to try and restore it, but to no awail. Almost thought it was broken for good when enter this baby - along with the shot phix 3.5 this performed a miracle in just one application. I am so happy!! My hair is now that of an angel!</li>
    <li> This is what the salon uses.  I loved the treatments and am thrilled I can now do them at home.  -So much cheaper and easier than going to the salon.</li>
    <li> I mean, there is another product to purchase with this: Redken Chemistry Shot pHix 5.5 or 3.5, depending on the type of damage done to your hair. This was explained more in the other reviews, though, so I&#x27;m going to review the entire treatment:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s really nice. It softens my hair and weighs it down a bit when it gets too frizzy. It&#x27;s for salons, though, so you should probably get familiar with salon terms and products beforehand, just so you don&#x27;t damage your hair, you know?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not extremely difficult. I did it all online with extensive research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this if you need to soften your damaged hair, but it&#x27;s an actual salon treatment, again. So if you&#x27;re just looking for that little add-on thing, they do have those products, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product my hair is getting on the healthier side every time I use this</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it did anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this along with 3.5 phix phase spray and it makes my hair super soft and voluminous.  I keep this in my hair for much longer than stated on directions, I would say 20 min to half hour and then spray in the Phix phase and leave that in for another 10-15 minutes and Ive got gorgeous hair.  I alternate this system with Redken extreme strength builder for deep conditioning every Sunday night and I have totally noticed thicker, fuller looking, longer hair.  For daily shampooing and conditioning I use United hair products.  I am a hair product junkie since I straighten and blow dry my hair daily so anything that will help me keep hair on my head I have used and so far United and Redken have been doing the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter that has very thin curly and brittle hair and it has significantly softened and hydrated the hair, I&#x27;ve tried to use many masks and intensive conditioners, this product is the best! I would recommend any person to use this product. Although I wish it was more cost effective.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, you have to follow through with the PHIX PHASE SPRAY... (which for me was the problem).&lt;br /&gt;The second part of the system made my hair feel really brittle... so you have to use the regular conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a total catch 22... if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> Redken is the best friend your hair has. Stop paying a salon for this product. You can do it yourself. Smells wonderful and makes your hair so soft used with the spray.</li>
    <li> I have tried a million conditioners but THIS leaves my hair silky soft.</li>
    <li> Super conditioner.  Love this project.  My hairdresser got me hooked on this but I never knew I could buy it myself.  Perfect for my color-treated hair.  Soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Love this product leaves your hair feeling healthier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Leaves hair softer but I guess not as soft as some of the other reviewers started. Definitely not a miracle product in my opinion although I know all hair is different. Mine gets very frizzy and this helps somewhat but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d but this again. Maybe I&#x27;ll try the Extreme Deep Treatment next time. It is a two phase process and should be used along with the shot phix 3.5.</li>
    <li> Greater shipper. Product came perfectly packed and actually arrived faster than some items I ordered using Amazon Prime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most amazing product I have ever purchased! I am a beauty junkie, so that is saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im a natural brunette but color my roots once a month to keep up my back length light blonde hair. This last year, I got back into swimming daily laps so between the color and the chlorine, my hair was paying the price in a big way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive used this chemistry shot twice since it arrived and I can say now that this stuff literally has SAVED my hair. I was thinking Id have to loose some inches but not now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions as printed on the bottle and followed up with the Redken Chemistry System 3.5 Phix Phase Spray, 8.5 Ounce. I rinsed really well and then did an All Soft deep conditioning treatment. Wow! I have silky soft hair that is almost as soft as it was before I went blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im going to use this once a week for the next month to see how much more my hair improves. Im following it up with the full All Soft line to boost the results.</li>
    <li> It is not the same product you get at the hairdresser</li>
    <li> I love this product. Don&#x27;t be in the dark like I was when ordering this. You need to order pHix pHase 3.5 with it to make it a complete process. Both products are great.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had it done in the salon and liked it.  I definitely notice a difference in the texture and sheen of my hair after use.</li>
    <li> Really works to soften your hair. I paid for this in salon and loved it. Thought why not do it myself at home?</li>
    <li> Love it!  Tames even my almost all gray hair!</li>
    <li> Love this treatment and everything it does for my hair. Also, CT Beauty has the best customer service I have had in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted them after a blip with the product, which they replaced at no cost to me, and added some wonderful samples from Paul Mitchell and Dermalogica. I am very grateful for the awesome experience and as soon as I run out of this product you can bet I will be back to buy from them!</li>
    <li> I get this when I get my hair colored. It cost $10 for one shot. Now that I bought this I give my hair a treatment once a week.</li>
    <li> Love it, always works.</li>
