### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best heated eyelash curler I have ever used!  </li>
      <li>but this does the best job.</li>
      <li>This product is the best yet.  </li>
      <li>Its the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I LOVED this while it worked!  </li>
      <li>Once again, I find myself utterly delighted with my purchase!  </li>
      <li>and I loved the results!. . .</li>
      <li>In theory, with two curlers, it seems that it would deliver amazingly beautiful lashes.</li>
      <li>You will be happy you did . . .</li>
      <li>I curl my lashes for about 30-40 seconds and they look great.</li>
      <li>Works surprisingly well.  </li>
      <li>Not that good.</li>
      <li>Since I don&#x27;t use any liquid stuff on my eye lashes, this product is good, but not as effective as I would like.  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than heating your curler with the hairdryer!</li>
      <li>I liked it has 2 heated bars instead of one.  </li>
      <li>Have to hold it to your eyelashes forever to get a curl, and then it makes your eye feel somewhat warm...</li>
      <li>I was on a quest to own one that will keep my lashes curled for hours</li>
      <li>It is nice to have a on and off</li>
      <li>and I am loving it.</li>
      <li>The temperature is just warm to the touch</li>
      <li>This curler works well but falls apart very easily.</li>
      <li>this one is the best so far..</li>
      <li>It seems to fit my eyes perfectly and really hold the curl.</li>
      <li>I bought this, was so happy the first time I tried it</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used heated eyelash curlers for many many years, and after my trusty and inexpensive TRIM eyelash curler stopped working, I needed to find a replacement.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a bit more sturdy as the plastic tends to break on the top after prolonged use on this style.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than a $3 manual eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>I guess I will keep looking for a better one...</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t know if those work better.</li>
      <li>Maybe it will work better on longer lashes?  </li>
      <li>but I am pleased with this curler.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty good product.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THE WAY THIS CURLER HEATS UP AND CURLS IN TWO PLACES, BUT IT BREAKS WAY TOO EASY.</li>
      <li>But until then it really does a superb job of making my lashes look spectacular which is why I&#x27;ve bought this product for the second time.  </li>
      <li>I like the dual curling capability; however the heater part does not work and is yet another example of a strong pattern I&#x27;m seeing ....</li>
      <li>If anyone knows of a brand of mascara that works to give a nice curl I would be interested in hearing about that.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough,and takes some time for it to reach any kind of heated state.</li>
      <li>I prefer my Panasonic heated curler, but this one works fine</li>
      <li>I have also tried the Panasonic EH2331P and the Ardell (squeeze not stick) and while the Artemis works better than those, I still like the Hitachi better even with the higher price.</li>
      <li>If you use the trick of curling close to the eyelid and then again midway, you will get fabulous curly lashes in no time at all.  </li>
      <li>This product became my favorite right away.</li>
      <li>the only thing is not as good w/</li>
      <li>The local drugstores did not carry my beloved TRIM so I decided to order one from Amazon, based on the reviews.</li>
      <li>I went through 2 of these before I decided to splurge and purchase the Hitachi curler which is much sturdier and curls much better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the heat is not uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>It breaks way too quickly, as in within 6-12 months.</li>
      <li>I need something that uses heat to get them to look more normal.</li>
      <li>The actual device is light but it more sturdy than I would have thought.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it and tossed all my old ones in the trash.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl your lashes straight up but gives them a nice natural look that lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t get too hot, just warm enough.  </li>
      <li>Luckily my husband was able to solder the wire back on for me a couple of times.</li>
      <li>I still recommend this to my friends though, because you can still prep your lashes with a regular curler and gently pull your eyes slanted to make a more even line of lashes to fit in this curler.</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic doesn&#x27;t last but good enough for the price</li>
      <li>it is the batteries drained very fast.  </li>
      <li>It gives off gentle heat and works miracles for my lashes!</li>
      <li>love the double padding on this curler, but I could see how people with shorter lashes may not reap the benefits.  </li>
      <li>I was sceptical at first because I have tried all the heated curlers as soon as they come on the market.  </li>
      <li>This is my first experience with any heated eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t get too hot and it heats up within a minute.  </li>
      <li>Most recently, I had purchased a [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I noticed if you keep the battery out it last longer but eventually the heating element fizzles out and the top curler doesn&#x27;t contract well in time.  </li>
      <li>I did not use this product consistently but &lt;10 times, and it has stopped working.</li>
      <li>W/A PRETTY DESIGN.</li>
      <li>instructions suggest a 20-30 second hold, but even with a 10-15 second hold on the lashes, I get a good four hours of hold without mascara.  </li>
      <li>Better than previous curlers where I had to hold it closed to heat it up, this one has a separate switch to warm up.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much difference in the before and after.  </li>
      <li>Was very dissappointed with this curler.</li>
      <li>KINDA FAST.</li>
      <li>and it really worked.  </li>
      <li>i really like this one.</li>
      <li>My eye lashes are straight and stubborn.  </li>
      <li>and it worked really well, but it broke and target didn&#x27;t carry it anymore</li>
      <li>After the first one kicked the bucket, I was overly careful not to leave it on too long and to use good batteries.  </li>
      <li>It was more than worth the $6.59 I paid, and I will seriously buy this exact product again when it breaks (I tend to break things).</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s relatively cheap plastic that takes a very long time to heat, and the mechanics of the curler just don&#x27;t really allow lashes to be curled.</li>
      <li>I ordered this heated eye lash curler after reading about it in a magazine where it received a decent review.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this heated lash curler.  </li>
      <li>I love this curler... have been using it for the few years...</li>
      <li>It only takes seconds to heat up (on fresh batteries) and the color-changing pad makes it dummy-proof.  </li>
      <li>, but it didn&#x27;t get hot enough or really even move my lashes.  </li>
      <li>I would say my lashes are not hard to curl.</li>
      <li>Amazon in the new WalMart of on-line shopping and the quality of products repeatly do NOT meet expectation.</li>
      <li>My eye lashes are pretty short</li>
      <li>but it doesnt heat up hot enough for me.  </li>
      <li>Ever since trying my first heated eyelash curler, I can&#x27;t go back to a non-heated version.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair which translates into unruly lashes and this is the first curler to ever get all my lashes going in the same direction.</li>
      <li>Save your money and heat up an old school eyelash curler with a blow dryer.</li>
      <li>The curl holds much longer than with my regular eyelash curler</li>
      <li>I CAN&#x27;T GIVE IT A 4 OR 5 STAR RATING SIMPLY ON THESE TWO FACTS, BUT OTHER THEN THAT IT IS A COOL PRODUCT</li>
      <li>She had used the Artemis Woman Double Curl and her eyes looked enormous -- they really stood out.  </li>
      <li>okay, not great.</li>
      <li>In comparing the Artemis Woman Double Curl Gentle Heat Lash Curler to my metal curlers, the concave/convex arc that sits at the lash base is much less prominent on the Artemis than my metal curlers, so perhaps this is why there is not much payoff in a good curl.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is this doesn&#x27;t fit rounded eyes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product became my favorite right away. Did everything it promised and I loved the results!. . . While it lasted! I made the purchase on 3/17/2011 and as of Saturday 4/16/2011 it does not work. . . I guess a month of use isn&#x27;t bad IF THEY ARE SELLING IT AS A DISPOSABLE PRODUCT!. . . Very sad about the loss of my new makeup friend!</li>
    <li> The curling factor is the same as with a regular curler, except that with this one, your lashes may (not \\&quot;will\\&quot;) stay curled longer.  It&#x27;s easy to use and the heat is not uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I did not use this product consistently but &lt;10 times, and it has stopped working. Not sure why. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I had this for two weeks, using once a day, and now either it is torn up or the batteries are dead.  Either way, it is not worth replacing them to find out.  There isn&#x27;t much difference in the before and after.  Save your money and heat up an old school eyelash curler with a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> My eye lashes are pretty short and I had used a heated curler before (diff brand) and it worked really well, but it broke and target didn&#x27;t carry it anymore, so I had to look online for it, decided to get this one. Maybe it will work better on longer lashes?  I am dissapointed that this don&#x27;t work as well for me and the batteries don&#x27;t last very long either.  I guess I will keep looking for a better one...</li>
    <li> I received this about 2 weeks ago and I love it! I have used several other battery operated curlers in the past and none of them can compare to this one. It seems to fit my eyes perfectly and really hold the curl.</li>
    <li> I ordered this heated eye lash curler after reading about it in a magazine where it received a decent review. After trying it out, let me tell you, I&#x27;m not impressed. It didn&#x27;t seem to curl my eye lashes at all but rather sort of straightened them out even though I held the curler in place for almost a minute. Unfortunately this product was a let down.</li>
    <li> After using a manual eyelash curler for years, this one rocks my boat.  My eyelashes stay curled.</li>
    <li> Was very dissappointed with this curler. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough,and takes some time for it to reach any kind of heated state.Have had to use my hair dryer to heat it!!</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly well.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since the only other model like this was waaay more expensive but I am pleased with this curler.  The \\&quot;double curl\\&quot; design does add an extra dimension to curling your lashes.  I have naturally curly hair which translates into unruly lashes and this is the first curler to ever get all my lashes going in the same direction.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to curl my lashes right no matter what I tried. Curl did not stay even when paired with curling mascara. Its in landfill now and I went back to Shu Eumura lash curler. Its the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago, I noticed how pretty a co-worker&#x27;s eyes were, thinking she was wearing mascara when she usually doesn&#x27;t. But no, she didn&#x27;t have any eye makeup on. She had used the Artemis Woman Double Curl and her eyes looked enormous -- they really stood out.  So, I picked one up and I am loving it. It heats up in 30 seconds and doesn&#x27;t take any longer to curl than a regular curler.  In fact, the heat works faster and the lashes stay curled and I&#x27;m saving on mascara!</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing a review in a magazine and it really worked.  The curl holds much longer than with my regular eyelash curler and it didn&#x27;t get too hot, just warm enough.  I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This product is the best yet.  I was sceptical at first because I have tried all the heated curlers as soon as they come on the market.  I was on a quest to own one that will keep my lashes curled for hours and this one does it.  It gives them a double whammy.  I curls them in two spots - at the base and tip.  I love it and tossed all my old ones in the trash.  I wouldn&#x27;t give it up for anything else!</li>
    <li> This curler works well but falls apart very easily. If you drop it, everything comes apart and sometimes the wire will become disconnected and it stops heating up. Luckily my husband was able to solder the wire back on for me a couple of times. The batteries only last about a week or 2 so plan to have plenty AAA&#x27;s on hand. I went through 2 of these before I decided to splurge and purchase the Hitachi curler which is much sturdier and curls much better. I have also tried the Panasonic EH2331P and the Ardell (squeeze not stick) and while the Artemis works better than those, I still like the Hitachi better even with the higher price. I haven&#x27;t tried any stick curlers so don&#x27;t know if those work better.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with any heated eyelash curler. I had high hopes for this heated lash curler.  Unfortunately, I get a better curl with my metal eyelash curlers (LaCross, Maybelline).  I bought this to avoid the pinching I sometimes get with my metal lash curlers.  I would say my lashes are not hard to curl. I get a very small curve with the Artemis, but that is only if I hold it for 30 seconds or longer -- too long for the results achieved -- and it does not last.  It is no improvement over what I can do with my finger! I have to use my traditional metal curlers to get an actual upsweep to my lashes.  In comparing the Artemis Woman Double Curl Gentle Heat Lash Curler to my metal curlers, the concave/convex arc that sits at the lash base is much less prominent on the Artemis than my metal curlers, so perhaps this is why there is not much payoff in a good curl. I thought I had paid about $8 for this product, but it looks like I paid almost $18! I am sooo disappointed. If I could find someone for whom this item actually works, I would give it away rather than throw it away, which is probably what I will have to do unless I find another use for this item on something else (like curling ribbon, holding false eyelases for application?). I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product.  It starts up within 30-45 seconds.  The temperature is just warm to the touch so you know your eyelashes aren&#x27;t heavily aggravated.  The curl does hold all day, even through rubbing of the eyes.    My only complaint is this doesn&#x27;t fit rounded eyes.  I have rounded almond shaped eyes and this isn&#x27;t curved enough to take the ends of my lashes so the tail of my lashes do not curl.  I&#x27;d have to go back in with a manual curler for that.  I still recommend this to my friends though, because you can still prep your lashes with a regular curler and gently pull your eyes slanted to make a more even line of lashes to fit in this curler.</li>
    <li> I bought this, was so happy the first time I tried it but then it didn&#x27;t curl my lashes again no matter what I tried or how long I held it in place. Wish I could get my money back for his piece of junk :/</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE WAY THIS CURLER HEATS UP AND CURLS IN TWO PLACES, BUT IT BREAKS WAY TOO EASY. I AM ON MY THIRD ONE ALREADY. IT ALSO BURNS THROUGH BATTERIES KINDA FAST. I CAN&#x27;T GIVE IT A 4 OR 5 STAR RATING SIMPLY ON THESE TWO FACTS, BUT OTHER THEN THAT IT IS A COOL PRODUCT W/A PRETTY DESIGN.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing a review for this eyelash curler to warn you that this item is DISPOSABLE.  I&#x27;ve now owned two of this particular curler and both died within a few months.  After the first one kicked the bucket, I was overly careful not to leave it on too long and to use good batteries.  And it still died after about 3 months.  Still, with that said -- I LOVED this while it worked!  If you&#x27;ve got a few bucks to spare, I highly recommend buying this.  Yes, you will probably have to replace it sooner that you&#x27;d like, but if you know that going in it won&#x27;t be a big deal.  It curls like a dream!  If you use the trick of curling close to the eyelid and then again midway, you will get fabulous curly lashes in no time at all.  Because this is heated, I found that I didn&#x27;t need to pinch the lashes quite as tight at with a traditional curler, so there&#x27;s a comfort factor bonus to this.</li>
    <li> This is yet another terrible eyelash curler. It does not hold a curl either before or after mascara. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It is nice to have a on and off switch you do not have hold while it is heating up.  My eye lashes are straight and stubborn.  It only curls my eyelashes a slight curl.  At least the curl lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I hate it!  It does not work to curl your lashes, just heats up your eye lids.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude who has his eye lashes pointing downward.  Since I don&#x27;t use any liquid stuff on my eye lashes, this product is good, but not as effective as I would like.  I need something that uses heat to get them to look more normal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used heated eyelash curlers for many many years, and after my trusty and inexpensive TRIM eyelash curler stopped working, I needed to find a replacement. The local drugstores did not carry my beloved TRIM so I decided to order one from Amazon, based on the reviews. For $18, this product is a complete rip-off. In theory, with two curlers, it seems that it would deliver amazingly beautiful lashes. However, it&#x27;s relatively cheap plastic that takes a very long time to heat, and the mechanics of the curler just don&#x27;t really allow lashes to be curled. I say, go find a different brand. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I can get my money back.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this.  It doesn&#x27;t work any better than a $3 manual eyelash curler.  I wouldn&#x27;t bother next time.</li>
    <li> I like the dual curling capability; however the heater part does not work and is yet another example of a strong pattern I&#x27;m seeing .... Amazon in the new WalMart of on-line shopping and the quality of products repeatly do NOT meet expectation.</li>
    <li> I noticed if you keep the battery out it last longer but eventually the heating element fizzles out and the top curler doesn&#x27;t contract well in time.  But until then it really does a superb job of making my lashes look spectacular which is why I&#x27;ve bought this product for the second time.  I tried a bunch of things in between but this does the best job.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough. I went and purchased a more expensive and &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; make!</li>
    <li> It worked just like it said it would.  It didn&#x27;t get too hot and it heats up within a minute.  It doesn&#x27;t curl your lashes straight up but gives them a nice natural look that lasts all day.  Use it as it says, before you put any mascara on.  I curl my lashes for about 30-40 seconds and they look great.</li>
    <li> Once again, I find myself utterly delighted with my purchase!  This is the best heated eyelash curler I have ever used!  Ladies, do yourself a favor and get one of these little beauties!  You will be happy you did . . .</li>
    <li> I liked it has 2 heated bars instead of one.  but it doesnt heat up hot enough for me.  the battery life is very short.</li>
    <li> I love this curler... have been using it for the few years... the only thing is not as good w/ it is the batteries drained very fast.  I sometimes had to take the batteries out after each use... it seemed to help but such a hassle cuz I used it every morning for work.  But all &amp; all, it works for me!</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic doesn&#x27;t last but good enough for the price</li>
    <li> love it. i tried  a few heated ones. i really like this one. i have long straight  down. this one is the best so far..</li>
    <li> Not that good. Have to hold it to your eyelashes forever to get a curl, and then it makes your eye feel somewhat warm... I went back to using a regular curler after trying this a few times, though that has its drawbacks too. If anyone knows of a brand of mascara that works to give a nice curl I would be interested in hearing about that.</li>
    <li> Ever since trying my first heated eyelash curler, I can&#x27;t go back to a non-heated version.  I have long eyelashes that actually point into my eyes rather than up, so I use curlers for comfort as well as beauty.  Most recently, I had purchased a [[ASIN:B000CSLIH4 JAPONESQUE JAPONESQUE Heated Mini lash Curler]], but it didn&#x27;t get hot enough or really even move my lashes.  I thought this would be a bit more sturdy as the plastic tends to break on the top after prolonged use on this style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the double padding on this curler, but I could see how people with shorter lashes may not reap the benefits.  Better than previous curlers where I had to hold it closed to heat it up, this one has a separate switch to warm up.  It only takes seconds to heat up (on fresh batteries) and the color-changing pad makes it dummy-proof.  The actual device is light but it more sturdy than I would have thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions suggest a 20-30 second hold, but even with a 10-15 second hold on the lashes, I get a good four hours of hold without mascara.  Like hair, everyone has different eyelashes that respond differently, but don&#x27;t be turned off by some of the poor reviews.  It was more than worth the $6.59 I paid, and I will seriously buy this exact product again when it breaks (I tend to break things).</li>
    <li> It breaks way too quickly, as in within 6-12 months. Still, I reorder it. It gives off gentle heat and works miracles for my lashes! It&#x27;s better than heating your curler with the hairdryer!</li>
    <li> I prefer my Panasonic heated curler, but this one works fine</li>
    <li> Received it in late February and it is already broken.  Will not heat up.  Tried replacing batteries, but that was not the issue.  This item has been kept in a makeup bag, not abused and not used everyday.  Should have lasted longer than 5 months.  Would not recommend.  When it was working it worked okay, not great.</li>
