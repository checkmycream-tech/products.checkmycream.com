<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if &amp;#34;Face Lift&amp;#34; is the right word to describe the product.  What it does is &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; the skin.  When someone gets older, their skin kind of &amp;#34;sags&amp;#34;.  You know you skin is sagging because if you put the palm of your hands on your cheeks and pull upward, you notice a big difference.  Everything is pushed back, diminishing the sag and the lines and your face is smooth again.  When you apply the Nu Face Lift, it tightens stuff up on your face, making the smaller wrinkles and baggy bits on your skin less noticeable.  It makes your entire face look &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; like it&#x27;s had a mini-boost.</li>
    <li> My wife uses NuNutrients Face Lift and she really likes it.  She uses their facial cleaner also and I think she&#x27;s really happy with the brand.  She&#x27;s always trying different brands before and seemed quite satisfied but with NuNutrients she&#x27;s very happy.  She started using this because of what she said her age and wants to keep her youth as much as possible.  So far she&#x27;s very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Aging. What&#x27;s that? Wifey hunts the products down and I purchase and post reviews on them. This product has significantly reduced the amount of wrinkles on her face. I asked her if the product was working out okay because I noticed that her face looked really tight and had less &#x27;slack&#x27; on it. Don&#x27;t worry though, she says that her face doesn&#x27;t feel tight or hard and that it actually feels smooth like chocolate almond milk. Happy wife, happy life! So all you ladies out there, don&#x27;t lose any more sleep over wrinkles and such.. give this product a try, it just might change your life.</li>
    <li> Face lift is just a marketing decision when it comes to the name of this product. It&#x27;s basically a product that helps keeps wrinkles away. It works fine and keeps you looking as young as you possibly can so try it out if you&#x27;re looking to take better care of your skin. Great price and arrives quickly.</li>
    <li> There are several wrinkles on my face and because of that I am looking older than what I am. Then I tried this product and it helped me a lot in regaining my younger look. Thanks to NuNutrients for such an amazing supplement. Loved the results and a must try one. Looking to order again and enjoy the results.</li>
    <li> This is an effective product. Truly lives up to it&#x27;s name. Your face will look more bright and youthful after use. Vanish those wrinkles and stay young looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with crows feet appearing on my face in the past couple years, a genetic thing that unfortunately happens in my family as a young adult.  I have been looking looking for something like this for a LONG time, knowing that I would suffer from premature wrinkling. NuNutrients never seems to let me down. I applied the cream, rubbing it into my wrinkled spots just under my temples for a few weeks daily. I can&#x27;t be sure if they&#x27;re gone for good (probably not) but I certainly don&#x27;t notice them, and others have told me how much more vibrant my eyes are now. I feel like a whole new person!  Getting older is not easy, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we have to give up on our looks because of it!</li>
    <li> As a mom have you noticed since having babies and aging that your face is just not what it used to be?  I have been searching high and low for products that will help tighten and lift my skin, especially under my chin.  I noticed that it&#x27;s starting to hang slightly almost like a wattle.  Oh dear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about lines and wrinkles?  Thankfully, NuNutrients came up with a product that is specifically for removing fine lines and wrinkles and may even tighten the skin around it.  It&#x27;s perfect for crows feet which I have also started seeing when I smile.  No, those aren&#x27;t laugh lines.  So happy that NuNutrients has something that works on these target areas that we are always concerned about.  Here&#x27;s to staying younger looking.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this very long but I noticed a change already. I have very uneven skin and feel this has really helped to firm up my face. I notice a difference for sure. I&#x27;m constantly squinting my eyes when I watch TV and use the computer as I have bad eyes. The lines around my eyes have improved. It&#x27;s taken years off my face and neck area. I am very impressed with the effectiveness of this line of products.</li>
    <li> I am 70 but look 60!  This NuNutrients Face Lift helped smooth my complexion.  It also removed some of my brown spots!  I am so happy.  I look like a young lady again!  It is worth every penny.  I feel much more confident!</li>
    <li> Once I hit 30 I started noticing the fine lines around my eyes mouth and forehead appear. Panic set in and I spent a small fortune on anti-aging creams and serums. Even the most expensive products did little to stop Father Time marching across my face. I&#x27;ve had great results from other NuNutrients products so I gave this one a go, but didn&#x27;t get my hopes up. But after only a week the fine lines are less noticeable, and my skin has a brightness and suppleness I thought I had left in my twenties. You only need a small amount of cream to see results, so it&#x27;s slso great value in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Amazing serum. My skin is soft and smooth, I can&#x27;t imagine my life without it. I&#x27;ve tried other anti-aging creams and I was never satisfied until I found this one. Now I have a baby like soft skin.</li>
    <li> My mom turned me on to this product when I voiced concerns that my age was starting to show in my face. I love the product. There is a noticeable difference in the health and beauty of my skin already. Best of all, I know it will continue to be effective for me into the future (my mom uses it, after all, and she swears by it, too!) NuNutirents, you have done it again. My favorite brand ever.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best anti-aging product that I have seen so far. My mom has sensitive skin and she started using it since last 3 weeks ago and she loves it. It smoothen and brighten up her skin. She uses it almost every morning and it doesnt cause her any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;This will be a great product for those who are looking to reduce wrinkles and improving facial texture.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  need more time to evaluate.</li>
    <li> This is an intensive cream that will renew your complexion while giving you firmer and younger-looking skin. It provides a youthful look, and keeps your skin moisturized and nourished. It also helps to reduce the signs of aging and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin look youthful, younger, supple and beautiful. It also works towards skin smoothening and skin moisturization.Must Have product!!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product. When I applied it I felt a little bit of tightness, but it went away not too long afterwards. I then had a lot more smoothness than I&#x27;d had before.  I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of wrinkles yet, but this would definitely be great as a preventative tool as well. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Just started this product...wouldn&#x27;t say wrinkles disappeared but my skin is definitely less dull and more dewy. Absorbs really easily. Smell isn&#x27;t over-powering. Also, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Great price. And I like to cool sleek bottle too, which isn&#x27;t important - just looks nice.</li>
    <li> My wife has different products from this brand. She loves Face Lift. She has been using it for a while and saw a difference within a week.  Our friends compliment her on how good her skin looks and she tell them it is because of the NuNutrients. Bottom line, this product works, and it works as advertised. We can see the difference in the firmness of skin since she began using these products. We greatly recommend this line to anyone who wants healthier younger looking skin!</li>
    <li> I can say this cream &#x27;lifted&#x27; my face but it definitely tightened my skin and erased the fine line that have began around my eyes and between my eyebrows. I also felt like this made a huge difference in tightening up my chin were I have felt self conscious about ever since loosing a little bit of weight. I love this cream and I am loving my skin!</li>
    <li> NuNutrients Face Lift cream tightens the skin when applied.  It&#x27;s a great second option compared to cosmetic surgery.  Priced just under $100, it&#x27;s a bargain.  The cream can be applied whenever needed.</li>
    <li> Nu Nutrients has done it again! I love this line! Its the best for my sensitive skin. I have been using this one for about 2 weeks now. My 2 toddlers have drained me of my life force, and I was using this to try to get some of it back! I am using it on my face once a day, in the morning, and on my hands once a day. So far I have seen my skin has brightened up, it is very supple and smooth to the touch, even my husband says my face and hands are &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;- the exact word he used, my face is more firm, and my hands look and feel so soft and youthful, the wrinkles and roughness in my hands diminishing. The results have been beautiful so far so 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom last year, after months of her feeling so down about her appearance, I decided to take action. I did research and stumbled across this lovely gem, and I can truly say it is working. My mom has a more youthful look about herself, her face is just glowing and overall has this flawless wrinkle free look. Just like she did 10 years ago! I am so happy to see my mom nature beauty shine through again, thanks to NuNutrients Face Lift :)</li>
    <li> Unlike the previous reviewer, I am not that young and so I do need all the help that I can get. I have been noticing fine lines around my mouth and eyes, especially, and since I use other NuNutrients products with success, I purchased this product to try it out. I am glad that I did. Just after using it once, I did notice that the wrinkles across my mouth were far less noticeable (the wrinkles around my mouth have started to look like they are carved into my face). Together with their other products, this line keeps my skin looking young and fresh.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;It works great for smoothing and rejuvenating skin. I&#x27;m in the sun a lot and my skin gets dry&lt;br /&gt;a lot as well. This product leaves my skin feeling  so soft and so much smoother. I love using it at night before i got to I sleep, I wake&lt;br /&gt;up with great feeling skin!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has dry skin or an uneven skin&lt;br /&gt;tone.

    <li> NuNutrients have an amazing line! Their Face Lift makes the skin instantly fresh looking. I have no wrinkles (yet!) but I have been using this product for a while, and my skin feels amazing! As with the other products, has a pleasant smell and goes on smooth and creamy. Also doubles as an excellent moisturizer. Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> This product works quickly! after just one use I was able to see the difference. Love Nu2 they are a very safe and reliable company. Would Recommend.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients Face Lift is a product that nourished skin and gives fresh look. It is an anti ageing cream ans reduces wrinkled. I have been using this product for several months. It suits for all skin types. I have a very sensitive skin and I was hesitant to try any type of creams. My friend suggested this cream as she had used it and had seen good results. I tried after seeing admirable changes in her face and sudden change in her skin texture. The wrinkles that were around the cheeks had vanished in a very few days. And I thought of giving it a try and to my astonishment it worked perfectly as expected and saw astonishing results.</li>
    <li> This is also another product that my mom and her friend used to help lift their face and they are so obsessed with using this. Sometimes I wonder whether her not they enjoy being their age because they are always keeping up with their beauty. I do recommend these though.</li>
    <li> this tightened my skin and made me feel better about the wrinkles around my eyes. It&#x27;s where I&#x27;m showing my age, Although it seems expensive, you don&#x27;t need much, so it&#x27;s more cost effective than it seems at first glance. I&#x27;ve also been using it around my mouth, and I&#x27;m seeing the fine lines disappear.</li>
    <li> I am soo happy with this product! I have never used any sort of wrinkle cream or serum in the past. I am getting older, late 30s. I have noticed my skin was not looking so young anymore. After a few days, maybe four or so I did notice my skin looked and felt more tight and smooth. Needless to say I was pretty excited! I have recommended to a couple of my friends, they noticed too. We are all pleased with how effective the results are. If you are considering any wrinkle treatments, give this serum a shot, I love it!</li>
    <li> Having reached my thirties, I get the same fears that all of us have about our face showing our age.  I notice some lines under my eyes and around my mouth and felt very upset.  I looked at many wrinkle remover products and decided on this one by NuNutrients.  It is a really wonderful product, since using it I have noticed my eyes look brighter and younger, my face has an overall beautiful look to it and I no longer worry about others seeing lines on my face.  I encourage everyone who has noticed the lines on their face getting more pronounced to try this.</li>
    <li> As I get older, it is essential to use face creams and serums that restore the damage of my skin and to make my face look more youthful. Since I’ve purchased this product, I’ve been using it regularly on my face to reduce fine lines and to increase the moisture of my skin. This is a good face lift product that I cannot live without.</li>
    <li> I love all of NuNutrients products and their Face Lift is no different. They have wonderful customer service and any questions that you have about the product, they are happy to answer. The product itself does exactly what it says it will. It removes your wrinkles! It just erases them away and makes you look years or even decades younger! Plus this serum smells wonderful and it leaves a soft, healthy glow about your skin and who doesn&#x27;t want that right? If you are looking for a solid anti-wrinkle cream, look no further. You have found the one that really works!</li>
