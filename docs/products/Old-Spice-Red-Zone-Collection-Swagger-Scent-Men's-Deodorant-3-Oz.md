      <li>now, Old Spice has given me too many options, excellent</li>
      <li>I wear t-shirts under my finer clothing; otherwise, the problem would be even greater than it is.</li>
      <li>Smells manly without getting into that over the top kinds of scent.</li>
      <li>Love swagger.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>Love the scent and the fact that it&#x27;s subscribe and save.</li>
      <li>I really am enjoying this stick of deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I get many compliments from patients and family members that I smell very clean.</li>
      <li>I am trying this as a new scent for, it is great, so</li>
      <li>It is more of a musky, strong smell.</li>
      <li>At a certain age you stop reading ad copy and focus on how the product works, and this does a good job.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had swarms of girls coming about me, kissing me, and most importantly, I smell like how a man should smell like.</li>
      <li>Other than being called &amp;#34;swagger&#x27;, this product is great!</li>
      <li>and it is not so strong that everywhere</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like anti-persperants (I don&#x27;t sweat a lot) and am happy this scent comes in the deodorant only variety.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m traditionally an Original Stick kind of guy, but picked up this Swagger thanks to a coupon</li>
      <li>Smells good, you don&#x27;t need alot of it and the smell actually lasts nearly a full day!</li>
      <li>Bought a stick of Old Spice Swagger deodorant earlier this year and it worked GREAT!</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s Proctor and Gamble who I avoid due to animal testing issues, but this really is the best deodorant imho.</li>
      <li>It smells good, and it lasts long which is important.</li>
      <li>The pleasant smell easily distracts the average landlubber and helps me get away with all the booty I can carry.</li>
      <li>it would be that the bar itself seems to diminish rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>and I think this stick will last a pretty good while as well.  </li>
      <li>It will likely add about 17% to your attractiveness quotient, which is pretty good for the price.  </li>
      <li>I always used Old Spice and out of all their deodorants, I love this Swagger.</li>
      <li>This is just some smell-good to keep you fresh.  </li>
      <li>Price is right when you subscribe and save...</li>
      <li>I know some people told me there are more powerful one and longer lasting,</li>
      <li>When you call the company, you receive a special RECORDED message for THIS PARTICULAR problem.</li>
      <li>I am smelling as fresh as ever thanks to this delivery</li>
      <li>But it does work pretty well at keeping you from being stinky.  </li>
      <li>Ultimately personal, but it is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It has a great smell and seems to last all day long.  </li>
      <li>However, the two separate products definitely work better than an all-in-one.</li>
      <li>First - this will not make you swagger around.  </li>
      <li>Will still sweat in hot weather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now my favorite and use it daily.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s probably a better fit if you&#x27;re not ready for that plateau of manliness in your life (or feel secure enough in yours to not need the BURN), but overall, it&#x27;s a good product that I&#x27;d use again at the same price.</li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone familiar with old spice scents.  </li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re smart you will too.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>My son tried out Swagger and really likes it.  </li>
      <li>Even though i really like it</li>
      <li>Some people may not like it, but I really like this one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of different Old Spice scents, as I like their functionality, but this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;m back to the Original Stick.</li>
      <li>Nothing too strong or too weak and lasts most of the day.</li>
      <li>This product smells as if it were meant to be a cologne designed for older men.</li>
      <li>I used to use the High Endurance Fresh Scent, but recently came across this Swagger Scent.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is it burns a bit going on, but offers great protection.</li>
      <li>The first one still has about 3/4 left</li>
      <li>A new market for Old Spice; pre-teen/teen age boys.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t get more manly than a pirate and Old Spice Swagger is specially formulated to combat that hard day spent plundering and pillaging.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clear this is a alternative product to the Axe line,</li>
      <li>If you want ladies swarming around you and your friends jealous, then Old Spice&#x27;s Swagger is for you.</li>
      <li>I have been using Old Spice Deodorant for over 50 years</li>
      <li>I like old spice, and I like this smell</li>
      <li>sweat is manly after all), but it seemed to lack something compared to my old standby.</li>
      <li>The scent is masculine without being overbearing and</li>
      <li>so I guess I can&#x27;t really say which one is in second place.</li>
      <li>I like the scent of this one a lot, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up as long as the Pure Sport scent for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Old Spice.  </li>
      <li>I cannot believe that Old Spice is actually marketing a product that it knows does this to people&#x27;s clothing.</li>
      <li>Have to go buy a new stick of some other brand today and throw this one out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love swagger. Nice when your man smells good for you :)</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get more manly than a pirate and Old Spice Swagger is specially formulated to combat that hard day spent plundering and pillaging. The pleasant smell easily distracts the average landlubber and helps me get away with all the booty I can carry. My parrot likes the scent too!</li>
    <li> Ultimately personal, but it is my favorite. Could be the least useful review I&#x27;ve written.</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to add this to an order</li>
    <li> Works well. Smells good. Price is right when you subscribe and save... I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s deoderant. I kept me from smelling. Landed me a date. Not much to complain about here.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. My husband and son are happy with how well it works, and I love how it smells.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a deodorant, not an anti-perspirant.  You have to use something like Certain-Dri to actually prevent sweating.  However, the two separate products definitely work better than an all-in-one.</li>
    <li> Big fan of this item. Deoderant works well and smells great. Gets compliments. I&#x27;ve used a number of different Old Spice scents, as I like their functionality, but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> No complaints here. I am smelling as fresh as ever thanks to this delivery, I know my co-workers appreciate it.</li>
    <li> All the kids at school are into another product (that shall remain nameless).  My son tried out Swagger and really likes it.  A new market for Old Spice; pre-teen/teen age boys.</li>
    <li> Day Three of using Swagger. I&#x27;ve had swarms of girls coming about me, kissing me, and most importantly, I smell like how a man should smell like. The other men are jealous due to my popularity among women because I have so much SWAG. If you want ladies swarming around you and your friends jealous, then Old Spice&#x27;s Swagger is for you.</li>
    <li> Deodorants only, not antiperspirant. Will still sweat in hot weather.</li>
    <li> Some people may not like it, but I really like this one. It smells good, and it lasts long which is important. Plus it seems that it comes a lot.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this. He cannot get enough of it and I am happy for that. It smells really good</li>
    <li> I get many compliments from patients and family members that I smell very clean.</li>
    <li> Nice smell from it and it lasts all day :-)&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again and recommend it to others..</li>
    <li> Like this style and scent of deodorant.  Gel instead of a powdery style.  Smells manly without getting into that over the top kinds of scent.</li>
    <li> I like old spice, and I like this smell, it works great (gel type of deodorant stick) and it is not so strong that everywhere I go I smell like a mall perfume center.</li>
    <li> I found them cheaper ( on sale) at Walmart. But my boys like it so I guess that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m traditionally an Original Stick kind of guy, but picked up this Swagger thanks to a coupon (it&#x27;s manly to save money). I like the scent (as did the missus) and the fact that it&#x27;s your standard deodorant stick (not into gels or flaky white antiperspirants...sweat is manly after all), but it seemed to lack something compared to my old standby. I think it&#x27;s mostly missing the BURN (call me crazy...but I miss that), so it&#x27;s probably a better fit if you&#x27;re not ready for that plateau of manliness in your life (or feel secure enough in yours to not need the BURN), but overall, it&#x27;s a good product that I&#x27;d use again at the same price. In the meantime, I&#x27;m back to the Original Stick. Coming in second isn&#x27;t so bad...</li>
    <li> Makes my son smell good</li>
    <li> Bought a stick of Old Spice Swagger deodorant earlier this year and it worked GREAT! Reduced sweating, and that Old Spice tang lingered all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried a new scent for a few months (Game Day), then bought another stick of Swagger this summer. Started using it about a month ago, and noticed it wasn&#x27;t reducing sweat and improving odor like it used to. Just last night developed a nasty red rash in both armpits. After checking online, seems that a large number of people develop a reaction to this deodorant, and especially many this summer. What happened to this batch of deodorant?? Why the sudden reaction? Disappointed in what was a fine product. Have to go buy a new stick of some other brand today and throw this one out.</li>
    <li> After wearing this deodorant I was kicked out of the local watering hole. The reason being I was causing a comotion with all the women swarming around me. When they say swagger they mean it. Hidden in the stick is a bunch of MOJO also.</li>
    <li> I always used Old Spice and out of all their deodorants, I love this Swagger. I know some people told me there are more powerful one and longer lasting, but for me, I sit in an office, this deodorant is great and gets the job done. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> Makes me smell like a man. A manly man. A man who does manly things, like commute, throw my child in the air, and read.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good deoderant. Smells nice. Buy this if you have used it before and know how it smells. That&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this one a lot, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up as long as the Pure Sport scent for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome awesome. I really like this product. It does the job and it is well priced. I will definitley order from this seller again in the future.</li>
    <li> The scent is really nice. It just doesn&#x27;t last as long as other deodorants I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> This product is abominable! It leaves blue streaks on one&#x27;s clothing. It may be hard to believe, but it&#x27;s the truth. Really, I&#x27;m not exaggerating. When you call the company, you receive a special RECORDED message for THIS PARTICULAR problem. What does that tell you? Unfortunately, when one applies the product sparingly, as suggested, it does little or no good. When one pre-treats the spots as suggested, this too is ineffectual.    I cannot believe that Old Spice is actually marketing a product that it knows does this to people&#x27;s clothing. I will never again purchase another product from this company, and I will encourage others to refrain from doing so.    Thank goodness I wear t-shirts under my finer clothing; otherwise, the problem would be even greater than it is.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s Proctor and Gamble who I avoid due to animal testing issues, but this really is the best deodorant imho.</li>
    <li> First - this will not make you swagger around.  The swagger must come from within, not via a bar of deodorant.  If you could buy swagger, *everyone* would swagger and it would be worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, this does not give you the swagger.  But it does work pretty well at keeping you from being stinky.  It&#x27;s clear this is a alternative product to the Axe line, what with the attitude and so on in the ad copy.  Whatever.  At a certain age you stop reading ad copy and focus on how the product works, and this does a good job.  The scent is masculine without being overbearing and obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a complaint it would be that the bar itself seems to diminish rather quickly.  I mean, I&#x27;m not piling this stuff on or anything (nor do I think I&#x27;m all that stinky...), but one bar of this doesn&#x27;t seem to last an overly long time.  I contrast this with the Speed Stick I used to use and which seemed to last about twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that aside, it&#x27;s a good product.  It will likely add about 17% to your attractiveness quotient, which is pretty good for the price.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> Great! Love the scent and the fact that it&#x27;s subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> This is just some smell-good to keep you fresh.  The ladies like it, so if you&#x27;re smart you will too.  Everything is great except the name.  Ugh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Old Spice.  I used to use the High Endurance Fresh Scent, but recently came across this Swagger Scent.  It&#x27;s now my favorite and use it daily.  I don&#x27;t like anti-persperants (I don&#x27;t sweat a lot) and am happy this scent comes in the deodorant only variety.</li>
    <li> Smells good, you don&#x27;t need alot of it and the smell actually lasts nearly a full day! Even though i really like it i shouldn&#x27;t have bought 6 sticks. The first one still has about 3/4 left and i&#x27;ve been using it for half a year....</li>
    <li> I have been using Old Spice Deodorant for over 50 years so I guess I can&#x27;t really say which one is in second place.</li>
    <li> Other than being called &amp;#34;swagger&#x27;, this product is great! Lasts a long time, smells awesome, great price...will be picking up more ASAP.</li>
    <li> Smells good and very easy to use. No issues turning the knob to push the stick up. I&#x27;ve had issues with other deodarants that were hard to deal with.  I would recommend to anyone familiar with old spice scents.  Nothing too strong or too weak and lasts most of the day.</li>
    <li> This product smells as if it were meant to be a cologne designed for older men. I would not recommend this to any &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; males that want to &amp;#34;attract the ladies&amp;#34;. It is more of a musky, strong smell.</li>
    <li> I am trying this as a new scent for, it is great, so now, Old Spice has given me too many options, excellent</li>
    <li> Works great for me and I walk about 6-10 miles a day.  Keeps me from smelling horrid even after my walk.  My only complaint is it burns a bit going on, but offers great protection.</li>
    <li> I really am enjoying this stick of deodorant.  It has a great smell and seems to last all day long.  It goes on smooth and I think this stick will last a pretty good while as well.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great scent, but was a gel stick and my hubby prefers the solid. Not sure the product tag mentioned that.</li>
    <li> Old spice swagger is the best. If u want your pits to always smell good, get this</li>
</ol>
