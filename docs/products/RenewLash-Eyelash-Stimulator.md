      <li>I asked what kind of mascara</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best price, I paid way too much at the salon.</li>
      <li>Maybe the formula has some kind of moiturizing agent that soften the lashes so they curl up after u wake up or when you blink thousand times a day.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I was hesitant to purchase this.  </li>

      <li>go very easy on the application.</li>
      <li>The most popular one is \\&quot;how</li>

      <li>lol, it scareds me that my lashes is reach up to my eyebrows and i dont even need a mascara,,i would difinitely recommend this to anyone that wish to have long lashes besides my lashes is more thicker and stronger .</li>
      <li>I put it on, also it dryes the skin around my eyes increasing my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes...  </li>
      <li>and then my eyes were fine.</li>
      <li>At this point I figure it cost me less than a dollar a day to have these beautiful eyelashes!!  </li>
      <li>Her lashes were newly fabulous, so I gave it a go.  </li>
      <li>This product is AMAZING, and it really works.</li>

      <li>My lashes used to be sparse &amp; now they have really filled in.</li>
      <li>I have used three products; of the three this is by far the most effective.   </li>
      <li>You have much, much longer lashes and many more of them, but it doesn&#x27;t thicken or plump them up.  </li>

      <li>I considered quitting using it, but since I paid so much for it, want to give it just a couple more weeks.</li>
      <li>I am 43 years old, and honestly don&#x27;t remember ever having lashes this substantial.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it everyday until it is at my ideal length.  </li>
      <li>has a mild effects and dont sting my eyes</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t happen quickly.</li>
      <li>I will definately buy another tube when I finish the first one!</li>
      <li>As I get older, I notice my lashes becoming sparse.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what they put in this stuff,but it works and is well worth the money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Honestly, I was hesitant to purchase this.  The reviews looked great and yet there were only a few so I wondered if they were placed by the company.  I took a chance thinking well, for $60 - when the other leading brands are 130 - I&#x27;ll give it a try.  I am thrilled that I did!!!!!        I am 41-years-old and had started to find I needed more and more mascara.  My lashes were getting sparse and after using this stuff for three months they are longer and fuller than I&#x27;d ever imagined they could be.  It&#x27;s shocking.  They are so long they rub on my glasses and sunglasses but that&#x27;s a good thing.      I&#x27;ve been using it 4 months and would say I started to notice a difference after a couple of months.  When a make-up artist I work with (I work on television) saw me the last time, she was shocked at how long they were and thought I had extensions.  She said she was going to buy some herself.    The tube seems to last forever, unlike some of the other brands that are $130 and they warn you it&#x27;s only a one month supply.  I&#x27;m still on my first tube and bet it will last up to 9 months or longer.      I truly can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is, especially for the Amazon price.     Just to cover the bases, I will say, you still have to use mascara.  You have much, much longer lashes and many more of them, but it doesn&#x27;t thicken or plump them up.  Still, I think it&#x27;s one of the best beauty products I have ever purchased.     In my opinion, and I swear I DO NOT work for this company, run don&#x27;t walk to get your credit card to buy this.</li>
    <li> I have been using RenewLash almost 4 months. My eyelashes are so long that I have actually cut them! They are also curled and I haven&#x27;t used an eyelash curler in at least 3 months. You have to be patient. It doesn&#x27;t happen quickly. I didn&#x27;t see really dramatic results for about 2 and a half months. My daughter has also had fabulous results. I do have some reddening close to my eyelashes, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for the long, lush lashes. I also had red, scratchy eyes the first day I used it, but that was only one day and then my eyes were fine. I&#x27;ve had the same tube for 4 months and have just started using it about every three days. I love it!</li>
    <li> I refused to believe that this could work, but went on a girl&#x27;s trip and a trusted friend swore by it.  Her lashes were newly fabulous, so I gave it a go.  Within one week I began to see fuller, longer lashes.  Now after one month, my lashes are unbelievable.  I highly recommend Renew.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 17 days now.  To be honest, I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference.  But then again, I don&#x27;t really pay much attention to my eyelashes.  I just decided to try this stuff for fun.  So, today at lunch, my boyfriend of 10 years suddenly looked at me and said, \\&quot;Are you wearing false eyelashes?  They really look long!  I&#x27;ve never seen them that long before.  They look great!\\&quot;  Of course, I sat there with my mouth open, totally stunned.  I thought that it must be a coincidence . . . maybe I put on more mascara than usual, or maybe he just happened to notice my eyelashes for the first time, etc.  Then I thought that he&#x27;s never said one thing about my eyelashes in the 10 years we&#x27;ve been together.  Now that&#x27;s either a really spooky coincidence or maybe, just maybe, this stuff actually works.  I still think it&#x27;s too early to tell and I continue to be skeptical at this point, but I thought I would at least put it out there for those who are considering this product.  I&#x27;m not yet giving it my full endorsement because the verdict is still out, but I was just flabbergasted and stunned that I received such a comment after using this product for a little under 3 weeks.  Is that crazy or what?!    UPDATE 10/02/09    This stuff definitely works.  My eyelashes are so long that it&#x27;s unbelievable.  However, I don&#x27;t recommend using this on your lower lashes (unless you really want them to be just as long as your upper lashes.  I tried this and they were getting way too long to look natural).  I think this is a great alternative to purchasing an expensive brand name product that requires a prescription.  Two months later, I&#x27;m still on my first tube (applying it one time per day) and I believe this tube will probably last me another two months.  I&#x27;ve never experienced any of the irritation or redness that others have, but I did notice that my eyes were a little itchy the following morning.  I do recommend this product and I&#x27;m so excited to continue using it and seeing the results.</li>
    <li> Renewlash is the most amazing beauty product I&#x27;ve ever purchased! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks but already people are asking me if I&#x27;m wearing extensions. I can&#x27;t believe the difference! The first 4-6 days were tough as the product does cause irritation. I just carried eye drops and made sure I didn&#x27;t rub my eyes. The irritation is well worth it and I&#x27;ll never stop using this product!</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical at first, because I didn&#x27;t see any effect for a month, plus my eyelids were a little red every morning. But after the 5th week I was amazed by how long my lashes grew. They were at least twice as big and were even touching my glasses when I blinked. Never got so many compliments before!</li>
    <li> This product is questionable.  Perhaps after 6 weeks of use I saw a little lengthening of my lashes.  But, unlike Latisse, it does not lead to thicker or darker lashes.  Additionally it itches like crazy and causes eye redness.  Not sure it is worth the price.  I&#x27;m going to try Latisse.</li>
    <li> this product did what it said, although be aware that until your eyes become accustommed to it they will get red around the lid area. go very easy on the application. After a few months of application my lashes were very long and looked great, however, if you stop using this product your lashes will go back to the original way they were before you used this product. Yes, they do get long but not thick. Probably would try it once again but not too soon as it has sky-rocketed in price.</li>
    <li> I have never had eyelashes this long before!  I have had so many comments on my lashes! The most popular one is \\&quot;how do I get those lashes!\\&quot; As long as you use this product faithfully...everyday, once a day on clean skin, you will see results. It took about 2 months before i started noticing a difference and by the end of the third month they had dramatically grown longer. The tube lasted me about 4 months. I plan on continuing using this product!    Amy</li>
    <li> As I get older, I notice my lashes becoming sparse.  I&#x27;ve never had beautiful lashes anyway, but they were almost non-existent, and putting mascara on was always a challenge.  I started using this product 1.5 months ago, and the difference is incredible.  I have lashes! The mascara I have always used goes on effortlessly, and the results are spectacular!  The only thing is that my lids are red at night and sometimes the lash line itches- and when I used on the lower lash line I noticed slight discoloration, like a mascara smudge at the outer corner of the eye.  But all in all, I would say the results def outweigh any cons!  I love it!!!  Just make sure to line the upper lash line and eyebrows (if you want), but take care not to get any in the eye!  Try it!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month now. WOW! I can&#x27;t believe the results. My lashes are longer and fuller, people ask me what type of mascara I use. I tell them about Renew Lash. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my lashes will look like in another month, even 4 months from now. The price is right, and I had my product within a few days! My eyes were red and irritated for the first 2 weeks, but using eye drops it helped to cleared it up. I will definately buy another tube when I finish the first one!</li>
    <li> This product does not do what claims to do.  I have used since I got it and have seen no improvement at all.  My lashes remains the same lenght and my eyes get super red and irritated very time I put it on, also it dryes the skin around my eyes increasing my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes...  Defenitely I do not recomend it and defenitely will not buy again..</li>
    <li> Excellent product works!! Have used other products like this one but this is the best!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I had pretty long lashes to begin with but they were thin and fair, but now it looks like I am wearing fake lashes all the time.  They are so long and full!  It took about a month to really see a difference but when it starts working it truley is shocking how good it works.  I have even had to trim one or two lashes because they got too long.  LOVE IT!  - Jenny</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from my mom who works at a high end salon.  She had been using it for a few months &amp; loved it.  It takes about 6-8 weeks of daily use to see results, but then the growth &amp; thickness take off!  Well worth the money &amp; time.  I first experienced a little redness and irritation, but found that was due to using too much.  I had the best luck using it once a day during the day on my top lashes only.  My mom actually had less redness when using it at night (i had more using at night), so play around with it &amp; see what works best for you.  Both of our lashes are longer &amp; way thicker.  My lashes used to be sparse &amp; now they have really filled in. After 8 weeks my husband even noticed.  LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product!! The price is pretty high but it definitely works. I bought it after I saw my sister&#x27;s lashes turn long, thick and curly. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks but I can see a difference. Be patient. For someone who&#x27;s lashes were non existent, it is a miracle!</li>
    <li> I too was skeptical about the product but purchased it at my salon after they raved at the results they had.  I have been using daily for about 2.5 months and am shocked at the results. My lashes are so much longer, I have stopped using my eyelasher plumper b\c it is no longer needed.  I had really fine lashes on the bottom and did not even use mascara prior to the product b\c the lashes were so sparse.  My bottom lashes are dark and long-it is amazing!!!  I did not have any of the irriation that some other of the reviewers had.  Be patient and use daily, you won&#x27;t have results immediately but you will after several weeks!</li>
    <li> Ok, I used this for 2 weeks and then stopped using it(for no reason really, just got lazy). I sort of saw a difference but now I have been using it again for about a week and a half and my eyelashes are long! I asked my twin sister yesterday if she noticed and she said, Oh my gosh yes!! She wanted to know where she could get some!! So keep using it--it works!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over 50 yrs old and my lashes were quickly thinning out and fading away. I researched eyelash growth but was concerned about having an allergic reaction or changes in eye color. I decided to try this product beginning in mid-February.  Results were slow, but I faithfully applied RenewLash every night. By the first week of April I was amazed at what I saw in the mirror. To be certain that the change was natural, I stopped using mascara.  Now I wish I had before and after pictures! One more thing, my eyes are still green and I&#x27;m a satisfied customer. Buy this product!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product (Renewlash) nor the vendor.  I did not notice any increase in length in my eyelashes.      In addition, the vendor did not ship my product when they stated they would.  I also attempted to contact the vendor who sold the product, but they did not answer any of my emails I sent.</li>
    <li> I first heard about this through my hair salon.  I was not so sure.  Then I went out with a group of gals who all had super long eyelashes.  I asked what kind of mascara did they all use.  All used Renew Lash Grow by Metics.  I bought my 1st bottle for $130 from the salon at the end of May.  Now 5 weeks later, others are asking me what I use.  I am so happy with the results I am seeing. I still use mascara to enhance but what a difference. I did not have the eye issues that some have described.  So glad that I heard it was being sold online for $65.  I have not finished my 1st bottle but did already buy a 2nd bottle. I recently saw that Brooke Shields does a tv commerical for a similar product for a higher cost for the same results.</li>
    <li> After several attempts of calling Metics the company that makes the product to find out more about the product i.e. what the active ingredient was, where in MInneapolis, Minnesoata they sell it, etc. no one ever called me back and the lady who answered the phone was almost nervous when I called.  The only thing she could tell me was that there was 2 places in Minneapolis that sold it and they were both at asian nail salons.  Do your homework before you buy this product!</li>
    <li> This product really works!!!!  It took about a month of nightly use, but in one month I woke up with LONG beautiful lashes.  This product is worth the money and I would highly recommend it.  I have very sensitive skin and had no type of reaction.  People were constantly asking about my lashes and how beautiful, full, and long they were.  You cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> I was an eyelash extenstion wearer for about 2 years. I stopped getting the extensions because it was getting expensive ($80 a month) and I noticed my eyelashes were barely visible and were short and puny! I always had long dark lashes naturally. I was devastated because I looked so ridiculous. So I decided to buy a eyelash grower. After tons of research, I decided to buy this product. The product actually works. Ive been using it for a little over a month and my lashes are back to normal and maybe a little longer! I didnt experience any pain or burning. My top eyelid got a little pink when I scratched it but it looked like I was wearing eyeshadow so I didnt mind the redness. I highly recommend this product, I just wish it was cheaper!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  My lashes are thick and very long after using for 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for approx 2 months and have had to stop using it on a regular basis because my lashes were getting so long that they would drag on the inside of my glasses when I wore mascara.  I love this product and would recommend it for those of you with short skinny lashes. I had a bald spot on the left eye and you would never know it now.  I get comments constantly have to show people that they are my lashes by pulling them.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me, and I thought what the heck, it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. To be honest, it is a bit irritating to the eyes. Nothing horrible, just some slight itchiness &amp; redness. I found it helpful to use it in the morning instead of before bed.  I didn&#x27;t notice much difference the first month, but after about 6 weeks, I realized my lashes were fuller and actually hit my eyebrows! I am 43 years old, and honestly don&#x27;t remember ever having lashes this substantial. Now I just use it once week, and they still look and feel great. Amazon has the best price, I paid way too much at the salon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three months now, and I swear by it.  A local salon recommended it to me because my lashes have always been rather unremarkable--not too short, but not long and luscious, either.  With daily use, I now have fuller, longer lashes that nearly touch my glasses.  My aesthetician, who has done my lash tinting for years, cannot believe how well this product works.  I purchased my first tube at a local salon for $130 but will definitely be purchasing from Amazon from now on, as this price is a steal!  It is well worth the money but this discount is amazing.  I would give it ten stars if I could!  Use this in combination with Renew Brow (also by Metics and available for a significant discount here at Amazon.com) if you have thin eyebrows (I used to, but not anymore--that product also works amazingly well!).</li>
    <li> Within two weeks my lashes were fuller. I needed to purchase an eyelash curler. I never needed one before!</li>
    <li> So, I bought this product due to the reviews I&#x27;ve read. Before I used this stuff I had bald spots on my lashes due to continuous use of fake eyelashes over the years. My eyelashes were SEVERELY short and sparse, you couldn&#x27;t see my eyelashes even if you were close to my face! It was pretty depressing, that is how bad they were. I started using this product around 11/20/09 and used it consistently for a month. I did see a big difference during that month period, my lashes were definitely thicker than before, healthier, and slightly longer. Now my eyelashes are wicked long, and they look fake with mascara. But still even without mascara they are still long. Its been about 3 months and my lashes have completely changed. I wish I had before and after pictures, but sadly I don&#x27;t...</li>
    <li> I started using Renewlash less than two weeks ago.  The first thing that happened is I don&#x27;t need to use an eyelash curler anymore.  My lashes are curly and very visible now.  I&#x27;m also using it on my brows.  Thank goodness they aren&#x27;t curly like my lashes.  I understand it takes two months to see significant results.  I&#x27;m already very satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING, and it really works. I was skeptical but purchased it anyway, hoping for a miracle. My eye lashes are stick straight and sparse. After about 4 weeks of use, I noticed that they started to curl, even without mascara on them! They are longer, fuller and they stay curled all day long. I used to carry my eye lash curler with me at all times and use it multiple times a day. I am glad to say, that I havent touched it in over a month. I recently saw my Mom and she asked if I had eye lash extensions put on! She and my sister couldn&#x27;t wait to get their hands on Renew Lash!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend, so I purchased it and have been using it for over 3 weeks now but have not noticed any results. I use it nightly and have noticed that it makes my eyes very dry, red, and itchy. I considered quitting using it, but since I paid so much for it, want to give it just a couple more weeks. For now, I&#x27;d rate it a 2/5, but maybe I&#x27;ll change my mind if/when I start seeing results.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 weeks already.  It gave discoloration around my eyes and caused itchiness. It make me look older because of the discoloration and lack of brightness.  When I quitted using it for one day, my eyes were back to normal. I am not sure my eye lashes had grown any longer but i noticed that they seem to curl up a little bit.  Maybe the formula has some kind of moiturizing agent that soften the lashes so they curl up after u wake up or when you blink thousand times a day.  The curl up makes you believe that your eye lashes have grown longer. If this product does not give u any trouble with irritation and redness around eyes, u can try out see if this works on you, but becareful not to put it on too much...too much will cause more problems to your eyes.  Make sure you brush off the excess liquid by the tip of bottle so the brush can glide smoothly on your eyeline.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this product for about 4 weeks now in the hopes of seeing a change in my lashes. Unfortuantly, there really has not been a big change. Also just a warning to those who are considering using it, be cautious if you have sensitve skin or eyes because I do and it definitly irritated me.</li>
    <li> I purchased a tube of the Renew Lash by Metics a couple of months ago, and my eyelashes are looking longer and better than they ever have!  This one&#x27;s definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> I started using this product on Sept 25th and was hoping for long eyelashes for Christmas(Merry Christmas to me).It took about 5-6 weeks to see any changes.I was reluctant at first when a cousin of mine, who owns a salon sold it to me and claimed she tried others but that this one worked the best. She said the people at her salon were starting to cut their eyelashes because they were growing so long. Naturally, at first I thought she was pulling my leg and just trying to sell me another product. Now 3 &amp; 1/2 months later all I can say is WOW!! My eyelashes are longer,thicker and darker than ever. At 49, I have eyelashes like a supermodel. I actually have cut the outer ends twice. I also where Tarte eyelash stain or plum mascara in the day instead of black mascara because otherwise I&#x27;d feel like a showgirl. I never had any bad side effects and will continue to use it indefinitely. However,I will probably cut back to twice a week. My 66 year old aunt started to use it when I did and she says that her eyelashes now touch her eyebrows when she blinks.I only decided to write this because I am such a skeptic and don&#x27;t always believe things I read. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this stuff,but it works and is well worth the money. I am still on the same applicator and I have alot left. At this point I figure it cost me less than a dollar a day to have these beautiful eyelashes!!  (P.S.)I just recently found out that RenewLash by Medics has been recently re-branded as the product LiLash but new and improved...WOW!!</li>
    <li> Item was shipped very quickly and in brand new condition.  I have been using it for a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used three products; of the three this is by far the most effective.   I am disappointed that it may no longer be available.      My eyelashes were amazing, I used very little mascara and received numerous compliments from men and women alike.     Please try to reinstate.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Just do not use too much at a time. I love this. Great for eyelash and eyebrow</li>
    <li> EL PRODUCTO ES INCREIBLE, RECIEN LO ESTOY USANDO.... PERO LO VI EN MI HIJA, QUE YA LO HABIA USADO UN MES Y LOS RESULTADOS SON REALMENTE FABULOSOS.....ES QUE SUS PESTANAS ESTAN MUCHO MAS LARGAS Y DIVINAS..... PARECEN PESTANAS POSTISAS.... !!!Y SON NATURALES!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I saw results within the first week. I am tempted to buy a bunch more so I never run out!!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product, since it was for sale at my salon for $120 (double what I paid at Amazon).  I have been using it daily for about 4 weeks now, and I don&#x27;t see any real results yet.  My eyelids are a little puffy and pink and my eyes have been more irritated than usual.  I&#x27;m going to stick it out for a few more weeks, hoping to see some results.  So far, I&#x27;m not sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m entering the 5th week of using the product and am starting to notice new growth in my lashes. Nothing overly dramatic as yet, but an improvement. I&#x27;d recommend using it in the morning - I tried it at night before bed and it stung a little when I closed my eyes. No problems when using it in the daytime however.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product at my Salon for $120 after my eyelashes completely fell out during chemo.  I waited about 6 weeks after the last chemo, and my hair was growing back in before using the product. I had the longest, thickest lashes I&#x27;d ever seen in my life in about two weeks time.  People were amazed. I was amazed. You can see my lashes across the room.  And we joked that my lashes were longer than my hair.  Yes, the product does darken your eyelids.   And If my allergies are acting up, my eyes lids might feel a little dry or irritated.  But honestly, not very extreme and certainly not enough to make me quit using the product. As the first tube ran dry, I noticed my lashes weren&#x27;t as thick as they once were.  I have a new tube at half the cost and they are getting better again. My results with my new lashes just after chemo were probably more extreme &amp; much thicker than now (about 4 months later), but they are still rather long and curly and the product is still worth it.  I will continue to use this product indefinately.  And many of my friends now use it too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVED this product the first 2 or 3 weeks, the growth was incredible...but I&#x27;m very disappointed now. My eyelashes seem to be falling out and I have less than when I first started!  Some of the lashes are long but others are taking off in different directions...I&#x27;m flipping out cause they are sparse but a tad longer...has anyone else had this problem? I used it every night for 2 months...could using it too much cause permanent damage?? Does any one know for sure? I hate to keep using it, HELP&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</li>
    <li> I cringed and paid $150.00 for this at the salon.  It was worth every penny.  I wish I would have taken before and after pictures.  My thin, sparse lashes are REALLY  long...like I have to work to get the mascara to the end of the tips...full, lush.  This stuff is ridiculous.  My salon did say if you stop using it, your lashes will go back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; as they fall out.  I will NEVER go without!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used LILASH before, The result is good but it really sting my eyes, when i finished my LILASH i tried RENEW LASH GROW LONG LASHES BY METICS I was surprised with the results my lashes is more longer than i was using LILASH,and RENEW LASH  has a mild effects and dont sting my eyes but i was thinking to use it only every other day because my LASHES  now reach up to my eyebrows kind of funny because seems like  I am wearing false lashes  lol, it scareds me that my lashes is reach up to my eyebrows and i dont even need a mascara,,i would difinitely recommend this to anyone that wish to have long lashes besides my lashes is more thicker and stronger . love it but i am hoping it wont get more longer lol .</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t beleive how much my lashes have grown.  EVERYONE always asks me if my lashes are real.  When I tell them yes, they can&#x27;t beleive it.  They ask what kind of mascara I wear and when I tell them I&#x27;ve been using the Renew Lash by Metics they want to know where they can get it.  I let them know I ordered it from amazon.com.  It maybe alittle expensive, but worth it.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that say it will make your lashes grow, and they never did.  This product really works.  I Love It!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Love it!  Love it!!! My eyelashes are soooo long that they touch my upper eyelid.</li>
    <li> like most of the reviews, i too was skeptical about the product since it was really expensive but i wanted long lashes so i gave it a shot. in 2 weeks i saw a slight difference. in 3 weeks all my coworkers and friends noticed the change.     my eyes did get red and puffy at first but that&#x27;s because i realized i wasn&#x27;t putting it on correctly. you have to treat it like liquid eyeliner. meaning, you don&#x27;t want to use too much or  put it too close to the edge of your eye lids or else it will get in your eye! also, you have to make sure your eyes are cleaned or else the product isn&#x27;t going to work as well.     I use this every day and i put it on when i go to bed. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now and i&#x27;m still on my first bottle. definitely, worth the money!</li>
    <li> This ABSOLUTELY worked for me and all the girls in my family.  I used the product every other day after the shower on makeup free eyes.  My lash line did become a little pink after about a week or two of use, but the product never hurt or irritated my eyes, and I have very pale, sensitive skin and wear contacts.  After 2 weeks I noticed subtle growth and after the 4th week, my boyfriend commented that my eyelashes had gotten VERY long.  Its been about 6 weeks now and my eyelashes have not only grown A LOT in length, but also seem thicker, darker, and like they curl upwards more.  I will absolutely purchase this product again after it runs out and I am considering purchasing RenewBrow because I&#x27;ve had such great results with RenewLash</li>
    <li> It does work...  I saw the results in 4 weeks...  My mom noticed the difference in two months...  Sorry that the item went up in price  :((</li>
    <li> Renew Lash by Metics is a waste of time and money.  Plus you will be infuratated when you find your eyelashes have BROKEN OFF after 3 weeks of use. No Joke, this will happen, as it happened to me, my cousin, and 3 of my friends. DO NOT BUY.  It takes about 6 months for eyelashes to look like they are growing back again too.  It leaves the lashes extremely brittle, and damaged.</li>
    <li> I bought both the eyelash and the eyebrow growth stimulator from my salon, and yes, paid twice what you can get it from Amazon (grr). It works FABULOUS! My thining eyebrows (I&#x27;m 50) are filled in and my lashes! Someone tells me nearly every day that I have the longest eyelashes. I should make a commission on this product I have so many women buying it because of seeing me.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001CB5OE8 Renew Lash Brand New Factory Fresh]] Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!  My daughter, who is a cosmetologist, turned me on to this product.  This manufacturer has pulled out the ingredient in glaucoma medication which causes the eyelashes to grow, (ask anyone who has glaucoma about how incredible their eyelashes have gotten since they started using their medication!) and formulated Renew Lash. There are other products with a similar name, this product is by Metics.  Make sure you get the right one!  I have been using it for about 6 months and it is unbelievable.  My eyelashes are naturally short and straight.  They now hit almost to my eyebrows!  You will notice some irritation for the first 4-5 days of use, but it will go away after that.  I found that using eye drops during this period helped a lot.  You apply it like eyeliner just to your upper lash line at night.  It doesn&#x27;t take much.  You will start to see a difference in about 3 weeks.  As the weeks go by you will not believe it.  It&#x27;s amazing. I have people ask me if I have lash extensions all the time, and I have never had anybody say anything about my eyelashes in my entire life ,and I am 45!  I tell anybody who will listen about this product, it&#x27;s that good.  I was really skeptical at first but after my daughter started using it I was sold.  Your lashes will keep growing until they actually get too heavy for the follicle and then they will drop, being replaced by a new one.  I will definitely be using this forever!  And, the Amazon price of $62.00 can&#x27;t be beat, even with the shipping!  My daughter got mine using her cosmetologists discount and it was still $85.00!  This retails between $140-160! Because you don&#x27;t use much, it lasts a long time.  I would definitely buy it at this price, it is the best I have seen.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.  I know several people who are using this and they all are having the same results as I have!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I was skeptical at first, but I&#x27;ve always wanted longer and fuller lashes.  The price is so much better on Amazon than at the salon.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks now and I definitely notice a difference.  My lashes are fuller and longer!!!  I will continue to use it everyday until it is at my ideal length.  Then I was told to use it once a week for maintanence.  For the first couple of weeks, my eyelids were a little pink, puffy, and irritated, but fine now.</li>
    <li> This was the best stuff ever.  The company that made it was bought out by a competing company (I believe it was LaLash) but their product does nothing for your eyes.  Please bring back the original Metics formula - you know, the one that worked.</li>
</ol>
