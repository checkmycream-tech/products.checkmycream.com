      <li>This product is GREAT.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>

      <li>I really liked this product.</li>
      <li>(SBM seals it in) and I am apt to retain length.  </li>

      <li>So, if you want to keep chemical relaxers out of your hair then this product is a great option and definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s by far the best product that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>and it is the most effective \\&quot;serum\\</li>
      <li>Ok ladies, you may be convinced that the product can help your hair look good, but what is important to me is whether or not the product is functional.</li>
      <li>I promise you will love it.  </li>
      <li>And we moms are better moms when we feel GOOD!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The results were fabulous!</li>
      <li>but as most women with children know, pregnancy puts your hair through a roller coaster ride.</li>
      <li>I ordered one of each just to be safe.</li>
      <li>I read so many glowing reviews about this product that I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
      <li>but I tried it because of a review I read elsewhere (love word-of-mouth advertising), so I&#x27;m passing on the favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, I have four children ages nine and under and just do not have the time.</li>
      <li>Also, on humid days I&#x27;ve learned to add just a touch more.</li>
      <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on so many hair products over the years; this is the best one ever!</li>
      <li>I was thinking about buying the reformulated version, but many people said the original is better-</li>
      <li>3 days is more my wash interval# to wash it, because MB helps maintain a fairly clean, healthy &#x27;look.&#x27;    </li>
      <li>My hair is usually extremely dry and breaks easily without the perfect products.</li>
      <li>I think this is the most important test.</li>
      <li>I could go on and on because it&#x27;s really that good.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Sabino, keep up the good work</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product that helps smooth your hair and keep it smooth then you&#x27;ll love Sabino.</li>
      <li>My hair is so easy to blowdry and straighten.</li>
      <li>I blew out my hair with a brush and flat ironed, and I had beautifully silky hair.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>Over the years I have learned something important though.</li>
      <li>Even though I had originally bought this item to keep my hair smooth during humid weather, I now plan to use Sabino even during the winter months, because it makes straightening my hair an ease.</li>
      <li>I wash my hair and rinse with vinegar to remove residue, then I do a one good conditioner to apply some fresh new protection and rinse.</li>
      <li>Please note that I have not received the original</li>
      <li>It was such a relief, especially after trying so many products, that this worked beautifully!  </li>
      <li>, it stays soft and smooth on its own.</li>
      <li>When I first began researching hair straighteners, I concentrated on those with high ratings, of course, and those that mentioned something about being effective even in humid/moist conditions.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more. :)</li>
      <li>I hope you all enjoy this product as much as I do!</li>
      <li>I finally love my natural curls again!</li>
      <li>finally love my natural curls again!</li>
      <li>(Come on, I&#x27;m not superficial, nor vain, but when your hair looks good it goes a long way towards supporting *</li>
      <li>I love this product for my 4a/b natural hair and use it on every straightening occasion.</li>
      <li>But for those who are hesitant about buying sabino, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>But even if you do pay $20, it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
      <li>and after it is absorbed.     </li>
      <li>I just had to play with it to figure out the right amount.</li>
      <li>I like to finish is a dab of the Sabino; rub it in my hands and then lightly comb my hands through my hair to put a final, superfine layer of Sabino in my hair.     </li>
      <li>It is super light and it leaves your hair very silky without weighing it down (AT ALL), which is more than I can say for Lok and Blok.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product at all to get the desired results!</li>
      <li>Getting Hot</li>
      <li>I first &#x27;scrunch&#x27; the ends and then work it through the rest of my hair and then let it air-dry.    </li>
      <li>I was initially dubious about moisture block (I have tried many products/treatments, including a $240 thermal straightening process)</li>
      <li>I was waiting for the weather to get warmer to see if my hair remains straight after the southeast humidity kicks in!</li>
      <li>First, I will say the product is a must have for anyone who uses heat to curl or straighten their hair.</li>
      <li>Soft and silky smooth...</li>
      <li>Do not use too much though!</li>
      <li>It looked better the next day.</li>
      <li>I have very frizzy, dry, curly hair, this product has been amazing.</li>
      <li>but I had better results than when I used L&amp;B.    Maybe the L&amp;B&#x27;s two new ingredients are making the new version less effective, but if I have different results when I receive the original version (which is almost 3 weekslate), then I will repost.    </li>
      <li>My hair was so strong and soft, it surprised the heck out of me.</li>
      <li>spray with Nexxus Heat Protex Heat Protection Styling Spray ( also helps to soften hair better than any other heat protective styling spray), and put it up in jumbo hot rollers.</li>
      <li>And so the hunt continues for a straightening product that really is humidity/moisture proof, to keep curly hair straight all day...</li>
      <li>my hair retains LOTS of moisture and has LOADS of body, intense shine and controlled frizz.  </li>
      <li>I could have used too much, so that is why I am still giving it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really does what it says it does.</li>
      <li>it (fog, mist, humidity) and the chemically treated portion is still bone straight and the roots are beaded up like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
      <li>thanks....</li>
      <li>So, considering that and the reasonable price, I decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>and I get virtually no hair breakage for the 7 plus days that I wear my hair straight.  </li>
      <li>I still use the Frizz-Ease Curl Around shampoo and conditioner, they really do bring out the curls, but it&#x27;s this Sabino Moisture Block I can&#x27;t do without.</li>
      <li>When I am done, I have flowing, silky, bone straight hair.</li>
      <li>It depends on how much hair you have, but I use about a quarter-sized amount.  </li>
      <li>Sabino Moisture Block really works.  </li>
      <li>and I can say that it really works.  </li>
      <li>I HAVEN&#x27;T BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a no-brainer now, every day I dab a little in my palms, rub it into damp hair, and I&#x27;m confident my hair can dry into healthy curly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving the product two stars because it did make my hair easier to blowdry straight, and I was able to do it in less time.</li>
      <li>I was able to wear my hear down, sweat, and do whatever else</li>
      <li>Its surprising just how little you need to use to make it work properly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ths is a great product for frizzy hair.  It repels humidity great, I wouldn&#x27;t go out without it.</li>
    <li> If you have natural curly, coarse, dry, frizzy hair, this product does help.  Feedback from others is my hair is not as frizzy and does not look so dry.</li>
    <li> I have thick, fine, blonde frizzy hair and Marrakesh Oil Hair Styling Elixir really does soften and reduces frizzies, and I love the fragrance. My hairdresser uses this herself and it works very well , but she has thinner, only slightly frizzy hair. I combine the Marrakesh Oil with Sabino Moisture Block, as my hair requires serious frizz control. There are only two Ingredients: Dimethicone and Cyclomethicone in Sabino Moisture Block and it is the most effective \\&quot;serum\\&quot; I have ever used.   I try every new product and really like the softening and frizz control, and combine them in my hands to apply as the Sabino is verrry thick and sticky. They both require some adjustment to figure out how much to apply, but the results are the best I have ever had. I wash my hair at night, apply the products and go to bed (NO BLOW DRYING). In the morning my hair is dry, I sometimes add a little extra Sabino to the ends as I section my hair for each roller, spray with Nexxus Heat Protex Heat Protection Styling Spray ( also helps to soften hair better than any other heat protective styling spray), and put it up in jumbo hot rollers. The result is big, soft, wavy curls, lots of shine and no frizzy hair even in high humidity or rain.</li>
    <li> I am African American, and have thick coarse hair. Sabino has cut my straightening time in half. My hair is so easy to blowdry and straighten. I could feel the moisture protection after adding a heating element. It seems to immediately seal the hair shaft and makes my hair feel smoother and silkier. Even though I had originally bought this item to keep my hair smooth during humid weather, I now plan to use Sabino even during the winter months, because it makes straightening my hair an ease. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that helps smooth your hair and keep it smooth then you&#x27;ll love Sabino. Thanks Sabino, keep up the good work your product is forever a staple item in my hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> It does everything it claims to do. I have very tight, curly type 4 hair and when I used this product, along with my flat iron, my hair had shine and body as if I had a relaxer...the only complaint I have about it, but this really isn&#x27;t a complaint, is that if you use too much product it does make your hair a bit oily and weighed down, but this is just a matter of what works for YOUR hair type. So i suggest adding product little by little to see what works for you. Also, a little goes a LONG way! It doesn&#x27;t take much product at all to get the desired results!</li>
    <li> I read so many glowing reviews about this product that I thought I&#x27;d try it. I&#x27;ve had natural hair my whole life (4a/4b), and it&#x27;s been several years since I&#x27;ve attempted to straighten my hair because it would just poof back up within hours of doing all that hard work. I tried the moisture block 2 days go. I was thinking about buying the reformulated version, but many people said the original is better-plus it&#x27;s cheaper. After 2 days, I only have slight reversion at the roots in parts of my head. So I&#x27;m VERY impressed. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of silicones, but this product works very well for me. I also like that it&#x27;s fragrance-free as I&#x27;m allergic to everything under the sun.     This was my regimen: I washed and deep conditioned. I sectioned my hair into 8 plats before applying the conditioner to make it easier later on. I rinsed and let it air dry for about 15 minutes. I then applied about a quarter-sized amount to each section and combed through. This was followed by blow drying with a comb attachment. When I flat ironed it, I added just a drop more sabino to each little section before running the iron over it. The results were fabulous! I wish I bought 3 bottles instead of one to save on shipping later. I&#x27;m very happy with it.     Some people complained about it making the hair look greasy. Mine did look slightly greasy the day I did it, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad. It looked better the next day. I don&#x27;t particularly mind it either way though. I will definitely be buying more. :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, as I tend to be with any product that makes promises of a transformative effect, but Moisture Block actually delivered.  I had been using seemingly every available product to smooth and tame my kinky natural hair and have found that this product actually alows me to thermally straighten my hair and have it not revert.  Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s really good and it&#x27;s by far the best product that I&#x27;ve tried.  So, if you want to keep chemical relaxers out of your hair then this product is a great option and definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. My hair was so strong and soft, it surprised the heck out of me. It rained on my head, the wind blew like crazy when we had a storm, yet when my hair dried, it dried straight.  Fantastic product.  It&#x27;s now a part of my permanent hair regimen.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of anti-frizz serums over the years without any results. Sabino Moisture Block really works.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy and limp like many other serums.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than many store brands, but it is really worth it!  I have never heard of this product and found it by accident online...If you have a problem with frizzy hair, this is your answer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I can say that it really works.  I have dry frizzy hair and when I use this - I am so protected from moisture in the air.  I live in Oregon and my hair really stays even on a rainy day.  Over the years I have learned something important though. Don&#x27;t use too much of the product, because it will leave your hair looking slightly greasy.  Its surprising just how little you need to use to make it work properly. I&#x27;m never without this product. And added plus is all the money I&#x27;ve save NOT buying tons of other products that never seemed to work.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a blog.  The woman who suggested this product submitted herself (&amp; thus her hair) in a picture.  It was beautiful (more like stunning).  So, considering that and the reasonable price, I decided to try it.  It was such a relief, especially after trying so many products, that this worked beautifully!  I bring it in to my hairdresser when she does my hair, and she likes it now too.  She can&#x27;t believe the condition it leaves my hair in, since it has always been hard to work with (very course, thick, dry).  This tames it and it stays soft.  I also find that I don&#x27;t need serums in it after I use this, it stays soft and smooth on its own.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy, dry, curly hair, this product has been amazing. One of my clients turned me on to the product. It really does what it says it does. thanks....Judy</li>
    <li> When I first began researching hair straighteners, I concentrated on those with high ratings, of course, and those that mentioned something about being effective even in humid/moist conditions. I came across Sabino on several websites and saw that there is an original version and a new version (with two extra ingredients) called Lok and Blok. I ordered one of each just to be safe. Please note that I have not received the original but I did receive and use the Lok and Blok (from official website). I tried it following the directions exactly and even tried several different ways of using it just to be sure that I was using it every which way possible. I read reviews where a consumer with used the product, blow-dried and ironed her hair and then went into humid conditions on purpose (sweat/workout, shower steam) and her curly hair did not revert back to its natural state.    I have 3C hair and am in the process of growing out my chemically relaxed hair, with about 2 inches of new, curly roots. You can imagine how my hair must look when a little moisture hits it (fog, mist, humidity) and the chemically treated portion is still bone straight and the roots are beaded up like nobody&#x27;s business. THIS STUFF DID NOTHING FOR MY HAIR THAT I HAVEN&#x27;T BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH OTHER PRODUCTS. I&#x27;ve tried Alterna hemp straightening balm, Chi straigtening cream, Chi silk, Silk Strate, and Kerastase Oleo Relax. Of all of those, Lok and Blok is the thickest, but as soon as I hit the streets to battle NYC heat/humidity, my curly roots made an appearance. The best product was the Kerastase Oleo Relax. It is super light and it leaves your hair very silky without weighing it down (AT ALL), which is more than I can say for Lok and Blok. The KOR is not designed to fight humidity but I had better results than when I used L&amp;B.    Maybe the L&amp;B&#x27;s two new ingredients are making the new version less effective, but if I have different results when I receive the original version (which is almost 3 weekslate), then I will repost.    I&#x27;m giving the product two stars because it did make my hair easier to blowdry straight, and I was able to do it in less time. It did, however, revert with the slightest moisture. If the product is supposed to block moisture, I&#x27;m telling you that it did not deliver in my case. If it is supposed to keep hair straight until your next wash, even in humidity, I&#x27;m telling you the product did not deliver.    And so the hunt continues for a straightening product that really is humidity/moisture proof, to keep curly hair straight all day...</li>
    <li> Sabino is the best. Period.  I have African American thick, condensed 4a/b hair.  When I press my hair using the SMB, My hair does not, DOES NOT revert back to its kinky coils until I wash it out.  I use it as directed on 450 degress with a  SOLIA cermaic flat iron.  No heat damage because after 3 times using this--- The curls and naps came popping back.  Thats a good sign that my hair is not heat damaged!  TRY this... I promise you will love it.  I will never relax or perm my hair again.  i dont have to.  This is so much more convenient and less expensive.  SBM also leaves my hair feeling silky and I get virtually no hair breakage for the 7 plus days that I wear my hair straight.  I like this because my hair is being moisturized (SBM seals it in) and I am apt to retain length.  You cant beat that with a stick!</li>
    <li> I have the natural African-American hair; imagine the kinkiest, curliest hair possible. Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying to straighten my hair but it either doesn&#x27;t get straight or poof back up in a few hours. A friend recommended that I use Sabino Moisture Block as an anti-humidity serum and I bought it off Amazon the same day. When I received the Sabino, I washed and conditioned my hair with herbal essesnces hello hydration shampoo and conditioner. Then I sectioned my hair into 6 section and applied the a dime-size amount of the serum to each section from root to end. I blew out my hair with a brush and flat ironed, and I had beautifully silky hair. My hair has lasted a whole week and only puffed up at the roots in the middle of my had on day 5, but I can still wear it in a high ponytail. I will never be without this serum again, its WAAAY bettter than the John Frieda crap I was using.</li>
    <li> I have used Moisture Block for at least 7 or 8 years now; I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m probably not the stereotypical user of this product because -- I&#x27;m a guy.  However, I have long, curly hair and really like it, and therefore, take the time and spend the money to maintain it.    Here&#x27;s my regiment:  I use Joico K-Pak shampoo and conditioner.  Maybe once a week I alternate the K-Pak Reconstructor or Intense Hydrator in the place of the conditioner.  I have fairly dry hair, so, contrary to Joico instructions, I don&#x27;t rinse out the conditioner, Reconstructor or Intense Hydrator when I use them.  Then, I only towel dry my hair and apply Moisture Block.  It depends on how much hair you have, but I use about a quarter-sized amount.  I first &#x27;scrunch&#x27; the ends and then work it through the rest of my hair and then let it air-dry.    The result -- my hair retains LOTS of moisture and has LOADS of body, intense shine and controlled frizz.  Lastly, I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday because it&#x27;s too harsh.  When I don&#x27;t use MB I can tell, because my hair becomes difficult to manage #because it&#x27;s dry# and just &#x27;feels&#x27; dirty sooner.  While when I do, I can sometimes wait as long as five days #not the norm, just in extreme cases.  3 days is more my wash interval# to wash it, because MB helps maintain a fairly clean, healthy &#x27;look.&#x27;    I could go on and on because it&#x27;s really that good.  Just shop the price, though, because it can be expensive.  The norm is about $20 or so for a 3oz. bottle, but I just paid about $7.50 a bottle #great deal, so I bought 3 :#). But even if you do pay $20, it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
    <li> After looking at different hair blogs and forums, I&#x27;ve decided to purchase sabino moisture block. I was waiting for the weather to get warmer to see if my hair remains straight after the southeast humidity kicks in! After the I rinsed out my deep conditioner, I applied it to my slightly damp hair. I&#x27;m biracial with tight curls and when I flat ironed my hair, I did not have that burnt hair smell like I did with other heat protectants. The only downside I have was that it weighed my hair down and my hair looked greasy (I also have fine hair). But that&#x27;s usually because I&#x27;m heavy-handed with applying hair products anyway. But for those who are hesitant about buying sabino, it&#x27;s worth the money. Just tell yourself that a little goes a long way:)</li>
    <li> This stuff is the shizznit. My ol&#x27; lady told me about it, she used to use it when her hair was longer, to keep it under control. Right out of the shower, ten minutes later, it&#x27;s all frizzy and fluffy- but a DROP of this stuff, rubbed between your palms and then rubbed into damp hair, cures that. Soft and silky smooth...A tiny bit goes a LONG ways, so use it very very sparingly. Good thing, too, &#x27;cos it is a little spendy...but well woth it, should last you a year or so.</li>
    <li> This product delivers what it promises to do.  Moisture is locked in so that your flat ironed hair is protected and long lasting. It only takes a few drops to work its magic, but when it is time, I will definitely re-order SBM.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT. I had tried everythung for frizzies and nothing worked. The gal that cuts my hair uses it so I tried it. After I do my hair now, I actually look like I left her salon. Works great. Just need a tiny bit and does not leave build up on hair. Leaves it shiny and heathly looking. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have always had frizzy, dry, coarse hair that was difficult to manage and style because it had the tendency to puff out. I was initially dubious about moisture block (I have tried many products/treatments, including a $240 thermal straightening process) but after I used it, I was amazed to find that it did make a noticeable difference in my hair. After using a little, my hair is soft and sleek without the puffiness that used to bother me. I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Sabino makes a very good product. I thought the bottle was small for the price, but a little goes a LONG way.   Trust.   I love this product for my 4a/b natural hair and use it on every straightening occasion. The shine is out of this world, still allows for body, but can weigh hair down if you use too much. It&#x27;s a must-have.</li>
    <li> First, I will say the product is a must have for anyone who uses heat to curl or straighten their hair. I am the type of person who will spend money on high end products and salon brands because I can trust them. I was skeptical when I heard about this product because it reminded me of a cheap, beauty supply store product that may not work.     To help you understand the depth of this product, I must tell you about my own hair; My hair is below shoulder blade length, very very thick, and very tight curls and zig zag mix. My hair is usually extremely dry and breaks easily without the perfect products. I do not use relaxers or chemical color in my hair.     I had been so frustrated by flat ironing my hair and immediately after, it was getting thicker and thicker because my hair holds so much moisture due to its thirsty state. I would have to straighten my hair and put on a silky scarf just to make my hair lie flat. If I sweat just a little, my hair would look like a bad weave because it would be so thick at the scalp and the ends would still be kind of straight.     With Sabino Moisture Block, my life has changed! I wash my hair and rinse with vinegar to remove residue, then I do a one good conditioner to apply some fresh new protection and rinse. Afterwards, I spray my hair heat protectant hair spray (Nexxus has a great one that smells wonderful). Last, while my hair is still wet, I rub a small amount (about the size of a quarter) throughout my entire head. Then I blowdry my hair in a downward direction, in the same pattern I will flatiron. Then I flat iron and the Sabino causes the flat iron to glide down your hair. NO FRICTION! NONE. When I am done, I have flowing, silky, bone straight hair. I like to finish is a dab of the Sabino; rub it in my hands and then lightly comb my hands through my hair to put a final, superfine layer of Sabino in my hair.     THE TESTS: Ok ladies, you may be convinced that the product can help your hair look good, but what is important to me is whether or not the product is functional. Here we go with my own tests!    1. Shower- I accidentally got into the shower without a cap and when I got out, my hair was still intact! My shower sprayed a little \\&quot;runaway\\&quot; mist onto a little bit of my hair and I dabbed it with my towel. It was nearly perfect! The texture changed ever so slightly, but not enough to cause me restraighten; and it still had body!    2. Getting Hot/clammy- We have all been in the car too long or been stuck in a small space, burning up hot and getting clammy. My hair usually is ruined after this! Not with Sabino. I would move my hair away from my face thinking, \\&quot;Oh no, it is going to be thick because I am letting off so much humidity.\\&quot; Wrong! It was perfect after this happened to me.     3. ADULTS ONLY/Intimacy- I think this is the most important test. Everyone woman who uses heat styling dreads the hair outcome during intimate moments; especially women with tight curly hair because it takes so much time to straighten it and keep it from becoming dry and brittle. My husband hated when I would up a scarf on to protect as much of my hair as I could during intimacy. NO MORE HALL OF SHAME! THIS PRODUCT GOT ME THROUGH THIS! I was able to wear my hear down, sweat, and do whatever else I wanted to do and my hair was not effected!    This product works great and the price is nothing because it works! Do not use too much though! I did this because I spilled a little on the counter and did not want it to go to waste and it gave my hair a wet look all day long and I do not like that. It weighs the hair down and is a waste of product; your hair just ends up super straight and after it is absorbed.     I hope you all enjoy this product as much as I do!</li>
    <li> Moisture Block is one of the best products I have ever used on my hair. I have super curly hair and although MB is expensive it is reliable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, I have four children ages nine and under and just do not have the time. BUT THIS STUFF DESERVES A REVIEW! I had never heard of it (I don&#x27;t think they advertise - ?) but I tried it because of a review I read elsewhere (love word-of-mouth advertising), so I&#x27;m passing on the favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product delivers, IT WORKS! I&#x27;ve always had thick, curly hair and people would comment on how pretty it was (yes, we women do like an occasional compliment) but as most women with children know, pregnancy puts your hair through a roller coaster ride. Throw some grays into it and hair coloring onto it and hair that was already curly and frizzy to begin with becomes a real a mess. And moms just don&#x27;t need bad hair (it left me feeling icky and even a tad depressed). I tried other products when I dared (it gets expensive!) and had a bit of luck with the Frizz-Ease line. I still use the Frizz-Ease Curl Around shampoo and conditioner, they really do bring out the curls, but it&#x27;s this Sabino Moisture Block I can&#x27;t do without. My hair looks shiny and healthy and touchable (no more straw!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit to figure out the amount to use, a little goes a long way and you can put on too much (or in my case sometimes not enough). I just had to play with it to figure out the right amount. Also, on humid days I&#x27;ve learned to add just a touch more. But it&#x27;s a no-brainer now, every day I dab a little in my palms, rub it into damp hair, and I&#x27;m confident my hair can dry into healthy curly locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful not to have to work and work on my hair (no time anyway!) just to get it to look decent (and that wouldn&#x27;t last on humid days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems expensive, but it lasts a long time and really stops all the other insane spending on product after product. I think it&#x27;s a bargain just for the time it saves me alone, and a Godsend for the relief an feel-goodness healthy-looking hair offers. (Come on, I&#x27;m not superficial, nor vain, but when your hair looks good it goes a long way towards supporting *you* feeling good! And we moms are better moms when we feel GOOD!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally love my natural curls again! Thank you Sabino!goes a long way towards supporting *you* feeling good! And we moms are better moms when we feel GOOD!)      I finally love my natural curls again! Thank you Sabino!</li>
    <li> This product is decent to block moisture as is it&#x27;s intent.  I went to muggy South Carolina&#x27;s Myrtle Beach and had little to no frizz from being outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside for me, is how it makes your hair feel stiff, if using it to flat iron.  My hair would hold, absolutely, no curl after using the product.  I could have used too much, so that is why I am still giving it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my mother use it for a press and curl and her hair looked great and held her curls.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a product that actually does what it claims to do, and that is block  out moisture. It leaves my hair feeling really smooth and silky, and no more frizz! I have spent hundreds of dollars on so many hair products over the years; this is the best one ever!</li>
