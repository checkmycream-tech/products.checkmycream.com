<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This piece arrived in great condition and was exactly as described.  It holds well in my hair and doesn&#x27;t feel like a cheap product despite the low cost I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter. She loves it and wears it in her hair all the time.  Super cute and fashionable.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this clip!  It doesn&#x27;t look cheap either!  Great gift for a tween or teen. A+ Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these and liked it so well that I have purchased others.  I am keeping one as a backup or if I ever wanted to clip both sides.  I also bought a couple more of these to give as small gifts.  Excellent product--highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I was skeptical because I&#x27;m not really into a lot of bling looking things. However, I was pleased that I bought this because it&#x27;s muted tones look great with my dark hair (which is darker then the girl in the picture), and I get a lot o compliments when I wear it.  I&#x27;m actually thinking of buying another one so that I have a back up.</li>
    <li> beautiful. I love it. for only $1 , you can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; to this. good quality too. I will buy more for my friends.</li>
    <li> This product broke in shipment. I really love the design, but I really wanted to be able to wear it when it came in :0(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trish</li>
    <li> I love it it looks so pretty. the only thing I didnt like is that the stone fall off real easy i had to reglue them in.</li>
    <li> This clip is wonderful! It is beautiful and adds elegance to a simple bun or braid. I have very thick hair and worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be a substantial clip since it was so inexpensive. It won&#x27;t hold up my hair on it&#x27;s own but it definitely isn&#x27;t cheap as I was expecting. I get nothing but complements for this clip. I am so happy I decided to order it!</li>
    <li> I just received this today, I honestly was amazed at how sparkly and beautiful it is!  I checked it out closely for missing or loose stones and/or flaws, there were none.  I ordered it to see the quality, I plan to order more to use as gifts.  For $1 and free shipping, I more than got my money&#x27;s worth!  This would make a lovely small gift or stocking stuffer.  It did come from the Far East so took longer to arrive, a couple of weeks, but no problem, it actually arrived before expected.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I bought this. I hate having to find new things to do with my hair. This is so cute and so easy to use!</li>
    <li> absolutely love it.  this is the second one I have ordered and I get sooo many compliments on it. would definitely recommend.  you can t beat the price</li>
    <li> Detail in hair piece is good. Doesn&#x27;t look as cheap as it was. It hold back hair well only if you put a minimum back</li>
    <li> These are absolutely beautiful.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with these hair clips.  Bought 2 of them gave one to my neighbor for her birthday and she is 74 yrs old and has long hair and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured and missing gems. I know it as very inexpensive but it was sealed damaged. That means they knew they sent me crappy products and that makes me mad.</li>
    <li> the quality is okay not the best but for the price is good. it does work pretty good though. the part that looked kind of cheap to me was the clip part but its covered when it&#x27;s in your hair anyways.</li>
    <li> Loved this clip, it is made of plastic but its still really nice, and its not as big as you think it is. still goes with everything though so I love it all the same. will buy from and recommend seller to others!</li>
    <li> This is cute and fairly well made...I love how colorful it is and it&#x27;s plastic so it does not feel all that heavy.</li>
    <li> I love this clip! It was so cheap, arrived quickly, and looks super cute! I would definitely encourage others to buy it!</li>
    <li> Very beautiful. It is a bit smaller than the picture but I&#x27;m very pleased with the product considering the price. I got many compliments wearing it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this clip!  It is very pretty and sturdy.  Holds my hair very well.  I get so many compliments invite and it was an amazing value.  So inexpensive and free shipping.  It took a long time to get here.  In fact I forgot I ordered it so it was like a little surprise present coming.  Will definitely be ordering more from this seller.</li>
    <li> It is a very pretty clip that functions well, doesn&#x27;t hurt or get caught in your hair and looks great.</li>
    <li> It holds my curly hair in place pretty well.  It has a good grip and it is ver very pretty.</li>
    <li> The stones are brighter than the picture shows. But its really really pretty and feels heavy. Definitely a good buy for the price</li>
    <li> This is a must have especially for big hair or long hair. It&#x27;s perfect to have in your purse esp in the summer.</li>
    <li> it may look large on the picture.. but once you recieved it.. its small.. and people can barely see it..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad. I was hoping it would look a little more vintage. Still looks cute though even though its shiny</li>
    <li> I really like this barrett. It is pretty, very inexpensive, and is able to hold my hair back without falling out.</li>
    <li> i like this clip, very colorful. i wish it could clip on more hair though. i have received many good comments on it.</li>
    <li> my girls are fighting over this. it is heavier than I expected but it is quite colorful and seems well made.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough about this piece. It was so pretty and has style. Very well made. Beautiful colors to go with anything.</li>
    <li> this was a cheap hair clip and it is just as cute in real life as it is in the photo!</li>
    <li> Very cute to wear on a night out. A fun piece of hair jewelry at an excellent price. Pleasing purchase.</li>
    <li> Love love love this hair clip. Loved it so much this was my second order. Need to order another one for my mother</li>
    <li> Was made very well and prive was great. Came in mail withouy any problems. Would make great gift for anyone.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is really cute. Considering the price, it is a must have! I love how it makes my hairstyles a lot more fun to look at especially if they&#x27;re simple.</li>
    <li> I originally bought just the bangle peacock bracelets, but when I saw the hair clips I had to get a few of those as well.  I love the vintage look to it.  I have a lot of hair, and the clicp was strong enough to hold it back.</li>
    <li> Great deal, Quick shipment, best things ever in the history of the world, EVER, EVER, EVER,  seriously ever in the history of the world!</li>
    <li> Very pretty clip! Went very well with some other peacock jewelry items I purchased for a friend! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how cute this is and how cheap it was! I have worn it a few times, love it!</li>
    <li> she loved it and it was perfect for the 12 year old who is wearing it as I speak. thanks</li>
    <li> This is the second i&#x27;ve bought only because my husband stepped on my first one and broke it. Get a lot of compliments on it. Once i tell the people i bought it for like 80 cents on Amazon with no shipping fee they go crazy lol.</li>
    <li> Very very cute and colorful!! I love it.... only wish it could hold a little more hair..... my hair is super thick though.  Very vintage..</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair pieces. The colors are very nice and vintage looking. It was well secured in my natural curly hair. It didn&#x27;t pull my hair when removing.&lt;br /&gt;It looks large in the photo, but it&#x27;s about medium size.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this item for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Would like different styles in this clip.</li>
    <li> It looks like a really expensive clip! I will definitely buy this again! I use mine all the time and I&#x27;ve had it for a year. It really hold hair well, but doesn&#x27;t get tangled. I keep it in my purse and it hasn&#x27;t broken like my other clips. It&#x27;s really beautiful and well made.</li>
    <li> the product is very good and I recommend it did not take delivery as much as expected they recommend is very good</li>
    <li> I ordered one for myself, and I was surprised at how beautiful it looks. The colors are great and it seems to be very durable. It holds my hair just perfectly.</li>
    <li> In this hot, muggy weather I like to have my long hair off my neck.  With this clip, I can just twist my hair up and it stays put.  Actually better clip than I expected for the money.</li>
    <li> The pin itself was amazingly beautiful but when I went to go put the pin in my hair the clip broke! I was not applying an insane amount if pressure it just broke off!!</li>
    <li> This hair clip is a statement piece. If you love peacocks and have long hair, this clip is for you !</li>
    <li> This hair pin is absolutely beautiful. This was a gift and the person loved it!! Thank you so very much.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair so I was surprised to find out these were able to hold my hair up.  Plus my hair is black so the bright colors on these look great in my hair.  Took a while to get, like a month maybe longer, but for the price it was great.</li>
    <li> I get compliments everytime I wear this clip, it is elegant yet not juvenile. A nice wear for the mature woman.</li>
    <li> Its a very cute piece. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap. Its made of metal not plastic. The clip holds some hair but not a lot (my hair is long and thick and all of my bangs wouldn&#x27;t stay) . I used a Bobby pin under it then the clip for prettying.</li>
    <li> Arrived on June 26, well ahead of delivery dates.  I really want to have this seller make more clips like this.  The teeth underneath the clip hold my hair in place no matter how I use it.  This is the best clip for my THICK hair I have ever found.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty peacock clip, shiny, small enough to fit in anyone&#x27;s hair! Very well made, heavier material used than most clips, for what I paid I was expecting something cheaply made, nope this was made very well!!! I will be a return buyer to this company.</li>
    <li> pretty and have gotten soooo many compliments on it :)&lt;br /&gt;no problems with it as of yet but i dont wear it all the time and dont put so much air thru it. .</li>
    <li> This is a cute peacock hair clip. The only this is that it is really brightly colored than in the picture. I was hoping for it to be a little duller colored but still works.</li>
    <li> I love the hair clip it is beautiful wore it in my hair and got so many compliments. they thought I bought it at a high end store .</li>
    <li> It is very good and I like it, but it looks different than what I saw in internet and make me kind of disappoint when I received it.</li>
    <li> WE ENJOY SHARING OUR HAIR ACCESORIES AND WE JUST ENOY THIS PIECE. IT&#x27;S LIKE A ONE OF A KIND AND WE LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I did not think the picture of this hair clip would be the same as the real item but it is prettier than the picture. I have received many complements and I have only had it for a week. Its a very good value for the money. I am very well pleased.</li>
    <li> This is really cute and well made despite the cheap price. Buy several and give them out as cheap gifts.</li>
    <li> This  peacock hair piece is durable and what a great price! It was shipped from Hong Kong but arrived before it said it would :-)&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase! I&#x27;m wearing it now!</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, and it&#x27;s location of where it was shipping from I wasn&#x27;t sure what exactly to expect. I had actually forgotten I&#x27;d made the purchase and was surprised upon it&#x27;s arrival yesterday afternoon. I was pleased to find the stones are a beautiful color and the clip is metal without too much weight. The teeth held wonderfully while I was at work for eight hours, and there was no slipping. I can&#x27;t wait to find new hairstyles to add this to as a cute accent for any outfit.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical in ordering this; so I ordered 2 of them. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong; others complained about the &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; coming off. Mine arrived nicely packaged &amp; intact. I did buy 2 to have a backup- but they are oh so pretty. Dying to wear them soon!</li>
    <li> I think i have purchased about 10 of these hairclips so far!  When someone compliments me on it...I give it to them!  I have also bought one fot all the girls at work.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this! Its so pretty! It has great fall colors incorporated into it and I love it! I get so many compliments anytime I wear it. Plus it was only like a dollar so it was worth the wait. I recommend you buy this. It wont disappoint. :)</li>
    <li> looks great In my hair and it stays also holds my thick hair. I wish I would have ordered one more.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t look like item pictured. Was white comb. Heavy at top. Don&#x27;t buy. This product is not worth the money</li>
    <li> I love it, product was extremely cheap, didn&#x27;t have any rush at getting it so the almost 2 weeks that took to receive it were well worth it. Its pretty strong to hold plenty of hair.</li>
    <li> Wow, what I really love about this hair clip, is that the colors are so dramatic. You can wear it with a multiple amount of different colors. Yet, it is lightweight. Another wonderful product, for a fantastic price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Although this clip is still usable for my 10 year old daughter, its not something that an adult could wear. Its too bright, as in &amp;#34;i bought it at the dollar store bright&amp;#34;. The metal and clip looks great just the stones are too inexpensive looking.</li>
    <li> Simply fabulous, even my grand daughter wore this..totally awesome piece, looks fantastic in my hair, many compliments on how beautiful this piece is.</li>
    <li> I really think its beautiful ...but the only problem is it doesn&#x27;t hold up alot of hair at all . In great condition when i received it and mail  :) happy whith my purchas.</li>
    <li> I wear this piece all the time. I love it. I wish I had two of them. It came on time.</li>
    <li> very nice item for the price.  significant size and good design. well worth the price.  great item to buy in bulk for a wedding party, dance team, or ?</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these and have one to a friend as a gift. She loved it! Very cute, true to the photo. And has a very strong clip!</li>
    <li> 3 stars as the Owl&#x27;s are the wrong color. The peacock clip was as described and is gorgeous. While the Owl&#x27;s are the wrong color they are still beautiful and decent quality I find it best to knot my hair and then use the peacock clip to clip the tendril coming out of the knot.</li>
    <li> I think they left a bit of metal somewhere or glue I don&#x27;t know but it pulls my hair if I try to pull out the clip to I have to sort of loop it out of my hair to avoid a snag. Or maybe it&#x27;s because my hair is nappy/curly but that shouldn&#x27;t honestly matter</li>
    <li> I just love the peacock clip.it looks awsome ,just like shown in the figure..the price is worth the quality of the clip..</li>
    <li> First of all, the colors of the stones aren&#x27;t exactly like the ones in the picture, they&#x27;re a tad bolder! But this clip is very pretty! It goes with almost any vintage style outfit. And the price is AWESOME! 5 stars! :)</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t beat this price. It looks just like the picture. Doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of hair so definitely only use it as a decorative piece.</li>
    <li> This clip couldn&#x27;t have been more perfect. It&#x27;s in perfect condition and came pretty quickly! I absolutely love this gorgeous clip!</li>
    <li> This is quite stunning for the price, much prettier than I imagined. I wish it held a little tighter, but I still love it. Great accent piece for a bun or messy knot.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t quite what i was expecting i thought the clip was going to be different then what it is. Not sure how much i&#x27;ll actually end up wearing it but it&#x27;s cute.</li>
    <li> This was a dollar. A single dollar. Cheap and beautiful, so I bought three. I figured if I never got it from Asia, then I&#x27;m only out three bucks, but when they arrived (very quickly I might add and from Hong Kong) I was astounded. They really are as beautiful as the picture shows. I took some photos for additional detail. This is a great deal. Buy one for yourself and a lot of extras as gifts!</li>
    <li> Great addition to any hair style. Very cute to add to a simple bun! With all the colors the clip goes with anything!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and strong.  I have very fine hair, and not many things hold it! Pleasantly surprised. This works great and the style is cute.  Great value for the cost!  I think I will order several for gifts!  Thanks</li>
    <li> It is very beautiful.  I love it&#x27;s many colors enabling me to wear it with just about anything in my wardrobe.</li>
    <li> Great clips to accent your hairstyle. I ordered 2 of them (hoping for the best). Got them yesterday - I love that each one is slightly different on colored \\&quot;gem\\&quot; placement. I doubt you could use them to pull the hair out of your face like a barrette -- but then again I have rather thick hair... :-) The spring in the clip seems strong and overall seems solid.  I do expect that over time I will discover \\&quot;hey I&#x27;m missing a gem!\\&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it happened within a month, because it is always a possibility with glued gems. Over all happy with product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice functional piece. Took a while to arrive but it did arrive eventually and was well packed. The size is good and would recommend, for the very, very low price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This hair clip is so much prettier in person. It is my new favorite accessory. I would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> i got 2 of these one for me and one for my daughter that loves peacocks we will enjoy them</li>
    <li> This is gorgeous!! My first one I got ended up being broken when I got it. The back clip had snapped in two. I contacted the seller and they shipped me a new one right out the next day. I got it very quickly!! I was happy with the way that as handles and I am glad to have a new clip that I can use!</li>
    <li> Short version, it&#x27;s perfect, the beautiful colors, stays in hair, always get compliments. ordering more today for family and friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price. So inexpensive but the product is fabulous. I get so many compliments on it. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this for the price!!! Shipping was faster than expected. It has little teeth to hold it in your hair. It looks super cute with a bun. Love it!</li>
    <li> I think this clip is very nice. Love the fact that it has a peacock . The colors are awesome and really you can wear it with anything! Love it.</li>
    <li> These clips are much more vibrant and gorgeous than their product picture makes them seem.&lt;br /&gt;A definite steal! It has free shipping, you do have to wait some time, but it&#x27;s so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M in love with mine!</li>
    <li> Love it!. very colorful and sturdy. Doesn&#x27;t look like the type to break easily. will look into more product from seller.</li>
    <li> Well made, strong grip on the hair.  Stones are secure in their settings.  Worth more than the price we paid. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Love this hair clip such a good deal for such a cute well made item! I thought it was gonna be cheap but its so cute, love peacocks!</li>
    <li> This hair clip is simply lovely! The &#x27;jewels&#x27; sparkle and with the multiple colors, it will compliment any outfit. Loved it so much I ordered 2 more as gifts for a friend and her daughter!</li>
    <li> I know this was only 1 dollar but I was hoping it would arrive in one piece. It really is lovely and was looking forward to wearing.</li>
    <li> for the price you cannot beat this, but I was surprised that I had to pick it up at the post office since it was so small but the size 13 mens flip flop fit in my mail box?</li>
    <li> I purchased this since I wear my hair up every day in the summer.  I have received lots of compliments on it.  Very happy with my purchase and it came in the mail faster than I had expected!</li>
    <li> This product is very pretty and made a wonderful gift. It was super cheap, but good quality.  It is a nice size, and the clip is strong and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this clip. It has a nice strong hold without digging in hair. My hair is not real thick and is somewhat soft and the clip does not slid out. It is great, very colorful and not gaudy. Great for fall too.</li>
    <li> Not only did it show up prettier than the picture, it&#x27;s much better quality than I expected for a couple of bucks!  Heavy duty metal, the gems are bright and set securely and the clip holds my thick hair without slipping.  If the second one is as consistent of quality as the one I have now,  I&#x27;ll be ordering more for friends!</li>
    <li> Is is very lovely hair clip, shipping took forever though. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it if you intend it for anything time sensitive. But for a few dollars it is very pretty.</li>
    <li> it is cute, though it feels and looks cheap, the shape does not at all flow with my hair, its not curved enough to ear like the photo.  I had wised it looked more like the photo makes it out to be.</li>
    <li> I really love this clip. So sweet and a nice touch to an everyday updo, I am happy I bought it .</li>
    <li> Totally beautiful, but it doesn&#x27;t hold all of my hair. Not surprised though, I&#x27;ve got pretty thick hair, so I want expecting it to hold it all, but nonetheless not the strongest clip.</li>
    <li> Wow it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m very happy with this new hair clip the cost was so cheap for such a beautiful piece I highly recommend it can&#x27;t loose</li>
    <li> Love it but a couple of the stones feel off in shipping. It was an easy fix, super glue. Other than that the product was as described. For the cost a overall great product.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely clip.  It as perfect for an accent piece. It did take a while to arrive though.</li>
    <li> Although this piece is beautiful when I received it in the mail the plastic stones kept falling out and I after numerous attempts to glue them back in I was not able to ever wear it.</li>
    <li> I love this, the gems have fallen out a few times but i&#x27;ve hot glued them back in so not biggie. I wear it often!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really pretty and the colors match with what ever you wear.It was delivered sooner than I thought it would be.You can where this for day or night.I am very happy with this purchase and the price .</li>
    <li> Large, lovely, very colorful and full of life. Very well made, don&#x27;t worry about buying this one, its a no brainier,get it!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair clip for my sister who loves peacocks.  The clip is pretty and very colorful and she loves it.</li>
    <li> The design of the peacock is a beautiful shape and the multi-colors in these stones make an effect that complements my hair or&lt;br /&gt;others who wear the clip to keep long hair out of the face.</li>
    <li> got this for orphan we support.it was very very inexpensive but looks pretty and so colorful.  I am sure Jennifer loved it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sis because she loves to put stuff like this in her hair.  She thought that it was really cute and for the price you cant beat it (:</li>
    <li> The item is not as attractive as it looks in this picture. For the price, consider it to be good value.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s the same hair clip but the crystal no&lt;br /&gt;The color it&#x27;s diffrent and the clip looks cheap&lt;br /&gt;Really I don&#x27;t love it</li>
    <li> I really like it and the price is reasonable too. Only thing is that you have to wait for a while to get it. I have heavy hair and I was surprised to see how it holds my hair. Like the colors, very pretty!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and it was a good price for fun costume jewelry. She purchased a matching bracelet too.</li>
    <li> These  hair pins are beautiful, much better than what I expected. As mentioned through other reviews the colors are brighter than the photos shows, but they are very nice. Can not beat the price.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this its so unique and very cute it looks just like the picture! I get many compliments on it</li>
    <li> It looks absolutely nothing at all like the picture!  What I got is a cheap thing with random cheap stones and it doesn&#x27;t remotely look like a peacock!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent purchase&lt;br /&gt;Way better built and nicer then the clips you buy retial&lt;br /&gt;beautiful hair clip very sturdy</li>
    <li> Love the clip is beautiful! Very pleased with that , thank you , it will look nice as an hair ornament</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this hair clip was to check the quality of something I could buy for $2. It is really nice, it took a while to get here but shipping was free. It can be used as a hair clip or clip it on a hat or a sweater and it becomes a broach! I think I&#x27;ll get the matching earrings!</li>
    <li> I have gotten many compliments on this clip, and for the price, it cannot be beat!  It is perfect for accenting and up-do or to hold back my bangs.</li>
    <li> If you buy this, I would definitely recommend replacing the clip with a hot glue gun first thing--the clip broke when I went to open it to try it in my hair. I was a little frustrated at that, but after replacing the clip, I was satisfied--none of the rhinestones have fallen off and I wear it often. A good buy for a cute ornament, if you negate the clip.</li>
    <li> This clip is more decorative than functional. It is really pretty and quite heavy but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold much hair. If you don&#x27;t mind the weight of a metal clip then you should be fine but I have thick hair and it felt heavy to me.</li>
    <li> some beads fell out and I didn&#x27;t even use it yet. Otherwise it is so pretty that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
    <li> got this along with matching bracelet for my daughter. she loves vintage and she loves peacocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it seems to be decently made and has some heft to it, so it doesnt scream &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  my only complaint is the finish.  cant tell if it is messed up or just distressesd to look old and worn.  the stones are clear and colorful though.  much more flashy than the pictures show.  cant help but notice it, even from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the clip is tight and it stays in her hair well.  she said the clip has not loosened at all and she wears it all the time.  with all the colors, it certainly goes with everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am not thrilled with the finish, but she loves it and that is all that really matters.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and how snug the clip actually holds. I gave a few away as BIRTHDAY gifts. :)</li>
    <li> For the money, this clip is actually relatively well-made and looks nice. My main issue is that the clip is VERY large. Unless you have a bun (as pictured), you can&#x27;t wear this without the clip being very visible and causing the peacock to sit unevenly on your head.</li>
    <li> good thing this wasn&#x27;t a christmas gift.  I am still wiating for my order. This is not an expensive item but would love for it to come in.  I ordered a matching bracelet that I have already received.  The bracelet is cheap in quailty but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price.  Very pretty and good for a teen that changes their style every week</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my preteen and for the price it is very sturdy and the colors are beautiful and bright! Delivery was pretty quick as well. Amazon estimated after Christmas and it only took about 2 weeks to come in so I got it a week and a half before Christmas. Definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this since it arrived.  Get lots of compliments.  Holds my hair in place.  Pretty too!  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely hair piece for the price.  The clip seems sturdy and perfect as a slide in (not to hold the hair in place).  I think the size is well represented in the picture so it was just as a I expected.</li>
    <li> I am simply amazed at how well this hair clip holds up...and for the price it is! I will DEFINITELY be buying more of these in the future :D</li>
    <li> I love this little clip!  It adds such a cute look to your hair when it&#x27;s thrown up in a bun just like the picture shows.  It&#x27;s not too flashy or too plan.</li>
    <li> I wear it all the time. It holds my fine hair firm and in place. It is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> THIS ARRIVED AS A NECKLACE AND WAS BROKEN. I FIXED IT, BUT INTENDED TO GIVE IT TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER FOR HER HAIR. IT&#x27;S NOT A PRETTY NECKLACE, LOOKS TARNISHED AND CHEAP. I WILL TRY TO GIVE IT AWAY.</li>
    <li> What a great deal! But I have thick hair and this is not for me:( It seems very retro design to me and I was not a big fan. But again, such a bargain!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even get this sent to me...be careful. tracking number that was provided doesn&#x27;t even work. it may have been a dollar but still would like it since I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Great hair clip for the price.  I wore it once before I cut my hair all off and it made my hair look great</li>
    <li> it could look better it looks exactly what you pay for!!!!!!!!!!!!i believe and expected the hair clip to be more equisite,</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this clip. For it being so low priced, it&#x27;s actually well made. Seems sturdy and strong enough to stay is my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip. It&#x27;s built well, the colors are beauitful, and it goes with everything. It shipped fast too. Got it a week ahead of schedule!</li>
    <li> I like this piece because it has great colors and is noticeable and light on the head.  It also keeps my fine hair in place.</li>
    <li> I wore this to work the other day at school and all the little girls in class loved it. It is not too large and not too small. It&#x27;s added the perfect amount of girly flair to my outfits without me looking too young.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the size of the clip. The one pictured is about three times larger than the one i got. It is just okay.</li>
    <li> Cute, surprisingly well made for the price, but it took forever to arrive, and it was supposed to be a gift. If you&#x27;re not on a deadline, it&#x27;s well worth the price! A real steal.</li>
    <li> ORDER THIS PRODUCT. PAYED FOR TWO OF THEM. NEVER GOT FIRST ORDER. MESSAGED THEM ABOUT NOT GETTING WHAT I ORDERED AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD SEND ME ANOTHER ONE. AND I MESSAGED BACK THAT THEY DID MEAN TO SEND TWO OF THEM NOT ONE. AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY DID . THEY ONLY SEND ME ONE, WHEN I PAYED FOR TWO AND WAITED ALL THIS TIME TOO. DISAPPOINTED GREATLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  KINGMILLEN</li>
    <li> I was surprised with the quality of this piece for the price! Its a heavy, brass (or at least looks like it) metal, and the gems are plastic but shine nicely for being so! I would expect to pay about $5-8 in the stores for this kind of thing, so its really worth the price here! The only downside is the shipping time, but if you dont need it immediately its really not a big deal as the free shipping makes up for it. Would definetely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> The vlip is colorful, but it is heavy. As heavy as it is had defeated my purpose of giving it to who i had planned. It would probably work better if . It had a different clip I&#x27;m not sure ehat I will do with it now. I&#x27;ll have to think on it some more.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim and I am so happy i did. The clip looks beautiful in my hair. Great quality. Holds hair tight. I get compliments every time i wear it. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought, not as noticeable of a peacock as thought, but very pretty. Will still work for the gift</li>
    <li> I like how it is however, i wish it was little colorful. It looks little colorful in the picture, but in real life, it is kind of faded color.</li>
    <li> I ordered a couple of these clips in the past for myself and daughters. I like how colorful and unique they are.  I was initally worried that the clip would slip out easily, but they hold hair really well!!! I like them so much that I ordered a bunch more to give as gifts!</li>
    <li> I would have changed the direction.  I have to clip this in from behind &amp; not from the front to get the bird&#x27;s head to be right.  Not the best angle to do my hair &amp; it often snaggs if I dont put it in backwards just right.</li>
    <li> It arrived exactly as pictured. The teeth aren&#x27;t as long as I&#x27;d hoped but for the price I&#x27;m not complaining. It is a very pretty hair clip.</li>
    <li> This is a very very cute product. I have very thick hair so it holds and stays! The only reason this product got 4 stars is because the little gems are kinda loose so I had to reglue one of them. But all and all this is a great product and its relatively large</li>
    <li> I gotthis as secret pal gift with the matching bracelet.  It arrived quickly in good packaging. It is really pretty and a great deal for the cost.</li>
    <li> VERY CUTE THIS ACCESSORY FOR HAIR .... LIKE ME FOR MY hair look SPECTACULAR IN ANY MODERN AND SOCIAL EVENT ..</li>
    <li> I like this product because of it durability and it comfort. It look really nice in my hair, you should try it too.</li>
    <li> I received my item and it looks way bigger in the picture then he actually is but I am very pleased I was hoping none  of the stones will fall of during the shipping time and it didn&#x27;t so I&#x27;m very happy about that. I recommend this item and the price is just great</li>
    <li> i would have to upload a picture it breaks the minute i was trying to get it out from the plastic bag it came in, it really looks nice but i didn t even get to use it,,,smh</li>
    <li> I used this item as a giveaway on my website.&lt;br /&gt;It was a huge hit. The winner is very please with the item.&lt;br /&gt;I like the price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Received my Peacock Hairclip 2 weeks sooner than expected and didn&#x27;t expect much as far as quality for the &lt;$1.00 price.  It is beautiful!  The metal clip isn&#x27;t \\&quot;cheap shiny\\&quot; like in one of the pics.  It has a nice antiqued look to it.  The rhinestones are just that.  Bright rhinestones, but boy does it give a great pop of color to my up do!  As reviews said, it doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of hair, but it is just a clip for decoration.  Better probably for up-dos than anything where you can just clip it on.  VERY happy with this purchase!  This is so much better than some plastic thing I could get at Walmart for twenty times the price! Thank you ELI FASHION!</li>
    <li> Very pretty hair clip.  Looks just as shown in the picture.  I bought it for my daughter, but may keep it for me.  ;)</li>
    <li> Great add on to hair or bag. Vibrant colors and very secure clip, even in my thin hair. Great buy!</li>
    <li> i love them. i love that classic look it gives my up dos and buns. its a timeless look it gives</li>
    <li> Actually very cute with the right outfit. Lots of multicolored glass insets and the peacock is very cute.Good price. .</li>
    <li> So cute! I put it in my hair, my sister&#x27;s hair, whatever. It holds up to all kinds of abuse (dropped, even stepped on) and for the price, I may just buy a few more.</li>
    <li> This clip is really pretty and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with any of the gems.  Great price and faster delievery than estimated!  Fun to wear and has all the popular colors for this spring and summer!  Ordered the bracelet too!</li>
    <li> i was surprised when i have received it,too small and even did not come close to what i have expected&lt;br /&gt;it looks bigger in the picture</li>
    <li> Delivery was pretty quick and arrived sooner. It looks exactly like in the picture and I absolutely love it. I get compliments on it all the time. You should buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was slow but product came as advertised. Was a great purchase for my niece that&#x27;s 15 years old! She loved it!</li>
    <li> It looks stunning and is actually very well made. Mine came even earlier than expected and totally intact. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> this item was available for cheap - and it was worth getting since my wife loves to use things like this to hold her hair up. great product.</li>
    <li> I like this hair clip, it is unique and beautiful. The price I paid for it through Amazon, I can not complain.</li>
    <li> Love it! Cute for quick buns when you have no time in the morning to do your hair. Great accessory to have! Delivery time was good as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love peacocks and couldn&#x27;t resist but it is difficult to tell it is a peacock unless you really stare at it up close, so don&#x27;t buy it if that doesn&#x27;t work for you.  It just looks like a bunch of colorful stones but not the colors of a real peacock&#x27;s feathers.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair clip!  Best 90 cents I ever spent. I orders this when I still had long hair and had to end up cutting my hair short wail I waited for it to come. I was so happy when it got here to find out it still would clip into my hair! Did take 3 weeks to arrive but that&#x27;s what you get for only paying 90 cents.best value ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Super cute and pretty hair clip.  Looks exactly as pictured. Holds in hair really well (I have thick hair).  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price :)</li>
    <li> The product has colors as shown on the picture, and it was about the size i believed it would be. Was excited to put it in my hair for the first time in a bun like the picture showed but it broke when I tried to open it overall i think the opening mechanism is too flimsy to comfortably move around and use multiple times. Its just ok for the purchase price assuming it does not break. (ALSO i made no attempt to contact the seller since it would take time and it only cost a few cents).</li>
    <li> Well done to the maker of this beautiful clip I love the texture,  the look the quality and the price of this product and I am glad I ordered this for my hair it is a nice compliment to adorn yourself with buy it u will not regret it!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely piece, especially considering the price. I have short hair, so I haven&#x27;t exactly figured out how to wear it yet, but I love it. It looks just like the picture. It matches almost everything I own. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> the clip is strong. and is very beautiful. the only problem with this product is the stones came off and i had to glue it back on.</li>
    <li> This was a beautiful piece! I got it for someone as a gift but instead gave it to my daughter to wear to school an church. It didn&#x27;t take long to receive it an the price was awesome!</li>
    <li> I feel all dressed up when I wear this hair clip. It&#x27;s just the right size and weight, too. It&#x27;s the perfect touch of elegance for a simple black dress with some strappy sandals. The stones are nice and vibrant, and it arrived quickly. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected and there was a jewel missing in when it arrived, I looked in the packaging to see if the jewel was there to fix it but it was not.</li>
    <li> I really really like the hair clip. Its sooo pretty. The stones in it just sparkle and shine!!&lt;br /&gt;It stays in your hair,right where you put it too.</li>
    <li> Great price for a little big of bling!  Lovely colors. Has held together well.  I usually wear it clipped to the side of a &amp;#34;messy bun&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful just beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;The clip is large and heavy. I wish you good luck in trying to keep it in your hair.</li>
    <li> Clip is very attractive and seems to be made well enough. I bought this for a friend and think she&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
    <li> Nice hair clip. I got a compliment on it the first time I wore it out. I don&#x27;t use hair clips often, so it was nice to get a fun one like this for such a great price, so I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted money on something I rarely use.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Very sturdy.. I am so happy to wear it, and everyone gives me compliments.. I will be ordering more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Durable and very pretty. I have THICK heavy hair and it can hold it with ease. Worth purchasing. Very pretty.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Not quite what I expected...thought it was a barrett. Corors of stones bright. Would consider buying here again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little embarrassing how expensive this clip looks but isn&#x27;t! It looks very sophisticated and dresses up any hairstyle. I&#x27;m so pleased!</li>
    <li> I wore this to an outdoor wedding and got a few very nice compliments on it. I love it and can&#x27;t wait to wear it again.</li>
    <li> I did not expect too much for the price, but was pleasantly surprised.  Very pretty and seems to be very well made</li>
    <li> This came from China. I had forgotten I had ordered it when it finally came.  Upon taking it from the package, some of the sets fell off.  But what the heck, you get what you pay for and I didn&#x27;t pay that much for it.</li>
    <li> pretty cute for the price. i havent used it yet, but am glad I ordered it. looks nice and very statement-y</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of these Hair Clips. They are for a granddaughter who works at a beauty salon and she uses them as thank you gifts for customers. The colors vary on each clip, not a bad thing, and the stones are resin not glass, again not a bad thing. An excellent value for a bright, pretty piece.</li>
    <li> this is light weight and very pretty. it grips well and stays put. glad that i bought one for me.</li>
    <li> its a bit cheap looking. Thats what I get for being cheap, I guess.  Colored in the &#x27;jewels&#x27; with a sharpie...looks 100 times better.  I might actually wear it now.</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine curly hair and it holds EXTREMELY well, I love it. I can wear it with basically any colored shirt but mostly red since most of the stones are that color.</li>
    <li> the slip is absolutely beautiful all the stones are placed evenly  and it looks gorgeous im my hair love it</li>
    <li> I purchased the clip for a friend because they looked good for dressing up and she has two weddings coming up soon.  However, I never got a chance to see them up close.  My mom liked them so well she kept them herself.  Next time I&#x27;ll make sure the shipment is to my house.</li>
    <li> Looks like its picture. You do pay for what you get. The gems have not fallen out which is a plus. The price is great and I think this is a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The clip came in three weeks, pretty with all stones intact. for the price- a nice buy for the money</li>
    <li> I love this but the gem piece were missing when I recieved the item :(  I did not want to go through the hassel of returing it just for 1 missing gem.</li>
    <li> This is a really great quality item. I wear it all the time now. It has a great steampunk feel to it, but good for other styles as well.</li>
    <li> Very cute hair piece. The colors of the actual piece are a bit different than shown but it is still very nice. Quick delivery. I would use this seller again.</li>
    <li> beautiful hairclip. the colors allow one to wear it with many outfits. love it! would suggest it to anyone and it is not heavy the hair.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, depth is smaller than I expected so don&#x27;t buy it to hold medium to thick hair. It would be well suited for thinner, finer hair. More substantial feeling than you&#x27;d expect for the price. It&#x27;s shipped from quite a distance, so be prepared to wait a couple weeks for it to arrive. Overall a good purchase and I&#x27;d buy from this store again.</li>
    <li> The jewels were missing from the side of the hair clip when I got it from the mail man... Terrible</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair clip.  Now I want to go back and buy the matching earring set.  Hair clip is much more stronger than I imaged.&lt;br /&gt; I was very please with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and stays in place wonderfully! I love to play with my hair! I enjoy putting it up this way and that. For fun occasions, I enjoy have a clip or comb to stick in my hair.  This is a beautiful clip!</li>
    <li> This item looks just like the picture. It clips onto the hair and doesn&#x27;t come loose and fall out and it looks very pretty. A great accessory for when you are dressing up.</li>
    <li> I never got it something else came that I didn&#x27;t order I don&#x27;t know what happen with the order I placed</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair piece. Great quality for the price.  I receive many compliments on it and no one knows it cost less than a dollar!</li>
    <li> it to my liking that is all I can really say about it. unlike other review who claim it broke its still unbroken and it feels sturdy enough</li>
    <li> This is not what I received at all.  I received 2 very small bobby pins with a couple of cheap looking beads on them.  I had ordered 2 peacock barrettes.  Have sent email to seller hopefully they will fix this.</li>
    <li> Niceer than the picture.. Very lovely hairclip not heavy and its very elegant.. I would recommend buying it ;D .</li>
    <li> My only concern is if the pin holding the top and bottom together will stay in place as this is my second, but the first was from a different vendor.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. Its jut as vibrant and looked exactly as the image. I get lots of compliments and questions about it. My only gripe is that its a bit smaller than id imagined it to be.</li>
    <li> I am amazed how beautiful this clip is! It is prettier in person. I use it as a hair clip, a clip to hold my scarf closed, and an adornment on my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took a while, but to get this beauty for  a dollar, well worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip!  Very well made for the cheap price. I wear it often and get lots of compliments.  My 6 year old likes wearing it to school also. All the stones are still intact and haven&#x27;t had any issues at all. If anything happens to mine I will definitely be buying another,  maybe 2!</li>
    <li> High quality product. Clips well in my hair and I have thick hair. Reasonable price. I would do business with them again and again. Very satisfied..</li>
    <li> Got what I expected. The eye jewel is a little cheesy but easily fixable. I wear this often now. Love.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful clip! I can&#x27;t believe the quality for the price. Will look good with any outfit. Fast shipping considering it came from Hong Kong. Will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
    <li> peacock hair clip very colorful and matches the peacock braclet i purchased. my daughter loves it. it matches everthing, will purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much for the price, but this is beautiful! and strong!&lt;br /&gt;Im planning on ordering more for christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> I though this was going to be cheap looking because of the price but is actually very nice and shiny, now I got to get me another one.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty hair clip and the price wasn&#x27;t bad either. I will buy more of these for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> This was the thing i was most excited about! Its perfect for thr price. i love it so much! it looks exzactly like the picture and arrived in perfect shape!! I love this!</li>
    <li> Wearing it right now! It&#x27;s cute to wear along with the peacock necklace also and it&#x27;s at a great price.</li>
    <li> package tracking stated that it has been delivered, but wasnt in delivery. want a refund or my order. long wait for not all that i ordered.</li>
    <li> I wanted some stones filled clip and this clip served the purpose, ,, its as shown in the picture,,, the color seems to have faded from the day I recieved it,,,</li>
    <li> That just about covers it they are pretty but way to heavy.&lt;br /&gt;They may work on some ladies but not for me and I do have&lt;br /&gt;thick hair.SORRY!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered 10 and only got two. Not at all what I expected! Cheap and clasp not secure! So lame.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip. I got more then one of them its great for my very think sometimes curly hair. Hold it very nicely and looks great all the different colors really look great in my hair it also matches a lot of things due to all the colors in it. I have had a few complements on the clip.</li>
    <li> I like it is a beautiful garment I use when I make my bum it looks very nice and sassy</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write negative reviews but this thing is downright hideous!  I only bought it because it had free shipping and thought:  Why not?  The clasp is flimsy and the colors are nothing like the muted jewel tones as posted in the picture.  This hair clip is so gaudy I wouldn&#x27;t even give it to a 4 year old to play &#x27;dress up&#x27; with.</li>
    <li> I am shocked at how pretty this clip is!!! Lots of colors and has a nice antique look without it looking tarnished. I have very thick hair so I don think I could use this clip alone in my hair but it&#x27;s tight enough I&#x27;m not worried about it falling out. The colors are teal, red, pink, orange and a yellow green. But the yellow green is a soft color so I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it clashing. And shipping was super fast!! Almost a month sooner than I expected. I&#x27;m now looking for matching earrings</li>
    <li> Considering how inexpensive this was, it&#x27;s a really nice, durable hair clip. All the jewels were intact and it&#x27;s made so it won&#x27;t slip out of my hair once I&#x27;ve clipped it on.</li>
    <li> its small but cute color is good. took sometime for delivery but its a good price it will go with lots of different outfits since its not just one color</li>
    <li> The are very nice look great in hair and had lots of people wanting to know where to get them , saw some simular for a lot more</li>
    <li> Really liked this Hair Clip, very fashionable and got lots of complements from it. it wont hold that much hair on it but its just okay to show it off. will recommend it</li>
    <li> I was VERY surprised when I opened this - the peacock is made of heavy metal, the gems are bright and well-attached, and altogether it is a beautiful clip that holds securely. I&#x27;ve ordered several more in other colors. It works best like in the picture, as an accent to an updo or a bun. It might work for a half-up style also, but I&#x27;d wear a ponytail holder/barrette to actually hold the hair and place this over top or just above it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip! I get compliments on it every time I wear it. It is really pretty and is durable. It came way before the estimated shipping date.</li>
    <li> This looks not so great in the picture but I had 1 dollar on my gift card figured ill give it as a gift. Well, I kept it, it is sooo pretty!!!</li>
    <li> this item is a great price and very cute lots of compliments i ended up ordering more more little gifts</li>
    <li> I expected my clippy to be more colorful - its actually a bunch of different colors of red. Oh well. Its still cute and usable.</li>
    <li> This is a very cute little hairpiece, and it does its job, even though its so cheap! I would recommend!</li>
    <li> nice and pretty but kind of small size. I will try to find a way to use it concedering I have very long and thick hair.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for the best and was not at all disappointed! This is the nicest hair clip! Very well constructed, exactly as pictured, stays in place all day, and matches everything I own. It also arrived much faster than the delivery estimate. I&#x27;m so pleased with my purchase that I&#x27;m thinking of ordering more to give as gifts. Would definitely recommend this for any age, not too big, not too small.</li>
    <li> I was very happywith the hair clip.  Arrived very quickly.  I can hardly wait to give it to my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> So this is an &#x27;ok&#x27; hair clip... Only paid about a penny for it so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love the look of this clip, but not amused with the fact 2 stones fell out of it before I even got to wear it.</li>
    <li> I love it...For the price it is very pretty and very well made.  It may be a bit too heavy for very fine hair...but I have no problem whatsoever with this staying in all day.</li>
    <li> This was a much nicer piece than I was expecting it to be. So glad that I found and bought it.</li>
    <li> i have not this product it has benn over a month and still did not get it bad bussiness. i will not buy any more stuff from amazon again. nothing but a rip off</li>
    <li> plz dont waste your money on this junk.It arrived broken and is such a cheap quality .you get what you pay for!!!.i wish i could give it zero star rating.</li>
    <li> beautiful I think it is stupid for you to require so many words that is why I don&#x27;t like to do this</li>
    <li> This clip exceeded my expectations. It was so cheap, I figured it&#x27;d break right away or the gems would fall off, but I&#x27;ve had it for months and it&#x27;s completely intact! It&#x27;s wonderful, and very cute!</li>
    <li> WE WILL ORDER THIS AGAIN FOR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. IT IS VERY VERY CUTE AND WELL WORTH THE PRICE. GREAT VALUE, THANK YOU</li>
    <li> For the price of this item it is amazing!! I was surprised by the tight hold it actually has. I thought it was going to be cheap, but it wasnt, it holds in your hair very well and is tight, it is also very pretty!!</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it. I ordered these hair clips as a gift for a small gathering I had and they were a HIT... Highly recommendent them.&lt;br /&gt;The color stones are really pretty.</li>
    <li> I would say that the quality is sooper good. But for the price the product is so cute and holds well. It definitely doesn&#x27;t look cheap...</li>
    <li> Do you like peacocks? Do you like colors? If so, you&#x27;ll love this clip. It&#x27;s wonderfully decorative. It does NOT hold hair well. However, if you want it to accent your hair, it&#x27;s awesome. Plus....it&#x27;s stupidly cheap</li>
    <li> The Product was received promptly and  in great condition.  It was everything it was advertised to be and I am very happy with both the quality of the product as well as the excellent service I received.</li>
    <li> Cute item but pulls hair a lot. Whenever I take out the clip from my hair, it&#x27;s always pulling out too.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I wear it all the time. Classic and vintage, looks very nice in my hair! I&#x27;d buy more if I could!</li>
    <li> It is a nice piece! I receive many complements when I wear it.  Personally I think the add shows the stones a few shades darker than they really are.  It was a good purchase for the price.  Shipping was received in less than two weeks, supper quick compared to other purchases I&#x27;ve done.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this actually stays in my hair. I am going to order a few more for my daughters.</li>
    <li> Matches the photo, I haven&#x27;t personally worn it yet but I do like the colors &amp; it seems to be well made, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> My niece is gonna love this for Christmas!!!  Glad I found it at a great price!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Got them for friends and relatives.  They look like crystal and should make great Christmas gifts. I&#x27;ll find out at Christmas what the recipients think of them!</li>
    <li> This clip seems well made, and is really pretty. It&#x27;s lightweight so it stays in my hair easily without much fuss.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why I HAVE to write out a review. This is stupid. Amazon needs to get it together..bc AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THIS!!!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and am tired of wearing little girl hairclips. This clip is great for thin, straight hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with very thick locks, however.</li>
    <li> I totally love it!!! I get so many complements when wearing it. I love how it sparkles in the sun! ^.^</li>
    <li> Fast and looks just like picture! Completely satisfied with product. Great quality for price. Colorful, durable and great design. Satisfied</li>
    <li> Its so beautiful!!! I wished I had ordered more.  I received many complements on it. Thank you for offering such a beautiful product!</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful piece of accessory really nice for a messy hair do or a very neat hair style love it buuuut it was already missing a rhinstone when I got it in by mail.</li>
    <li> IT ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED IT AND WEARING IT ALMOST EVERYDAY.&lt;br /&gt;I TRULY RECOMEND THIS CLIP,AS IT IS COLORFUL AND STYLISH.</li>
    <li> nothing was glued on &#x27;wrong&#x27; or missing. the clasp is tight with no loose spring. it holds very tightly. it&#x27;s mildy heavy for thin hair. so little girls with thin hair may not feel comfortable with it on. but i love it and got it for my daughter. she may not wear it until it&#x27;s older but i can for now ;-p</li>
    <li> It was a cheap clip, but it doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made, and its quite lovely.I would buy similar pieces with the company. Thank you!</li>
    <li> it looks very nice in my hair, however it doesn&#x27;t actually hold the hair in place, you have to put your hair up first and then add the clip.  It is prettier than it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> Quality and beauty all in one great clip !  This is well made and will definately be a useful piece in your hair accessories.</li>
    <li> This is a little on the duller side if you like that... Not really sparkly which I liked. for the price you cant beat it.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be so good for the almost negligible price.&lt;br /&gt;I love love it. Bought many more from them.</li>
    <li> Considering how cheap this was I was surprised by how sturdy it felt. Coincidentally, my mother bought me another one after I showed her the section with all the cute accessories from China. I have used the one I bought (a week ahead) and it stays in my hair when it is styled/pinned very well. Which is saying a lot because I have such heavy, slippery hair normally. Unfortunately, one of the jewels has already fallen off- after the first wearing. Luckily, like I mentioned prior, my mom got me the 2nd one, which I am keeping wrapped until it&#x27;s time to use it for the outfit I&#x27;m planning for Halloween. Until then I&#x27;ll keep wearing the broken one, it still looks cute and the silver mirror look under the jewel almost makes it look like it&#x27;s done on purpose- certainly at a distance or a quick glance.</li>
    <li> These, we got 3, will be a treat for Christmas for our girls. My wife liked them very much and felt they were well made. She also thought it would survive the 4 year old. If that happens, this hair clip can survive anything. They are beautiful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s high quality and it&#x27;s a dollar! I just ordered two more because I keep giving them away to friends that love them. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this more. It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> the colors are much brighter than I than I thought they would be, but love the antique metal look.&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use and surprisingly stays put if you twist and pin properly ;)</li>
    <li> The jewelry piece that I purchased looked beautiful on line ... and except for being smaller than I thought it would be, it is beautiful and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  I also appreciate the price.  The clip took so long to get to me, I had forgotten I had ordered it - except when I went back and reviewed my orders.  But it arrived in perfect shape, wrapped carefully.  Looking at the picture with it in a woman&#x27;s hair, that is just what I believe it will look like - only more lovely in the light.  So - as long as you&#x27;re not in a hurry! - I&lt;br /&gt;recommend this seller.  He or She has got the goods!</li>
    <li> Item was as expected and adds a real pop of color to your hair.  This will be used as a gift for my daughter</li>
    <li> I Love it! It was a great price and great quality! I will definitely shop there again! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the quality of the metal but gems were missing from the peacock tail sadly, disappointing because I love it otherwise.</li>
    <li> The clip is not like in the picture, the stones don&#x27;t have a dull finish but are actually pretty bright. The teeth of the clip hold hair well in place and don&#x27;t tug at the roots. For the price the product is very good and would definitely buy it again. All my friends like it, they like the price more in fact. It ships from China hence the shipping took about 15 days but the tracking number helped keep track of the package. I dropped the clip numerous times but the stones held up and none came loose.</li>
    <li> It was totally broken this product was useless. When I opened the package it was broken inside. I am disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought it for my best friend and she loved it. Great quality clip. it holds very well and the crystals are not cheap looking at alll!:)</li>
    <li> This is a pretty clip. For the price it&#x27;s great.  My only disappointment is that it is a one sided clip. The description doesn&#x27;t state that it is decorated on both sides - I just made the assumption, because the picture is shown on a pony tail that it would be two sided.  That&#x27;s the only slight disappointment.  All in all I like it.</li>
    <li> Your supposed to put it on a side of your fairways cheap Goodrich jerk Rick rock fjord rock fjord Monckton loud&lt;br /&gt;Luckily hi weed splash</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful hair clip, but it is extremely heavy!  I have found I have to use bobby pins in order to keep it in place.  Otherwise it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Is beautiful and I have recieved many compliments and some who have hinted to give it as a gift to them.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom and she said she has received many compliments on it. Most people ask her if it is an antique.</li>
    <li> This is so beautiful! It looks like I paid $20 not $1!!! It has such beautiful stones and the clip is strong enough to hold onto my hair, totally not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this clip for over 6 months and really love it. I wear it all the time, and have gotten plenty of complements on it. It doesn&#x27;t tear at my hair. It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and holds my hair up well, I have medium length hair. A slight warning, the colors of the &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; on the clip vary so you never know what colors they will be. However, for the price you&#x27;re paying I think its worth the chance. I personally think all the gem colors are pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this is a solid, pretty and cheap clip and I would recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful clip.  But it doesn&#x27;t look that much like the picture.  Firstly, the one in the picture is way bigger than the one I received.  Not that it&#x27;s a bad thing for it to be smaller, it&#x27;s just I expected a larger piece according to the picture.  Still I love it and have worn it several times.  I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.  Just wanted to warn others about the size difference.  I&#x27;m definitely happy with my purchase.  We will see how it holds up over use.</li>
    <li> This clip was beautiful and so inexpensive!  It&#x27;s also actually functional,  which  not all  jewelry type hair clips can say! I recommend it completely.  It arrived very quickly as well.</li>
    <li> Only used once and it immediately snapped in half.  Colors were not nearly at vibrant as they appear in picture and metal is blackish not gold.</li>
    <li> this is very cute and works well for those who like peacocks. small prongs to hold the hair in place</li>
    <li> This one is my favorite, the color is a little different from the picture, but it works so perfect for me, I like it.</li>
    <li> if it&#x27;s like the other&#x27;s then I am sure I will love it and so will the person that I  bought it for if it gets here in time.</li>
    <li> i really wasnt expecting much when i purchased this item, it took a long time to get here, but when it finally arrived, i was pleasantly surprised, it was so pretty.  thank you</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair clip, the colors are amazing and it looks great. Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down. Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I loved it till it broke.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another though.. Very flashy, easy to put in,  I really liked</li>
    <li> Took a while for it to get here but my daughter absolutely loves it! It was worth the wait for her ;)</li>
    <li> it isn&#x27;t high quality jewelry but it does look quite pretty. I bought enough for the girls in my son&#x27;s bridal party. The theme is purple and teal/peacock feathers etc. My future  Daughter in law loved them</li>
    <li> It is so beautiful and I can wear it with so many different colors and different hair do&#x27;s, it always looks great</li>
    <li> Once in a while I like to add something to my naturally curly hair. I love color and it matches the bracelet too. Can look either cute or elegant depending on where and how you place it in your hair. Does not snap tight so does not hold tons of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this crystal peacock hair clip for my niece to go with the matching bracelet. It is so colorful and I could see using it as a scarf clip, as well. The price was very reasonable and I would recommend this to anyone who likes bling!</li>
    <li> Bought these while looking for something else. I was greatly surprised!! They both were slightly different in the jewel placement on the peacock, but that made them unique. Great quality clip, good spring in the clip, the clip in also substantial in its weight while not weighing down your hair/head, beautiful!!</li>
    <li> This clip is beautiful and of good quality. My daughter gets compliments every time she wears it. Thinking of ordering more for gifts!</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful! In my black hair it shines! I love it so much! The colors match a lot of my outfits!</li>
    <li> The hair clip was so pretty and worth the price. Nice quality and the perfect size. Everyone will want ask where did you purchase</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great item.&lt;br /&gt;The price is really great.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this item again.&lt;br /&gt;Quality is absolutely great. love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim cause I never put my hair up and I thought what the heck for the money it is a steal.  I bought it and I love it now I just have to find someplace to wear it now.</li>
    <li> Great for one dollar!! I loved it. My mom wants one too and I will order like 5 more to have in stock for whenever I have a Bday present to give, I can add it to the other gifts... I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It came like 3 weeks after ordering... Decent quality</li>
    <li> I was BEYOND pleased when I received this hair clip.  Gem colors are very vibrant.  Gorgeous, gorgeous piece.  I&#x27;m sad to be giving it away as a present.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is what I would call a &amp;#34;pinch clip&amp;#34;, meaning you pinch the end, the other end opens and you slide it into your hair and let go. It holds my rather thick hair very well with little or no slipping. It is also beautiful. I get compliments on it every time I wear it. It&#x27;s 2-2.5 inches long, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and it seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a great deal so I bought 2, when I received it the item looked pretty so I give one to my mom since she wears lots of these hair clips.  When I took mine out of the packaging and tried to open it to get it on my hair it snapped and broke!! It didn&#x27;t even last one day, the one I gave my mom lasted for about 3 days and the same thing happened.  We used it only as a hair accessory and it didn&#x27;t last, I guess ours were really low quality.</li>
    <li> For the cheap price, it&#x27;s lovely. It&#x27;s not made of plastic, but brass-colored metal, and has some weight to it. The clip mechanism is solid, and it holds my thick, heavy hair well. The &#x27;stones&#x27; are plastic, and it arrived with one of them missing, but I&#x27;m not nit-picky at this price. It serves its purpose well, and it looks nice! Probably wouldn&#x27;t work well in thin hair however, due to its weight.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when paying so little for this piece of jewelry, but I was happy with it when I received it. The color tones are not as deep as in the picture, definitely brighter and look a bit cheaper, but my daughters have worn it and gotten many compliments. Definitely worth the price for a small gift!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much since it was so inexpensive but this was a great purchase. The clip is a thin metal rather than the plastic I had expected and the gemstones are real shiny. Clip is nice and the teeth on the clip are on the outside of where the clip closes which seems to make a firmer hold. Overall, pleasantly surprised and would recommend this product. Oh, shipped and received in 15days, comes from Hong Kong.</li>
    <li> Looks like the picture it arrived fine and in time for a present I was giving.  Its made nice and was exactly like the picture plus it was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It fits and holds my hair nicely. The only thing stopping me from giving this a 5 star is that a stone that was missing after the first I wore it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give this item a 0 star because the option doesn&#x27;t exist! I ordered it 3 months ago and still waiting.. I guess it&#x27;s being shipped by a donkey....</li>
    <li> Very pretty and strong hair clip! Just the right touch to add to any outfit several colors to go off of.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty hair clip for a great price.  I get compliments every time I wear it.  I bought a second to give as a Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> The back of my clip was broken when I opened the package.  The packaging was in perfect shape, so it was shipped broken. Aslo one of the gems is missing from the bird&#x27;s head.  I&#x27;m waiting to hear back about returning it, but it probably won&#x27;t be worth it.</li>
    <li> Similar to others, when I opened the package some of the fake gems had fallen off. I tried to keep the rest on with clear nail polish but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is super cute considering how cheap it was! Wish it also came in more colors and with more of an antique silver finish.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. I did break one of the stones off within the first five minutes of opening. It was an easy fix and again I can&#x27;t complain bc of the price.</li>
    <li> Gift for sis, and she loved it. It seemed a bit average on quality, otherwise, I&#x27;d I&#x27;ve it 5 stars. The price was too good to pass up, so I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like the hair clip in a peacock style, its different, I like the design and the stones in different colors.</li>
    <li> This is really sturdy and colorful. I think the hardest this is the angle of the clip, but I&#x27;m not a hair gal ... so I need practice I guess. Great price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It arrived broken. I was  not expecting much for the price, but it would have been ice to be able to use it at least once. too bad too because it is a cute clip.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this might have been a scam because it was so cheap but you do in fact get a very nice hair clip for only a dollar. The piece looks great, I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet and it fits securely in my hair. I was very impressed for the price.</li>
    <li> I have gotten lots of compliments on this. looks just like it does in the picture. is that enough words?</li>
    <li> This clip was so beautiful that my sister took it from me. I&#x27;ll need to go buy more - the price and quality are so worth it!</li>
    <li> I apologise that I reviewed the wrong barrett. I bought two &amp; have still not received this one.  Guess it takes a lot longer to get here from another country. Still waiting on this one but got the other peacock turquoise pin &amp; it is beautiful</li>
    <li> Very cute.  I expected to be a comb or barret, but it is just as described, a clip.&lt;br /&gt;Goes very well with Vintage style copper Peacock dangle earrings.</li>
    <li> This clip is really nice but not exactly as it looks in the pictures. It looks a little cheap, but worth the price paid</li>
    <li> Ordered this on a whim and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  For the price I was figuring it wouldn&#x27;t be very good quality but it&#x27;s sturdy and holds my hair just fine.  Very colorful and cute.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s an amazing buy! Great way to dress up your hair! I would definitely buy more of these if there were different colors and designs!</li>
    <li> What I love about this product other then how adorable it is, is that its versatile and can be used for any occasion. Took a while to ship because it was sent from CHINA but great buy!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 17 year old daughter. It was a great surprise for her, and she loves it. Lots of colors so it is very versatile.</li>
    <li> A pretty and colorful hair clip. Will be a nice addition to a special occasion such as a birthday party, new years eve, Valentines, mother&#x27;s day...... I got it for my daughter to wear to a Chinese birthday celebration. The gems are beautiful color as welk as the clip itself, i.m only concerned the gems may need to be re.applied at some point.</li>
    <li> the hair clip looks exactly as it appears on the picture, and i am very happy with the product, i recommend it</li>
    <li> arrived in 15 days and looked b&#x27;ful with colorful crystals simmering in light .&lt;br /&gt;would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in adding a bit of color to hairstyle .</li>
    <li> THIS IS VERY STRONG AND STAYS IN PLACE.. ITS CUTE AND LOOKS EVEN BETTER IN YOUR HAIR. I WEAR MINE ALL THE TIME AND LOVE IT</li>
    <li> A little brighter colored stones then I thought it would be. It is very unique.  Bought as a gift. Can hardly go wrong or the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, looks just like the picture. It is a nice size and it stayed in my hair well. The jewels are brightly colored.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the quality of it. I need to buy more for my friends and family to use.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well made this clip is made.  It holds my hair without pulling.  I have thick hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> This came MUCH quicker than I expected. For one dollar and free shipping, I can not find any reason to complain about this clip. Stays in my hair just fine.</li>
    <li> Very pretty hair clip.&lt;br /&gt;Love it for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would def order again.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived with all stones in tact and attached to clip.&lt;br /&gt;Have not worn it yet but very much intend to soon.</li>
    <li> It was said this is for a younger girl in another review, well I guess. I&#x27;m not 18 but it&#x27;s really cute.  Definitely something you would wear with jeans and a shirt. This pin would dress up simple jeans and shirt look to a casual, chic look with the help of a cardi, heels/kitten pumps, earrings and light lipstick.  In other words - it&#x27;s one of those little gems to complete a look.&lt;br /&gt;It grips hair well too, under the peacock part, there are 8 teeth for stability.  The &amp;#34;crystals&amp;#34; are actually plastic, but the actual clip is some sort of tin that is a very nice copper color.  For the price it&#x27;s better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought similar clips from stores and they never hold - this one does.</li>
    <li> stones are bright and shinny...seems to be well made....not bad for the price...I definitely recommend this product...ill be looking for more like this</li>
    <li> It actually is a very nice hair clip very pretty the picture does it no justice sturdy too when I do a side braid I place it atop on the side of my head above the braid lots of compliments</li>
    <li> this is such a pretty piece to dress up my very short hair. The price is so reasonable i&#x27;m going to buy several for gifts. My grandaghter has her eye on it already.</li>
    <li> very well made. not flimsy. very beautiful. I get stopped just to be asked about where I got it! in very happy with it</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; fell off the second day i wore it. It&#x27;s a great idea for an accessory, but the quality just wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I could think of a better way to spend a dollar! This clip is beautiful and shiny. I get compliments EVERY time I wear it! If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product PLEASE buy it! It is very very sturdy-- not flimsy AT ALL. The gems are plastic, but very bright and vibrant in the sun.  The clip is a nice size and good weight. I promise you will love this clip and wear it 24/7! :)</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair piece, I will definitely wear it, however there is a gem slightly out of place, it&#x27;s not that noticeable, but it is if you look close enough. The quality level is that of Forever 21 accessories, so it is definitely wearable, but falls short of gift-worthy.</li>
    <li> OK - Beads Come Off. It still looks OK because the metal looks good and the clip is sturdy. What do you expect? It&#x27;s practically free.</li>
    <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t look nearly as cheap as I thought it would! Looks great next to my sock bun our as a clip to hold back long bangs!</li>
    <li> For the price it is a very good buy. It would be a good gift for a young girl, probably between the ages of 8 and 12.</li>
    <li> When I received the piece two of the crystals had fallen off and it took along time to get the piece being it was from hong kong,but all in all was really cute.</li>
    <li> Great clip, it is a bit smaller than I expected but it is very nice. I havent used it yet but looks like it would do the job</li>
    <li> I love this clip!  I&#x27;ve had so many compliments when I wear it to work.  One thing to consider before purchasing: The rhinestones are brightly colored, and the patterns vary from piece to piece.  As long as you go in expecting that, you likely won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I personally love the pattern mine came in!  And the quality is definitely above what I was expecting- the rhinestones are fairly centered and the grip of the clip is excellent.  I used it to keep a small lock of hair in place and it didn&#x27;t slide or budge a bit.  I would definitely recommend this product to others!  Keep in mind that the item does ship from China but I still received mine before they said I would.</li>
    <li> The clip was very pretty decorative jewels. now i have long thick hair, so it&#x27;s no surprise that it falls off so use it with small amounts of hair. The only issue i kept having was that the nice pretty jewels kept falling off. I didn&#x27;t use it a lot and i just got it ad two already fell off. planing to glue it back but if more fall off it&#x27;ll be a hassle. Another thing is the shippng and delivering..IT TOOK TOO LONG!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and it came sooner than it said it would. Good quality for a really good price.</li>
    <li> I loved this piece! I bought it for my daughter! Got lots of compliments on it! Super Cute to wear!</li>
    <li> I justo expected it to be a little bigger.. but it look beaitiful un TVE hair.if you hace curly abundante ha ir... it might not work for you</li>
    <li> It is very beautiful, I love all the colors, seems to be made of very stable metal. A few of the crystals did fall off in coming here, but come on, we paid next to nothing for it. I plan on popping them all off and gluing them down with super glue! Beyond that, can&#x27;t complain, it&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
    <li> I chose a 5 star rating because this hair piece just fits so nicely with that &amp;#34;sexy little black dress&amp;#34; you have, or that &amp;#34;really colorful but don&#x27;t have any hairpiece to match&amp;#34; dress. I also happen to have really long hair so I usually need to put something in there to get it to behave. Know what I mean girls? Anyways, great item, love it, etc.</li>
    <li> Fascination grows with this jewelry is what I tell everyone that I talk to, because of the compliments that I about my peacocks!</li>
    <li> I never got this particular product. So i won&#x27;t be able to rate it to its entirety. Thank u for asking</li>
    <li> A beautiful easy to use hair accessory. Should have purchased 2 so I have one for each side...using one clip makes your head look lopsisded.</li>
    <li> Almost all the gems were missing. Even though the price says it all, I was expecting a somewhat decent hair clip, but the clip arrived with few gems on the clip, and plenty on the bag.</li>
    <li> This piece is so different and I was surprised that is so nice. I will wear this one in the fall and for the holidays.</li>
    <li> Love this clip and is beautiful and I am really enjoying this product, Could not been any better. This is a vender that ppl should shop from its great!</li>
    <li> The pin meets my expectation it&#x27;s sturdy made of metal good sizing multicolored, and easy to place on any hairstyle as an accessory...</li>
    <li> The reason i gave it a one star is i didn&#x27;t receive this item .  This looks pretty and i was expecting to get this item soon. Its been almost 3 months.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful, very nice piece of jewelry.  It is not flimsy at all and it has gorgeous color stones.</li>
    <li> The photos do a good job of representing this product. It holds well in the hair and makes a pretty little decoration.</li>
    <li> My new favorite hair pin arrived just as promised.  It was new and works properly.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered it for myself.</li>
    <li> Very cute holds my hair great! Didnt except it to be so nice but it&#x27;s awesome! Would recommend it to friends</li>
    <li> It is attractive and will make a nice gift if I don&#x27;t end up keeping it myself. It doesn&#x27;t curve like the picture indicates instead is almost straight. I tried it out to hold back my bangs and hair on one side and it worked beautifully.</li>
    <li> I thought it looked ver pretty, I buy stuff like this during the year to fill stockings at christmas, they are well appreaciated and its less expense at christmas.  tip if you do this have a good hiding place or the kids will find them, morecso for the older kids</li>
    <li> Item was delivered with some jewel pieces missing and others had fallen off inside packaging.  You truly do get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I just received this hair clip and it&#x27;s very beautiful. Would need thick hair to hold it, it&#x27;s not light weight. Very much a bargain, but slow to arrive as it appears to be shipped from China.</li>
    <li> This hair clip looks very similar to the photo but right off the bat, two of the stones fell out, before I had even used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Might be ok if you are using these as stocking stuffers or for party favors at a girl&#x27;s birthday party but not really worth the wait to get one in the mail from Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok but no great bargain. You do get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I use this most often to help hold my hair swept off to the side. When people see it, they always compliment it and ask where I got it. The colors are lovely and it goes with everything. The metal isn&#x27;t nearly as cheap as I feared it would be and it has teeth that do a great job holding it in my long, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Very fun hair clip, kind of heavy, good for thicker hair. Decently made, some of the crystals might be slightly off center, but certainly worth the price. Bought several as gifts, and they are a big hit! Clear smooth &amp;#34;stones&amp;#34; of orange, purple, red and turquoise make it versatile with lots of colors. I&#x27;ve also worn it as a brooch clipped on a jacket or cardigan.</li>
    <li> Not as big as it looks in the photo . the length is about 2&amp;#34;. will look very good on a little girl&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> ugly cheap and lackluster but cheap so when it got donated to goodwill, i didnt miss it.  did not even hold my hair</li>
    <li> It took a little over a month for this to come in but it is so cute! I would buy from this seller again. The product is heavy and looks costume but not junky</li>
    <li> VERY CHEAP LOOKING, AND YOU CAN ONLY USE IT AS DECORATION, BECAUSE IT DOESN&#x27;T HOLD ENOUGH HAIR.WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS.</li>
    <li> I received this a couple weeks earlier than anticipated. The colors of mine are pretty close to the picture, except that most of the tiny round &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; are blue but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me. The &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; are kinda like stickers, but I think they will stay on. It is a really nice size and is actually metal as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> great piece. apppears to be very sturdy. not cheap looking. gems dont look fake. it clips in well. doesnt pull hair out i love this piece.</li>
    <li> The clip is so pretty, but the clip itself is flimsy.  I can&#x27;t get it to clip anything - I think as long as it is just used for decoration (instead of hair retaining!) it would be fine</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay a lot of money for this therefore I didn&#x27;t expect it to be a well-made product. It is very sturdy and I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments on this barrette; and no one out there can beat the price. Great deal overall.</li>
    <li> This hair clip took about 3 weeks to get to my mail box. Other than that, you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s kind of cheaply made, but it looks good in your hair. I have received a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I never received it. It seems like a super cute hair piece and I hope that others have a better experience than me.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and amazing quality for the price. I am VERY happy with this purchase! If you like it get it!!</li>
    <li> I got two of them for my wife and they were a cute and colorful addition to her hairstyle.  Excellent find</li>
    <li> This is very cute and even better than the picture...especially for the price! It seems like it&#x27;s good quality, don&#x27;t know yet of it&#x27;s durability.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is so beautiful, very vintage and unique. I enjoy it every time I wear it, every one asks me where I got it!</li>
    <li> The clip is very cute and stylish. The clip doesn&#x27;t hold much hair it&#x27;s more for decoration on hair. Looks just like the picture.</li>
    <li> I bought this with not very high intentions on this being good, but when I got it I was shocked with the quality. This hair clip is really cute with the little gems and looks darling in one hair.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is okay. Pretty stone combinations, except red eyes on peacock look posessed.Some stones are set sideways,not seated, very heavy. Price is right,you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is so pretty. All of my friends love it and are have said that they are ordering one. It&#x27;s not at all heavy. I have very fine hair. My hair and head are sensitive to heavy hair accessories. It holds my hair up too! A big plus with having fine hair! It does take FOREVER to get in the mail though.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Pretty&lt;br /&gt;Type of clip is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Price is good&lt;br /&gt;Great for gifting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observation:&lt;br /&gt;Large size. Makes you think about how to style your hair.</li>
    <li> I will probably end up selling this. It looks cheap and doesn&#x27;t lay right in my hair. Great deal for the price, but not for me.</li>
    <li> This product broke the same day I received it. I try to open it by pressing the clip down and it broke off. I never got to wear it, the material is so cheap that breaks at contact. I was not very pleased with this item, it took weeks to get it, and the day I got it it broke.</li>
    <li> Much nicer than I thought it would be. I actually ended up buying another after getting this one in the mail.</li>
    <li> The crystals are vivid and the wide range of colors can be worn with many outfits.  The clip is very sturdy and holds wells.&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful piece and a wonderful bargain.</li>
    <li> Works best on short or thin hair . Really pretty ! doesn&#x27;t look cheap . They also have matching necklace</li>
    <li> this is adorable and got here pretty fast and the colors sparkle perfectly in my girlfriends hair so i definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This clip is very cute and looks exactly like the picture. It holds very well and goes with lots of different colors. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product for the price. Looks cute and has good hold in my girls thin/fine hair</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these, one for my Mom and one for me. Looks cute, not costumey like I thought from the price.</li>
    <li> This is SUPER cute!!! I have a lion&#x27;s mane of hair and it holds sections perfectly! The clip is strong and doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap! This is seriously a steal, they colors are very vibrant.</li>
    <li> it is really hard to tell what you are buying from the picture. it is simply a medium sized clip. I thought it would have two sides of teeth and it would scrunch up around a pony tail. no such luck. it is pretty, but not as functional as I would like</li>
    <li> It took a few extra weeks of shipping, I wouldnt&#x27; order it if you&#x27;re in a rush. But it is beautiful, and stays in place in medium thickness hair very well.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift so I can&#x27;t speak for the quality but it is cute. Using it as a stocking stuffer. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim, very cheap price but better quality then I expected. I wouldn&#x27;t say this will hold hair by itself though. It is more for the look. Perfect the add spice to an up do.</li>
    <li> This is fun, inexpensive jewelry. You can&#x27;t beat the price. It does take a little while to ship, but it got here when they said it would. I wear it on my scarves. It would be BEAUTIFUL addition to the bow on special gift wrapping.</li>
    <li> I love its color in it and it dresses up any hairstyle. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as big as it is.</li>
    <li> This item arrived with several of the rhinestones already missing. not even worth it for dress up. I regret this purchase. Also took ages to arrive.</li>
    <li> The beauty of this hair clip us truly unbelievable for the price. The colors of the stones are gorgeous.  This is the buy of the year.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple for my sister and friend for christmas.  I got them a full week early which is awesome.  The colors are bright and fun.  The clip itself has great detail and is nicely made for being so inexpensive.  Very happy that i got these:)</li>
    <li> I ordered this along with a few other pieces of jewelry. A month after I ordered this I contacted the seller asking about it. I received a form letter stating I would get my money back and that they were very sorry. I did get my money back but I was disappointed because I really liked this clip.</li>
    <li> Not at all like in the picture.  too bright and looks really tacky.  But for the price I made, I guess I got a good deal.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair clip! I bought it to gift to someone but I might just keep it for myself &amp; wear it on Christmas Eve:)</li>
    <li> This looks very vintage and cute from the picture, but upon receiving, it is very cheesy. The jewels are cheesy and not classy. I dont feel as if I could wear it in my hair.</li>
    <li> This Hairpiece is adorable, and a STEAL for the price. I have also ordered the bracelet that matches so i can wear them together!! The clip on this is sturdy and feels of good quality!</li>
    <li> this clip is very pretty. it looks like the picture although I thought itd be a bit bigger like to be noticed from farther away.</li>
    <li> nice hair addition that really isn&#x27;t big and oxy , is made nicely and i can see where when wanting to dress up will be a nice addition</li>
    <li> Took forever to arrive from China. Is actually very pretty. Nice Construction. I recommend if you need something cute at a bargain.</li>
    <li> It is not as gorgeous as it looks on the picture but it is  ok for the price you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a very long time to arrive</li>
    <li> This is absolutely gorgeous!  It matches almost anything I choose to wear, and the clip stays place in my thick, curly hair.  I can do about any updo imaginable with just this clip!  It&#x27;s definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I just love this hair clip....looks old fashioned! Does not pinch when in your hair or pull hair! It is a snug fit without pain! I love the beautiful colors in the stones and I have a ring that matches it perfecting! Thanks for the great packaging and the fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I used my Amazon gift card I received for Christmas to buy this. It arrived early, works well for my hair and looks exactly like the photo. It is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Definitely dressed up my messy hair days! It&#x27;s great when don&#x27;t feel like making my hair look nice because this does the trick!</li>
    <li> I love this clip!  It holds my hair up really nicely (my hair is very fine and usually slips out of almost anything I try to pin it up with).  I would love more like this in different styles.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much love  my hair clips would  tell all my freinds what a good place to get good del. love it</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivered perfectly on time.  It is beautiful and looks great and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is very beautiful! For people with thin hair beware because its kinda heavy! I like to wear with my hair up! Got a lot of compliments on it!</li>
    <li> I was worried when I bought this as I thought it would be a cheap plastic hair pin...but it&#x27;s actually of much better quality.  It&#x27;s metal and is almost like a banana clip.  It&#x27;s very colorful and very cute.  I recommend!</li>
    <li> the price was really low, so I bought it.  It&#x27;s very nice, but one of the stones already fell, and I used it only once.  Otherwise, it looks pretty much as you see it.</li>
    <li> POOR PACKING ONE OF MINE COMPLETELY BROKEN.&lt;br /&gt;WHYMAIL THIS WAY? AND THEN YOU WNAT ME TO CHANGE MY FEEDBACK LEVEL BECAUSE YOU WILL REPLACE WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE ORIGINALLY?? not!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the bright colors in this and also the way it is versatile in the ways you can place it in your hair.</li>
    <li> It is gorgeous!  The pic doesn&#x27;t do it justice. The stones are very colorful, bright and they seem like they are mounted very well, i.e. no loose stones.  The clip is very sturdy and not too tight.  My hair is very hard to put up.  A stray hair is always falling out.  This clip is very effective at keeping it up and I don&#x27;t say that very often.  The price is great, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came just in time for summer.  I can put my long hair back off of my face and it enhances my look for the day.  I feel pretty even though I&#x27;m just in shorts and a tank top.</li>
    <li> This clip was surprisingly beautiful. It&#x27;s costume jewelry but it was very inexpensive and really nice for the price. It&#x27;s very large so I would only recommend it for an adult or someone with really thick hair. Very nice!</li>
    <li> Love the peacock, love the colors, love how it fits! love the service and everything about it! Can&#x27;t wait to show it to the world!</li>
    <li> I love this piece and I get so many compliments from this and it came so fast and it wasn&#x27;t damaged. the only thing that I would like is if it was in silver because it would go with my jewelry better but I still love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and it is broken down. I&#x27;ve read several comments recommending not to buy. I should have listen their advice.</li>
    <li> It looks exactly like the picture if not better. It was a great price and came well package. I would recommend this product, and I will order more.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Although it isn&#x27;t exactly the colors shown in the picture, it is still really pretty. The clip is perfect for putting it on any hairstyle, and is very comfortable as it is curved. It&#x27;s very easy to clip in, as well.</li>
    <li> The bottom of the clip was broken upon arrival on one of them, the other has missing gems. A dollar is a dollar, if you&#x27;re selling something make it good quality so people continue to buy from you. Amazon would be best to stop allowing this company to sell products through them.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because it is exactly what I was expecting and have worn it a lot.  With the many colors in it, it goes with just about anything.</li>
    <li> My daughter still uses this in her hair, Her friends went nuts over it, Good quality too, Great for hair, works to hold hair</li>
    <li> it is a very beautiful assesorory, I love using it when my hair is up. I bought it because it was cheap but now I love it</li>
    <li> Its cute but a little flimsy, it does look better on the screen but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Arrived in bubble wrap but completely broken. All of the rhinestones had fallen out. It&#x27;s useless to me. The product would be very beautiful if not for that.</li>
    <li> I liked this product because of the different colored gems. But when I got it, the gems were completely different colors than in the picture. Needless to say, I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much of this pin, since the price is very low. I love that the pin is metal and not plastic, the colors are very vibrant.</li>
    <li> The piece came damaged it does not look as the picture&lt;br /&gt; is not very attractive, and it  looks  very cheap also</li>
    <li> Very Nice...wish it would be little longer but still loved it....the stones are very artistically placed...Will definitely recommend it to friends...</li>
    <li> Very colorful and big enough to put on big hair dues. Teen would like this item. And the price was just right.</li>
    <li> I love it, and its such a unique and dazzling piece of hair jewelry.  It looks like a well crafted almost vintage product.  Nice  bronze tone.  The pretty \\&quot;gemstvones\\&quot; really sparkle!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair clip. Beautiful colors and the price is a steal. It took 19 days to arrive. Its a small clip and wish it was made bigger.</li>
    <li> For the price (I think 1.99) it is okay. It was priced correctly, and a okay bargain and colorful. So, I kept it.</li>
    <li> Looked okay on Amazon and I did not expect much. As others said it took a couple of weeks to arrive but when it did arrive, it turned out to be a colorful, metal hair clip  - really good grip, and very resistant (I have a toddler who always plays with it, he likes the colors). I received a lot of compliments on it in the past couple of months. I also wore it as a \\&quot;brooch\\&quot; holding together my scarf, pretty good!</li>
    <li> this has little points in the inside of the clip that holds your hair in place. It even stays in my two year old&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how beautiful this is in person!. Oh my goodness! Nothing costs less than $1.00 anymore and I would have been pleased had it cost 5 times that. Looks great in the hair too</li>
    <li> I liked it! It looks exactly how it looks in the picture! I love all of the diamonds on it</li>
    <li> Not worth the price of shipping. I thought it would be bigger, the person wearing it must be a childMine looks like a 4 year old glued it together, considering its so cheap and from China, a 4 year old probably did glue it together. Sad but probably true. It had potential to be pretty, mine had excess glue on top of the gems so they weren&#x27;t shiny or anything. I could probably give this to a little girl as a gift and she would like it, but any older and they&#x27;d say I got it at the dollar store. Actually, before you pay shipping, go check a dollar store first, I bet you can find one there.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal for this unique item.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed, however, that it did not arrive in time for Easter as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> this peacock hair pin is just right it is very pretty and seems to be made strong and it is not heavy</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a little present for my daughter, who has long hair and often wears it up. She has received so many compliments on this clip!</li>
    <li> I like it.  Heavier than I&#x27;d like, and it will slide out of softer hair.  It doesn&#x27;t have the best of clasp/clip thing but it looks great.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my granddaughter and she loves it, it looks so pretty in her hair!!!  She asked me to see if they had other ones to buy for her!!</li>
    <li> Never saw anything  quite as beautiful .Jewelry for  my hair .well made ,not a piece of junk .  Love it</li>
    <li> Love it! I have received many complements on this piece. And the best part it matches everything. The clip will not hold hair, you need a real fastener, but it will hold in hair for a nice touch</li>
    <li> Perfect! Arrived intact and glows beautifully, as gems should, in light. I feel like I could put this with any dress and really steal the spotlight! I need to buy a matching bracelet, though, because this is really hard to get to look right with anything else. Peacocks aren&#x27;t exactly a staple in my wardrobe, but for this $0.90 price with free shipping, I couldn&#x27;t resist! It did take a while to come, but it was well worth the wait for the quality and price. I recommend it! x</li>
    <li> This piece is a head turner! This is actually my second purchase of this clip, my coworker loved it so much I ordered it for her. With all the colors in the feathers it matches everything. It is so unique and vintage looking.</li>
    <li> Peacock clip.Absolutely love it!! Now I wishe i had bought two of them! Very very pleased with this item! Very happy! :)</li>
    <li> It looks beautiful, not really cheap looking. It would match great with many outfits too, but mine broke quickly :(.</li>
    <li> Pretty item but very small  Unless you only want to put up portion of your hair and leave part down.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter loves  this glamorous hair clip very well nice stuff for them and they are really happy</li>
    <li> The stones are a lot brighter than they appear in the photo. Easy to use and clip stays in place.</li>
    <li> It wasnt exactly what i was expecting. However, it has such vibrant, wonderful colored gems through out the whole clip. I&amp;#34;m looking forward to getting to wear it soon!</li>
    <li> The peacock barrette met all my expectations. I bought this item as a gift for my niece because she likes peacocks and she absolutely loved it! I look forward.to more great deals from Amazon.com. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love the contrast of the antique metal against the bright colors. I think it&#x27;s a fantastic deal. It&#x27;s a pretty small clip, good for holding up the top of my hair.</li>
    <li> i love my hair clip. it looks just like the picture and it looks great in my hair. my hair is very fine and it stays in place.</li>
    <li> This Clip is beautiful.  I wear it as a broche or a pin and get alot of compliments on it.  Bright and colorful!!</li>
    <li> For the price, I was expecting something really cheap, but the clip is a very substantial, very pretty filigree metal.  The clip is very tight--I was really expecting something very lightweight and thin.  I will definitely be ordering more of their products.</li>
    <li> I got this 91 cents and it is well worth that. It holds hair easily and stays in place. It is a little heavy but it is a metal clip so that&#x27;s no surprise. It will not be good for someone with thin and fine hair. I did have one of those rhinestones fall out of place but I super glued it back in place and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
    <li> Since this product came from China, it took about 3-4 weeks to arrive. Assuming you don&#x27;t mind the wait (Prime customers can scoff at that kind of time frame), it&#x27;s a fantastic clip that dresses up your hair or outfit. Playful and jeweled, it&#x27;s a lovely addition and accessory to any closet.</li>
    <li> I collect peacocks so was attracted to this hair clip.  It is very cute and colorful.  Will wear it frequently!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves hair things. She is young and loves to play dress up. This one is a little big for her yet, but will enjoy it later on.</li>
    <li> Super good price and very cute! Made well too. Like that it adds a little more flare to my updo.</li>
    <li> The colors are much more vibrant in person, so if you&#x27;re expecting really deep, rich colors then you might not like it. It seems really sturdy and it&#x27;s made out of metal! The price is so cheap but the product isn&#x27;t. Love love love! This isn&#x27;t for me, but I thought about keeping it ;) don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> Very pretty well worth the wait. Good quality especially for the price. I definitely would by from them again! Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself to replace my favorite hair clip that I lost in my last move and I had reeeeeally high expectations for it. I was so excited to get it so fast from china weeks before expected. It has definitely replaced my old one very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This clip is cheap, it does not hold any hair itself, but is great as decoration. Some of the jewels are not quite glued in their spot, a little off, but not too noticeable. The colors of jewels are pretty random, I wouldn&#x27;t count on the exact color distribution shown in the picture. I like it and would recommend for a self purchase- not as a gift. Great price.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t have high hopes because it is so inexpensive, but it is really nice. The only thing is that it was missing one of the stones on the bottom, but it is hardly noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love the hair clip but whish the earrings came with it. still have not gotten them. this is the same seller for the purse.</li>
    <li> Quality made the jewel tones will stand out in everyone&#x27;s hair. This will be great as Christmas gifts.  I ordered 2.</li>
    <li> This will uphold the wrath of a toddler. Originally got it for my wife but my daughter ended up keeping it. She loves this hair clip and its her daily clip. It took a fall from a moving car before a stone fell out. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to find it in one piece (sans one little stone missing),</li>
    <li> Took a long time to be shipped to me, but it was worth the wait. It was very cute and I got compliments on it. You would never have expected I paid what I did on it.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and had no issues it was pretty and the woman I gave it to loves it and wears it in her hair all the time.</li>
    <li> Like wearing it a lot. Have gotten a lot of compliments on this piece. Don&#x27;t get why shipping took so long for something so small but it happens.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it came promptly, but the clip piece broke in my hand as soon as I opened it, it could still be used to hold your hair, but it looks funny and the spring was exposed... so it was still functional... but I contacted the seller and they sent me a new one right away and that one has lasted me over a month now. I was a little upset at first, but stuff happens, no big deal, could have just been defective. but they were so nice and got me a new clip right away... I like the new one better anyways (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the old one is still going to be used, I&#x27;ll just hot glue it to a barrette or something, but I realize not everyone is as crafty as me. lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but, yes I would buy again for sure, and its totally worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> My order arrived three weeks ahead of estimated shipping time. While it is a high quality product worth much more than what it was here, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in the colors. In the photos on their sales page, the colors look more subdued and darker, however, the piece I received has very bright, and almost too fake looking rhinestones (obviously I knew they were fake to begin with, that just seems to be one of the best ways to describe it).  All in all a great purchase and would suggest to friends looking for a way to add some fun color to their hair styles.</li>
    <li> This clip was purchased as a gift.  She absolutely loves it, and I have purchased more as gifts.  Beautiful AND cheap!</li>
    <li> This item showed up faster than I had anticipated. It&#x27;s a good quality for the price and is cute. Its a solid plastic and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. My two year old wears it and plays with it all of the time and it has held up to her abuse. The item is a good size, probably around three inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive complements every time I wear it. I plan to purchase another for m daughter so she can have her own.</li>
    <li> I love this clip. I bought it for 1$ .... and I wear it all the time. So far the gems havent fallen out yet..</li>
    <li> Was so much nicer in person, great value for the money.  Loved the first one just had to order another</li>
    <li> This lovely hair clip is strong and very heavy duty. Every time I wear this one, I get a lot of compliments. Very sturdy and pretty this hair clip is strong and is made with love and care. I&#x27;d recommend this seller to anyone who asks.</li>
    <li> Very pretty piece. I was surprised with the weight of the item. I figured it would be of lesser quality for the price. Wow!</li>
    <li> I paid less than a dollar for this and I can&#x27;t complain about the product. However, I have seen many beautiful clips for lower costs in other countries and this isn&#x27;t really that beautiful. The clip is not too sturdy to hold a lot of hair. Advantage is that it can be worn with any color attire as this is multicolored. Took about a month to arrive. All crystals were intact despite the simple packaging. It&#x27;s less than a dollar so you won&#x27;t regret the buy.</li>
    <li> I think it looks good for the price! I wanted something gorgeous but didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot. This product was a lot more than I expected!</li>
    <li> You cannot beat the price.  The hair clip has several colors that makes it easier to go with various outfits with different color schemes.</li>
    <li> This was gorgeous I LOVE IT, clip it to my shirt in my hair on a purse it is very nice.</li>
    <li> Came exactly how it looked in the picture...its super sturdy has a metal clip.colors are great as well.came on time as well</li>
    <li> Exactly like the picture. It&#x27;s not as big as I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s still pretty and shiny and nice to wear. Definitely worth it and nice.</li>
    <li> I love it. It compliments my hair very well. It has some weight to it (in a good way) and is still holding up great. This is definitely not one of those &amp;#34;you got what you paid for&amp;#34; things. It&#x27;s greater than I paid for.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these earlier and when I recieved it, I went back and ordered a 2nd one. It is very pretty</li>
    <li> Its ugly, and not like the one in the pic at all, completely different. Don&#x27;t waste  your money.and once i get it, it was broken.</li>
    <li> The product took about 3 weeks to get to my house. Not that bad since it came from far away. This hair clip is no better than what you can find in a beauty supply. And it doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> very cute, have not worn it yet so i can not comment on the quality of it, but i anticipate getting complements.</li>
    <li> I went back and ordered more and handed them out to my girlfirends, and kept some on hand for a small gift idea.</li>
    <li> Haventr tried it on yet but it is pretty i love it. Mine came in way faster than expected and it looks so nice i love the colora and itlooks expensive . I would probably buy more.</li>
    <li> OMG! awesomely pretty! Love this hair clip even more in person! And so do my daughter&#x27;s..Lol  the jewels are very pretty and holds my hair very well!</li>
    <li> This is very pretty and it is easy to use.  I do designs in my hair and add this to the bun or design. Always looks good</li>
    <li> Excellent material, look, weight. Perfect for specials ocassions. No complaints, it´s gorgeous. This is a must. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This pin is the perfect example for you get what you pay. The stones do sparkle but look on the cheaper side and the clip is not a tight fit. However the clip all in all is acceptable.</li>
    <li> Great price. Looks great and is easy to use. Could be higher quality, but then the price would go up.</li>
    <li> Love this clip. It&#x27;s a big alligator clip, so it holds a lot of hair securely. It doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch, and it is cute. I keep it in my purse all the time for pinning up my hair if I&#x27;m having one of those days. And I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it came in different colors and designs... I would order dozens of them!</li>
    <li> It was really pretty and it looks just like the picture and I really thought the colors on it was great. Shipped really fast then most of my orders on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Though it&#x27;s a low price it looks BEAUTIFUL in your hair.  It took a Looooooong time to get to my house and when it did it was broken.  I contacted the seller, sent them a picture and they sent me a new one.  I&#x27;d buy 5 more and give as gifts.  Didn&#x27;t have any issues with jewels falling out.</li>
    <li> The clip is as pretty as it looks in the picture. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because although the clip is strong, it fell out of my hair on the first day I wore it because I clipped it as shown, with the clip facing up. If you don&#x27;t want to lose it, clip it in the way that gravity will help it stay in your hair!</li>
    <li> The back clip broke into two pieces before I even got to wear it.  Unless you are very careful or can use the front piece for a craft project then I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.  The jewels were very shiny and it is a beautiful hair piece; it is just delicate and breaks easily.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is beautiful. The gems are not to bright that it compliment the vintage clip very well. A must have in hair accessories.</li>
    <li> I think the clip is adorable. It holds a lot of hair in place and stays put. Great price and great item.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is adorable! It is what I expected, and so far no jems have popped out. It is a tad heavy for my thin hair, but when I have a braid she holds right on.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took longer than expected, but still was within said time.</li>
    <li> Very much worth the little money I spent. Very Colorful...........I will defitantely give as a gift to a famiy member</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the cheap price, but after reading other positive reviews (and the free shipping helped!), I decided to give it a try.  It turned out to be perfect!  I also got the matching bracelet and that was perfect too.  Try them!</li>
    <li> This looks larger in the photo than it actually is. I will probably re-gift this rather than keep it for myself.</li>
    <li> I like the metal base of this clip very much.  It&#x27;s a good color, is a clip as advertised, and holds hair well.  I almost didn&#x27;t order it at all, but the special promotion with other items made it too good to skip. I am not especially fond of the stones in it, but it is by far my favorite clip of the three I ordered. (The others turned out not to actually be clips.)  If it were offered with other stones I&#x27;d order several more.</li>
    <li> cute clip and not so girlish. we women like to use accessories in our hair as well but dont want to  look like high school girls</li>
    <li> Great value, looks more expensive than what I paid. Awsome colored stones, I can wear it with many different outfits.</li>
    <li> it is a beautiful peice - love it! stays in your hair no problems with it falling out. very colorful</li>
    <li> For the price i paid for it ..i just love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;i have a short hair n it fits perfectly!!</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair- so this doesn&#x27;t hold it back very well. But I like it and use it for decoration instead of the actual piece to hold my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how pretty and durable this clip was. I have very thick hair and it stayed in well. The colors are pretty and makes for a nice accessory.</li>
    <li> looks so pretty on my hair and  it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all...love it!!! I definitely i would recommend it</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I ordered. It&#x27;s suuuper cute!! I wear it almost everyday now. I&#x27;m so glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I bought this and wasn&#x27;t sure what I would get for such a low price! To my surprise this clip is gorgeous and strong! I pull my thick hair up into a bun and this clip holds it securely! I liked this clip so well that I ordered (5) five more!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty, solid, inexpensive and cheerful on a dreary day.&lt;br /&gt;It is also colorful and a great touch for most any destination.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!  I got this as a package deal with the Peacock Bracelet and it truly is a great set.</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Arrived a bit late but I don&#x27;t mind since it was worth it. ;-) ;-) :-) ;-) ;-) ;-)</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and matches many of my outfits that I can accessorize with this clip.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> Took a while to be shipped to me...but knew that it would. Very good price and is a really cute piece. Would order again!</li>
    <li> Accidentally was dropped on the floor and the peacock itself cracked in two pieces. Not sturdy enough to get good use from it although it was very pretty.</li>
    <li> I was amazed when I received this hairpin!  It is beautiful!  The pictures do not show the beauty of this product.  I was so happy with it, that I bought more!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice product, seeing it in person it&#x27;s more for a young girl but it&#x27;s still nice. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Was suprised for the price and the fact it was from China but it&#x27;s well constructed and I wear it everyday pretty much to pull my hair back. I bought 2 just in case.</li>
    <li> They looked larger in the picture but I could still use it since my hair is originally short, I don&#x27;t recommend it for longer hair.</li>
    <li> This came in very quick and was excatly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price and product is good quality!</li>
    <li> This hair clip is more colorful in person, and also sturdier than I imagined from the picture and the price.</li>
    <li> Paid what a garage sale would&#x27;ve charged me I think. Such a lovely traditionally oriental piece. A work of art.</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful and well made. It was reasonable and delivered on time. It&#x27;s a gift so I haven&#x27;t used it. Will know more after I gift it. Well worth the price from the looks of it.</li>
    <li> the price was great..it looks great in my hair. the colors and clip were always. Thank you so much. love it</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip, its really a great deal for the price paid. Its made entirely of metal, besides the rhinestones on top. Will be using this over and over again!</li>
    <li> It is exactly as pictured.. I t came way before the expecte date which was perfect because I needed it to wear to a wedding.. It got so many compliments..</li>
    <li> These clips are actually quite pretty, and they hold well -- even in thick hair, which is a plus!  We did not have a problem with faded \\&quot;stones\\&quot;, ours arrived as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, when I ordered these, it took so long to get them that I had actually forgotten that I&#x27;d ordered them when they finally arrived.  Of course, they do have to come a long way, but if you are anxious to get them there may be a long wait.  Also, one of the stones was loose, but we just glued it right back into place, and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I recommend these!</li>
    <li> Picture does not do this justice.  Very beautiful piece.  My daughter wore it to middle school and had many friends asking her where she got it.</li>
    <li> I  been looking for something to pin my ahir up with, out the use of bobbie pins or hair ties. When I found  this clip I looked no further.</li>
    <li> But jewels started falling off in the first 10 minutes. 99c for ya though. Buy cheap get cheap, I suppose. Sturdy clip nonetheless</li>
    <li> It looks ugly when you see it in person.  It doesnt look anything like the picture... The clip is already broken within a week.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely piece. It can also double as a scarf clip. Delievery took a long time, but was worth the wait for this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 11 y.o, nice. She was very happy wearing it over the band of a ponytail. It covered well that band and she was very happy. It is well made and you cannot go wrong with that price.</li>
    <li> as soon as i opened the plastic it was wrapped in, the whole thing crumpled. i was very upset. the jewels were very pretty, but there was no sense to send it back. i just cut my loses an definitely do not recommend</li>
    <li> I gave these to my daughters and my sister and my mother. They all have gotten such great reviews on the style of their hair and the beautiful way it looks in their hair.</li>
    <li> I love this piece. It&#x27;s beautifully made. Nice colors very shiny. This was my favorite but it broke without warning and without me wearing it</li>
    <li> My Daughter and sister are both Obsessed with Peacocks so when I saw this I had to grab it (HELLO THE PRICE IS RIGHT!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very pretty and my daughter (9) wears it all the time!</li>
    <li> my hair is too short for them, but I put one on my coat lapel and got a lot of notice and comments about it.</li>
    <li> The item broke after using it the 3rd time.. I didn&#x27;t ask for a refund because I had already had it for about 2 months. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I love this peacock hair clip! It&#x27;s great - works well with my thick hair and matches with lots of outfits. Definitely something I recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great accessory for the price, the colored gems are plastic, but its a great pop of color to add some style to an updo.</li>
    <li> This clip is absolutely gorgeous! I get compliments on it all the time. I uploaded a picture of it in my hair. The stones are might brighter than the picture shows. It&#x27;s also heavier/sturdier than you&#x27;d think it would be for under $2. I just ordered more for my sisters. It holds a decent amount of hair securely.</li>
    <li> I thought for sure that since this was so cheap that this clip would look cheap but when it arrived it was to pretty. The colors are gorgeous. It was purchased as a gift and my friend is going to love it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but was pleasantly surprised, it&#x27;s very cute and came quickly.  It isn&#x27;t the best quality but I think is great for a fun hair piece.</li>
    <li> Terrible! Most of the stones arrived broken.&lt;br /&gt;Really not worth it. Save your money and dissapointment.&lt;br /&gt;I did not even bothered in returning.</li>
    <li> This item arrived well before the stated arrival timeframe. The colors are so rich and beautiful. The item is so much more sturdy than I thought it would be because of the price. I am glad to add this item to my growing collection of unique items.</li>
    <li> The brouche was absolutely beautiful. It&#x27;s heavy duty so you know it won&#x27;t fall part in an instant and have i said, it looks beautiful?! This is one of my favorite hair acessories for sure.</li>
    <li> I love the hairclip - although my hair is to thick to be held with it - it is very pretty and I will use it as a gift for someone - very nice product</li>
    <li> While rhis piece feels flimsy it is a costume piece. Treat with kid gloves and its ok. Beautiful piece and i love it. IT IS NOT VINTAGE!  just looks like it.</li>
    <li> The rhinestones are very bright colors, not the toned down look as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The clip is just that, an open ended clip but it&#x27;s a long one and works better than most of it&#x27;s kind because of the 9 spikes on the back that grab the hair (don&#x27;t worry, they don&#x27;t hurt). Seems strong enough. Nice.</li>
    <li> This one was my favorite that I ordered!  It is very colorful, stylish peacock and pretty.  I wish I ordered more!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a cheap metal, it&#x27;s actually heavy and hold very well!&lt;br /&gt;I think I will get one for my sister.</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful clip. The colors are really vibrant and go with a variety of different colored clothes. The clip also arrived in good condition and in good time.</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture, and will go quite well with dark brown or black hair.  The price was good and I received it in good shape.</li>
    <li> Great for the price.Quality isnt that great. But again for the price it was good.  Thank you for the product</li>
    <li> good hair clip, a little smaller than i envisioned, but still cute.  and a very good price for a pretty item</li>
    <li> Cute for a younger girl. Looks kinds cheap but it was cheap. JEWELS are very bright. My Daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful hair clip.  I ordered it for my daughter and she is going to love it. Great description.</li>
    <li> Great! New and very cheap and beautiful to add to my collection. Recommend using this company for future use. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This hair clip is absolutely beautiful. I have received many compliments on it. So far i have no complains on it.</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift, but I was happy with how pretty it was when I opened the package. Also, the estimated shipping time would have put it well past Christmas, but it came within a week.</li>
    <li> Love this hairclip, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and the process.  Very easy to use and it looks so great in my hair.</li>
    <li> She tells me that this is a colorful hairpin that attracts compliments wherever she goes, and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a lot brighter than it looks, it is really cute and looks really great in my hair. I thought that the price was right and if you don&#x27;t mind waiting for it then I would say buy it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister for Christmas. She works at Chanel and always has her hair up. She LOVED it and was in awe at how beautiful it is!</li>
    <li> Item looks exactly like picture. I was happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It is a large clip style which is not displayed in the picture shown.</li>
    <li> Beautiful amazing product particularly for the price! I would suggest buying this for anyone who might like this style! Great gift!</li>
    <li> I love this hair accessory it is so cute and really worth the money. It is small but the stones in it are very nice. I am ordering 2 more as gifts.</li>
    <li> This hair piece is beautiful when I received it today I was so susprised that this lived up to its picture. Anyone would be happy to get.</li>
    <li> I put it in my hair and it BROKE. The FIRST DAY that I had it. :( It&#x27;s so pretty and there is no way I can fix it so I am going to have to suffer the return process.</li>
    <li> It is quite heavy to use for hair.&lt;br /&gt;And looks cheap, though it is cheap. I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> love it!! very beautiful!! I was very surprised when I actually received it....thought it would look cheap. This was a great deal!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like it better if the colors were better thought out. Too many of the same colors next to each other and looks like someone who was color blind decided to place the gems on it. I figured I could just remove them and reapply them in a different manner if it really bothers me. Its a strong clip and is great otherwise.</li>
    <li> Loved the style and the look of it. They are going to come a bit different then what you see in the pic as far as color schemes go. Mine tends to lean more on the red side with less colored jewels. I wanted a multi or purple, green one but it didn&#x27;t happen and I&#x27;m not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glue on the jewels and the jewels themselves are a little bit lacking in &amp;#34;awe.&amp;#34; Its still a great deal and a good purchase just cheaper than what it appears.</li>
    <li> This goes very nicely with the necklace that matches. It is definitely worth the money. I have had many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This clip is light weight and easy to use both vertical and horizonally. It dresses up any updo and has great colors</li>
    <li> this is very pretty and functional.  I have long hair and I think I can pop it in my hair to hold stray strands as well as wear it with a fancy dress.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this item when I received it.  I think the item works well for younger and older women.  The muted colors in the piece will blend well with any hair color, and the quality of the item is surprisingly good.  I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a different type of hair accessory.</li>
    <li> Looks great!! It&#x27;s very light in weight, bright colors. Holds my very curly, long hair in a bun easily with the help of one more bobby pin.  Arrived 4 weeks early with no broken or missing parts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty clip and, best of all for me, it stays firmly despite my fine hair.  I was prepared to have to put my hair up another way and only use this clip for decoration.  I&#x27;m really surprised and pleased that I can just use this clip alone.</li>
    <li> The item is pretty the smell of copper not so good it smells cheap and a lot of copper like the penny&#x27;s Smell it leaves the smell I it didn&#x27;t get wet so I don&#x27;t know its to strong for me item is pretty if you don&#x27;t mind the copper smell</li>
    <li> This is a special hair clip, the design is beautiful and out of the ordinary. Very good item to wear for a party or daily. I love it.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful,crazy cheap price.You just have to wait for them to ship from Japan, but worth the wait.Also very sturdy cilp large with tight spring and grippy teeth. Nice quality.I bought 4 and gave 2 away as g</li>
    <li> Very Pretty hair barrette.  Recieved as promised.  The colors are not as deep as I thought, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.  I think the colors will shine and sparkle in the sun and proper lighting.  For the price, I&#x27;m extremely happy with it!</li>
    <li> This is a little smaller than I thought it was, but that&#x27;s my own fault for not reading the description. It&#x27;s really pretty and the colors are nice.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely beautiful clip for the money! It&#x27;s also quite a bit sturdier than I had expected. And the colors are brighter in person.</li>
    <li> Not happy... Wanted these for Holiday Party this Sunday. French theme. Now I learn it wont arrive till after NYE! BS</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. It is beautiful and just as described. The only thing that worries me is the clip in the back. It does;t seem real sturdy, which is why it loses a star in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these because the picture depicts them so beautifully. And let me tell you, they are even MORE beautiful in person!! They glisten and gleam in person, and they are strong enough for thick hair. I love how they look. Here is one drawback, and its not about the item itself. These ship from Hong Kong, so it takes about a month to get them (I live in America) and it ships with standard delivery, thats why its so slow. But I must say that I was anticipating the delivery, and was not disappointed at all. I would recommend for those who want elegant looking hair clips.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this \\&quot;Lovely vintage jewelry crystal peacock hair clip\\&quot; and thought I would take a chance on purchasing it.  I just received them today which is a lot earlier than I was expecting them.  They are absolutely lovely much nicer than I expected them to be for the price.  they look like they are made very well.  I tried one in my hair and it stayed put.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting that either because most clips slide out of my hair.  (I have baby fine hair, but a lot of it thank goodness)  It looks really nice in my blonde hair.  You absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong buying this item, and it makes an excellent small gift.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Cute for the price. The gem stones are more primary colors than dull colors. Shipped from outside the US, only negative. I used for a decoration on the packaging on a couple Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> I am so upset!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars, if it hadn&#x27;t broken before I even received it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s such a beautiful piece! I bought it for my little cousin&#x27;s first high school dance (she&#x27;s going as a Peacock Princess) and I thought, pretty and inexpensive. Sure, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was so terribly done - there was two short rectangles of bubble wrap around it (very thin bubble wrap) and it was held together by a very easy to open paper bag - barely bigger than my palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also ordered a pocket watch, which was packaged nicely, but the hair clip was broken right at the base of the spring. I am unsure whether to blame the metal as well, but I was very upset. I took pictures of where it broke in hopes to email them and see whether or not it&#x27;s worth returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing: I was very pleased by their other product!&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure whether or not to give them another try.</li>
    <li> the clip is very pretty. its nice and light as well which was a big plus for me as i have fine hair. i have other clips that are similar but i dont wear them as their weight pulls on my hair. so that was a nice surprise. the shipping however takes a while. i didnt mind it that much cause i wasn&#x27;t in a rush to get them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and waited a month for it. Upon arrival, the clip had a few rhinestones missing. I like it, but I can&#x27;t give it to anyone now. Thanks :/</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this product for 2 reason. It&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s coming from our of the country. But I was surprised to received it before Christmas and the color is great. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all. So I decided to order more.</li>
    <li> I got this to match the bangle bracelet. It is very cute and arrived in the time specified. l l</li>
    <li> I purchased the Crystal Peacock Hair Clip for a friend.  It is so colorful and pretty, and I know she will love it.</li>
    <li> I gmot more ware out of this item than I every imagined.  It works with many different hair styles and is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> A really nice clip, especially for the price. I put this in a little gift stocking for my mother ( she always has her hair up). She loved it, and thought it was expensive. Great little bargain.</li>
    <li> The colors were a little off, but it sttill looks really pretty!! it came with an extra gem, dont think that one of yours fell off. i ordered it a few days before christmas and it came the 2nd :D</li>
    <li> My mom bought this for me it is just like the picture! Very cute. Holds well in my hair. It&#x27;s not the best quality but it&#x27;s worth the cheap price.</li>
    <li> I feel bad giving this only 2 stars, but the reason is not the color but that it arrived broken. Very bad packaging.</li>
    <li> The clip has a good, strong grip--the stone colors are a bit brighter than they appear in the picture--overall, a good buy for the price! Oh, and it ships from China so it takes a while to get to the states (probably a month or so).</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for someone. It way more expensive than it is. So it made me look really good, lol. It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I thought but still very nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this clip (actually I bought 2) for my daughter since she has grown her hair out now.  They are quite lovely and colorful.</li>
    <li> Very cute. I love it. Didn&#x27;t take very long to get here from so far away. Thanks. I would order again.</li>
    <li> The product came broken it wasnt able to to put back together. It took almost 3 months to get. The price was awesome but again the product was horrible.</li>
    <li> cute, adorable, fashionable, good quality, and did I say cute. A great price! I plan to buy more from this company.</li>
    <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but now I wish I would have bought more than just one!  The only con was having to wait so long to get it, but it actually came sooner than expected.  It&#x27;s really pretty and I wear it all the time!</li>
    <li> There are 2 of them, and they&#x27;re very pretty with the different color stones!Prompt shipping, and great price! Sure to draw compliments!</li>
    <li> I love it! It holds a little or a lot. It goes with anything. The colors a very vibrant and beautiful!</li>
    <li> This is so cute and was very inexpensive but one of the stones has already fallen out.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll only take a little super glue to fix, but still.  But no real complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this clip. It does not pull hair and it truly looks vintage. My sister couldn&#x27;t believe it wasn&#x27;t. Great for costume jewelry. It&#x27;s much brighter than shown. The picture does this clip no justice. Prettier in person.</li>
    <li> This piece is light weight and very beautiful in its unique style. Easy to use. Many people have admired its beauty and colors each time I wear it. I can wear it with almost every outfit because of the many colors. I love it!</li>
    <li> I received the Crystal Peacock Hair Clip within a couple of weeks, I expected it in February.&lt;br /&gt;I was sad to see that the clip was broken.  I emailed the company to let them know.  The&lt;br /&gt;Peacock was beautiful, I love the colors of the crystals.  I am just bummed that I was not able to use&lt;br /&gt;it.  It was sent in a single bubble envelope.  I hope they get to send another one, I really liked it.  I also bought the matching bracelets, they were received in good condition, they were wrapped several times in bubble pack and then taped.</li>
    <li> This was much prettier in person. The colors pop and it stays in your hair very well. I am very please with this fun little purchase.</li>
    <li> Bit too tacky for my taste at hand. But it&#x27;s better to give one of your tacky-style friends . Not to have.</li>
    <li> This is a really cute clip and quite sturdy, especially for the price!  It made it here in about two weeks, much faster than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I like the colorful pop this peacock hair clip adds to any outfit. It looks pretty dressy when I wear it so it doesn&#x27;t go with everything, but it&#x27;s fun to wear with fancier outfits. My only issue with it is that my hair parts on the opposite side so I&#x27;d have to wear the peacock upside down on the side it parts. Other than that small personal issue with it, I&#x27;ve enjoyed this cute accessory. :-)</li>
    <li> Hee hee! It&#x27;s really beautiful!  I put it in my hair right away.  Just the right amount of color, really, it&#x27;s great. Came in a padded envelope.  Took forever to get here but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this hair clip! It is very colorful and is made with a good quality metal. The rhinestones are nicely placed and do not fall off or chip. I would highly suggest this hair piece.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous, study, colorful....just beautiful. I receive compliments every time I wear it.  I bought two and the stones are different in each one, I LOVE THEM!  The inexpensive price is just exceptional for the quality.</li>
    <li> its a very nice clip arrived a little later than expected but it was coming from china arround christmas wish the tail feathers dangled</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and sparkly. It looks like it cost way more than $1.50. Shipping took a while and the product is smaller than I was expecting. It is more of a hair decoration than a clip. I can only really hold back half of the front part of my hair. The bar on the bottom seems plenty long, but the teethed side necessary to hold your hair is about an inch shorter than the other half.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear clips or barretts because my hair is thin and fine. But, I decided to order this clip because it was cute and really inexpensive. It pleasantly surprised me. Not only does it hold my hair but it is very cute!</li>
    <li> could not beat the price, its not to outlandish looking but adds a pretty accent to your hair, I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Love that this goes with ALMOST EVERYTHING in my spring/summer wardrobe.  It makes a boring updo/ponytail into a very classy, jeweled updo!!!!!!! I also purchased the matching bracelet &amp; the crystal owl pendant &amp; chain to go with this</li>
    <li> I bought this and thought it would come home looking kind of like the picture and when it got to me all the colors were either bright red or bright blue, it looks extremely cheap (the price should have given that away huh?) but I was just disappointed with the fact that it didn&#x27;t match the photo at ALL. the clip is pretty sturdy in hair. Should work fine for tweens and teenagers.</li>
    <li> It is a good hair pin for buns/french role. It is as per description, just the colors are brighter. I received it in reasonable time and product was new. It is not heavy at all. Overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> Still have not received product. waiting for it conme beofre I can make a review. once I do I will review</li>
    <li> ordered 3 all 3 where different the one had all the different colors pretty well spread out really nice, had a tight grip..</li>
    <li> It took forever to get here, but it finally came and I  absolutely love it! It is SO so cute!</li>
    <li> This will be very pretty in my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  It is so very pretty and I love it.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It brooks the second I opened it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Plus it arrived really late..I order it a month ago and arrived last night!!</li>
    <li> The size is about as long as my middle finger which is like 3-4 inches but i still absolutely love it. I have a hard time finding clips that stay in my hair b/c my hair is very smooth and slippery, but this one holds great. My hair is very long (bout to middle of my back) and theres lots of it, but i can still put it up like in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The estimated delivery said something like dec 10, but i found this odd b/c i ordered items from them much later after i ordered this and their estimated delivery was before dec 10. So, i wasnt surprised when i received the package on nov 27</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected which was a plus. Got this for way cheap and was kind of worried but it is beautiful and my friend will love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more bful than than the pic.Great workmanship too.Worth the wait with free shipping.Buy it and you would think why I ordered just one.Great gift idea for ladies.</li>
    <li> bought this and the matching braclet. love it! gwt lots of commnets doesnt look cheap great price  and very colorful!</li>
    <li> This hair piece looks great! This is definitely worth it. Buy Buy Buy. have gotten great compliments from family and friends</li>
    <li> Bought for daughter, she  loved this for Christmas gift. artwork great, and she&#x27;s already worn it with compliments from others. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I wasnt expecting anything much from a product that was so cheap. Thought it might not be as pretty as the picture shown here. I was SO wrong! Beautiful vibrant colors and very comfortable to wear. Doesnt pull/tug at your hair at all. I was so happy that i ordered another one for my sister too.</li>
    <li> colors are vibrant, lightweight.  holds hair nicely.  priced right.  It&#x27;s plastic so I hope it doesn&#x27;t break easily.  very happyso far</li>
    <li> This hair clip is beautiful and surprisingly well made. What you see in the picture is truly what you get. I plan on buying more to give as gifts. Definitely, a 5 star rating from me!</li>
    <li> It was great especially for the price, it seems like the colors were a different shade than the picture but such a good price how can you really complain!</li>
    <li> I had to throw out what I thought would be a beautiful hair pin, as soon as I got it out of the package it was broken in 2 pieces.  I tried to see if maybe I could super-glue it back together but that did not work out so like I said, it went straight to the trash.</li>
    <li> I love this I&#x27;m not a fan of peacocks but the clip holds my thin hair very well and its beautiful def worth the 1.50 and it got here super quick to with in a week.</li>
    <li> This barrette is just gorgeous! No one can believe that I only paid $1 for it! I gave 2 as gifts and kept one for myself and it is very sturdy and well made.  The spring mechanism is very tight and holds back my long hair just as well as any high priced clip would.  Definitely recommend to anyone looking! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> alot smaller than i thought, but still a very nice piece..got this for a friend, she really liked it as well...</li>
    <li> Wonderful price and beautiful clip! I gave these as gifts and got raves from the recipients. I wish I had hair long enough to use them myself! Good quality and no disappointments.</li>
    <li> i bought this to put in my 4 year old&#x27;s hair and its perfect. i am having no problems with it.</li>
    <li> Love this hair clip! The colors are gorgeous and the clip acually holds a lot of hair. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered on time and was packaged appropriately. The clip was as described and a pretty color arrangement. I received a few compliments while wearing this piece.&lt;br /&gt;  Unfortunately the clip broke within two weeks. The clip could be more solid for those of us with very thick hair but nothing some handy super glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting such a nice product since it was so inexpensive. It took a few weeks to arrive but well worth the wait. I plan to order more. The hair clip is sturdy and really holds my hair in place and the colors are much better than the picture. I am very satisfied with this very unique but tasteful hair accessory. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did not hesitate to order this after ordering and receiving a similar item on Amazon:  Sudial- Multi Vintage Colorful Peacock Bracelet Bangle.  That bracelet was inexpensive also and proved to be durable and oh - so - pretty!  (See my review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This peacock hair clip did not disappoint, either.  It is stunning!  I actually ordered two and had them shipped directly to my daughter.  She was so surprised to receive them, and even more surprised when I told her how little they had cost -- because they look like they are designer pieces.  She tried one in her hair immediately, and it looked beautiful.  She is just so happy with them.  Honestly, I believe these would sell for a lot of money in some catalogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stones are nice, bright colors, and none of them are loose.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of metal the hair clip is constructed of, but nothing looks cheap about the quality.  I ordered two for my daughter because another reviewer had said she wished she had purchased two in case hers broke.  However, I think one is going to be sufficient for quite some time.</li>
    <li> I love this! It is very cute and always getting compliments on it. Would recommend. The colors are true to the picture and I just love wearing this. I even got my sister one.</li>
    <li> This clip is lovely and perfect. It took a little bit to get here but it arrived and I absolutely adore it.</li>
    <li> Pretty from far away, but up close the piece looks cheaply made. What do you expect for something under $3 that comes from Hong Kong? I didn&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations for this item, but I also didn&#x27;t expect it to break when I put it in my daughters hair. She doesn&#x27;t have super thick hair, but either way, the soldering should be a little better to at least hold the peacock onto the clip for a little while!</li>
    <li> when it arrived it was broken,stones were sliped out,its also very small, i like viewing lovely vintage jewelry,but thet are very cheaply made,so better to look at them only</li>
    <li> very pretty, I wish the peacock was more rounded to follow the contour of the head. I like it anyways.</li>
    <li> Those peacock look pretty on the hair. I like it. Thank you so much, I don;t regret getting item and I advice to buy it.</li>
    <li> pretty, great price! gems are cheap but hey for the price you pay I didn&#x27;t really care. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This broke two days after I had it. None of the gems fell out but it was poorly made. It took forever to get here since it is coming from China.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful. However it is much bigger than appears, as about 5&amp;#34; across. But a great way to dress up your hair for a special occasion.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister, she loved it! she likes vintage stuff. she liked the colors, but i didnt. It wasn&#x27;t what i expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Everyone I knew loves this clip... I will be buying more for gifts. Thank you for making them adorable. There cute.</li>
    <li> This is awesome for the price. Bought 2 for wife and daughter. Both liked them. It would have been 5 stars but for the time it took for shipping.</li>
    <li> So cute and worth way more than 88 cents. very fuctional and pretty. good quality and looks like it will last a very long time. its cute and dainty about 3 inches long the perfect size for me to just add a little touch of color</li>
    <li> so cute. i wear it so often that everyone else is probably sick of looking at it! i love it!</li>
    <li> These hair clips are stunning in person.  They are smaller, lighter, and more versatile than the larger and much much heavier metal hair clips most sellers offer.  The larger hair clips are extremely heavy and very hard to put in and hold an updo in place.  These smaller clips are easier to clip anywhere you want them and they stay in place.  Two on each side of a nice updo won&#x27;t give me a migraine or pull my hairdo apart and collapse it like a deflated balloon as the heavy clip I received a few weeks earlier does.  My girlfriend, who has enough hair for three of me, said she can&#x27;t keep the large clips in her hair either because they are so heavy they slide right out of her long wavy hair.  I wish I had ordered these as gifts earlier, but the picture isn&#x27;t flattering.  Knowing how they look, how reasonably they are priced, and how much easier they are to manipulate in hair, I&#x27;m ordering more now.  I will hold them to give as gifts later since it&#x27;s too late to get them by Christmas.</li>
    <li> This was an order for my daughter who has long hair. She was wearing it when she visited me and it was very attractive in her hair. She reaally liked it.</li>
    <li> i purchased this as a christmas gift and they were received with a huge smile and many thanks! thank you!</li>
    <li> the antique finish in picture is not seen when i bought this , but its for very less price , i wont buy this again .</li>
    <li> This is gorgeous!  It arrived over a week EaRLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the peacock bracelet and they match perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get many compliments on this!</li>
    <li> I am so sorry that it has taken me a while to review this item. I had ordered it for my daughter who loved vintage jewelry. My daughter passed away on February 22, 2013. I am just checking my emails now.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice hair clip.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CLIP! I fell in love with this hair clip on line but it is even more beautiful in person!</li>
    <li> It is very pretty, smaller than I expected, and very fragile-feeling. I&#x27;m scared to put it on my ridiculously thick hair cuz everything breaks on my big &#x27;ol head!</li>
    <li> It is a nice clip, the colors of the crystals and total look matches the picture provided by the seller, the only drawback is that  the actual size is a bit on the smaller side. My tween is happy though. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This clip is very cute &amp; matches the bracelet nicely. It holds my very thin hair quite well &amp; I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! This clip is worth every penny and more! Very sturdy and holds hair well. Arrived quickly. I definitely recommend this product. I am buying more.</li>
    <li> This clip is cute and the price was right but it was very cheaply made.  I asked for a refund and I need to see if I actually was credited.  The little jewels were misglued.  From a distance, perhaps OK, but I didn&#x27;t expect so many jewels to be misaligned it is if it melted and they slid.</li>
    <li> This is everything I hoped for and more.  The colors are just as good and as varied as in the picutre.  Plus it is really comfortable to wear.  I have thin hair so big pretty clips tend to slip through the strands through the day and drag on the hair.  However, this one did not feel heavy and held my hair tight all day long.  Definately reccomend, and I am going to buy some more for friends.</li>
    <li> it is beautiful and has a vintage flavor which i love. the clip is very easy to use for any parts of the hair, could even put on a scarf.  the shipment takes longer than domestic ones because it mailed from Hong Kong, but the seller (Efuture LLC) was especially prompt and courteous in responding to my inquiry. I&#x27;m happy with the transaction.</li>
    <li> I have gotten many compliments on this pretty hair decoration. It seems to be well made and sturdy. It also stays in place well.</li>
    <li> I received this hair clip in record time. I get lots of compliments on it and it stays in my long thick hair. I love the versatility of it. With so many colors it works well with just about anything I wear.</li>
    <li> I liked it/ would recommend.I is very pretty and reasonably priced. Colors go with most anything. It is  easy to use.</li>
    <li> Took 10 days to arrive, but since it ships for free and it came from China, it was not so slow.&lt;br /&gt;Look just like the picture but little bit prettier and brighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a clip that is sturdy enough to hold my very long thick hair in place. This clip is AWESOME. Its made of metal and has strong metal teeth that holds the clip in place- however its designed in such a way that it has not damaged my hair at all. I can simply twist my locks into a quick bun shape and clip it in place and I am good to go for several hours (this is a rare find with clips in my experience.) I have gotten lots of compliments on this. This clip seems unbreakable so far and I have been using it for 5 months.</li>
    <li> love this product because its so colorful i can wear it with so many different things.  had it for over half a year now and still has all its stones and is in wonderful working condition. sturdy.</li>
    <li> So pretty and very nice size piece.  My 6 and 8 year old love it too!  I bought one for my sister and her two girls to symbolize our love bond.  Would make a great gift or stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> For the price, the quality is wonderful. I received many compliants about it. The hair piece holds my hair in place without pulling</li>
    <li> This hair pin is very light, very colorful, and very cute. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to jazz up their hair a little bit. :)</li>
    <li> This item arrived very quickly; it got here far sooner than I would have expected.  It is very beautiful, the colors are brighter than the picture depicts.  The clip looks great in my hair.  For a dollar and free shipping this was a great find!</li>
    <li> came in broken in 3 pieces, bad bad, dont buy, comes from china in plain envelope, not even a box, fragile i would return, but cost a dollar,</li>
    <li> I received exactly the item shown. It is high quality and I would recommend it and/or by it for a friend :)</li>
    <li> for this price? what else do you expect? sooo nice and colorful you can use with different desses in different colors</li>
    <li> Its is a little bit bigger than the size of my palm, the jewels are secure in their places, it is strong and stays in place well. It has multiple pin prongs to hold the hair in place.l</li>
    <li> This is a cute, inexpensive clip. Not sure how long it will hold up, but for the price, I thought I would give it a try! I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Nice size and strong clip. But it&#x27;s heavy. Works fine for my thick wild hair but I&#x27;d imagine if your hair is fine or thin I think it&#x27;d probably all out. But great for an updo and not cheap looking at all!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and holds hair tight, no falling out or pulling hair. Also very pretty. Got a compliment on it tonight, someone across the table from me at a function said she couldn&#x27;t take her eyes off it. Very pleased with my purchase and came sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> it is to be given as a gift so I don&amp;#34;t know if she likes it yet but I did get one for me also and I like it</li>
    <li> Dresses up even the messiest of up-dos. It has a nice weight to it too. Really a nice little accessory for the money.</li>
    <li> Again, I bought both of these as gifts but have not yet given them but they look kind of nice to me. I like them and I hope the recipients will too.</li>
    <li> For the price I was a bit iffy but I&#x27;m glad I did. I have no regrets about buying this. You get what you pay and no one should ever complain about it looking cheap if you bought it cheap. Still for the price I would do it all over again. My mom was actually in love with this!</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty hair clip! It looks great and stays in your hair very well. The design is pretty cool and unique.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet. I just had to get  it.  It is very pretty and  classy.  It is great for the cost!</li>
    <li> I love this hair adornment and the price is awesome. It&#x27;s a solid piece and its very pretty. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> -this clip is durable&lt;br /&gt;-it has a flat clip so its easy to slide into hair&lt;br /&gt;-its not made to hold a lot of hair though&lt;br /&gt;-medium to light hold</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sturdy enough to hold my thin shoulder length hair, any more then that then it would just have to be an accessory in the pictures. The colors are very vibrant and I was hoping they would be more muted, but still a cute piece.  Unsure of how long it will last but it seems sturdy enough for normal use.</li>
    <li> A sturdy hair clip with a beautiful peacock. Keeps me motivated for growing my hair out. Everybody notices it, too.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this arrived just a few days after placing the order as I thought it would take longer. It&#x27;s as pretty as it looks in the picture. My hair is super fine and the way this clip is made it actually holds when regular barettes fall right out.</li>
    <li> Better quality and color than i expected . Its really a beautiful hair clip.I have fine thin hair and it holds tight to a small piece of my hair. It came a week earlier than they said also. Great buy!</li>
    <li> The stones are pretty in this but one is barely inside the metal that is meant to surround it. It appears about to fall out. It took forever to get here and arrived weeks after Christmas. Would send it back but it is too much trouble and it was not expensive. I would skip this if I were you.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a bit of time, but it was coming from hong kong.. nice for the price we paid.  Would order again. Is worth the wait.  I would also recommend the matching braclet</li>
    <li> I love my hair clip, I get compliments every time I wear it.It is so pretty. I ordered my daughter one too and she love hers too. It came in fast after I ordered it, I had a good experience, I will buy from this seller again. Thank you very much.Sincerely, June Johnson</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t be mad. I paid less than 2 bucks for this clip. It&#x27;s pretty, for sure. But the stones were unevenly distributed so there&#x27;s clumps of red and blues, and I tried it on ONCE and already stones are popping off. I imagine I&#x27;ll spend more on the glue to fix them than I did on the clip itself. I wish it was sturdier. I do love the clip&#x27;s shape and design.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 13 year old for Easter.  She is going to enjoy it for sure.  Looks very well put together.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smallish -- though now misrepresented at all.  I have really curly hair and the little teeth on this kind of get caught up in my hair.  But, it works beautifully on my 9-year-old.  For the price, this was a great buy!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo224BUVZS87CZL]]It&#x27;s hard to believe that such an inexpensive item could be so elegant and pretty. The plastic gems look cheap, but the clip is a bargain. The assorted gems are randomly placed and vary per clip. The quality of the \\&quot;green\\&quot; gems seem to vary per clip as well. Mine look kind of brown, as the video shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair, and the clip has no problem holding it. However, I&#x27;d be gentle with the clip, as the construction doesn&#x27;t appear to be all that sturdy. There are eight teeth that are very useful for holding up hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, at one dollar a piece, I recommend this product wholeheartedly. Buy several-- your friends and family will be wanting their own!</li>
    <li> Affordable fashion that had multiple uses. I loved it. I was surprised at how accurate the piece looked in real life compared to the picture.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about buying from this seller due to the free shipping and next to nothing pricing; However I must say I was pleasantly suprised. Yes it did take almost a month to ship but I was well aware of this prior to purchasing. The quality of this hair clip is amazing.. It has a nice weight to it and the clip is very sturdy. Since price was so low I also decided to add two more to my order for gifts and lets just say they were very appreciated. Would love to buy more from this seller!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim and love it. Very colorful and really holds my shoulder length hair. Can be used casually or for dress up.</li>
    <li> THE JEWEL-LIKE DECORATIVE STYLE OF THIS CLIP IS NOT THE SAME AS IN THE ON-LINE PICTURES.....MUCH TOO ATTENTION GETTING THAN WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR ME... I WILL FIND SOMEONE TO GIVE IT TO WHO IS SUITABLE FOR ITS DESIGN//</li>
    <li> Is about 1/3 smaller than the one pictured.  Quality is still good and is affordably priced, just not as grand as the one they show.  Decent quality over all, but would be careful letting &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; child handle it, due to the &amp;#34;unknown&amp;#34; ingredients in these metals from China.  I import from there and know what might exist in &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; undeclared material.  I cleaned these with vinegar and treated the parts that are handled/rest against my wife&#x27;s head with clear nail polish.  An old trick to help ensure a little protection.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to receive this hair clip, and I honestly wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It&#x27;s a pretty hair clip that&#x27;s unique.  I will say that the colors aren&#x27;t exactly as depicted...instead of jewel tones, the stones are bright.  Also, I have thick hair, and the clip doesn&#x27;t always stay right where I put it.  But it came two weeks earlier then I anticipated and was a great price!  All in all, I&#x27;m a happy girl :]</li>
    <li> This was a sturdy clip and very beautiful! I have ordered the matching bracelets but, they haven&#x27;t arrived yet and it&#x27;s been a while. I hope they show up because the clip was impressive for the price!</li>
    <li> It is surprisingly more beautiful than the picture looks even here. I was extremely pleased and I think you will as well.</li>
    <li> Lovely Vintage Jewelry Crystal Peacock Hair Clip came early and it is beautiful, The clip doesn&#x27;t hurt or pinch my head.</li>
    <li> It is very pretty considering the price was so low.  Also it came in the mail fairly quickly.  All in all pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter, who has long dark hair, was very pleased at how it looked. It is made well and I am very glad I pruchased this item.</li>
    <li> Very cute hair clip.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a colorful and interesting look to their wardrobe.  It is also great for teens and some children, but I&#x27;d be careful if one of the pieces came off.</li>
    <li> I have the bracelet and the hair clip and they are so cute!!! The price is good but it going to take a while for the hair clip to arrive.</li>
    <li> I purchased two clips and they light weight and beautiful. I will purchase more  clips for my family and friends</li>
    <li> Not nearly as vibrant in color as the image inspiring the order.  Better to show larger picture and to confirm which colors are ordered.</li>
    <li> The pin is beautiful, well made and goes with a lot of outfits.  My daughter wears it often and loves it.</li>
    <li> I got a lot of compliments on this hair clip, it is shiny and grasps tight enough to hold thick hair or fine hair like mine. Quick delivery</li>
    <li> I think this is a great hair clip but it you have fine hair you may be disappointed since it is heavy.</li>
    <li> The teeth on it aren&#x27;t very strong, but it&#x27;s a sturdy clip for sure. It pulls slightly to one side with the clip, but not noticeable through the peacock.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as pictured. I was pleasantly surprised by its weight and sturdy-ness. I have natural kinky curly fine yet  A LOT of hair it kept my hair up and off my face all day and was comfortable. It also arrived 5 days earlier than stated. I would purchase from this buyer again and again.</li>
    <li> I got it a week earlier then it was expected to arrive. It&#x27;s so colorful (which is why I loved it to begin with). Only thing wrong with it is there are a few gems that look like they were glued on in a hurry, but overall it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Bought for $1.60 (free s&amp;H) so the construction isn&#x27;t the greatest on the one I received. When it closes it&#x27;s kind of &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but very pretty bright colors &amp; fully functional. Better than anything you could buy at the dollar store or anywhere for only 1.60. Arrived faster than I expected also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even sure when or where I&#x27;ll wear this, but it&#x27;s even prettier in person than in the picture.  It sparkles a lot, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll wear it on a fancy occasion.</li>
    <li> le recomiendo este producto a todos, excelente atencion por parte del vendedor y mucha rapidez al entregar el paquete. muy bien</li>
    <li> I guess I should have expected this for what I paid... It will still be a cute accent piece for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing i every day since it arrived I love it!!! It is incredible thanks for the great packing!!</li>
    <li> You never know when you order something what it will look like in person, but this clip is b very pretty</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what this was going to look like since it was so inexpensive, but I bought one anyways. The hair clip looks exactly like the picture, the colors are beautiful. I was presently surprised to see that the clip was large and very we&#x27;ll made. I love how it clips in my hair. So far, it&#x27;s really strong and allows me to style my hair in many different ways. If they had a variety of these clips, I&#x27;d buy them all. Since I love it so much I did buy a few more as gifts and an extra one for myself!</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL HAIR PIN.  IT ARRIVED ON TIME FOR CHRISTMAS GIVING, DAUGHTER VERY HAPPY TO RECEIVE IT.  EASY TO USE, LOOKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Great hair clip; holds my thick hair and hardly anything does!  Unfortunately one of the beads fell off but otherwise, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> My Tween loved it, but we bought it for her to give as a gift for Christmas and it didn&#x27;t come in time. Oh well, she is enjoying it instead.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the highest quality piece, but it&#x27;s PERFECT for the price. I receive compliments each time I wear this. It&#x27;s a beautiful piece.</li>
    <li> This is actually very pretty, and of great quality for the price.  My daughter really liked it, when I surprised her with it.  It makes a nice accent to pretty long hair.</li>
    <li> Great price for this hair clip. I use it all the time. I usually have trouble finding something that will hold my hair but this is PERFECT</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these as gifts and I loved how they were different (in color). Although I haven&#x27;t given them to the people I want to, I know they will love them. I love these clips even more in person. One clip had one jewel barely out of place but it&#x27;s hard to notice unless you point it out. Over all they are lovely items and I plan on ordering one for myself. Shipping was fast, my items estimated delivery date was January 21-Feburary 6 and my items arrived January 7.</li>
    <li> The colors of the gems are brighter than pictured. But the clip is much sturdier than I had anticipated for the low price.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be all around it&#x27;s a clip only one sided by very nice,, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but was pleased when it arrived when they said it would for the price it is an excellent buy and i like it alot. I would order again</li>
    <li> This hair clip is great ... its very pretty and sparkly! I just love it. Definitely brightens up my entire outfit :)</li>
    <li> I use this hair clip often and get compliments on it frequently. It is the perfect size to swoop up the front of my hair over my ear. The peacock design is very pretty and there are a lot of different colored \\&quot;jewels\\&quot; that help it coordinate with just about any outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  I bought several of these to add to gift baskets. Some of the \\&quot;jewels\\&quot; fell off before I even had the chance to give them as gifts. They are lightly glued on. Pretty easy to re-glue, and for the price, I&#x27;m not too upset about it. Also, the jewel colors are random, so they do not all look the same. Some are brighter than others.</li>
    <li> I just love this peacock clip. I wear it everywhere and get so many compliments on it. It&#x27;s so colorful and it goes with everything from jeans and a tshirt to a nice Sunday church dress. I can also style my hair in many different ways using this clip alone.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money. Very reasonable price for a nice hair clip. Easy to us, sturdy, hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair or caused any problems.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is worth the price! It is really cute and holds up well. What a great buy from something so cheap!</li>
    <li> For the price, these hairpeices were just ok.  I gave as cheap girl gifts for Christmas.  That&#x27;s about all they could be used for.</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail this morning. BEAUTIFUL piece to add to my jewelery. Everything was in tact. Came in in better shape than I thought it would. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rather pretty and not too big, like we were afraid it might be. It&#x27;s bead like stones are nice and shiny, mostly blue and red. It has little &#x27;teeth&#x27; that help keep it in place in your hair. My mom loses earrings and almost anything she puts in her ears or hair, but so far she hasn&#x27;t lost this and that says a lot for it. She&#x27;s very pleased with it and it adds that little bit of dressy.</li>
    <li> This clip is a good clip. It&#x27;s not super pretty like a little cheesey looking but not too bad. It gets the job done! I like it.</li>
    <li> Got this on sale for under $1, but have seen the same quality on sale at forever 21 for 10 bucks.  It is very nice to look at and provides a great pop of color. Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase for only $1.50! It really is a beautiful clip and the quality seems great for the price. The gems are very bright and the design on the bottom part of the clip is a nice detail. I wish it would be a bit larger, but it works. I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*  I&#x27;ve had this clip for over 10 months and none of the gems have fallen out and it still looks great!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping (few weeks before stated time) and really beautiful. Surprisingly, I do not find it cheap looking at all ... but I also have not worn it yet. I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> it is smaller than what picture shows and it looks very cheap (as it is)... I am not sure if i will use it...</li>
    <li> My clip doesn&#x27;t look as cute as it does here.  But that&#x27;s ok, I like it anyway.  It did take some time to get to me.</li>
    <li> this peacock is a cute hair clip. it has beautiful colors. I gave this as a gift to someone who loves peacocks.</li>
    <li> it looks wonderful on my hair. its lightweight and pretty and is bang for the buck I totally love how fancy this clip looks in my hair.</li>
    <li> it came completelly broken .....bad because it was cute .it was a gift from my husband:-( i dont recomend this one..i dont know if i can use it</li>
    <li> This is unusual and versatile.  It looks a lot pricier than it is.  I&#x27;m adding it to my gift giving stash.</li>
    <li> It is very pretty and stays in my hair fairly well. The picture is not as accurate with the coloring but it is still nice. Mine has a mainly red jewels in it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim, not expecting much, but when it arrived (and quickly too), I was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s a good size, not too lightweight, where you can tell it&#x27;s not cheap, and the quality is extremely nice. My favorite part about this clip is how it clips onto your hair...and stays! No matter where you clip it, it stays and looks good! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than I thought, just in time for my mom&#x27;s birthday! She absolutely loved it! Definitely a worthy purchase for any girl who loves sparkles!</li>
    <li> I love this colorful peacock hair clip. It is too cute!It measures about 3.5&amp;#34;. I decided to get some more!</li>
    <li> this clip does not look like the picture. the clip i received is not colorful like the one in the ad, in the ad the wings of the peacock are different colors but mine is filled with clear stones with 1 orange stone and 2 blue stones awkwardly placed. this clip looks so pretty in the model&#x27;s hair because its very colorful but the one i got is ugly because its filled with clear stones! i know it was only a dollar but i just want to let people know that whoever makes these clips makes them randomly and you might get a clip with no colored stones or you may get one like they sent me.</li>
    <li> This was a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; item offered by Amazon. It was my second and last time purchasing a filler item. The low prices are tempting, but the quality of this and the other item (imitation &amp;#34;flipflop&amp;#34; brand solar item) was horrible. As I had mentioned in my previous review, this is a way for Amazon and the vendors to get rid of their overstock, low-quality stuff.</li>
    <li> The colors are a lot more vibrant than in the picture so it takes away from the &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; look. Easy to put on and take off. cute for everyday use and so far it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart.</li>
    <li> Item was not anything close to picture. Cheap and ugly. Bought for my niece and would not give it to her!</li>
    <li> If you bought this then you know that the shipping takes forever,but it is understandable due to the price which by the way is a really a amazing deal.This pin is not no crappy dollor tree clip it seems like it&#x27;s from Claire&#x27;s store for it is really pretty and great quality.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of these to give as gifts, as well as keep one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Friends love them!&lt;br /&gt;They are great with fine hair, although the clasp doesn&#x27;t bend around a clump of thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;gems&#x27; look wonderful and are great for that summer &amp;#34;Do&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> i wondered how it would be when i ordered this clip .. and it turned out to be amazing ...fits my hair absolutely prefect.. worthy to buy .</li>
    <li> Ordered several of these hair clips.  Packaged neatly and were nice looking.  Material were thinner than expected, but colore vibrant and will look beautiful when worn.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> I am astonished at just how pretty this little hair clip is.  The details are exquisite.  It isn&#x27;t the most expensive, but that&#x27;s what makes it such a rare find.  The photos do no justice for this clip. I recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair clip because it seemed a little different. I figured since it was only $1with free shipping that if I didn&#x27;t like it I wasn&#x27;t out much. It said shipping could take awhile since it was coming from Hong Kong, but it came alot sooner than I expected. The colors were a little brighter than I expected, but is still cute. I have very thick hair and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling out. Great deal for $1, even better deal now that the price has went down even further!</li>
    <li> i have received many compliments on this necklace. its really cheap and takes a little time to come in the mail, but its worth it for just a little something extra to an outfit. love it.</li>
    <li> i like the head pice because its pretty and sweet it play with a girls fiminety i would recemond this to any one who wants something different</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so cheap, that I thought, &amp;#34; this is going to be a pig in a poke, but for the price, why not?&amp;#34; Actually, it is a great little clip and I enjoy wearing it al the time. I ordered some other pieces from the same site since I bought this.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Not only did it come about 2 weeks early but it was safe in its wrapping.  The product is a great size and the colors are beautiful.  I have very thick red hair and not only did it STAY in my hair but it was not wobbly.  I would recommend this product to anyone who would listen.  It is a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I love this clip so much, I bought a second one, however that one was delivered missing a gem! Win some you lose some, but you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> My daughter saw it and immediately thought she had to have it.  It is well made and at a great price.</li>
    <li> it was so cute and looks so nice in my hair .and it was a great price ,love it. would order from them again</li>
    <li> I wear my part on my right side so I have to pull my hair back on the left.  I have to pin the peacock in my hair upside down.  If it was the opposite side, it would be right side up.</li>
    <li> The item itself is very beautiful and made of a nice metal. I thought this was going to be cheap plastic, so this was a nice surprise. My bad rating is because it came in damaged. Two stones were off and just in the baggy. I will try to glue them on because the item is beautiful, but I&#x27;m upset that they sent this while damaged.</li>
    <li> It was a Great price for unique clip. Love it but does not hold thick hair well. It is a great accessory</li>
    <li> Cute and sturdy enough for the price. I bought bunches of these cheap things on Amazon. Some of the items (hair clip and some necklaces) are going into stockings as cutsie, costume jewelry, others are being turned into unique Christmas ornaments for baskets given out to teachers, co-workers and family. Very pleased with this purchase. And it says four weeks for delivery, most arrived between 10 and 20 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so surprised by the quality of all these under a dollar hair and jewelry pieces on Amazon.  This clip is very cute, and the quality really isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
    <li> As  far as hair accessories.  go, this pin is as pretty as the picture.  very  nice and  affordable.  received it right away !</li>
    <li> It broke before I could even put it in my hair! Cheap made. Cost to much to send it back or I would have.</li>
    <li> Sooo cute! I wear almost every day. A couple of the tiny jewels were missing, but they&#x27;re so small you can&#x27;t even really tell. Plus, it&#x27;s under a dollar, can you really complain? Shipping was quick for me, although they&#x27;re coming from far so it wouldn&#x27;t have been surprising if it took long, especially with free shipping.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, excellent quality and works with my really thick hair, which a lot of clips don&#x27;t. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This hair clip was SO incredibly inexpensive, and it&#x27;s gorgeous.  Shipping takes quite some time, but if you&#x27;re not in a hurry, I really recommend this item.  It seems to be well made and the colors are very nice.  I&#x27;ve worn it several times and think it is a great size.</li>
    <li> Good. Nice. Okay. Alright. As expected. In one piece. Nifty. Shiny. A-ok. Acceptable. Satisfactory. Valuable. Favorable. Neat. Pleasant. Agreeable. Commendable.</li>
    <li> I bought is for my mom, who loved it. The colors are slightly brighter than in the picture. It worked well in my hair, which is fairly thick, but it could not hold all of my mom&#x27;s hair, which is super thick and coarse. However, it works well for other styles.</li>
    <li> I bought for myself but when it got here my daughter feel in love with it if she don&#x27;t use it then I do heavy duty cause she has not manage to break it</li>
    <li> Very cute and reasonable! I wear it often. It is great quality for the price. It matches many items in my closet.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is very sturdy and works really well. For the price - and free shipping - it is more than worth it. It is very pretty.</li>
    <li> I bought 6 of these as gifts for friends and coworkers and they just loved them.  A rather unusual item that is not found in stores but all the same is quite nice looking.  I am told that they hold the hair rather nicely and also versatile.  For the price, you really cant go wrong and they are unusual enough that I doubt you will ever see its  like worn by anyone else.  Lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Shipping time was ridiculous. I ordered this on December 21, 2012. The item was just received second week of February, 2013. That&#x27;s a bit long to have to wait on an item that cost $1.45&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my time delay and shipping complaint. The item, however, was fairly nice. Heavier than I expected and was&lt;br /&gt;not made from cheap plastic. Sturdy clip to hold on to hair. I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> The hair clip doesn&#x27;t really hold your hair, and falls out really easily. Not really worth buying, it would be better if it was a rubber band with the peacock,</li>
    <li> This looks very lovely and is extremely beautiful even my grandma loved it so much that I gave it to her as a gift</li>
    <li> This beautiful hair clip held fine hair and thick hair.  Pretty to look at and lots compliments from ladies and men!  I am buying more to give as gifts!</li>
    <li> Heavy weight clip with beautiful colors. Love this and so many uses besides in my hair.  Colors make it easy to pair with outfits - happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful hair clip.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  Product took a few weeks to arrive - worth waiting for.</li>
    <li> I love this clip so much, it works great for my thick hair,the only down side is that it is not as big as it is in the picture other then that i love it, i have boughten more stuff from this seller. Also it got here quicker then it said it would.</li>
    <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t regret buying this. It is quite pretty. It is cheaply made, but it was cheap to buy. It will give me some fun while it lasts!!! :)</li>
    <li> With this stuff from overseas, you never know what you are going to get, but for the price, this one is good quality so I would purchase again.  I also bought the matching bracelet and am happy with both items!</li>
    <li> My 16 year old loves to wear this clip. It looks great for just costing a couple of bucks. Very sophisticated.</li>
    <li> I bought these to wear in my hair for my son&#x27;s wedding.  The as pretty if not prettier than they are in the picture.  They are light weight and don&#x27;t slide out of my hair.  I would recommend them for anyone looking for a special hair decoration for a special event.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift. I plan to deliver it in summer.  I think my friend will love it.</li>
    <li> This clip looks just like the picture. It&#x27;s very pretty &amp; stays in well. The clip part does not have &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; so it does not pull at the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like a vintage piece for a bargain price.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice item.  I wouldn&#x27;t find anything like this around here.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for alot of different outfits for so many different colors in it.</li>
    <li> my favorite hair clip!  I get compliments every time I wear it!  I am going to have to order a few extras!  They do take a while to ship as they are overseas.  But great product!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much, I would recommend to all buy this stuff, you Will not regret.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is awesome! Definitely recommend! It stays in place and doesnt clamp too toght! Very chic! Goes with almost everything!</li>
    <li> Looks great in my hair. But has a strange metal smell that&#x27;s quite strong, I hope it&#x27;s nothing harmful. Anyway before I realized this I ordered 2 more. One of the rhinestones were slightly crooked no two pins are alike in stone pattern! That is what I love about it. I have not been able to find anything like this in stores. I like things that are rare. Anyway I spent some time trying to figure out where the smell was coming from. I smelled the clips and there it was. I washed my hands afterwards. So just to be safe wash hands after each use at the end of the day or carry hand Purell anti-bacterial wipes should have to to adjust your clip when you are out.</li>
    <li> I thought that it was very pretty. It didn&#x27;t look cheap, worth the price that I paid for it. .</li>
    <li> This will be given to a young lady for Christmas. She has long hair so I am posistive she will be the talk of the class when she wears it to school.</li>
    <li> The hair clip is very pretty and will make a great gift for Christmas. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered and was very pleased when I got it. I bought this because of the price for preteen girls for gifts.</li>
    <li> I loved it super cute.. thank you. Delivering was a little bit long or it was maybe just be that I was so anxious for it to arrive..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;greetings from south california..</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim- the price made me feel like if I didn&#x27;t like it I wouldn&#x27;t feel bad about tossing it.  I WAS SO WRONG! This hair clip is AMAZING.  I have really thick hair and I can actually pull my hair up with it.  The colors are awesome and its an inexpensive piece that dresses up any look.</li>
    <li> This really is a gorgeous hair piece! No it&#x27;s not heavy in weight, but you don&#x27;t want clip to be so heavy to weigh the hair down and then slip out. I have had that happen before. I love it, it came exactly as it looks.</li>
    <li> These are great for gifts. I am giving them to my kids as a gift for Christmas. Can not bet this deal.</li>
    <li> It is lovely but missing a jewel so Im not happy. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift but now I dont want to give it.</li>
    <li> the stones were such a vivid color, cant wait to wear it. so colorful it will match any outfit i wear</li>
    <li> This clip is worth the price, plus some. I have very thick hair, and have found that most clips either break or do not come close to holding up even small sections of hair. This one does the trick, and is very stunning. The price is well under what could be asked for, due to the quality. Shipping was rather slow, since it is shipped from overseas. I did not drop the rating, since they make you well aware of the shipping time when you order.</li>
    <li> Item was not beautiful in person. Picture made it look alot prettier. The stones also look like they kind of hang in the picture.  But the dont, they are all on firm piece that goes only on a little bit of hair.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and well crafted. Will make a great Christmas gift. My daughter will love it as well as my daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> This clip was really beautiful! Looks just like the picture and for the price was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product. It broke the end off as I was taking it out of the package, then a rhinestone fell off.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. The clip is a little weird to put in your hair because of the placement of the bird n spring but very pretty and i am happy with my purchase. It is hard plastic from what i can tell so no heavy duty holding but worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are really nice quality. Very pleased with the purchase. Heavy and sturdy material. Very pretty. Gave to several family members for gifts.</li>
    <li> it has been well over a month and i still have not received this product.  i put one star just to be able to write this.  who can i contact about this?</li>
    <li> This is really cute. I love all the colors that is in this hair clip. I always have my hair up during the summer and am looking forward to using this.</li>
    <li> We werent sure exactly what size the clip would be and it is the perfect size for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> The hair clip was more than i expected. Does the job and for my hair being thin, it works! I loved it that much that i bought another one of a different color.</li>
    <li> Adorable.  Not too big. I ordered 2 and have not had any problems.  For this price, if you are looking for a little accent to a bun or ponytail, this is a great option.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old loves this - looks much too young for an adult, and the peacock is a strange shape. But the feathers and the gems are pretty.</li>
    <li> Very good. I like it.........  I love it. I want more lovely  vintage jewelry crystal peacock hair clip.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Item was shipped 12/2 per email.  NOT received yet.  Must have been sent by a relay of slow carrier pigeons.  if I do not receive it within a week I WILL dispute the charge to my credit card.</li>
    <li> I like my hair clip. It is smaller than I thought, but it&#x27;s really cute. I like the colors and the way it holds my hair! It was a good buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. The colors of the beads are very different than pictured... a LOT more of the blue/turquoise, which I never would have bought.  It LOOKS like we paid about $2.00 for it.  I regret buying it and would never give it as a gift.  A goodwill donation probably.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this item. It was very inexpensive so I didnt expect much but to my surprise it is a beautiful piece! Ive worn it in my hair. It keeps my thick hair pinned back and stays. I would reccomend this to anyone who asks! Semi fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This clip is cute...really cute! The actual clip that holds your hair is very sturdy, and the way it is slanted, it holds in your hair really well, no matter what you want to do with it in your hair. I was sad that one of the little crystals was missing when I finally received the clip, but i don&#x27;t mind because  the clip works so well.</li>
    <li> very pretty just love it.&lt;br /&gt;colors great&lt;br /&gt;looks good&lt;br /&gt;very pretty&lt;br /&gt;great handwork&lt;br /&gt;looks good in hair&lt;br /&gt;happy&lt;br /&gt;happy&lt;br /&gt;happy</li>
    <li> I got it in good condition. looks as it is in the pictures. the jewls are pretty and it clips nicely in my hair. took long to get here, seems it came from asia as my package has shown.</li>
    <li> Wow- Surprised again.  While this took a long time to get to me, it is very lovely.  In fact, almost too fancy to wear for every day.  The clip itself is very large and strong.  The item is well made and the design is very nice and stylish.  This item is suitable for regular use without the fear that it will fall apart any minute.  I think it would make a  nice gift too.</li>
    <li> I have order 5 of these so far. I love them. They are great quality for the low price. I have given a few out a gifts. I always get compliments of it.</li>
    <li> I Love this clip. Its Beautiful. And my Holds hair very well. It was Shipped a lot faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> NICE SIZE.GREAT CLIP.WILL STAY IN FINE HAIR OR THE THICKEST HAIR.AMAZING BUY..GET MANT AND KEEP IN YOUR GIFTS BOX.MATCHES THE BRACELET PERFECT.</li>
    <li> I thought it would take several weeks for this to arrive and it showed up in a week.&lt;br /&gt;So pretty.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is great for those days when you&#x27;re in a rush and just want to pick up your hair. (:&lt;br /&gt;Goes with just about anything you wear since it&#x27;s very colorful.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, my daughter kind of took it from me because she liked it so much. i i i i i</li>
    <li> Its really cute, but lots smaller than I though it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of complaints about it breaking, but keep in mind for less than $2, you should treat it very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;Really impressed its holding up my hair very well. My hair is on the fine side, but this little clip is doing a nice job.</li>
    <li> This clip is exactly the same quality as other more expensive clips I buy in the stores for $8-$10. Its vibrant and sturdy and holds well in my hair.Its great for the price! The only downside was the slow shipping but again its understandable at that price.</li>
    <li> Great item for the price! I thought because it was so cheap that it would be cheap looking but it isn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Price was great, lovely piece, different from most hair accessories, lots of compliments! Me and my teen love to wear it</li>
    <li> Very pretty items but more for show. I have thick hair and had trouble with it supporting the weight of my hair.</li>
    <li> Shipping took forever on this item!!!! but for the price it was worth it, cute little hair accessory, i haven&#x27;t had any of the jewels fall out yet so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> I received this and was surprised it was prettier than I expected, wish I had gotten 2,I recommend this one</li>
    <li> I received my hairclip in the mail yesterday, and wow, I was really surprised.  It is gorgeous.  The picture really does not do it justice.  The beads are bright and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I have my hair up in a french twist with this clip alongside the twist, and I have received multiple compliments on it.  I was really blown away by the beauty of such a low-cost item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few reviewers here have stated that their clip broke.  If that happens to me, I&#x27;ll remove the peacock design and re-glue to one of my own clips.  This design is worth saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for $1.50, but now I see the price has dropped (today&#x27;s price is $1.13).  I&#x27;m going to order 4 more of these for my nieces and great-nieces.  It&#x27;s truly a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:  This item is offered by several different sellers.  I purchased from Bonamart and received my item in about 3 weeks, as described.</li>
    <li> This is very pretty but the colors are brighter than I expected so it doesn&#x27;t look as vintage as I expected. But, the underside is also very pretty, which I like. I haven&#x27;t actually used it at all yet and have had it such a short time I can&#x27;t say how well the stones stay in.</li>
    <li> This clip is awesome. I have really long hair and it keeps my hair up with out any fuss. It&#x27;s a great price and it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
    <li> This product was sent to me in a very timely manner. Actually I am not using it as a hair clip. I cut off the little prongs on it and attached a pin to it. It makes a wonderful brooch. I&#x27;ve had quite a few compliments on it!</li>
    <li> Or I should say, my 6 yr old grandaughter loves it. So if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy. She wears it all the time.</li>
    <li> one word \\&quot; CUTE \\&quot; this thing is exactly like wat is shown on the picture. it is so cute on wat ever hairstyle you do. this makes you more cuter! i love it.</li>
    <li> I love this clip. Its a small one, so dont expect too much. My hair is mid back and it holds it well for a while then needs adjusting. Very pretty though and cant beat the price!</li>
    <li> Like many others, I was expecting something that went with the cheap price but I was pleasantly surprised. The jewels in the tail are shiny and sparkly, even after being shipped from Hong Kong. It was a lot sturdier than I thought that it would be and I just love it. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and like to wear it &amp;#34;up&amp;#34;, this makes a great addition to my collection of unique decorations for my hair.</li>
    <li> beautiful, high quality and ridiculously cheap PLUS free shipping! I was stunned. I just wore it today and got so many compliments!!</li>
    <li> Great hair clip for the money. Strong, sturdy and clips to thin hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;I have received so many complements on it.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected. The jewels look cheap in person, but I admire the clip regardless, and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my teen daughter who  liked it very much&lt;br /&gt;I also think I will borrow it from time to time as it is cute.</li>
    <li> I love this clip! It wasn&#x27;t expensive, is super cute, holds hair well, and has cute colors. I should have ordered a couple more for gifts.</li>
    <li> Love it Love it it holds my hair perfectly the colors are beautiful and this clip is so well made</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase! It wasn&#x27;t broken, like some people got it, and I don&#x27;t think the stones are too bright. It&#x27;s a great product and it seems very sturdy. And hey...it was like 99 cents.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty clip.  It was cheap so i did not expect it to be great quality.  However i was pleasantly suprised.  It seems like it is sturdy, and it looks great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this just sort of offhand, thinking- hey, why not? And I was pleasantly surprised when I got it. It is definitely cute. The shipping takes a little long- so long, I forgot I had ordered it. But worth it when you open the package and see all the little jewels winking at you.</li>
    <li> now this I got my money&#x27;s worth this is very pretty I&#x27;m giving it to my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day a little surprise you cannot find anything quality like that in the store for that price</li>
    <li> It really is so lovely. I was not expecting that from the price at all. Shipping didn&#x27;t take crazy long, either. Only a few days longer than my prime orders. Mine looks very true to the picture.</li>
    <li> Lovely piece, I use is often. Since it was only about $1.10, why not? I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The colors are very pretty, the clip is easy to put in your hair and take out without tangles. One of my favorites actually.</li>
    <li> when i received this in the mail i did NOT expect to be able to use it alone and it hold my hair but it does! one of the gems fell out but i glued it back in.</li>
    <li> This is much, much better than I expected, considering the price.  Go for it!  If your hair is very thin, though, this may well slide right out.</li>
    <li> The hair clip is beautiful and worth way more than what the seller is charging. I received the item two weeks before my estimated arrival date. The hair clip is cute and goes with almost anything,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great costume piece. The colors are quite bold and bright. Not subdued or jewel toned like the pic but still a great hair piece and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> It really does look pretty but o think only you&#x27;ll be able to tell it made if cheap medal. It&#x27;s not very sparkly. But is it colorful.</li>
    <li> The colors of the faux jewels are much brighter and gaudy in real life than in this picture.  I loved the subdued colors in the piece in this picture.  If only I got the same thing.</li>
    <li> I like it. Awesome quality. :DDD  it&#x27;s beautiful when it is on ur hair. Good price ;) I recommend u to try it</li>
    <li> I completely ordered this on a lark as a gift.  It is a wonderfully fun piece.  If I had really long hair I would order one for myself.</li>
    <li> this is a beautiful clip! I have not worn it yet but I have clipped it in my hair and it is easy to attach.</li>
    <li> Was very pretty, was actually heavier than I thought it would be... I will be wearing it when my hair is up</li>
    <li> Looking at the picture, I thought this would be very pretty. But when I received it, the color of these small decoratives are so ugly. I am not going to wear it.</li>
    <li> I got the matching bracelet. This hair clip is very nice!! I love the way it looks. Very bright and colorful</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect as they only cost a buck but they very good quality. I bought 5 and might even buy more. I would recommend these to anyone! Also they came in only 12 days.</li>
    <li> Nice colors on the Peacock hair clip. Really compliments any hair style and color and well worth the price. GREAT</li>
    <li> Great Value. Love the beautiful hair clip so much I bought more and gave them as gifts, everyone loved them.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with a matching bracelet.  The value can&#x27;t be beat and it is a pretty set.  It is a hair clip for decoration only but it is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The price is good, but you get what you pay for.  The stones are so rainbow bright, which makes it look very cheap,not like in the picture, haven&#x27;t worn it.  I will probably find a 1st grade girl to give this to.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for what you pay for i&#x27;m so happy with my purches!!!very cute i would recommend this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten eight separate compliments when I&#x27;ve worn this clip out. It&#x27;s adorable, and it&#x27;s only a dollar, I just ordered another one as a gift for my friend, seriously.</li>
    <li> This is really cute!  It holds in my hair well and can be used for casual or formal events.  I love it!</li>
    <li> One of the jewels became unattached in transit, but a little dab of super glue will fix that.  It&#x27;s a lovely hair clip and will work well even in hair that has a hard time supporting hair clips.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the hair clip for my wife and later found out it was just a plastic head band. Rip off!</li>
    <li> One day I would like someone to explain to me how someone can pay for the components of this hair clip, pay the labor to assemble it, pay to package it, ship it to the USA from Hong Kong, and have enough money left over for there to be profit for the manufacturer and the seller while selling it for 95 cents! And I didn&#x27;t even mention Amazon&#x27;s cut! Really, it&#x27;s mind-boggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the hair clip.... I think it would be terrific at ten times the price. It is just... cool. What more can I say? I liked it so much when I saw it, especially at the price, that I bought one for my wife, both my female employees, then sent one to my daughter. And they all genuinely loved it. (Well, you never know if employees are just kissing up...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the case of most things like this, what you see is what you get. Does it look like something you&#x27;ll like? You&#x27;ll like. Not? Not.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair clip, but delicate or not glued securely...missing a crystal after 1 wear!&lt;br /&gt;Considering a replacement, but the jury is still out!</li>
    <li> I love peacocks and this is so colorful and beautiful! It goes with a little bit of everything. It will bend if too much force is applied but its still pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip. It took a while for it to get here, but the wait was worth it. Its not as rustic as the word vintage, but it is still beautiful. I plan on wearing it tomorrow :)</li>
    <li> I love it, very nice item and holds the hair very well.  Well made item, will recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this clip! It&#x27;s so cute and colorful. It doesn&#x27;t have that cheap &amp;#34;dollar store&amp;#34; look either. Appropriate for women of all ages too! I will be buying some more for friends and family, they will make great gifts. :)</li>
    <li> This item is adorable!!!! It is well made, the clip is huge and can handle thick hair. Well worth the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I love peacocks and this looks great in my hair above the twist.  I have had so many great compliments!</li>
    <li> Got it forms 13 year old granddaughter.  She has long red hair and loves to pulpit back with a clip.</li>
    <li> For one you can&#x27;t beat the price, less then a buck with free shipping?! Yes please! The clip came pretty fast and it is really good quality. None of my gems were missing and so far it has held up very well. I&#x27;ts a good size and just a really nice beautiful looking piece for a great price. I&#x27;ve had many compliments on it and multiple friends have ordered one for themselves!</li>
    <li> I really like this colorful hair clip. It has a lot of different colors for the tail and the price was under $1. How can you go wrong for that price? The shipping was also FREE! It also holds your hair very well in place. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this peacock hair clip it is absolutely adorable and is very easy to use and has very nice quality</li>
    <li> the clip is ok , my 2 main complaints, first the colors are much brighter than shown and I like the more muted color pleat, also the beak was broken when I received it, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain to much. the picture is not what the same as the actual item</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty clip and looks lovely on my mother&#x27;s hair. She loved all the colors and the details of the peacock.</li>
    <li> I got it and a moment after I opened the package one of the colored pieces fell off, I put it in my hair regardless and it did look nice. Later when I got back home I lightly tossed it on a shelf- seriously maybe 1 inch in the air, completely gentle little toss (felt like a lie to say I placed it), and another colored piece fell off. Sure I probably should have more careful but this thing is just poorly made and feels incredibly cheap- because it is. I might take a glue gun to it but it&#x27;s probably not worth it since it will just fall to pieces again anyhow. I&#x27;d keep looking for some other jewelry if I were you.</li>
    <li> I wanted some clips for my daughter. Took a while to come, but was it was worth the wait. The cost is so cheap that it is worth the wait. Nice looking.</li>
    <li> This was a whimsical hair clip that matched the earrings I bought (also peacock design).  It takes awhile for them to get here, but the quality is good, and the price and cost of shipping can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, it&#x27;s not as big as I thought, but still just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would get more from this Supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping</li>
    <li> The clip arrived as described. the only problem was that it had a break in it, almost instantly, though its not the worst break, just gets caught in my hair. It is super cute though.</li>
    <li> How was this only like a dollar? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s freakin&#x27; amazing. The gems are super cute. The clip is sturdy. I&#x27;m in shock I paid so little for it. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disapointed with this product because it is too small and some of the little pieces where broken, and it took so long to arrive...&lt;br /&gt;Este broche esta muy peque&amp;ntilde;o y algunas de las piedras estaban quebradas o despegadas... y por si fuera poco tardo mucho en llegar&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure that I would find something better at dollar tree&lt;br /&gt;Estoy totalmente segura que me hubiera encontrado algo mejor en la dollar tree</li>
    <li> My hair is really thin and I have a hard time getting hair accessories to stay in; but, I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. A nice product for an exceptional price. Better quality than what I thought for being under a dollar!</li>
    <li> This is a very colorful, attractive and usual hair ornament that can be worn casual or dressed up.  Everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> This is just a vintage rainbow of colors for your hair. Very light and easy to wear. My friends all want one now.</li>
    <li> Got this much faster than predicted (ordered 4/15, received 4/23). Nothing broken and all the stones are in place.  Just be aware that this is for decoration and the spring clamp isn&#x27;t tight enough to actually hold a lot of hair in place.  The other thing I didn&#x27;t realize is that the stones would be different colors than the ones shown in the vendor&#x27;s photo.  Mine were mostly red and aqua with a few olive greens thrown in - it really isn&#x27;t a pleasing color combination to me.  Also, the finish on mine is a \\&quot;brushed\\&quot; finish rather than the satin finish in the photo.  Overall, it&#x27;s quite festive and would be nice for holiday or party wear, but the colors are too gaudy for everyday office wear, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This hair pin is exactly as pictured, great colors and very sturdy quality.  I&#x27;ve worn it a few times and it is holding up well.  Great buy especially considering the price.</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful. Hopefully it&#x27;s not lead based, I have no idea if it is...gulp! I wished it said lead free and I think I would give it 5stars.</li>
    <li> it looks so nice and i like it as hair accessory... but the quality was not good and it was broke after few time wearing it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair clip! It is beautiful and has a pretty decent hold. The actual clip it self is similar to an alligator clip. The whole piece is bigger than I thought it would be, and looks great. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I did not have high hope for this hair clip. Indeed, I totally forgot I ordered it. Come on, it is only $2. WEll it delivered in good condition. It looks nice and elegant and really easy to pair with office outfits. CAn&#x27;t ask for more ~ I am considering buy another one just in case.</li>
    <li> I like the clip and the way it clips.  Found that didn&#x27;t met my expectations only by how much hair it does&#x27;t hold, This clip is great if for those that use it only for decorative and hold onto a little hair: for that purpose I would give it 5 stars.  My purpose is to actually hold hair like a barrette.</li>
    <li> This is fun little piece and goes with any color.&lt;br /&gt;I am out of words and think that it is silly to require more!</li>
    <li> The colors of the jems are very nice. the quality seem really good for the price. though it was smaller than expected. In total i really like it i am a red head and i have got a lot of compliments. I recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this!! Pretty much goes with anything and perfect for any occasion. Looks better in person than in photo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sparkly. I has a sturdy clip, I was afraid it would be cheap looking or cheaply made and it&#x27;s not</li>
    <li> Strong enough to hold a bun in place (I have very long, waist length hair) , small enough to be pretty and not gaudy.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3 and all 3 are in working order and don&#x27;t look cheap or plasticky. It&#x27;s metal and looks like vintage brass, very light weight though.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone that has seen it has liked it.</li>
    <li> Peacock hair clip is beautiful! Put my hair into a bun and clip that peacock&lt;br /&gt;hair clip in and it looks perfect. Got many compliments on it. Great price as well!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This actually adds a lot of class to simple up-dos. I get compliments all the time. It is not built cheap at all.</li>
    <li> Not hat the piece *itself* was broken, but whatever they used to affix the plastic gems was crap, and half of them fell off.</li>
    <li> Looks lovely and meet and exceeded my expectations.  Was a gift and was well received and that made me feel good.</li>
    <li> These clips are beutiful with nice colors, sure to match a lot. They are a little on the small side.</li>
    <li> Very well made; didn&#x27;t fall apart after first use, nothing has fallen out/off. I would buy this product again. Sturdy and pretty.</li>
    <li> They took a while to arrive, but I think that&#x27;s a given that they&#x27;re coming from so far away.  What a fantastic purchase. I bought these and the other set that&#x27;s listed on the page.  Beautiful, functional and heavy.  Not cheap plastic parts, but heavy metals and glass gems.  What a beautiful surprising purchase.  Will definitely buy from these guys again!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that the colors are MUCH brighter than they appear in the image provided. Not thrilled with that, but otherwise it&#x27;s as I expected.</li>
    <li> Its a little brighter than whats in the picture but considering I got it for a dollar and free shipping :-D&lt;br /&gt;Its actually pretty well made! no plastic</li>
    <li> For the price I paid for it I didn&#x27;t care what it looked like but I am happy with it</li>
    <li> I love the look of this and I have worn it a few times now even though the peacock head came off when I first put it in. It is also very heavy so I dont think it would stay in thin hair very well.</li>
    <li> Pretty, eye catching, and attractive, but offers no support for my hair - won&#x27;t even hold back my bangs (I have super thick hair). However, it does stay in place if attached to an already established bun or twist. A friend has pretty thin hair and it works great for her.</li>
    <li> I only payed 91 cents. The product came from another county so shipping a while. It doesn&#x27;t look that fancy and i am happy i only paid that small of a price. It is nice for a young child, so i would recommend it fir them,</li>
    <li> Prompt shipment but it was missing a stone...but its in the middle of the piece so you can&#x27;t tell....still had many compliments when I wore it</li>
    <li> It arrived much earlier than I expected, and it looks just like the picture! It is perfect! I love it!</li>
    <li> I got my package today and I got so excited the clip was in a normal bubble wrap envelope. When I opened the envelope I saw beautiful colors and nice size but upon a closer look I realized that the tip of the clip had broke off. I can still use the clip but it makes it 10x&#x27;s harder to place in my hair since the clip likes to snag on my hair. I tried to super glue it back together, which I thought would work great but the little piece that broke off ended up lost in my hair, and now I can&#x27;t find it at all once I removed it from my hair. So yea please consider using a thicker bubble envelope or wrap it in some extra bubble wrap because that just sucks, $.91 is an awesome deal but I did expect it to not break while being shipped.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, so I was surprised.  The metal clip part seems well made, and heavier gauge than a lot of cheapos from the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter will love it!</li>
    <li> I love this clip. It has strength for the hair and it matches the bracelet so great.  It came exactly as described and faster than expected shipping.  I would have rated it higher except that one of the &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; fell out while it was being worn so it is lost and it is shaped so it&#x27;s not like it can be replaced easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy from this seller again.  They&#x27;re great and we love their products and free shipping!!!</li>
    <li> I like it, product just as what I expected. Haven&#x27;t worn it yet but it looks like it wil last a few months.</li>
    <li> Luv!&lt;br /&gt;Looks just like picture. Shipped fast! Very cheap price but doesn&#x27;t look cheap! It holds my hair in place. Very pretty.</li>
    <li> Loves these clips! I ordered two and both arrived in perfect condition weeks before estimated. The clips have slightly different color patterns which is to be expected, and in fact makes them more original. I an incredibly happy  with my purchase and plan on ordering a few more. For this price you cant go wrong! I&#x27;ve seen similar items at PIer 1 for 12- 20$!</li>
    <li> I love vintage jewelry, but this item does not hold hair, it looks pretty....but will not stay in at all</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, but it&#x27;s a little too heavy and big.  I have very thin hair, so it looks a little weird when I have straight hair.  Other than that, I really enjoy it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous. Quality is good. Not bulky at all. Arrived on time. Nothing to complain. It should worth more than a dollar for sure, esp. with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I received this item quickly and in very nice packaging. It is very colorful and I wore it to work my first day of having it. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a hair clip that is colorful and durable.</li>
    <li> Bought this to go along with my gift bag, for my best friend. I love this clip. It&#x27;s just gorgeous and really catches your eyes. It&#x27;s a bit heavy but with all those faux gems, it would be.</li>
    <li> It got here super fast, and it is really pretty! I love this product, it doesn&#x27;t slide out of my hair, it is perfect!</li>
    <li> It seems like it&#x27;s rather hit or miss with this barrette. Mine was a miss... A few of the jewels were missing upon arrival, making the piece look a little cheap. I&#x27;m crafty enough to fix the missing jewels, but I&#x27;ll probably spend more on filling the holes than I did on the whole clip...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the missing jewels, this is a really lovely hair ornament.</li>
    <li> i bought these for me. my daughters liked them so much they took them. nice way to add style on a tight budget. fast shipping  thank you</li>
    <li> for the money it was great but the jewels keep falling off and have to be re glued.  Byt for the price it is a great product.</li>
    <li> The hairclip is really cute and i love how it clips into your hair for a great hold. great gift</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I got the product.  As the saying goes you get what you pay for.  The peacock was too bright in color and definitely does NOT look vintage.  If the seller was local I would return the product but for the price I would keep it and use it whenever.</li>
    <li> Its cute and durable enough to use on thick hair to keep up with just the clip alone, or use it for head decoration...which ever works.</li>
    <li> The clip is much prettier in person, the colors are much brighter and more vivid.  I have long thick hair and have had issues getting it to stay in my hair.</li>
    <li> The design is beautiful and the clamp is tight and fits very securely. A little heavy if you&#x27;re not used to wearing clips but so pretty!</li>
    <li> i really like it fast service good price wish had bought more then one thank you really will buy stuff in future.</li>
    <li> This clip is one of my absolute favorite go to accessories. It is hard for me not to wear it everyday.</li>
    <li> I got this and wear it in my high crop and love it. It arrived as quickly as it could from overseas, and was in great condition.</li>
    <li> It so beautiful and is just what I was looking for. Unfortunately my hair it too fine to support it</li>
    <li> this is very pretty and just did my hair over so it looks great and compliments much  many likes from outsiders</li>
    <li> Omg,,,,,this is so so so pretty. It held up well and seems to be put together well. It&#x27;s a good idea to order several for gifts.. The price is even better...</li>
    <li> Even though I have only used it a couple of times, it always works very well. It is soo easy to use. I am not the person to fix my hair with bumpits or anything crazy. But this adds the little extra that I need. I am so very thankful for this item.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny spent. Was superb quality, looked amazing and was absolutely dazzling!!!! It is stunning and superb design!!!! Awesome!</li>
    <li> As several other reviewers said the clip did lose several of the gems in transit. That was disappointing. While it was inexpensive I did at least spent some money on it.  Regardless, I still lose the clip. It doesn&#x27;t look bad with the gems off. In fact, it looks pretty cool.</li>
    <li> The clip looks beautiful in my hair and I received a compliment on the first day of wearing it. However, I was disappointed in the quality as on the second day of wearing it, I discovered that one of the jewels is missing. They are glued on and, obviously, not very well. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Not the same colors as the picture and took forever to arrive in the mail! It&#x27;s cheap so it&#x27;s not about the price, just not really worth it.</li>
    <li> this is wayyy more sparkly in real life than in the picture.  I dont know if I will ever even wear it, but it is cute if you like super sparkly jeweled things.  Also, it actually has the potential to hold hair back.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful hair clip.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money!  I love my hair clip!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!, works great with my wavy hair. Colors are sparkly and bright. What a steal, need to order another one.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip! It was inexpensive, came on time and looked just like the picture. I have gotten many compliments, I love it!</li>
    <li> I did not notice buy the picture but the part of the clip that you squeeze together is very visible. Other than that it is big and pretty. The colors are actually more vibrant than pictured.</li>
    <li> This item was well worth the price I paid. The only flaws I can find are that some of the colored beads are the same color right next to each other and one of them was glued just a little crooked. Otherwise I&#x27;m very pleased with the simple beauty of this hair clip.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute it holds up its cheap but doesn&#x27;t look cheap. What more can I say. Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> When it came, one stone on it was broken m after a use a couple of others did. It was very cleap and i did not want to return it for $1 but bad product</li>
    <li> very heavy and slips out of my hair.  gave it to a friend with thicker hair and she loves it</li>
    <li> Ordered first from another vendor and liked it so much I wore it several times a week. Bought from World Pride to give as a gift as the photo looked the same.  Cheaper metal, two gems already off before arrival.</li>
    <li> this is a nice way to dress up a pony or twist. and I need to learn to write reviews when I&#x27;m feeling wordy. Seriously, how much do they think you can say about a hair clip??</li>
    <li> this ships quickly awesome and so cheep good for the price it has a good grip and pretty designs awesome get lots of complements</li>
    <li> At first glance I gave this a ranking of Three stars, but after looking at it and imagining the many uses for my nieces beautiful full thick hair, I changed it to a five.  It actually has a small metal peacock body with a beautiful tail of individually set colorful stones.  I think it will look great in her hair.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for my daughters, both in their 20&#x27;s.  They loved them and they looked so pretty clipped in their hair</li>
    <li> I like this product. quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
    <li> This clip really makes a boring outfit look absolutely incredible! It&#x27;s flawless and made strong. I loved wearing it :)</li>
    <li> Lovely Vintage jewelry crystal peacock hair clip&lt;br /&gt;Pretty with many colors.&lt;br /&gt;Go great with anything.&lt;br /&gt;Look great on anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Worth it.</li>
    <li> This clip is beautiful, and it&#x27;s difficult to beat the price.  However, I was very disappointed when it broke after maybe half a dozen uses.  I gave it two stars instead of one simply for the price.  Still, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> So, yeah, it&#x27;s cheap. I got that. It looks fun and is under a dollar, that&#x27;s cool. I ordered this for my wife just for fun along with a few other things. Shipping took so long I&#x27;d forgotten I&#x27;d ordered them until the package arrived. Within a week of giving it to my wife the clip broke. For what it costs I don&#x27;t really care that much but I just thought that others should be aware.</li>
    <li> I am not into hair accessories, but, lately it seems my hair is ALWAYS up and looking drab.  Added this in and POOF! Simple pony tails or buns are looking good!</li>
    <li> These clips are awesome. They really hold your hair up even in times of active movement. I work for KIA and we are always moving. To the point when rubber bands come out. These don&#x27;t break your hair and stay in! Love them. Very impressed</li>
    <li> The jewels are too bright and the metal is not of good quality. I can bend it between my fingers. Dont&#x27; buy this... it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this clip so much.  I purchased one months ago and loved it so much that I had to buy another one. They go with everything and they stay in your hair. Of all the clips I have &amp; that is many, I love these the most.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a peacock kick lately and this clip is perfect for my obsession!  It was cheap, but doesn&#x27;t look like it.  I&#x27;ll know I&#x27;ll be wearing this a lot.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Classy hair clip that can also be used as a brooch.  Very pretty!  Because of all the different colors, it can go with a number of outfits.</li>
    <li> Junk. &amp;#34;stones&amp;#34; falling off when opened. Didn&#x27;t expect a lot but some glue might have helped! Pretty but with stones falling off before wearing?</li>
    <li> Although this clip does not appear to be the best quality, it still looks nice in my hair and I do find myself wearing it often.</li>
    <li> This product is really cheap and acceptable for being as a simple gift. It looks nice on the hair. Only one thing is taken in consideration which is the color of the cooper.</li>
    <li> It is actually very pretty, and worth more than what you are paying for it, so while it isn&#x27;t perfect it is perfectly acceptable.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 10 yr old. Great price and is actually quite beautiful! Was scheduled to arrive after Christmas but rec&#x27;d a week before.</li>
    <li> Love this hair clip. It was way cheaper than anything you can find in the store. And, the quality is way better than expected for this price. Love it! May buy more for gifts.</li>
    <li> nice product good quality for the price i paid. Gave it to a friend who has worn it several times since she got it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter but decided to keep it&lt;br /&gt;for myself.  Very colorful and goes with many outfits.</li>
    <li> I like this clip when I have my hair up in a french twist.  I recommend that you coat the jewels with clear nail polish to keep them from falling out.  I do this with all cheaper jewelry that have stones in them.  Keeps you from losing the stones.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale for less than $2 , Im so glad I did. Its a very well made piece and I received a lot of compliments on it. The stones are well set and brightly colored, it does not look cheap, like I expected . Compared to store bought hair clips this was a great find!</li>
    <li> If you have thin hair, this will probably work just fine for you but I have extremely thick hair, so it won&#x27;t work to hold even partial strands up. However, if I use some sort of hair tie and just clip this on for decoration, it works fine. As far as aesthetics, it&#x27;s pretty and for the price, a bit better than I expected.</li>
    <li> The price is really cheap, and the quality is better than I expected. Additionally, although it was shipped from Hong Kong, I still received it in five days. What else can you expect?</li>
    <li> This is very pretty and definitely vintage looking.  Would be prettier if the gold color was shiny, but then It wouldn&#x27;t look as vintage.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received this product. It is much more heavily made than one would suppose from the price, and it stays in my very slippery, fine hair. I was going to order one for my sister, but decided to order a couple more to tuck away in my gift box. It keeps my hair up all day (which is huge...nothing, not even a ponytail holder keeps my hair up all day!). Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> This is a fun barrette.  Not like any other that I&#x27;ve seen.  I like the unusual things.  I would recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> The hair clip actually looks expensive, you wouldn&#x27;t find something like that for under $5.00 at a store. I received several compliments on it the very first day I wore it. My sister already stole it from me so I will have to order a second.</li>
    <li> I do like this hair clip. It&#x27;s just that the rhinestones for the peacocks feathers are all grouped by color, as in, 3 orange ones next to each other, 4 blue next to each other, 1 random purple rhinestone, and so on. The person making it did not bother to mix the colors at all. Then again, this thing was $1.50. Also, the rhinestone for the peacock&#x27;s eye was missing. I don&#x27;t know if it fell off right after I opened it or if it was gone before I got it. Again, this thing was cheap and I expected it to be cheaply made. That said, I still like the clip. The peacock eye can be replaced with a small bead/rhinestone and some super glue so I&#x27;m really not worried about it.</li>
    <li> This Is An Amazing Product! Said It Ships From Japan And Wouldn&#x27;t Be Here Until March 18th, I Ordered It A Week Ago And Already Received It! It Actually Shipped From Chicago. Wonderful Surprise! Only Reason It&#x27;s 4 Stars Instead Of 5, The Picture Makes It Look Bigger, So It&#x27;s About 3/4 The Length Of A Dollar. Still Beautiful, GREAT Price! I LOVE LOVE LOVE It, Holds My Hair Well! I Have Thick Wavyish Hair And It Works Awesome, I Get Compliments, And Again, The Shipping Circumstance Was Amazing! Definitely Buy This Clip!</li>
    <li> Good one..love the colors.. A nice peacock :) shining and not too big and not too small. Correct size.works great with my hair...</li>
    <li> The colors are a little brighter than the picture and the clip is slightly misaligned but no harm done. Packaged very well, and just a cute accessory to wear for a great price</li>
    <li> This is lovely and looks great when I wear it! It goes with so many outfits. I get many compliments.</li>
    <li> I got this sooner than the delivery estimate. However, the gems are really loose; a couple of them have already come off inside the plastic bag the hair clip came in. I&#x27;m going to have to fortify this clip with some gorilla glue before i can wear it. But for 1.50, I cannot really complain too much.</li>
    <li> i like this product, it&#x27;s pretty in my hair but it&#x27;s so heavy for me and i&#x27;m not comfortable with it.</li>
    <li> love multi color jewerly this is for fun to wear in your hair got it as a stuffer type gift for my daughter&lt;br /&gt;she works for a large jewerly distributor an luvs the stones in this piece</li>
    <li> It took a little while to get here but when it did arrive I was very happy with it. It is super cute and is made well.</li>
    <li> A lovely accent to wear in your hair, hold back a curtain or even hold your bills.  This beautiful assortment of stones makes this Peacock  fun to use in any accent for a touch of sparkle !</li>
    <li> Combined with the bracelet I got from the same vendor, they dress up the solid colors that I prefer to wear.</li>
    <li> its a high quality piece. the beads are attached well, no worries that they will fall off. Its very heavy duty. works well with medium to thick hair.</li>
    <li> Very pretty! Great colors and they do stay in hair well. I don&#x27;t have the thickest hair in the universe so I do feel the heaviness of the clips after a few hours. Great for an evening out.</li>
    <li> This looks just like the picture.It is very cute, and seems like it should hold up. It is made of some type of metal, not plastic. Like it shows in the picture, the clip will probably only hold half your hair back. The clip part is not very big. I really like it and have gotten compliments every time I&#x27;ve worn it.</li>
    <li> it very cute&lt;br /&gt;my sisture enjoyed it alot&lt;br /&gt;and you couldnt bet the cost any were you looked&lt;br /&gt;would enjoy more things like that</li>
    <li> This is a great and timeless piece.  Looks great with anything.  Great bargain, was very happy with purchase.  Even purchased 2 more as gifts!!</li>
    <li> i bought this as  a gift for my aunt and she absolutely adored it. it goes well with both casual and formal occasions.  a good fit for women in their later 30s/40s.</li>
    <li> The pin is fantastic. I really love all the colors on it and its actually very sturdy and very affordable. I am a huge fan of peacocks so this pin at its price and the way it looks was a must have for me!</li>
    <li> I was unsure what to expect after paying under $2 to buy and ship this product. When it arrived I was blown away! The clip part is very sturdy and well made and the colors are just beautiful! My daughter and I both love it! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Very cute and colorful, exactly what i was expecting.. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I love this hair accesory! It goes with a lot of things and its gorgeous. Shipping took a while but it was worth the wait. Looks just like the pic. Good quality.</li>
    <li> although it came from china  but it was well packed and i received it without any damage. Its really preety and crystals do shine. came in two weeks. I loved it..</li>
    <li> clip looks very cute in my daughters hair!  Goes with every outfit! I even bought a couple extras to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> I received my Peacock Hair clip from China and was somewhat disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t shiny gold as the photo depicts. It is dull, tarnished, discolored metal. I tried polishing it and it lightened up some but it&#x27;s difficult to polish because it isn&#x27;t a solid piece of metal. If I had paid more money for the hair piece I would have asked for a refund. However, since it was a rather inexpensive piece to begin with- why bother. The old adage, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for,&amp;#34; is definitely true in this case. Buyer beware the hairpiece you get is not as shiny and pretty as the photo shows.</li>
    <li> This item looks beautiful. However after wearing it, I noticed one of the little jewel pieces fell off. Luckily I was able to find it and will reapply it to the clip.</li>
    <li> Another cute piece. Looks like costume pieces but I love it anyways. Wish I had another for my sisters and mom.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is well constructed and is beautiful! Absolute must buy! It is left handed though, so take that into consideration. Other than that, no problems! I love it!</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get it but well worth it. Great quality item hold hair very well. Stone are nice color.</li>
    <li> It is a pretty item and you will not see this up and down the hallways of school, work or the street, but it just took to long to receive it.</li>
    <li> this product is very pretty and the price was great to buy several for stocking stuffers. i bought four of them for family members.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these so much I ordered 4, they will be perfect Xmas gifts for my daughters &amp; grand-daughters for special occaisions &amp; to wear to church, thanks!!</li>
    <li> This clip is very inexpensive and a good value for the money.  It&#x27;s  very colorful--will go with everything!  Nice addition to my hair jewelry.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot for the price I got it for. It isn&#x27;t fancy by any means, but it is still pretty and holds just fine.</li>
    <li> Totally love this!! So unique the pictures do not do this justice the colors are so vibrant and beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Was going to use as a stocking stuffer but decided to keep for myself instead</li>
    <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice, the stones are really pretty. The colours are brighter then I expected.  Should have ordered more.</li>
    <li> This peacock is very pretty and seems well made.  The stones are all in tack and hopefully I won&#x27;t be loosing any.  Very good price for this product and it arrived earlier than stated.</li>
    <li> I received the vintage peacock hair clip before schedule. I was very please when I saw it. It has the vintage look. It is truly beautiful and was difficult to wrap it because I wanted to keep it for myself. Truly beautiful product</li>
    <li> So I got it in the mail and I was so excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at it and could immediately tell there were only two things wrong but it still dissapointed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bead on the VERY end and a few in the middle were falling off and were GLUED THAT WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it doesn&#x27;t even really look like the picture that they advertise... Regardless it&#x27;s a very cute hair clip.&lt;br /&gt;I just took the beads off and glued them back on right. And it looks fine but it shouldn&#x27;t have been like that in the first place.</li>
    <li> I am glad I ordered this. While it isn&#x27;t the sturdiest hair clip, it is very pretty and if handled with care should last. And for the price, what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> My hair pin came broken and it just wasn&#x27;t worth it. Made me kinda sad I waited so long to get it and wear it but couldn&#x27;t because it arrived broken..</li>
    <li> This item took a while to get, but understandable since it was coming from over-seas. The pictuer makes the clip look bigger than it actually is, but its still absolutely adorable and I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair pin! It has beautiful colors, and is well made. I would love to order more clips seeing as how I have to wear my hair pinned up everyday!! I have gotten compliments immediately the first day of wearing it. It is actually prettier in person than in the picture.</li>
    <li> This piece was a bit more chintzier than I thought it woud be, it looks much better in the picture!</li>
    <li> Was exactly as pictured. So happy with it! :) Arrived quickly and without incident. I just need to play with hairstyles and see how many ways I can use it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother and she loves it!! It looks great and is actually comfortable to wear. Definite buy, plus price is great!</li>
    <li> This is really cute-looks more expensive than the price. I was very surprised at how nicely it stays in my hair-it&#x27;s got little teeth on the inside that hold it securely-I don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling out.</li>
    <li> very pretty decoration for long hair, made very well package came on time and was well wraped it made a nice gift</li>
    <li> The clip wasn&#x27;t as big as I expected, but it&#x27;s lovely.  The only problem I have is that my hair&#x27;s really thick, and it doesn&#x27;t hold much of it.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t beat this little hair clip for the price! I figured it would be something cheap and flimsy, but it was nice and heavy and clipped well in my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. The colors are accurately depicted in the photo, and I just couldn&#x27;t be happier! I think I&#x27;m going to order a few more just to have on hand for unexpected gifts!</li>
    <li> I really liked it. It goes really well with my matching bracelet and now i have something to wear for concerts!!!</li>
    <li> I wear a lot of black, and this is just the right touch in my hair for a pop of color, I wear it all the time, its just easy to throw in your hair and head out the door, and i always get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and it&#x27;s pretty good quality as well. I&#x27;m really pleased with it for the price. It does take about 3 weeks for it to ship, but the description tells you that. Very pretty hair clip.</li>
    <li> One jewel had fallen off, found it in bag but besides that I loved the clip!! Used it the next day.  Adds a nice touch to anotherwise boring outfit.  Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Waste of money..mine came missing it&#x27;s head and three gemstones.. not worth the dollar not worth ten cents will not recommend or by again unhappy  :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a seriously beautiful hair accessory.  I bought one for almost every I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes freaking forever for them to arrive, but you&#x27;ll be glad you got one when it does!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these bejeweled &amp;#34;peacock&amp;#34; hair clips.... I never get tired of them!!! I have several pieces of them now, in different colors. They really are very lovely and sturdy!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this, its not flimsy or cheap feeling. I am very happy with my purchase, It was better then I expected.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this purchase!! Very beautiful!! I would recommend any female to these hair clips,I bought 5 of them! Very well crafted and durable. And for 1.00 each!!!</li>
    <li> I would very much rather have the clip shown in the photo: the one I received did not have &#x27;loose, flowing, widespread&#x27; gems like the photo shows. It&#x27;s very skinny and not as dazzling. After a month of using it, a gem fell out. I can fix it with a hot glue gun but I feel like that&#x27;s a little unacceptable. But hey, for the price, it&#x27;s worth it. It also arrived earlier than the estimated shipping date.</li>
    <li> these hairclips are lovely...i bought one for my daughter and one for my assistant. the delivery took about a month...also these are decorative so don&#x27;t count on the clip doing any major \\&quot;work\\&quot; :)</li>
    <li> Lovely hair clip. All the gems were attached and in great condition. Amazing deal! I have gotten a few things from this vendor and have never been disappointed</li>
    <li> It came super fast and was much better in person then the picture. This was a gift for a niece and she will love i.</li>
    <li> I did not expect this piece will be more beautiful than what is represented on the picture. Really, it deserves the money I spent.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful, strong and vibrant! I love it! My girls have been trying to take it from me. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Although this does not hold a lot of hair, it is more hair jewelery and more beautiful than practical, I do love it.</li>
    <li> Peacock hair clip is very well made and pretty. I originally purchased the matching bracelet and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> xmas present for my daughter. She loves it and wears it often, so I guess it was a great buy. For the money it could not be beat.</li>
    <li> This was a terrible buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;It was missing three very fake and kid like jewels.  The missing pieces are very noticeable making it unwearable!</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these for my wedding party as part of their gift bags. I haven&#x27;t given it to them yet as the wedding isn&#x27;t until May but I personally do think they are pretty. The only downfall I have seen right now is that one of the gems fell off so I&#x27;ll have to re-glue that myself. The clips themselves I am very happy with, nice and strong so it should even stay in well for my Matron of Honor who has long thick hair. :)</li>
    <li> I found it to be very cute.  Even cuter than I expected.  The colors are all very pretty.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> this is the same as the owl ring and peacock bracelet, whenever people ask where I found it they are excited to find out Amazon</li>
    <li> For the price of this item it is wonderful. It seams of good quality and the pictures are accurate. I have not put it to alot of use yet so not sure how it will hold up, but it is every bit as good as something you would pay $10+ dollars for around here.</li>
    <li> Just received the peacock hair clip in perfect condition and love it! I think its prettier in person than the picture given.</li>
    <li> Loved it. really nice piece. I gave it as a gift, recipient loved it as well.  sparkles really nice. Looks way nicer then the picture shows.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip and its perfect with everything since its so colorful. This will make great gifts, so getting more in the future!!</li>
    <li> I just couldn&#x27;t turn away from the great reviews on this so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the low price I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but my nieces are younger and getting to that age where they like to put my pretty, more expensive clips in their hair. With this in mind, I wanted to find them something comparable but still cheap enough that if it broke or got lost, it wouldn&#x27;t make anyone feel bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip I got is identical to what is pictured in layout but consists mostly of red, green and orange stones with only a few purple and blue. It sparkles nicely and has that antique-y gold color, best part of all is that it arrived with all stones intact/still glued on. The girls absolutely loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this purchase I probably won&#x27;t ever consider spending $8-15 on hair clips at the more expensive &amp;#34;mall stores&amp;#34; again.</li>
    <li> This piece came in perfect condition. The multi-colored crystals make it versatile enough to wear with nearly anything. You can dress it up or down. So pretty and an excellent value.</li>
    <li> This is a steal! It&#x27;s so pretty and I use it all.the.time! I have thick and curly hair, and this (along with some bobby pins) is able to hold it up. I have gotten so many compliments on it. Buy  it!</li>
    <li> The hair clip is pretty and looks nice like it did in the picture. It works well and stays in your hair pretty well</li>
    <li> Such a pretty piece of jewelry- love wearing it.  It goes with practically everything.  It also works great- I put the clip in first thing in the morning and don&#x27;t have to worry about it sliding down throughout the day</li>
    <li> Hi there, got this beautiful hair clip few days ago(though shipping and receiving the item took long) yet when it finally arrived I was impressed by the looks, all crystals are intact and the color combo is great, I receommend this hair clip to anyone and everyone who is looking for something cheap and sexy</li>
    <li> I was really excited when this arrived.  It was super pretty and seemed of good quality.  However, the first time  I tried to wear it it broke.  My hair is fine/thin so its not much of an obstacle to get through.  I put the clip in my hair, and when I tried to adjust the position the bottom part snapped in 2 pieces.  Really disappointed as I was looking forward to a new colorful hair piece.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This took a while to arrive, but for the price, it was worth it. Really different piece, and very pretty and vintage looking.</li>
    <li> I like that this clippy grips my hair well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty and functional, Unfortunately I have misplaced it so I may need to order another.</li>
    <li> My clip is good, decent quality mine was all in one peice and it looks nice. Im in my late 20&#x27;s and the colors are very pretty. I just had to wait a while to receive it. It took a good month for me to get it. I can imagine some of the bad reviews for broken items would be simply it just takes forever to get and was handled alot. mine came in a very small bubbled envelope and could easily have been crushed. take your chances if you really like it. Iv bought nicer more expensive clips that broke the first day.</li>
    <li> Looks cute and is made pretty well.  Good product considering the great price.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for something cute and cheap to control their hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lovely. the picture is the same as the product. It arrived in time as well as well packaged. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely hair clip, much sturdier than it appears, that almost glitters in your hair as you move.  It took quite a while to get to the US but well worth the wait.  It&#x27;s good for any occasion and the multi-colors make it great with just about any outfit.  Lovely!!!</li>
    <li> I received this hair clip 2 weeks early,ireally like it but it looks bigger in the pic, and the clip part was a bit wobbley. but besides that, Ilove it!!!</li>
    <li> This is more along the lines of a pin hat, not a barrett or clip. BUt it is beautiful and it will be used. Took a month to receive coming from hong kong. But I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This hair clip was cute but it broke the very first time I tried to put it in my hair. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love it! I got 2 one for me and for a friend. Very pretty and awesome price!! Takes a while to get to the states but worth it :)</li>
    <li> Really attractive and for the price, you cannot go wrong. My daughter loved it and it adds just a little something to any outfit.</li>
    <li> the clip was a little duller than shown in the picture, but it works with so many outfits and i get lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on this and it matches everything.  Holds my hair great- I have the bracelet to match.</li>
    <li> The clip is very nice, and the colors are wonderful!  The ONLY thing that makes this a 4 instead of 5 star review is the clip is missing a stone on the peacock&#x27;s head...incidently there is one glued awkwardly on his back that I can&#x27;t get off.  &gt;.&amp;lt; But for the price great deal!</li>
    <li> gems falling off when taken out of package and arrived damaged.  I can&#x27;t believe anyone would give this as a gift. Bad workmanship and poor quality materials...looks like gumball piece.</li>
    <li> The clip came on time and in perfect working order!  It&#x27;s super cute, now I just need to find some clothes to match with it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my niece for her birthday last week. She has long thick, wavy black hair, and the colors look great. She said she loved it and I&#x27;ve seen her wear it twice since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that it seems a little flimsy. Hopefully it can withstand the wear and tear of a 13-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Love this clip! Looks beautiful in my hair and compliments so many different outfits. I wear this as often as I can. Awesome price too!</li>
    <li> Product arrived just as described, and rather quickly for international shipping. The clip is beautiful, and it held my thin, baby-fine hair up all night at a concert (where standing, dancing, and dealing with drunk people was involved). I was very impressed.</li>
    <li> This is dollar store quality. Fortunately, I assumed as mush when I ordered it as a stocking stuffer for my 11 year old step daughter. It will be lost in a month or to anyways! Cute for what I spent on it...</li>
    <li> I live in California and it took about a month before I received my order. That&#x27;s not the worst part, when I opened the package I found the hair clip broken in two. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This hair clip is a great bargain. It&#x27;s a little smaller in person then I expected, but it should look great in my mom&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> I think peacocks are very beautiful so when I saw this I knew I must have it. It looks a lot better than I had imagined and it&#x27;s a great price. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on it!</li>
    <li> Love this!  It was much better looking in person. Online does it no justice. It holds my hair up, and I when I decide to let my hair down, it&#x27;s so easy, and there is no tangling/hair pulling .. Lovely just lovely! Ty again!</li>
    <li> it was hard to see the actual clip in the picture but i took a chance and ordered it. it&#x27;s a cute piece, nothing to really brag about though. it is unique looking if you are looking for something you dont see very often. probably a nice gift for a young pre teen.</li>
    <li> its cute, colorful, whimsical and girly. I love all of those elements. Its pretty sturdy considering the price.  Thje only downside is that it took forever to arrive.</li>
    <li> Love it...very pretty.I showed it to my co-workers and they absolutely loved it.  I wish I had purchased more of them.</li>
    <li> I had it on time and I love the clip, it has beautiful colors and it looks great, thanks to the many colors you can use it with all kinds of outfits.</li>
    <li> The price was too good to pass up this item.  I thought it was lovely, but I wish that the \\&quot;stones\\&quot; were more jewel-toned.  Still a good buy and a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I was surprised with how well made it is. Everything very sturdy, looks just like the picture. I am very pleased with this piece.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. For under $2 after shipping you can&#x27;t go wrong. Up close looks a little cheap, but looks fine regardless.</li>
    <li> Colors are very bright compared to picture. But it is made well and the clip holds tight in my very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip. I wear it often and really enjoy the little flash of personality and color it brings to my updo.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promptly and the price was awesome. Very cute!</li>
    <li> I bought it on a whim and isn&#x27;t disappointed. Price is right and and got it sooner then expected. Glad I did</li>
    <li> I was very excited to be getting this item especially at a low price. I received it in a timely manner. But when I went to open it a stone had fallen off and I had to use some glue to put it back in place. But now the stone is a different color than the other. The glue gave it a darker color than the others.</li>
    <li> It was a nice item at a very low price. The peacock hair clip was a very colorful and nice.</li>
    <li> It is very cute and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I love all the colors. It fits prett well, you can&#x27;t put a ton of hair in it. I don&#x27;t know how they could afford to ship this and sale it. The price I paid couldn&#x27;t have covered the shipping.</li>
    <li> very cute. exactly what i was hoping for. works perfectly. does not look or feel cheap. deffinately a good buy</li>
    <li> This was quite inexpensive so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be any good but it was a cute hair clip that seemed decently made.  It should hold up just fine and it&#x27;s adorable</li>
    <li> I do have to admit that I waited a LONG time for this clip and started to get irritated about it, but it comes from Hong Kong so its no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;This is such a BEAUTIFUL hair clip! I normally don&#x27;t wear hair clips in my hair, but let me tell you, this clip is a regular for me. It goes with anything especially for a night out with red lipstick! Its a GORGEOUS clip. I thought it would be a bit bigger, but again, no biggie. I would highly recommend this clip! You won&#x27;t be dissapointed :)</li>
    <li> I ordered 2. The clip was even better than pictured. Sparkle for casual or dress. Worth the wait! I may buy some for gifts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good one, actually I thought it would be like any other funky accessory. But it is more likely a antique....like its color and quality. But nice one... I liked it..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made of plastic and isn&#x27;t very sturdy but it&#x27;s cute and cheap and I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else wearing one!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what it says it is. It is a cut e clip with a great design. Holds tightly in hair. That is a big compliment from me because I have a big problem with headbands and hair ties and bobby pins slipping in my hair or not staying in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this clip a couple months ago and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart. The crystals look real even though they are made of plastic. I did get a few nice compliments on it.</li>
    <li> my fiance and daughter both wear it and get lots of compliments, the clip is on the wrong direction making them put it on from the bottom so sometimes the weight of the tail causes it to slide out of place. the colors on the tail are very pretty, but some colors are repeated side by side.</li>
    <li> when i got this is was very nice, however one of the chrystal things were missing it isnt very noticable though so i wasnt upset.</li>
    <li> this is a well made, beautiful, colorful hair clip. I was surprised because it looks expensive. I will recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than I cannot understand how something this pretty and sturdy can cost $1.50 including shipping from China.  ???  It arrived in 1/2 the estimated time too.  Lovely item.  May buy a few more.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these and they make for a very beautiful, exotic hair decoration.  The stones are large and well mounted with a little flick up of the tail for added elegance.</li>
    <li> The clip is very beautiful but when it came in the mail it had a very strange smell. It smelled like paint or something. It looks older with some black detailing but I like the look. It seems bigger in the picture but it&#x27;s still pretty. The color isn&#x27;t as bright as in the picture, especially the teal. I like the clip though, it&#x27;s really nice for the price.</li>
    <li> great product would buy again love it just like the picture does not hurt to wear color nice also .</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd clip I bought since I adored the first one.  It&#x27;s sturdy, beautiful, and classy!  Everyone who sees it loves it and I get compliments all the time.  It&#x27;s sturdy too, no plastic clips, though the &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; are a little skewed ( I don&#x27;t care!)</li>
    <li> Very Pretty!  Great price, arrived as promised and I really like it!  I would highly  recommend  it to any one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very much my style, I love to wear it when I put my hair up, and for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This product arrived at a timely manner. It was what I expected. Its not to big. What I like most about it is, it holds your hair in place without your hair getting tangled in it.  The colors are beautiful.</li>
    <li> It works so great with pony tails even if your in a hurry, I just put in my peacock and it makes it look great!</li>
    <li> Love the size and vibrant colors. It was defiantly worth the price and more. The piece has an old world feel.</li>
    <li> It was for my niece, she loves peacocks, and she simply adored it, took like a month to get it , but it came</li>
    <li> I love this clip! It has a beautiful antique look. If that is your style, then you will love it too.</li>
    <li> What can you really expect for $2? This was an impulse purchase, and I knew from the other reviews that it was going to be bright, and I guess I didn&#x27;t realize that bright means cheap. The colors are just short of neon, its very bright, very fake looking. And maybe that&#x27;s a style that some people like, but I just can&#x27;t pull it off. I think I&#x27;m going to donate it. Easy come easy go.</li>
    <li> I really like the clip, but there are no written indications as to actual size.  The picture is deceiving; the clip is much smaller.  Still a good buy, esp. for the price.  Love the colors.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it. Stays in her hair, and really shines. The colors are bright, and very visible. Came well packaged, no damage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute, afforable, and original! The order took about 3 weeks to ship, but it was coming all the way from China, and I&#x27;d say it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is beautiful and strong.  It holds all of my hair easily, securely, and doesn&#x27;t slide at all.</li>
    <li> It is a little larger than I thought it would be, but it is well designed and very pretty. If you like large antique looking costume jewelry, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> my only regret is only buying one, its so beautiful and holds so nice and tightly. i didnt expect that at all since it was so cheap, i should have bought two or three!! too bad they are shipped from so far, major carbon footprint.</li>
    <li> I gave the product 4 stars because of its size. Its misleading in the picture. The actual clip is about 3inches long and a little over an inch and a half on its widest point. However it is beautiful and sparkly. The design is really nice and the clip is metal and durable. I bought it for a friend who loves peacocks she loves it.</li>
    <li> This peacock hair clip is truly lovely for the price. It is strong and functional and holds my thick hair. I am well pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is a gift so It hasn&#x27;t been used yet. I really like the colors and think my daughter will love it.  It was shipped quickly too.</li>
    <li> My daughter love this clip got it for christmas,  very pretty and great  price very strong to hold hair back</li>
    <li> This clip is absolutely beautiful and great price and great quality Hair Clip  - I really like this and got alot of compliments on it</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Very good quality for the purchase price, holds my thick, heavy hair all day.  Only complaint is it didn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture but was still a peacock and very pretty.</li>
    <li> A++++ A+++++++++++ A ++++++++++ A ++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;A+++++++++ A+++++++++++++ A ++ + + + + + + + +&lt;br /&gt;A++++++++++++++++++ A +++++++++ A+++++++++++</li>
    <li> The jewels are way brighter in person then what shows in photos. Kind of reminds me of that bedazzeled (?) stuff. I have super thin hair and generally clips etc. don&#x27;t stay in my hair but this clip actually stays put. Aside from the bright jewels it is a great clip. Might buy another and try to remove the jewels and see if I like it better.</li>
    <li> Beautiful,well made.The underside is also finished.Bought two,to do hair like picture.Took a bit of time to get them,they came from China well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Super rich colors, very nice quality. I have heavy/thick hair and this is still holding it great! It did take a LONG time to arrive (3-4weeks) but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our niece for Christmas. Although quite lovely, we have not seen her wear it as of yet. She hasn&#x27;t had the opportunity to dress up to wear it yet.</li>
    <li> Very nice, very sturdy can hold my hair!  I&#x27;ve already ordered another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend purchasing this for yourself or a gift.</li>
    <li> The is a nice hair piece for the money.  I thought it was more like a clip but it fastens like a barrett so doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of hair.  The featured picture is a bit misleading, but for the price it is a unique and sturdy enough barrett.  Expect a long shipping time.</li>
    <li> Of all of my accessories, this one gets the most compliments! I&#x27;m going to buy more for gifts and to have spares. Looks gorgeous in my 4yo daughter&#x27;s hair as well. You could even clip it on your bag&#x27;s strap. I store mine out in the open for all to see when not in use.</li>
    <li> When I initially saw this clip, I loved the beautiful colors and great price, so I bought it, even though it&#x27;s not the type thing I wear a lot. It took almost two months before I received it, and upon opening it, was disappointed to find that the beautiful colors I had loved were not there. Instead, all but about four of the stones were an unattractive shade of red. But by far the biggest disappointment came when I opened the little bag the clip was in, and the clip part under the peacock was broken completely in two. I may be able to fix it with super glue but I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll bother because I don&#x27;t even like the look of what I received.</li>
    <li> This is brighter (more gold) than it looks, but I still like it! Shipped from HK received pretty quickly.  I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely beautiful! I just love mine! I was also very sutprised at how big they were when I got them, and the jewels, and detail couldn&#x27;t be prettier! I get many compliments everytime that I wear them. I would most definately recommend these for someone!</li>
    <li> For the price and the free shipping, this is a cute, well made hair clip. It just looks like the picture. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This matches every thing I own. I love it! It is such a colorful accent and finishing touch to any hairstyle.</li>
    <li> i bought this item for a present and after i saw it i just fell in love with it...!!!  i Just love it :)</li>
    <li> The pin is great and I love the colors! Great price as well. I have been happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is absolutely beautiful and easy to wear! I can&#x27;t wait for an occasion to wear it! Very nice!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this hair clip to be made very well, since it was so cheaply priced, I expected it to be cheaply made. I was definitely surprised. The clip is strong and sturdy. It hold hair in place quite well. I have about medium thick hair. The design is absolutely stunning! I am going to order more for gifts and for myself!</li>
    <li> The company was very helpful when i did not receive my initial order.  They promptly resent the clip without hesitation.  Great customer service for a product that is not very expensive!  What a nice surprise that no item was too small for them to make sure they have a satisfied and happy customer!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thin but that&#x27;s not a problem at all. The jewels are bright and seem like they are attached pretty well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive cute hair clip.</li>
    <li> After receiving this clip, I ordered more for the rest of the ladies in my family!  We love them, they stay in great and are really cute!.</li>
    <li> for the incredibly low price, this piece of elegance is worth it. Get so many compliments everytime i wear it</li>
    <li> Item is well made and my girls loved them.  Took a a few weeks to get, but not long as it could have been.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected...thought it would b a barrette...still like it...would recommend it to all...it is well worth the wait...exceeds the price</li>
    <li> This hair clip is simple and elegant, it adds flair to your hair. Foe the price ($1), it was an easy decision. It is able to hold all of my hair up and I have long, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> The quality was not as expected, i ended up not wearing it. The colors are the same, its just the metal thats cheap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful clip. The colors are beautiful but it&#x27;s shinier and brighter than it appears in the pictures but I love it</li>
    <li> It was nice and sparkly. I wish they had made the colors a bit more mixed but otherwise it was nice.</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture and the alligator clip doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hair. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be prettier. It looks cheap. It did get hear in a good amount of time and packaging was fine.</li>
    <li> I gave four stars only because some of the gems were crooked, but it is hand made. It is beautiful, and I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> A pretty nice metal hair clip that you cannot beat for the bargain of only one dollar! The actual peacock is about 2 3/4 inches in length while the underlying clip is just over 3 1/2inches in length. It holds well in my thick silky straight hair. I recommend.</li>
    <li> love it! so pretty, so unusual, i love my new hair clip!  i&#x27;ve never seen anyone with one like this!  beautifully jeweled, fun for a party, looks good  in your hair!</li>
    <li> Pretty hair clip my daughter liked it. It was as it described it took a little while to ship. All together I was happy.</li>
    <li> A VERY NICE CLIP , PRETTY STRONG I  HAVE TO SAY AS I HAVE THICK HAIR......I REALLY LIKED IT AND WOULD ORDER IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Unless your hair is very fine, clip does not hold much up. You basically have to pin or clip your hair up with something else and then use this on the outside. I ordered two; one for myself and one for a friend.  One was missing a &#x27;jewel&#x27;.  The clips are alright.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  Just don&#x27;t have too high of expectations.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair clip. Very detailed work and can wear it with any outfit. Awsome price, I will be getting some other items to go with it.</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture, but one thing you can&#x27;t see is the filigree metal of the underside. The clip itself is gorgeous and makes the whole piece seem much more expensive that it really is. This would be a wonderful gift for anyone who loves peacocks...or hair accessories.</li>
    <li> very beautiful and sturdy lots of colors well worth the $1.00 I bought two one for each of my sisters</li>
    <li> Lovely Vintage Jewelry Crystal Peacock Hair Clip, I like it and it&#x27;s cheap also easy to use and not too heavy on my head.</li>
    <li> The hair clip is totally adorable! I get alot of complements when I wear it and it&#x27;s great quality for the price. The bird is metal but the backing that goes in your hair is plastic which I wasn&#x27;t expecting but it hasn&#x27;t come close to breaking so overall I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My sister and I were sitting at the computer just looking at sparkly, retro like baubles when we ran across this peacock hair clip.  We were laughing as the cost was so inexpensive so we ordered a couple of them, almost as a joke.  We were both quite surprised when we received the clips.  They were really, really nice and not flimsy at all.  I think this piece is definitely a good find and a keeper.  I disagree with the person who said that it looks cheap.  The two that I ordered were beauties!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> So I have already written a report from when I got it and now I have worn it an entire day to work. for one the teeth on the clip is great for keeping it in my hair, which is usually a problem for me. I would also like to mention I was iffy because of how many negative reviews it got saying it broke quickly. As I said it&#x27;s been in my hair all day and is very sturdy! I have gotten so many compliments on it and for the price I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I love  this new hair clip. My mother keeps trying to wear it herself. It is truly a beautiful piece.</li>
    <li> very cute and unique clip for short or long hair, the colors make it able to match any syle and color of clothing, a little brighter in color than what the picture shows.</li>
    <li> Looks like photo. Daughter will love it! Detailed, photo doesn&#x27;t show. She will get lots of wear out of it this summer</li>
    <li> The photo does not do this piece justice.  It is beautiful.  The multi-colored stones make it a versatile piece.  The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on the back keep it secure for a long time.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair clip, very colorfull, arrived way before  expected date and was intact. A little smaller than I though wich works perfect cuz I have thin hair. Definetely will buy again.</li>
    <li> This clip came when it was suposed to which I was pleased with as I want to wear it to an event this weekend. One small problem that I have with it is that one of the gems on the tail is off center and to the left. I don&#x27;t think that this will be that much of a problem because the clip is small, and the tail flips up. Another thing to metion; the pattern of the colors of the gems are a different color (mine has more blues and purples in it) than in the photo.</li>
    <li> Really nice and worth the price. Works very well for my hair. Beautiful little things. Would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> LOVED love love it! It Came in the maie very quickly and is super quality. Pretty and looks great too!</li>
    <li> it is as shown on picture&lt;br /&gt;for $1, free shipping?&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t complain&lt;br /&gt;yes, beautiful if you are that one who put your long hair in a bun&lt;br /&gt;this is a good looking accessory : -)</li>
    <li> It was a very nice addition to my hair clip collection, I like antique looking items and it was very pretty.</li>
    <li> I actually saw this in someone&#x27;s hair and thought it was so cute, I searched for it on Amazon!  I&#x27;m pretty sure I found the exact one!  Although the price is very low, the quality is exceptional!  I have very thick hair and this works great!  I think it&#x27;s best with an updo as shown!  Very high quality!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair Barrett, its beautiful and very durable! I really though it would be easily broken because the price but no it is underpriced if you ask me I think its better than another clip I purchased for $6 at Walmart, I will buy from this company again, granted it takes awhile to receive it but definitely worth the wait :)</li>
    <li> Sadly, the first time I put it in my hair (GENTLY!) a gem fell off. Felt the rest of them and although they seem secure, I&#x27;m worried to actually wear it anywhere for fear it&#x27;ll fall apart. Lovely though, looks just like the picture.</li>
    <li> Whenever I wear this hair clip I get stopped over and over to ask where I got it. It matches everything ,</li>
    <li> This is gorgeous in person. The clip part does feel a bit cheap, but even if it were to break I would still find another clip to secure as it is beautiful. Also feels quite heavy. Delighted with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this hair clip.  If is quite stylish and looks more expensive than the price you pay.  If you have fine hair than it will hold more than if you have thick hair, but you can use it more for fashion than function.</li>
    <li> for the money I spent I am more then happy with this item!!! The material it is made of - is metal - so it is strong and doesn&#x27;t look very cheap ,, I like it - I order 1 for me and then 2 more :)</li>
    <li> This is definitely worth is price as it is both strong and very beautiful. The colors really shine and look well togethor</li>
    <li> Quite large and stunning clip. Arrived very quickly from overseas and was well packaged.  Would have expected to pay much more local retail in the US, is a wonderful deal for the price. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> got this clip today beautiful,nice and bright colors. came sooner than it said. planning too wear it this weekend.would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this clip she always wants to wear it in her hair and all her friends at school thinks it is beautiful but two other people in her class have it:( I was looking for something unique  but thanks anyway</li>
    <li> The Hair clip was missing a Gem from one of the peacock feathers. Other than that no problems. Very pretty though</li>
    <li> I ordered it on Sunday and it arrived on Wednesday, so surprised! It is super cute and perfect to pin up my hair. It didn&#x27;t move all day. Very pleased. For as little as I paid, I&#x27;m completely happy.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good quality item for such a price! The one I got :-) was not missing any jewels :-) and it looks beautiful! Here&#x27;s the PLUS they don&#x27;t tell you about: it features little \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the inside of the clip to grab onto your hair!! This is definitely  a PLUS for me, because I have a LOT of hair, and other clips seem to just slip out of place. Not this one! Get it. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this despite some other reviews complaining about poor quality, since it was so cheap. I have to say- I am really impressed with the quality! No gems have come loose or anything, and the clip is strong enough to hold my hair back WITH NO SLIPPING!!! This is majorly impressive, since any clip I buy at an American store (CVS, Walmart for example) is never strong enough to keep my hair in place. I definitely recommend buying this, especially if you have Prime for the free shipping. So worth it!</li>
    <li> This is  a beautiful hair piece. It stays in my hair, which is unusual. People has told me how pretty it is</li>
    <li> Its so pretty!,, love it even more then when I saw it on amazon . Nice weight doesn&#x27;t seem cheap at all</li>
    <li> Very pretty but also a little heavy so if you have finer hair may be too much weight. Otherwise very happy with.</li>
    <li> I really like this pin because it is very colorfully and bright I love this product it is so worth the price</li>
    <li> Very nice hair clip. The jewels are very bright and look better than I expected. I ordered the matching bracelet as well. It&#x27;s almost too pretty to wear I don&#x27;t want to lose any jewels :) !!!</li>
    <li> The reviews say it is brighter than picture I disagree looks like picture to me.. I love it and for the price how can u beat it?</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this almost every day!  Just love it.  It&#x27;s high quality, and exactly as described.  A pair of them would be nice, and this would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> This came way quicker than expected.  It feels good quality heavy but not so heavy that it will fall out of the hair.  It&#x27;s very pretty and in no way feels cheap.  Love it so much I ordered a few more as gifts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much what I expected, cute hair clip, that looks great and adds a sparkle on a messy bun or with the hair down.  Don&#x27;t expect anything fancy, its just tin and a couple of colored plastic rocks but it looks very cute.</li>
    <li> This will be a great present.  Very happy with the look and quality!  I ordered 4 and they all differ in colors used but all very pretty!</li>
    <li> My friend loves peacocks and I found this trinket online for her birthday. Here&#x27;s the thing. She&#x27;s a friend, and we&#x27;re closer than aquaintences, but I would not consider us BFFs. You know that level of friendship. Anywho, this is an adequate present to say &amp;#34;Hey, I&#x27;m thinking about you, but I don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on you.&amp;#34; :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought one for myself and found that it makes a wonderful Christmas Tree Ornament.</li>
    <li> I guess the model&#x27;s head is the smallest in the world. The clip can&#x27;t bind many hairs at all. I have to clip it on my forehead, instead.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair clip. It is good quality for the price. Everyone raves about it when I wear it to work. It stays in my very thin hair with no problems.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so cute and stylish! Nice decoration for your hair! It&#x27;s cheapest hair clip I ever bought but it&#x27;s so interesting and all my friends like it so much!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair clip because I love unique accessories. I gave it to my mother who wears her hair in a chignon most of the time and it looks lovely. The price cannot be beaten either!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim and kind of figured it would be junk, but to my pleasant surprise, I really like it! It&#x27;s cute, good quality.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected it to be, is really pretty, arrived about 2 weeks earlier than expected! Overall nice product</li>
    <li> It clips very tight on my hair and holds it in place. I get lots of compliments on it&#x27;s beauty. It&#x27;s colors are very bright.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased and glad I purchased 2.The stones are well set and the clip holds tight in my thick hair.I really do love it.</li>
    <li> there was one little problem with one of the stones being off. of course i am the only one that noticed it. i really hating waiting for it to come but was so happy when it did arrive. i have long and thick hair and it holds up really great. shows really well and got lots of praise from everyone.</li>
    <li> Has Very beautiful colors...feels sturdy and will hold a good amount of hair&lt;br /&gt;Pictures dont do it justice...love this clip!</li>
    <li> When I odered this hair clip I thought for the price I paid it would be something I was able to use maybe a couple times but when I recieved it (16 days early) I was very happy with my purchase. It is brighter, more colorful and prettier than I expected and the quality of the spring and medal is much better than I thought I was getting! I might buy a couple more soon (if available then).</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful multicolored hair clip.  It was a great value and I bought more as gifts. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> We got this to use in a set with a couple of necklaces and a bracelet.  It&#x27;s bright and beautiful.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS ITEM!!!! MADE A GREAT GIFT TO ADD TO A GIFT BAG!!!! MAKES A GREAT GRAB BAG ITEM!!! EXCELLENT QUALITY... EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!!!</li>
    <li> I love the hair clip it is very cute and also at a good price.I received the hair clip before the expected time.:)</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments and a wonderful bargain for the price.  Pretty and bright, sweet and cool. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> this really is a sturdy clip and so pretty and delivery came quicker than expected ... this is a must buy for the peacock lovers out there</li>
    <li> This was a fabulous purchase. I bought four as gifts. The recipients were delighted. The colors are vibrant. The clip is smooth so that it slides easily into the hair. I was surprised to find it in my mailbox so soon. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This hair clip was quite beautiful, it arrived much sooner than I expected.I didn&#x27;t have any broken or missing pieces.I ordered two of these and both were very nice.I tried them in my own hair and they looked very pretty.I am thinking about ordering more as gifts.</li>
    <li> a little smaller in person, the only problem I have is that the clip was cracked when I received it from the back but still usable. stayed on all day with the help of a hair tie holding my hair. I would recommend this to others! very classy!</li>
    <li> I love this clip and will be buying more for stocking stuffers. It&#x27;s very pretty and really doesn&#x27;t look that cheap, even though I only paid 98 cents for it. A nice find. :)</li>
    <li> Very colorful, great little clip to add a little bling to your hair. Not big enough to hold all my thick hair but great at hiding the hair tie.</li>
    <li> A lovely way to brighten a bad hair day. I love mine. I am concerned about the back of the clip being plastic because heavy hair can break it but if you don&#x27;t abuse the clip it stands up to use well.</li>
    <li> I loved the pricing but you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s a medium size piece. Looks better on the picture then when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much I love love loved the hair clip so much and the price was awesome. Thank you again :)</li>
    <li> It is already July 2 and its not here yet it&#x27;s suppose to be here from June 11 -June 27 and its not here</li>
    <li> My kids and nieces all love this pin.  Sure it looks a little cheap in person but it was $1.00.  What do you expect.  Fun piece of costume jewelry.</li>
    <li> The clip is definitely lovely!  My daughter was thrilled when I gave it to her, and she wore it right away.  It works well in her long, dark hair.  One of the jewels fell out, and I glued it back in; we were lucky that she found the jewel.  I hope that the rest of the jewels stay in place.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter loves this. She loves colorful barrettes and this is both colorful and sparkly enough to make her very happy</li>
    <li> gave to my older sister as a gift and she loves it so much its beautiful and came on time.</li>
    <li> The product is nice and all. It arrived before expected time but what am I supposed  to do with it if it is broken! I guess you get what you pay for huh? But wait that&#x27;s not the best part, it was broken by the seller as I can clearly see, they tried to hide the broken piece. Wow just wow. Don&#x27;t bother buying.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and colorful hairclip.  Arrives just as picured.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either!  I was so surprised when I saw this one:)</li>
    <li> I hope it comes in early, bc I have a wedding to go to and it&#x27;s peacock themed! I think I will love it!</li>
    <li> I know I know 5 stars?! I do feel like it will fall apart after a few months worth of wears. &amp; I thought that this would be made of some sort of metal but it&#x27;s a plastic sort of similar to PVC... The \\&quot;crystals\\&quot; are plastic crystals but they look ok enough. The clasp I don&#x27;t think is strong enough to grab ahold American thin hair... I have full curly hair that grips easily. BUT WTH... it&#x27;s $1.99... I&#x27;ve already worn the item and it was pretty enough to get a few compliments. I&#x27;m really picky on what I wear because if it looks cheap and tacky then I really would just have given to my nieces because they would love it no matter what. Besides, I&#x27;m not going to be wearing everyday...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it did take longer than expected to ship from Hong Kong then other items I ordered same day (from other Amazon shops)... But again, if you don&#x27;t need it now, it&#x27;s a great price and the look doesn&#x27;t mean summer... it&#x27;s great anytime of the year (except of course on Christmas... but then again on New Year&#x27;s you can wear again!) LoL... anyway.. if you are still reading this... then get it already! :)</li>
    <li> Came pretty fast and the price was right, couldn&#x27;t pass it up.Very nice item.I usually can&#x27;t afford anything for myself so I was so happy to find this.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom.It is pretty good and colourful，she very love it.Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
    <li> they came faster than i thought they would ! they are hard clips and a bit cheep , but you only pay like $1.00 for them so worth it !</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price, I am happy that I purchased this. You just have to be patient for the long delivery times.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this was only a dollar!! It&#x27;s beautiful! What a deal. I didn&#x27;t think it would be of such a high quality, but it is. It&#x27;s metal not plastic and the gems look colorful, but very elegant.</li>
    <li> I can wear this to almost anything! It looks just like described. No scratches or missing gems. Its sturdy and I can recommend this product most definitely. Shipping takes a bit but it&#x27;s coming from China! So if your willing to wait, its definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a cute hair clip. I have long, almost waist length, thick heavy hair, and this clip holds it back and stays in place. At this price I&#x27;m going to order a couple more for gifts.</li>
    <li> ordered 4 of the hair clips. Reading some of the reviews I was a little concerned, but figured for the price I could just throw them away if they were really bad.  Love them, the colors are great and all were different.  Have 4 teenagers who will love having them. Something different.</li>
    <li> Very Pretty.  I will wear it when I go out somewhere nice.  When my husband takes me out to a nice restraunant.</li>
    <li> I think this is really an adorable little peacock.  I was more than content with the quality given what I paid.  Nice little decorative creature.  Rhinestones all secure and it holds in the hair well.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty hair clip! It works very well and adds a festive look to your hair any time you wear it! It is a wonderful looking piece of jewelry for a very inexpensive price! Well worth your attention and money!!!!! Plus, it was delivered very quickly!!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with the hair clip. Unlike some reviews, all the studs were in place. I am so happy with my purchase.. They are sturdy and I plan on wearing these after I get my hair braided... I love them... I bought 2 of them....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who both likes doing her hair and peacocks. She loves it and wears it all the time but it is about on its last leg now. She says is doesnt hold her hair as tightly as when we first bought it.</li>
    <li> Great price for something that can hopefully be enjoyed for years.  Don&#x27;t know how long the finish will wear nor\how long the stones will stay attached. but for the price, it was definately worth the investment.  Shipping was quick, considering it came from another country..</li>
    <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do this clip justice. It is was brighter than the images provided. I was worried my hair would be too thick for it to hold but so far it&#x27;s holding wonderfully. Everything is staying in place nothing is slipping out really like it so far. Really happy I ordered two.</li>
    <li> Loved wearing this hair ornament.  I have worn it twice already and received compliments both time.  All the stones seem to be set well.  Very colorful and looks great in my dark auburn hair.</li>
    <li> If it comes as pretty as the bracelet I will surely love it but I won&#x27;t know that because I HAVE NOT RECIEVED THIS ITEM YET.  I AM STILL WAITING TO SEE HOW IT WILL LOOK WHENEVER I GET THIS HAIR CLIP.  CAN&#x27;T WAIT BECAUSE IT LOOKS REAL PRETTY IN THE PICTURE.  THANKS AGAIN, ILENE GONZALES,584 MORSE LANE, ELKO, NV 89801</li>
    <li> Considering the fact that this was pretty inexpensive, shipping included, I am pretty happy with my overall purchase. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes that this would be delivered within a week or even two weeks. The shipping estimate said about a month so I pretty much forgot about it and then I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up. The quality is pretty decent, too. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s made of but I don&#x27;t have any plans on putting it in my mouth nor do I expect that anyone else in my house will either so that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and this clip actually holds my hair up/in, which is a difficulty of mine. I would recommend this product for something inexpensive and unique, but don&#x27;t expect high quality craftsmanship as some of the stones can be placed a bit off of their settings or crooked a bit. This will probably only bother those who are ocd or high class.</li>
    <li> The price was right, so it was worth a shot, but it came with 2 of the jewels out (found in plastic wrapping) and the clip can&#x27;t actually hold any of my hair, more of a decorative clip.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is much more beautiful than I expected. My daughter loves it and wears it often. Great value!</li>
    <li> For the money - it&#x27;s ok. The &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; are pretty - metal work is cheap looking. I&#x27;ll have to make sure the meetal part is covered by my hair.</li>
    <li> The pic made it look way bigger than it was.  And it said it was crystals but it&#x27;s actually plastic.</li>
    <li> If you wear this ur hair won&#x27;t come from it..&lt;br /&gt; It fits perfectly.. I loved it.... It&#x27;s very cheap too</li>
    <li> The hair clip that I received is a peacock. Other than that, it bears no resemblance to the striking piece in the picture. So disappointed, especially since I bought other items to match</li>
    <li> This is really gorgeous. All of the gems are vibrant, and the clip is study and seems like it will hold up my hair, which is a feat and a half. I love this clip!</li>
    <li> The clip was exactly as described. Very pretty design with bright stones. Good value for the price! Thank you, very much!</li>
    <li> Got this in the expected time frame (takes a bit longer because it&#x27;s from overseas, but not an unreasonable amount of time). It&#x27;s vibrant and beautiful. The quality is amazing for the DOLLAR I spent on it! WOW!!!</li>
    <li> This is a well constructed hair clip. It is pretty but the colors are a but brighter than they appear in the photos - they appear to be more earth-tone colors in the photo but are more like a step or two down from neon colors.</li>
    <li> WE TURNED AROUND &amp; ORDERED SOMEMORE CAUSE ALL OUR WOMEN WANTED THESE! DOES&#x27;NT HURT TO HAVE 2 SO U CAN EXPERIMENT WITH YOUR STYLES...~</li>
    <li> These clips only cost $1.00 so it&#x27;s no big deal if they don&#x27;t last or if I lose one. They are cute and trendy!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was thinking. It is fancy without going overboard. It is lightweight which is good since heavy hairclips give me a headache. I love the colors and the style of clip. I would love to have this in different shades or solid colors. Love it, thanks.</li>
    <li> I get many compliments on this hair clip. My hair is thin and it hold well plus it&#x27;s very cute</li>
    <li> I love it. Just got here already in my hair. I have waist length hair and I love to use something extra when I do my hair. I may be older then some of the other ladies that have purchased this but I didn&#x27;t let that stop me. Now that I have one to look at I may be ordering a few more as Christmas gifts for some young ladies I know. It grips well for the style of clip it is and that was a nice surprise to me most time one this type of clip I have to use something to make a none slip pad on part of the clip so it will stay in. So far it has not done the slipping out of hair action so that is a plus. For thinner hair then my own you may have to use it with a ponytail, braid or hair bun but it would work out fine. Will keep my eye out for more hair pieces like this from this seller.</li>
    <li> It does take a while to arrive, but it&#x27;s a dollar, so that&#x27;s fine. Mine looks exactly like the picture and the clip itself is actually pretty great. Normally hair clips like this pull my hair, but this one holds it back without hurting. It&#x27;s more than worth the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered two other similar hair clips because they looked brighter in color, but when those other two arrived, they were smaller and duller than the picture. Contrarily, this one is far prettier than the picture shows. Much preferred.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than pictured but what a beautiful clip. I cant believe how well made it is for the cheap price. I&#x27;m ordering a few more for my girlfriends they just loved mine!</li>
    <li> This came two weeks earlier than I was told it could. The piece is stunning I am going to buy some and give them as gifts. Great buy for only a dollar.</li>
    <li> The price was extremely reasonable so I really didn&#x27;t think the quality would be there.  I was mistaken.  this is a beautiful peace and I get lots of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Lovely Vintage Jewelry Crystal Peacock Hair Clip ...very nice work, for my sister&#x27;s birthday she just loves the hair clip</li>
    <li> I was surprised it came so quickly in about a week. Came in great shape and looked lovely with my hair up in a bun. You can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
    <li> These hair clips are very attractive, unfortunately, the stones keep falling off.  I had to reglue 5 stones on the first day that I got it.</li>
    <li> This beautiful hair clip arrived quickly and was very affordable. I bought it as a gift but now...I&#x27;ll just have to order another one.</li>
    <li> The pin is somewhat different that the picture. The colors are not the same. I was a little disapointed with it. But overall the delivery was very quick.</li>
    <li> Cheap and not very fast shipping but its worth the wait is actually better than I expected but I wonder if they do whole sale on product so I can sell them because I think for one dollar is a great deal good quality and very pretty I recommend yes!</li>
    <li> I think it looked better in the pic then in real life hands on. I am sure I might wear it here and there... But it&#x27;s not this huge great find for cheapo if thats what you think your getting. It&#x27;s basic and cheaper then you would find at Walmart or something. It was a good deal But like I said looks better in the pic.</li>
    <li> Received peacock hair clip in good condition. It was as I expected. Would order items again. It&#x27;s beautiful and I have been using it often already. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for me but it&#x27;s smaller than I thought &amp; my hair is too thick for it. But my daughter took it over &amp; it&#x27;s gorgeous in her hair! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair clip, its very pretty and its not going to fall apart quickly.  In fact I may buy another.  Its very pretty very sturdy very nice.  BTW-I have very fine thin hair and it works great in my hair to pull it all up not neccesarily just to have a hair clip if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the beautiful hair clip. It looked lovely and had many beautiful colors, just like the picture.</li>
    <li> This vintage look hair clip fashioned as a peacock is very colorful and beautiful.  It holds the hair in place and makes the style look elegant</li>
    <li> This is really cute.  It seems to be made nice. and the price was right.  It not too big,  but is big enough to see in your hair.  The clip is made of metal.</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes the clip. She has thick hair so she uses it as accent piece on her hair</li>
    <li> they ARE lovely. they are fun to wear and make your hair look better.  I enjoy experimenting with them, as well.</li>
    <li> This hair accessory is adorable and great quality for the price! I am completely satisfied. I wear it almost every day.</li>
    <li> I like the clip. I ordered 3 of them, and paided under $5.00 for all 3. I figured they would be junk but, to my surprise, the clip is very durable. I know that one day all of the faux jewels will fall off but for $5.00 it is not a bad purchase. The only complaint I had about the clips were the amount of time it took to receive them. I know that this purchase was being shipped from Hong Kong, but it took well over a month after I ordered them to receive them. I have purchase products online in the past that was being shipped from Asia, but I have never had to wait no more than 2 1/2 weeks to receive them. Overall I think this is still a good purchase.</li>
    <li> It  is so pretty and it&#x27;s not heavy in my hair. I had to wait a little while for it. But I love it</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the Peacock Hair Clip and she said it stays in her hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipment too !!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, and she loves it! It&#x27;s much prettier in person, very sparkly. The weight is good, and even though you know it&#x27;s not &#x27;expensive&#x27; it really does look like it&#x27;s worth much more than I paid for it. For the price, it&#x27;s excellent. Plus, it arrived much faster than I would have expected something shipping from over seas would have.&lt;br /&gt;I would happily buy more of them!</li>
    <li> The clip part of the of peacock was broken but the jewel part was intact. It&#x27;s a shame because it was very pretty product.</li>
    <li> This is so much more beautiful and of higher quality than I expected for the price. I have thick hair and it stays put. Very cute for the season!</li>
    <li> This clip is strong sturdy and goes with almost anything. The clip stays in place which i have trouble with other clips staying put. worth more than cost</li>
    <li> I thought this was a nice stocking stuffer. This is a great gift for a teenager. I think anyone who receives this, would love it!</li>
    <li> VERY INEXPENSIVE, LOVELY, HOLDS MY THICK HAIR GREAT AND I GET COMPLIMEMNTS ALL THE TIME, FOR WHAT ITS WORTH, ITS BEAUTIFUL AND I WOULD GIVE THIS AS A GIFT, OR RECCOMEND TO A FRIEND</li>
    <li> Great value. But understandably why. The clip is pictured  a lot larger than its actual size. Still, it is very colorful and true to detail. Order two.</li>
    <li> I loved it but my teenage daughters for whom I bought them for did not like them. It was a good price so it was worth a try.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a long time, but I knew it would.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I had actually forgotten about it. It was like getting a nice present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was great, 1.50!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sturdy little clip that I now use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Very versatile too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest giving it a try.</li>
    <li> This was the bargain of the month!  Well made and definitely worth the price.  Would keep it if I had the hair, but will be giving as a gift.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely stunning Peacock clip. I bought it on a whim as I love shiny things, and was definitely not disappointed. Even though it shipped from Hong Kong, I had it within the week. The clip seems sturdy, as does the general construction, which was more than I expected from a piece of jewelry from China (I know that sounds awful, but I was expecting something more along the lines of a &amp;#34;Claires&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Forever21&amp;#34; piece which I usually just end up using as decor for my craft room). I&#x27;ve actually worn this multiple times since receiving, and had many compliments. None of the jewels seem loose, nor does the clip itself. It does not pull or tear at my hair, but has enough grip to hold my fine, soft tresses in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a beautiful little gift at a great price.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is looks much better than the picture. I bought 2 as Christmas gifts. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since they were so inexpensive but I was shocked when they arrived! They are stunning in person! They don&#x27;t look cheaply made at all. In fact I ended up ordering 1 for myself. When I wore it a friend commented on how much she loved it so I ordered 1 for her. I&#x27;m going to order a few more as birthday gifts.</li>
    <li> This was a beautiful and bright hair accessory! I gave it as a gift and it was greatly appreciated :)</li>
    <li> Arrived before the delivery window. My 17yo put it in her hair as soon as it came out of the package. More than anything, I LOVE the price!!!! You can&#x27;t beat a good product for a good deal!</li>
    <li> I got a bunch of these clips (twelve, to be exact) and handed them out as little Christmas gifts for all my girlfriends. I was worried about the quality of the clips since the price was so low. But, it was DEFINITELY worth it! The clips are adorable. The stones sparkle and look beautiful against the gold colored metal. I love them and my friends went crazy for them! They were sure they were way more expensive than what I paid for them. I highly recommend these as gifts!</li>
    <li> Ordered on Jan 15 got to me Jan 20th great shipping and really stunning for the price I paid! If you want to take a chance on something small this is it. Love it!</li>
    <li> This takes a while to arrive from overseas, but it is well worth the wait.  It is good quality and has little teeth to hold its position in your hair.  The colors are so nice and I get compliments on it every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> This clip, is similar to a large alligator clip in the way you insert it into the hair.  When I make a messy bun on the side of my head, I just slide this clip in, and it&#x27;s an instant fancier look.  I think the clip is so cute and it could be dressed up or down.  For the price, this clip is way awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this piece for a friend because she loves peacocks. It is a very nice hair clip. It is better than I expected it to be and it is nicer looking than even the pictures show. The hair clip is very colorful. Very nice piece especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is very pretty and sturdy. Adds pizzaz to any pony tail or up-do. The photo does this no justice as it is very vibrant and is a good enough size to be seen, but not gawdy.</li>
    <li> I got this on a whim because it was so cheap. It is fun to wear on messy bun hair days. It is not of great quality, but for the price, it is a fun addition to my accessories.</li>
    <li> Stunning piece, all my friends want one now! The clips stays secure no need for bobby pins, that&#x27;s awesome for me with unruly hair</li>
    <li> this came very quickly.  Very pretty and far sturdier than i expected for the price.  very pleased would buy again.</li>
    <li> you will like this it gives boring hair great effect and I didn&#x27;t know what to do with my hair so I just threw this on everyone said was really cute. Does look really great on a bun</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars because it&#x27;s so beautiful and stays put even in with my baby fine straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to go to a craft store and find a bag of teardrop crystals to replace just one... well maybe more&lt;br /&gt;if they keep falling out. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> it is a very nice piece for my hair and it just looks so eligent and it is just nice</li>
    <li> I know I know 5 stars?! I do feel like it will fall apart after a few months worth of wears.  &amp; I thought that this would be made of some sort of metal but it&#x27;s a plastic sort of similar to PVC... The \\&quot;crystals\\&quot; are plastic crystals but they look ok enough.  The clasp I don&#x27;t think is strong enough to grab ahold American thin hair... I have full curly hair that grips easily.  BUT WTH... it&#x27;s $1.99... I&#x27;ve already worn the item and it was pretty enough to get a few compliments.  I&#x27;m really picky on what I wear because if it looks cheap and tacky then I really would just have given to my nieces because they would love it no matter what.  Besides, I&#x27;m not going to be wearing everyday...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it did take longer than expected to ship from Hong Kong then other items I ordered same day (from other Amazon shops)... But again, if you don&#x27;t need it now, it&#x27;s a great price and the look doesn&#x27;t mean summer... it&#x27;s great anytime of the year (except of course on Christmas... but then again on New Year&#x27;s you can wear again!)  LoL... anyway.. if you are still reading this... then get it already!  :)</li>
    <li> everything in order&lt;br /&gt;recieved it safely&lt;br /&gt;in time&lt;br /&gt;and with no problem&lt;br /&gt;safely in its package&lt;br /&gt;no damage&lt;br /&gt;its beautifull</li>
    <li> This is a very beautiful clip but this was my 2nd time ordering it. The 1st one broke before she could wear it, but my daughter loved it so much I had to buy another one. So far the 2nd one is still intact but have to be carful when putting I in her hair.</li>
    <li> Sturdy clip in piece that you can wear any way with almost anything.. So colorful and shiny. Youll love this hair clip</li>
    <li> I have 3 daughters and haven&#x27;t desided which one will get these , I&#x27;m sure they all will want one though.</li>
    <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy more. They look expensive, and are perfect for last-minute gifts. They are very elegant, and match everything.</li>
    <li> Thought I would like it never came. I DIDN&#x27;T GETNYTHINGI ORDERS FROM HONG KONG.WOULG REALL Y WOULD LOVE FOR THEM TO COME WERE SUPPO WE TOO BE HERE IN THIS MA RCH.</li>
    <li> So, this was two bucks and took a ga-jillion years to arrive (honestly, a month) because it shipped from China BUT it is totally cute and not generic material, so I was happy with it. It will take awhile for you to get it, but come on, it is two bucks AND it doesn&#x27;t fall apart and is as described and so cute once you get it. Totally worth it! It is metal, not plastic, and none of the gemstones have fallen off.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister.  I was pleased with it and so was she.  Very pretty and sparkly.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! Its gorgeous and I have gotten a lot of complements on it. Heavy duty too!</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I bought this product.  You are able to wear it both casually and formally.  And it is durable</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the price on this clip! For less than $2, I got a great accessory! It fits perfectly - the clip itself is sturdy. And, the gems do not look cheap or cheesy! It did take a few weeks to arrive - but I believe it came from China, which I did not realize when I bought, but arrived in great shape.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a friend as a gift. She was so happy and said it was so very  pretty.</li>
    <li> very colorful and nice looking but they looked old not shining. But for the price was ok. would love to see it shining.</li>
    <li> I also bought this for a gift for my daughter and it was prettier in person than pictured. Happy with the purchase :)</li>
    <li> I was not expecting too much from this dollar item coming on the slow boat from china but it was better than expected. The colors were a good arrangement and the clip looked better than the dollar I paid for it.</li>
    <li> This thing holds my hair MUCH better than I thought it would for such a cheap product. Really surprised me.</li>
    <li> i love this hair clip. its so cute and looks like its worth more than what i paid for. i would recommend this to someone</li>
    <li> It was very cute. Did not look cheap. My daughter just loved it. I also got one for my niece and she loved it as well.</li>
    <li> It is very lovely item for your tresses. This fits so well I admire the baby. I highly recommend to all</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this clip, for the price I paid! It has colorful rhinestones, which are glued well. I have seen some clips with stones glued, and the glue is visible. But not in this one. The back of the clip is golden metal. It&#x27;s quite sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;This clip will eventually break if you try to fit in all your hair, otherwise, I don&#x27;t see it breaking, as 1 of the reviews mention.&lt;br /&gt;Will look very pretty on darker hair. Look at the pics I posted. Looks much better in person though.</li>
    <li> Everybody keeps asking me where I got it from! I am very satisfied with my choice and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Pretty details Three red jems in the peacock head plume...details look like markacite in places. All the little gems are arranged and so colorful and well placed. i have to recommend this little ditty it is more than worth the little dollar.</li>
    <li> This came and is a great hair piece. Nice quality with bright colors. Well worth the money and the bit of extra time it takes to ship.</li>
    <li> I would def. recommend...which I already have...  I thought it looked pretty in the pic but it is absolutely beautiful in person.  A lot brighter then the pic.  I am actually ordering another one!  Only draw back if you had to have a con, it is a little heavy, but I have thick hair and it does have teeth to grip the hair.  Plus shipping was super quick compared to what was estimated.  My first appeal was the price and I thought &amp;#34;its cute and for the price can&#x27;t pass it up...department stores I would be paying much much more so its worth a shot!&amp;#34; Well worth every penny!!!  Would be a great stocking stuffer, brides maid gifts, bridal shower gift...etc.</li>
    <li> I like it but wish it wasn&#x27;t as bright and cheap looking depiste it being cheap.(I need four more words sorry)</li>
    <li> This was pretty cheap, but it looks it. It is partially made of plastic so it will only work in really thin and light hair. I put it in a cup and it looks cute but I will never use it. It took over a month to get here too.</li>
    <li> This piece is #1 in my collection.  This is the best quality piece I own.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it&#x27;s actually made of metal and not plastic.  The stones sparkle brilliantly, the detail is fantastic and the piece is well crafted.  My other pieces come close, but none compare to this piece.  Its extremely high quality for a honey of a price.  Truly the best purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    <li> i did not like any of tha products it was a waste of money and time . would not get again</li>
    <li> purchased this for a friend and she cant stop wearing it she adores this thing its her precious! very great</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a &#x27;let&#x27;s see what this is&#x27; buy.  Low and behold I received a very pretty, sturdy hairclip! It is made of metal not plastic.  And it really holds the hair well.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> I have extremely long hair that I like to pull up on hot days. I was surprised at how much hair this clip will hold. It kept my hair cute all day long... And for working in a library it fit the bill :)</li>
    <li> The design is pretty and the colours are bright, but after wearing it once the clip broke in half(it wasn&#x27;t even dropped). Probably not worth the money even if you are VERY gentle with it.</li>
    <li> Its a steal for the price. Would probably cost at least $5 at any store. Colors are vibrant, gems all in tack, stays in my hair perfectly, just beautiful.</li>
    <li> It took a little while to get here, but I was disappointed. The simple clip design makes it easy to use and its elegant enough for going out dressed up, or dressing down in jeans.</li>
    <li> The colors are more vibrant than I had expected, as from the given photo. Nevertheless, I am thrilled with my new hair clip.</li>
    <li> It was beautiful, but sadly it broke before I even took it out of the bag. Would not recommend sadly.</li>
    <li> The hair clip was described as having rhinestones but they were not real (which is made of glass) they were made out of plastic.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! It came within a week! And it&#x27;s so cute! Great service! All around awesome! This is a must buy!</li>
    <li> For a dollar, it&#x27;s a great buy. One jewel fell off but i just crazy glued it. It&#x27;s not really for grabbing hair, especially thick hair but it&#x27;s a great accent piece.</li>
    <li> fits perfect, got her on time, with all the colors it goes with everything. I get many compliments when I wear it. my sister and mother are jealous</li>
    <li> I like them alot and look forward to pining my hair back more (long and lots of it) and wearing them with a bun or updo.</li>
    <li> I really like this cute hair ornament. I call it an ornament, more than a functional clip. It&#x27;s definitely sturdier than I expected, but small enough that I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to hold up to the load of a thick bunch of hair. I typically put my hair up in an updo &amp; then use this pretty clip to keep the tendrils off the nape of my neck, or just clipped in along the side of my hair to look nice. If you&#x27;re looking for an ornament and are willing to take the risk that it might not survive shipping (the padded envelope seems to leave it up to the whims of the postal service because I could totally see it breaking if mishandled in shipping or smooshed under something heavy) then definitely go for it. I&#x27;m happy with mine.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting the product to be as nice as it actually looks, it&#x27;s resistant and looks delicate... It really looks just like the picture... I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was happy for the fact that it came quickly, great customer service, but the clip does not hold long heavy hair like mine. So, I use this for my daughter instead. Not built very well, but it is worth the money they ask for and nothing more than that.</li>
    <li> I use the clip all the time, its been very sturdy and I have thick curly hair. I love it! Can&#x27;t beat the price well worth buying, goes with everything! Hair stunner ;)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, since the product was only 90 cents, but this was pretty bad.  I thought the gems were going to be a muted color like they are in the picture, but they were way too bright. It looked like something The Nanny would wear.</li>
