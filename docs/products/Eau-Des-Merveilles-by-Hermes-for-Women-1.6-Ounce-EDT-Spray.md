      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>AND I GET SO MANY COMPLIMENTS FROM BOTH MEN AND WOMAN</li>
      <li>And since they&#x27;ve discontinued Chanel No. 19, I&#x27;ve been trying things that are lovely but not quite what I have been looking for.</li>

      <li>It has several great reviews, so I must imagine men like it, but I feel like I am putting on a man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously, although this could be a year round fragrance, it&#x27;s perfect for winter.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet without being cloying, spicy without being mannish, and yet somehow, it smells</li>
      <li>One of my all-time favorites, it is good for day or night and is very soft, never heavy.  </li>
      <li>Great year round scent with a hint of mandarine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s warm, a bit spicy, and the orange definitely comes through as does the balsam.  </li>
      <li>I got right on Amazon and ordered it</li>
      <li>First time I have ordered my scent over Amazon.  </li>
      <li>fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>Light enough not to give me a headache.</li>
      <li>IT IS UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT</li>
      <li>Such a rich classy fragrance!  </li>
      <li>The long lasting scent and gentle ness makes this my favorite.  </li>
      <li>And actually rather reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It is, and was much cheaper and will last longer than a trip to the beach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s complex without being confusing, and it&#x27;s gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>IT IS SOFT YET SENSUAL AND LASTS ALL DAY LONG.</li>

<li> It has some of the same rich green notes as the late, lamented Chanel 19,  but it&#x27;s a totally different fragrance.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a light summery scent;  it evokes Christmas trees and hothouse flowers.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been such a horribly cold winter, and I purchased this based on the reviews as a dead of winter pick me up.  </li>
<li> Not good to wear in the morning.</li>
<li> It&#x27;ll definitely get me through the rest of this awful winter!</li>
<li> I hate it.</li>

    <li> I hate it. I thought it has a very strong scent. Not good to wear in the morning.</li>
    <li> Kind of smells like a man&#x27;s cologne.  It has several great reviews, so I must imagine men like it, but I feel like I am putting on a man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> Such a rich classy fragrance!  It&#x27;s all I ever wear!</li>
    <li> I was walking through the Art Institute of Chicago and there was the most amazing scent.  I found myself following the scent. It wasn&#x27;t overpowering but was amazing. And since they&#x27;ve discontinued Chanel No. 19, I&#x27;ve been trying things that are lovely but not quite what I have been looking for. This is it. And actually rather reasonably priced. I stopped the Woman and asked her what she was wearing - after telling her I adored it. I got right on Amazon and ordered it and it was waiting for me when I got home.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Light enough not to give me a headache. A feminine/masculine scent. Love it.</li>
    <li> fast shipping!  Great price.  I enjoy the scent and for this price it is even more enjoyable.  Thank you and keep posting.</li>
    <li> One of my all-time favorites, it is good for day or night and is very soft, never heavy.  People ask me what frangrance I am wearing or tell me I smell wonderful all the time.  This is a must-have!</li>
    <li> really nice scent but dissipates. also the spritzer broke!</li>
    <li> The fragrance does not last.</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS PERFUME.  IT IS UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT AND I GET SO MANY COMPLIMENTS FROM BOTH MEN AND WOMAN WHEN WEARING IT.  IT IS SOFT YET SENSUAL AND LASTS ALL DAY LONG.</li>
    <li> I receive compliments every time I wear this perfume.  I must have to add to your collection.</li>
    <li> First time I have ordered my scent over Amazon.  The price was good.  The cologne seemed not as fresh as those for which I&#x27;ve paid more.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged and fresh smell.  The long lasting scent and gentle ness makes this my favorite.  I will get another one when this gets low.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is simply wonderful.  It&#x27;s warm, a bit spicy, and the orange definitely comes through as does the balsam.  It&#x27;s complex without being confusing, and it&#x27;s gorgeous.  It has some of the same rich green notes as the late, lamented Chanel 19,  but it&#x27;s a totally different fragrance.  It&#x27;s sweet without being cloying, spicy without being mannish, and yet somehow, it smells clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been such a horribly cold winter, and I purchased this based on the reviews as a dead of winter pick me up.  It is, and was much cheaper and will last longer than a trip to the beach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, although this could be a year round fragrance, it&#x27;s perfect for winter.  It&#x27;s not a light summery scent;  it evokes Christmas trees and hothouse flowers.  It&#x27;ll definitely get me through the rest of this awful winter!</li>
    <li> Eau Des Merveilles has become my signature perfume! I love it!  It was shipped promptly and packaged securely. Great year round scent with a hint of mandarine.  Thank you!!!!</li>
