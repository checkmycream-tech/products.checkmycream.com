      <li>These bottles are the perfect price and size for what I need.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality.</li>
      <li>Excellent service and great product!</li>
      <li>Good size, great spray!  </li>
      <li>Some sneak I am LOL.</li>
      <li>Spray function isn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Great size for my needs.  </li>
      <li>Good quality,  mist spray works well, sturdy cap.</li>
      <li>I got these for a good price.  </li>
      <li>They are the perfect size &amp; were very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I bought these because some of the perfumes that I own no longer spray</li>
      <li>The spray nice and have not leaked if I keep that cap on.  </li>
      <li>Fast service and great price!</li>
      <li>I am using these to make my own spray inks using Sharpie insides and alcohol and they work fabulous for that!</li>
      <li>(which in my case is homemade bug spray) gets stuck in the top and leaks out.</li>
      <li>I love that they are plastic so that I can write in Sharpie to label them.</li>
      <li>Glad Amazon carries them</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but somehow water or whatever you have in there</li>
      <li>A kid never notices it even fell out, and once it&#x27;s not installed, the sprayer becomes more of an oozer, making it unusable.</li>
      <li>I wanted a more &amp;#34;attractive&amp;#34; looking misting bottle for my purposes, but none of them available at the time seemed to work the way i wanted based on reviews.</li>
      <li>Easy to use pump.</li>
      <li>Bottles leak and do not spray a &amp;#34;fine mist&amp;#34; but rather a strong stream....</li>
      <li>The mist is strong, but controlled.</li>
      <li>When sprayed, a fine mist is needed for each one and these bottles fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Refill them from Costco free refill.</li>
      <li>They work better than some of the original bootles and are nice to have at a modest price.</li>
      <li>Quick to ship these, however some of them didn&#x27;t spray at all.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>I spent a good 20 minutes trying to tamper with them to no avail.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, sure screw top--all vital if used for travel, but useful, preferable, under any circumstances.</li>
      <li>Better off getting a cheap one at the dollar store that costs less and leaks just as much :)</li>
      <li>They were a good price and size but about half the sprayers didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>Works exactly like i hoped they would.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already tried 4 out of the 6 and none of them work after the first 5 or 6 sprays or fewer.</li>
      <li>Every time I try to spray something, I have to deal with large leaky blobs all over the place and my hands.</li>
      <li>I think if I&#x27;d been the only one using the bottles, they probably would&#x27;ve been fine.</li>
      <li>No matter how much i tighten it, it leaks.</li>
      <li>Good mist action and covers a lot of area for a small nozzle.</li>
      <li>Also, they leak a little around the top.</li>
      <li>I tried the last 2 with pure water and the exact same thing happened.</li>
      <li>An adult would probably see it, reinsert it, and then move on.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve used three and one of them is leaky.</li>
      <li>Not a huge deal considering how cheap they were, but next time I think I would look for firm-sided bottles.</li>

<li> These are hard to find in a local shop.</li>

<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> I now just have a bunch of plain plastic bottles with leaky lids basically.</li>
<li> The problem is that there is a small plastic piece inside the sprayer itself that can fall out.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually like writing bad reviews, but these definitely did not work for me.</li>
<li> Hard to imagine it&#x27;s a fluke since all six work equally as poorly.</li>
<li> So, that&#x27;s not good.</li>
<li> The plastic is very thin.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed I would not purchase them again.</li>

    <li> Bottles leak and do not spray a &amp;#34;fine mist&amp;#34; but rather a strong stream....</li>
    <li> I bought these bottles to hold my DIY primer and setting spray.  When sprayed, a fine mist is needed for each one and these bottles fit the bill.</li>
    <li> They were a good price and size but about half the sprayers didn&#x27;t work.  Sometimes if I cut a little bit of the tube on the sprayer they worked but some never did.  Also, they leak a little around the top.</li>
    <li> High-quality plastic and construction, efficient spray, sure screw top--all vital if used for travel, but useful, preferable, under any circumstances.</li>
    <li> Quick to ship these, however some of them didn&#x27;t spray at all.&lt;br /&gt;They ALL leaked.  I will not be buying these again.</li>
    <li> They work pretty well, but the soft sides of the bottles can make it difficult to spray sometimes. Also, a couple of the ones in my package leak from the sprayer when you&#x27;re using them. Not a huge deal considering how cheap they were, but next time I think I would look for firm-sided bottles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a teacher and wanted spray bottles for white board cleaner. I think if I&#x27;d been the only one using the bottles, they probably would&#x27;ve been fine. But they were intended to be used by the kids, and they just didn&#x27;t survive. The problem is that there is a small plastic piece inside the sprayer itself that can fall out. An adult would probably see it, reinsert it, and then move on. A kid never notices it even fell out, and once it&#x27;s not installed, the sprayer becomes more of an oozer, making it unusable.</li>
    <li> Spray function isn&#x27;t great. It doesn&#x27;t last long and starts dripping instead of spraying mist after a few pumps.</li>
    <li> Each of the six bottles don&#x27;t work. They do not mist -- they &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; a stream.  And they leak even thought the tops are tight. Hard to imagine it&#x27;s a fluke since all six work equally as poorly.</li>
    <li> Everyone of these bottles leaked. The plastic is very thin. I was very disappointed I would not purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Fast service and great price! Excellent quality. These are hard to find in a local shop.</li>
    <li> I am using these to make my own spray inks using Sharpie insides and alcohol and they work fabulous for that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using these to mist cleaning agents on my pistols. The mist is strong, but controlled. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Good size, great spray!  Pinterest will be my downfall with all the &amp;#34;make like the original&amp;#34; !!!!  Hard to find these locally!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like writing bad reviews, but these definitely did not work for me. I&#x27;ve already tried 4 out of the 6 and none of them work after the first 5 or 6 sprays or fewer. When they did work, the mist was perfect. I thought maybe it was the salt I had in the mixture I was using, but I tried the last 2 with pure water and the exact same thing happened. I spent a good 20 minutes trying to tamper with them to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;So basically this was a complete waste of money for me unless I can find a fix for it. I now just have a bunch of plain plastic bottles with leaky lids basically.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but somehow water or whatever you have in there (which in my case is homemade bug spray) gets stuck in the top and leaks out.</li>
    <li> I got these for a good price.  The spray nice and have not leaked if I keep that cap on.  The are fragile.  It stopped spraying after dropping.</li>
    <li> I have used two of the six bottles. No matter how much i tighten it, it leaks. Every time I try to spray something, I have to deal with large leaky blobs all over the place and my hands. In frustration, I have given up and tossed them away. Waste of money. Don&#x27;t bother with this product. Better off getting a cheap one at the dollar store that costs less and leaks just as much :)</li>
    <li> Nice sized bottles, just what I wanted, but they leak really bad.  Can&#x27;t use them and have given several away with liquid in them.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought these because some of the perfumes that I own no longer spray so I wanted to transfer the perfume to these plastic bottles. They are the perfect size &amp; were very inexpensive. I love that they are plastic so that I can write in Sharpie to label them.</li>
    <li> Good quality,  mist spray works well, sturdy cap.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and great product!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Works great.</li>
    <li> The spritzers on some of my sprays do not work or work well. That is when these bottles come in. They work better than some of the original bootles and are nice to have at a modest price.Glad Amazon carries them</li>
    <li> Bought these to put glasses cleaner in it and sprays mist as I wanted. Refill them from Costco free refill. Some sneak I am LOL.</li>
    <li> These bottles are the perfect price and size for what I need. It&#x27;s a practical size for a lot of different mixtures. So far I&#x27;ve used three and one of them is leaky. It drips fluid out of the lid when it&#x27;s tilted sideways. So, that&#x27;s not good.</li>
    <li> I wanted a more &amp;#34;attractive&amp;#34; looking misting bottle for my purposes, but none of them available at the time seemed to work the way i wanted based on reviews. So i settled on these. Works exactly like i hoped they would. Good mist action and covers a lot of area for a small nozzle. And when it came right down to it, i could care less about how it looks. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am using these to make homemade room sprays.  Great size for my needs.  The mist is just right.&lt;br /&gt;Convenient, yet discrete measuring marks on one side.  Easy to use pump.</li>
