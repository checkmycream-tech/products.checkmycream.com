<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We love Bronner soaps and this is one of our stand-bys.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this soap to make laundry detergent.  There are a couple other ingredients, but the soap is awesome, and smells GREAT!  It&#x27;s nice knowing what goes into your laundry detergent, and knowing there aren&#x27;t any crazy harsh chemicals.  This soap is also nice for just bathing or washing your hands</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap is the only soap that I purchase for bath use. Usually I&#x27;ll buy around $100.00 at a time to stock up with the three varieties that speak to me. I highly recommend this product that is sold for less on Amazon than the manufacturer is willing to sell it to me in quantity. Therefore we it seems that some person is able to buy this product for less from the manufacturer to afford them to sell this soap online at a retail price that is cheaper than the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> This product is great, and we really enjoyed it back when it was 17.00/six pack.  Unfortunately, at 25.00/six pack we will have to switch brands. It&#x27;s a shame because this is a great product that just priced itself out of formerly loyal customers.  We had been buying this stuff for years. If you have it to burn, this is a good pick.</li>
    <li> such a good quality, wholesome soap.  we use it for hand soap at every sink and use it for the kids&#x27; bath soap.  it&#x27;s great, pure, no yukky stuff.</li>
    <li> Just read their description, it pretty much says it all! I love this soap, it is very economical, produces a great, silky and foamy lather with only one turn under the water faucet! I won&#x27;t change it for any other!</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome. Love the almond scent. It does wear down fairly quickly, but what can you do?</li>
    <li> these are the best soaps - several choices of scent - all mild and skin soothing</li>
    <li> I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  She loved it and so did I.  It does not dry out your skin and it cleans thoroughly.  It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have that slight greasy coating I get from using another soap brand.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!! Due to cancer and the need for eliminating harmful chemical exposures...this soap is it!</li>
    <li> I have been using these bars for about 6 months and I LOVE them! I even got my mom hooked on them! A small amount suds up your entire body, and the bars seriously last forever. At the rate I&#x27;m at, I probably use 3-4 the entire year! The scent is light and not at all overpowering, and it cleans just as well as any other soap bar, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the bar on my face because it would probably dry out my sensitive face skin, but I used this bar everywhere else, even on my fresh tattoo because it contains nothing that would irritate a tattoo and I knew that no harsh chemicals were being absorbed by my body. It also feels good knowing you are supporting an all-organic company that actually cares about its consumers and its workers, unlike other store-bought soaps that put dangerous chemicals in their products because they only want your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these soap bars to everyone, and I will probably never use anything else besides Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Dr. Bonner soaps are great.  Not drying at all for your skin, nice subtle natural scent and you feel good that you are not polluting the environment.</li>
    <li> I love this soap it great for people with sensitive skin and it isn&#x27;t as drying as some other soaps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been switching all our cosmetics and cleaning supplies over to phthalate free, paraben free, unidentified fragrance free options. Not only is this a complicated process it is an expensive one too. After quite a bit of research and comparing soaps at the health food store I finally settled on Dr Bonner&#x27;s soaps as  being the most trustworthy and the safest for my family. Things I love about this bar soap :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Organic coconut oil, Organic palm oil, sodium Hydroxide (none remains after saponifying oils into soap and glycerin), Water, Organic Olive oil, Organic Hemp oil, Organic Jojoba oil, Natural Almond fragrance, Salt, Citric Acid and tocepherol.  The coconut, palm and Olive oil are fair trad certified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Vegan,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Label printed with water based ink on 100% waste consumer paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Almond and the Rose soaps so far. I very much prefer the Almond since the rose was a bit more astringent. I find that this soap is not at all drying to the skin and gentle enough to use on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price may seem steep I have not found it cheaper anywhere else and this bar soap lasts about 3 times as long as our bars of Dove used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price I am referring to is $22 for a pack of 6 (with free shipping over orders of $25) at the time of this review. If that has changed it may not be so good a deal any more. . . . There are many independent sellers who sell at higher prices on the Amazon website so this does make things even more complicated!</li>
    <li> Really cleans and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is the 1st bar of soap that has actually cleaned up my acne day by day &amp; helps to main it. Every day I could see a noticeable change. If any acne might flare up based on what food that has extra oil or any setting condition that would flare up acne occasionally, then just use this bar on that one area before you go to be or after a work out and you will see it clear in the matter of days.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, rinses off completely, no sticky residue. Fresh smelling. Can use the Ü scented for sensitive skin, but have used almond or lavender equally well in those cases.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap we use in our home.  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s makes the best everything! We love Almond, Peppermint, Baby Mild for our grandson, &amp; Tea Tree for sugar scrubs etc.  Almond has to be my favorite.  I like to use it as a base soap, then add any scent you&#x27;re in the mood for!!</li>
    <li> If for no other reason, I love reading all the spiritual sayings on the package. The fact that the soap smells good is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I like this soap a lot. I just don&#x27;t smell much almond on it. Maybe that&#x27;s good, it means there is not synthetic or otherwise undesirable chemicals in it. But I did kind of hope I&#x27;d be hit with wafts of almond smell when I washed with it.  I smell it, it&#x27;s just so faint.</li>
    <li> I started with a liquid castile soap, but decided a bar would be easier. I love the almond scent. This doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, just cleans well. It does sting my eyes if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
    <li> Great soap, rinses cleaner than any other in my opinion. Also a very ethical company and worth supporting.</li>
    <li> This soap is great!  My girlfriend loves the smell, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it cleans well, and its created ethically.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling.  Washes well and does not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronners is amazing. My family has several skin issues: eczema, acne, dry skin. Dr. Bronners helps each one of these issues. I will never use another soap.</li>
    <li> Some pretty strange people behind the company but I like the Bonner line of soap products. Very pure, very effective</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I use. I have dry/sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t take much to irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve tried so many soaps over the years only to keep coming back to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. I find the baby mild and almond to be the most gentle, but really any of these soaps are far superior to anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I mainly use the bar soap to make laundry detergent, but it is a great body cleanser and stain remover also. The almond has a nice, mild clean smell. So many uses for this soap. I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I normally buy the peppermint thought I would try Almond this time and I like it even more!! It has an awesome light fragrance not over powering but just enough. While a bit pricey as all Dr.Bonner&#x27;s soaps are they last a while. Seller was great no issues would recommend.</li>
    <li> Really love the smell and leaves you feeling clean!  Will be trying other scents in the future and the almond liquid castile soap as well.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this soap - the almond variant leaves my skin feeling very clean. Coming off of several years of using Dove for men, this soap is somewhat similar in that it creates a similar rich, gentle foam but it leaves my skin feeling cleaner with zero residue, whereas dove felt like a layer of something was being left behind on my skin (in a good way I guess). All in all, this soap feels like an upscale version of a basic hotel soap and that&#x27;s pretty much right on target for what I want from my soap. Would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I like the bar version of castile soap, they seem to lather more than the liquid. Although the liquid ones definitely have a stronger smell.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! Such amazing ingredient list and ethical philosophies I&#x27;m this brand. I feel better using this healthy stuff on myself and my kids, knowing it&#x27;s good for us and good for the environment. Almond is a lovely scent! I will be ordering it again soon and I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Love these soaps but my husband does complain a bit about dryness of his skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying lots of different soaps lately. I knew Dr. Bronner&#x27;s had been around for a long time but I had never tried it until now.  I LOVE this soap!  It&#x27;s silky smooth, lathers nicely, and smells good.  Now I&#x27;ll have to try ALL the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> The quality of the soap is great. It is pure. It smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that it is so expensive! It is about $4 per bar when it is on sale!!! I am not sure what to do because I am allergic to so many things.</li>
    <li> The best all natural soap you could buy.  Not hard and gets all the dirt off of your skin, leaving you smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap!  Haven&#x27;t used any other brands since discovering Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> So glad that Amazon sells this soap.  It is awesome.  First, it smells great.  It has a sweet, almond like scent that is not too strong.  It is great on the skin and does a great job of cleaning--and of course, it is vegan and cruelty free.  I just had company over and everyone asked what the soap was.  They loved it.  Also, the price on Amazon is a great deal.  It costs more in Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> If you are purchasing a 6 pack of this soap you more than likely already know how wonderful it is so I wont get to into that. It is great and I love it and the company is superior. That said I paid $4 and some change for the bars at target and by purchasing in a 6 pack I saved some cash. I really like the almond scent, it is light and I am not a big scent fan. I wash myself daily so In general my own smell is not fowl, thus I feel no need to smell like anything else. I find lavender kinda guyish, but the soap doesn&#x27;t really scent the skin, it is just about what you want to smell while showering. Great product, fantastic company, save a little and buy it in a 6 pack.</li>
    <li> Our family loves using this brand of soap. We like the idea of it being natural and not having all the extra ingredients that are questionable.  There&#x27;s a good variety of scent choices to choose from which is nice as I&#x27;m sensitive to some perfumes.</li>
    <li> A simple review for you.  The scent is delicious (if soap can, in fact, be delicious); not overpowering, but just a very pleasant almond smell. It lathers up well.  The bar lasts for quite a while (about a month and I use it twice a day).  Arrived on time.  Nothing not to like about this.</li>
    <li> This is a nice soap. All natural, long-lasting, effective product. It smells nice, although very faint. I was hoping for a slightly more potent aroma, but all in all am happy with this product. Might try a different type of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s next time, just to see if they smell any stronger!</li>
    <li> great product.  I have skin issue, other soap make me itchy, but this one make me feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> BEST soap I have tried!!!!</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely, light and gentle scent, large bar that lasts and leaves your body feel clean and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and this provider delivered the merchandise on schedule.  The product itself was fresh and packaged superbly.  Thank you!  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This soap smells amazing, suds well, and does wonders getting you clean without drying out skin.  Also seems to create less soap scum than most store brands.</li>
    <li> I love these soaps. They have a nice almondy scent which isn&#x27;t overpowering. The soap itself isn&#x27;t drying, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin but I have always been able to use Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soaps because they use natural ingredients and extracts. In a pinch if you are traveling it can cover all your soap needs and you can even use it in your hair if you need too. Great product, I have used it for a long time and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different soaps and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Almond soap is by far my favorite.  It is 100% vegan, non-GMO project verified, and made in the USA.  It has a lovely, light almond scent and lathers well.  It is very gentle on my skin and has never caused any tightness, itching, or irritation.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love all the Dr Bronner&#x27;s stuff...and this was my first purchase of the almond scent.  It has a very nice earthy smell that is not overpowering...I will be buying more</li>
    <li> The best soap I have ever used in the bath and I have tried dozens. Leaves my skin feeling great. Lasts longer than a glycerin soap.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.  This almond soap smells wonderful!!!  I use it for making homemade bodywash.</li>
    <li> This is the soap that got my husband off of the toxic chemical based soaps that are on most store shelves.  He loves this stuff and has used it for several years.  We will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> I love the almond soap.  It smells fabulous when first opened, and it provides a nice lather and cleans well.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap ever! I have sensitive skin and I use this on my face without any problems and even wash my hair with it! Fantastic stuff!</li>
    <li> My skin feels great after this soap, great for sensitive skin. Leaves me refeshed after a shower. I plan in trying the other Dr. Bronners flavors after these.</li>
    <li> Love all of Bronners soaps.  Lots of suds!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for years and the almond is by far my favorite.  I use this scent in the liquid form also.</li>
    <li> This is the way that soap is supposed to be. It is the only soap that i will use. I love it</li>
    <li> Love it! Use this soap to make my own laundry detergent!  Works great and smells even better!</li>
    <li> Product may be good. Not my type.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap, don&#x27;t expect the almond scent to be very prominent- one of the reasons why it&#x27;s so great!</li>
    <li> great for hand washing but had trouble in summer with all over body wash not bad in winter</li>
    <li> Originally bought some of this for my wife for Christmas a couple of years back as a stocking stuffer instead of the usual mall store stuff from bath and body works.  She really loves this soap and now my mother in law and daughter use it as well.</li>
    <li> Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps! They leave you feeling clean without having to worry about chemicals. The almond scent is very light, which some people may like, but I prefer the rose or eucalyptus scents better.</li>
    <li> Love the almond scent.  Not nearly as strong as the blue label Bronner&#x27;s soap.  High quality soap with great lather.</li>
    <li> Love this soap: lathers better than most, rinses clean, &amp; smells great!</li>
    <li> Excellent value, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Gentle, nice smell (not too strong), doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  I go through it very quickly!</li>
    <li> After 18 days of use, I had to use another bar because 85% of it was gone and the rest falls apart.  I used this soap for about 1 1/2 years and then noticed my skin was becoming increasingly drier.  I used it on my face for a shorter amount of time because it was very drying and I was starting to look older than my age! The almond scent is great but I found it to be very drying on my skin.</li>
    <li> This has been my face and body wash for the last five years. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. Though wish it was cheaper!</li>
    <li> Really like the almond scent... much better than some of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried (such as lavender). Feels much cleaner than regular soap, wish I would have discovered this sooner.</li>
