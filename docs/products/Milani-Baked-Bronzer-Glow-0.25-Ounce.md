    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like much but this powder will seriously last forever and is the perfect color to give a natural glow for fair to medium skin.</li>
    <li> Terrible. I have a medium complexion and the color made me look like a demented clown. I tried to salvage the purchase by applying it on my eyelids to see if it would work as an eye-shadow...no. It was still orange, sparkly, and terrible.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m happy with my purchase i used it and happy with the outcome....</li>
    <li> Exactly to its description and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> The top cap of it fell off when I got it which is annoying, it is ok otherwise although has a lot of red in it, if that is what you are going for then it will be good.</li>
    <li> The sparkles make it very shiny.</li>
    <li> Not highly pigmented. Shimmery.</li>
    <li> Love it great price great color stays on all day with no worries of reapplying it glad I found it</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good bronzer for the price. It&#x27;s not very dark and wouldn&#x27;t be a good bronzer for contouring because it does have some shimmer to it. But it doesn&#x27;t give skin a nice healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a good bronzer for months and purchased many different brands that ended up in the trash. I finally gave up the self-searching and took to Google to see suggestions on bronzer products. Milani was one of the top 10 brands of bronzing products. The site I used also gave me places to purchase and of course, Amazon, carried it and was the cheapest. After reading some of the reviews and seeing that no one really had anything bad to say about this product, I took the plunge and bought it. Needless to say, Google wins again at being correct!!! This is the BEST bronzer I have come across as of yet, and trust me, my checking account can vouch for being pinged time and time again for the purchase of another store bought bronzer. I am extremely satisfied with this product. It is a beautiful color and goes well with all my other makeup. It&#x27;s not to dark or orange so anyone with normal to tan skin tones should do great with this product. I&#x27;m always a little worried about trying different brands of any makeup due to the risk of breaking out but this product did not break me out any. It was like I had been using it forever!! The color is dark enough that you actually can notice that you are wearing makeup but subtle enough to not be overly indulging or the &amp;#34;clay pot&amp;#34; look as my mother likes to call it!! Love Milani products; even purchased the blush in Luminoso and it goes absolutely PERFECT with this bronzer. Makes for a beach girl/Cali girl look!!!</li>

Actually, I favor this Milani brand better. It provides just the perfect amount of shimmer without being excessively glittery.

    <li> Way TOO GLOWY for my middle-aged skin!!  Much more &#x27;glow&#x27; than color.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased by this bronzer. I have a tannish skin tone (1/4 peruvian) and not many bronzers show up on me. This one is so faint and beautiful with a light shimmer but no sparkles (which I hate). Comes with a compact case and brush. I am very pleased with this product! will buy again.</li>

    <li> Love the bronzer, goes on nicely just don&#x27;t want to do too much or it may end up a little orange. good overall</li>
    <li> love this product. I only need to apply once because I use a face-setting spray (Urban Decay &#x27;All Nighter&#x27; spray). Looks great, goes on easy and does not have that thick clumpy look and is not super orange.</li>
    <li> didnot receive my bronzer got a green eye crayon instead no pacakaging. would not recommend or buy again</li>
