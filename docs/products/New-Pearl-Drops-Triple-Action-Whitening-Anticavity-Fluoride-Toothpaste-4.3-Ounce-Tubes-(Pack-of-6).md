      <li>Pearl Drops works the best of any of the major products I have tried.      </li>
      <li>did I become concerned that I wasn&#x27;t able to locate it.  </li>
      <li>This product does not work any better than a $.97 tube of Ultrabright you can get at Walmart.  </li>
      <li>The best toothpaste in the world, however, can&#x27;t seem to find in stores locally.  </li>
      <li>I do not know why Pearl Drops are not stocked in stores any more.  </li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>This is a good product for maintaining a clean and healthy smile.     </li>
      <li>feeling CLEAN!</li>
      <li>It is by far the most effective tooth whitener on the market in my opinion.</li>
      <li>After using one tube I could not tell a significant amount of difference in the whitening of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I will most certainly try again.</li>
      <li>I finally got the bright idea to search Amazon, and there it was.  </li>
      <li>This product is great in terms that it leaves your mouth with an xtra clean feeling even after a little snacking.</li>
      <li>My teeth are in excellent shape, and I do not drink a lot of coffee, tea or dark soft drinks.</li>
      <li>Enjoy your clean, white smile :)</li>
      <li>minty fresh, not too menthol so that it irritates your palate or throat, and easy on sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>Great abrasive toothpaste for people with hard teeth.</li>
      <li>I drink hot tea/or coffee  &#x27;</li>
      <li>:) If your anything like me once you try it you won&#x27;t want to go back to anything else!</li>
      <li>we haven&#x27;t been able to find pearl drops in any of our stores recently.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand not so effective as a teeth whitener.</li>
      <li>And in all fairness, I have not found a toothpaste that has changed the appearance of my teeth that much.  </li>
      <li>I may wait a couple of weeks and try again because i would really like to use the 6 pack Pearl Drops that i purchased for $23.94...</li>
      <li>I love Pearl Drops toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t get all foamy in your mouth like some of the gel and other toothpastes.</li>
      <li>IT DOESENT FOAM LIKE MANY OTHER TOOTH PASTES I HAVE USED.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this toothpaste for close to 10 years, and recently I havent been able to find it in my local stores.</li>
      <li>I have been using Pearl Drops for at least 20 years and love it!  </li>
      <li>It is also available at walmart for less that $3 per pack</li>
      <li>almost daily&#x27; and being older and having older teeth...</li>
      <li>I LOVE my coffee, but it&#x27;s hard on my teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Pearl Drops tooth polish for nearly 5 years, now, and thought I would try their toothpaste...</li>
      <li>Even my dental hygienist asked me if I had them professionally done.    </li>
      <li>This item really cleans your teeth especially if you smoke.   </li>
      <li>I AM 63 YEARS OLD.</li>
      <li>It leaves my mouth tasting much fresher than regular paste.</li>
      <li>The icy mint flavor leaves you with fresh breath too.</li>
      <li>Your teeth are left feeling slick and tartar free.</li>
      <li>So recently I have bought a few different kinds of toothpaste to try out and can&#x27;t find anything that makes my mouth feel so clean or that I like the flavor.</li>
      <li>Your teeth will feel and look much cleaner than with any other paste.</li>
      <li>Not only does it not whiten in the least, it apparently doesn&#x27;t clean well or fight cavities--</li>

<li> Trouble was,</li>
<li> and i&#x27;m thinking this could be to harsh for some users like me.</li>
<li> The consistency is very little grit.</li>
<li> and now it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> Amazon, if you can&#x27;t publish a negative review I&#x27;ll never buy another product from you again.</li>
<li> toothpaste is gritty and nasty in texture, and didn&#x27;t feel like it did anywhere near the job of cleaning my teeth</li>
<li> I just had my boyfriend begin using a tube and within 3-weeks I can see a dramatic difference.  </li>
<li> I shy away from dental chairs and had not been to a dentist in almost 20 years.</li>
<li> Too bad they didn&#x27;t add peroxide.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I began using Pearl Drops on and off beginning when I was 17.  At that point in my life, I smoked like a chimney and drank coffee as if it was my lifeline (I worked at Starbucks--enough said).  Yet, I would constantly have friends comment on how white my teeth are.      Due to my travels, I didn&#x27;t use Pearl Drops for a few years.  It wasn&#x27;t until I returned to the US and began my search did I become concerned that I wasn&#x27;t able to locate it.  Thankfully Amazon came through and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.    I just had my boyfriend begin using a tube and within 3-weeks I can see a dramatic difference.  I like the one posted (regular tube of toothpaste) rather than the small version that sits on the cap.  I didn&#x27;t receive the same results with that line as I did with the tube.</li>
    <li> i was unable to find this in the store so glad for   Amazon</li>
    <li> we haven&#x27;t been able to find pearl drops in any of our stores recently.  We were so happy to learn that it wasn&#x27;t discontinued. It&#x27;s the only toothpaste that we&#x27;ve used that feels as if you&#x27;ve just left the dental hygenist chair after you use it.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I drink hot tea/or coffee  &#x27;almost daily&#x27; and being older and having older teeth... lol...i noticed my teeth were getting a dinge on them that daily brushings and my regular 6 month hygienist cleaning was just NOT removing. After reading several favorable reviews i thought i&#x27;d try the Pearl Drops Whitening Toothpaste. After a week of brushings with Pearl Drops i could visibly see a difference...but not without a downside......as i developed a small blister inside my lower lip that would NOT go away until i stopped using it. After a week or so i tried the Pearl Drops again and the blister reappeared. I may wait a couple of weeks and try again because i would really like to use the 6 pack Pearl Drops that i purchased for $23.94... you can do the math per tube. My regular toothpaste is not a &#x27;whitening&#x27; one and i&#x27;m thinking this could be to harsh for some users like me. Hope this helps you decide!</li>
    <li> I have tried gels, strips and trays...Pearl Drops works the best of any of the major products I have tried.      I&#x27;m a regular Diet Coke drinker - I brush my teeth morning and night. I often get compliments on how white my teeth are. Even my dental hygienist asked me if I had them professionally done.    The consistency is very little grit. Your teeth are left feeling slick and tartar free. The icy mint flavor leaves you with fresh breath too.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED PEARL DROPS TOOTH PASTE FOR 20+ YEARS NOW AND I LOVE IT, IT DOESENT FOAM LIKE MANY OTHER TOOTH PASTES I HAVE USED.  THE DENTIST SAYS I HAVE BEAUTIFUL TEETH. I AM 63 YEARS OLD.</li>
    <li> used all my life,nice white teeth.can not buy in stores,please do not stop selling this product.nice job amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I love Pearl Drops toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t get all foamy in your mouth like some of the gel and other toothpastes. I&#x27;ve used it for years and now it&#x27;s hard to find in stores. It gets the job done and leaves my teeth and mouth feeling CLEAN!</li>
    <li> I have been using Pearl Drops for at least 20 years and love it!  My dentist asked me how I keep my teeth so white and when I told him I use Pearl Drops he was amazed.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t describe how happy I was to find Pearl Drops at Amazon.  I hadn&#x27;t thought about it in years and didn&#x27;t even know it was still around.  Several months ago I found a tube in a local store and bought it.  I fell in love with it all over again but couldn&#x27;t find it again.  I finally got the bright idea to search Amazon, and there it was.  I will continue to order in quantity and hopefully not lose it again.  It is by far the most effective tooth whitener on the market in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for many years.  Helps remove smoke and coffee stains from teeth with less foam than other toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This product does not work any better than a $.97 tube of Ultrabright you can get at Walmart.  Not only does it not whiten in the least, it apparently doesn&#x27;t clean well or fight cavities--after two tubes I have a two cavities that weren&#x27;t there after my last checkup 6 months ago and a big dental bill.  Amazon, if you can&#x27;t publish a negative review I&#x27;ll never buy another product from you again.</li>
    <li> Oh how I wish I could find this toothpaste in the stores.  PErfect consistency, doesn&#x27;t make you gag, minty fresh, not too menthol so that it irritates your palate or throat, and easy on sensitive teeth.  In a word, PERFECT.</li>
    <li> This item really cleans your teeth especially if you smoke.   And the prices is a good value.  And Amazon will do auto delivery of the product.</li>
    <li> Once I find a product I like I stick with it. I have been using this toothpaste for close to 10 years, and recently I havent been able to find it in my local stores. So recently I have bought a few different kinds of toothpaste to try out and can&#x27;t find anything that makes my mouth feel so clean or that I like the flavor. So I am sooo thankful I can find it!! Even if it is online. :) If your anything like me once you try it you won&#x27;t want to go back to anything else! Enjoy your clean, white smile :)</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste in the world, however, can&#x27;t seem to find in stores locally.  So am thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> the product was delivered on time in the manner specified.  the product is the best we&#x27;ve found for cleaning our teeth.</li>
    <li> I had tried Pearl Drops toothpolish and decided to try the toothpaste as well. The toothpaste works as  well as the polish.  It leaves my mouth tasting much fresher than regular paste. I will most certainly try again.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. It&#x27;s the only toothpaste I will use. It&#x27;s a shame I have to go all the way to the UK to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Pearl Drops makes your teeth feel as though you have just come from the dentist. The slightly abrasive paste works wonders on plaque. I shy away from dental chairs and had not been to a dentist in almost 20 years. The hygenist was amazed that I had so little plaque build up. I attribute this to regular use of Pear Drops.</li>
    <li> Great abrasive toothpaste for people with hard teeth. I don&#x27;t know of any other comparable product. Highway robbery at 100 dollars a case. I paid about 35 bucks a case in 2010.</li>
    <li> This product is great in terms that it leaves your mouth with an xtra clean feeling even after a little snacking. On the other hand not so effective as a teeth whitener. It is also available at walmart for less that $3 per pack so you can try it with ordering a lot.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my coffee, but it&#x27;s hard on my teeth. This is a good product for maintaining a clean and healthy smile.     Not too gritty, and my teeth feel just like I left the dentist for a cleaning. I recommend a power toothbrush for the best results.    Too bad they didn&#x27;t add peroxide. The whitening agent isn&#x27;t as strong as strips, but it&#x27;s a good product for cleaning and polishing.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this!!!</li>
    <li> I do not know why Pearl Drops are not stocked in stores any more.  I did find it online and ordered 2 tubes.  After using one tube I could not tell a significant amount of difference in the whitening of my teeth.  I brush my teeth twice daily.  And in all fairness, I have not found a toothpaste that has changed the appearance of my teeth that much.  My teeth are in excellent shape, and I do not drink a lot of coffee, tea or dark soft drinks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pearl Drops tooth polish for nearly 5 years, now, and thought I would try their toothpaste...what a mistake!  And I purchased a 6 tube bundle!  Bigger mistake!&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is gritty and nasty in texture, and didn&#x27;t feel like it did anywhere near the job of cleaning my teeth that the polish does.&lt;br /&gt;Awful!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is really great. Your teeth will feel and look much cleaner than with any other paste. Trouble was, \\&quot;Publix Market\\&quot; stopped carrying it and I searched everywhere. Finally found it here! Try it, you&#x27;ll like it. Keeps teeth white too.</li>
