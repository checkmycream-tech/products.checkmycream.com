      <li>It was perfect for communion and stayed on her head without any problems for the few hours it took for the service and pictures.</li>

      <li>I loved the bow and the cross, but the veil was like rolled at the top.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>

      <li>Arrived on time, exactly as described!</li>
      <li>A nice, simple, affordable communion veil!</li>

      <li>I received exactly what is pictured from the</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to wear it for her First Holy Communion.</li>
      <li>For this price what exactly are you expecting?</li>
      <li>This veil is pretty</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my daughters first communion through Amazon Prime.</li>
      <li>It looks exactly like the photo and</li>
      <li>It was rather poofy up by the comb and never really laid nicely.</li>
      <li>One side layed nicely while the other stuck straight out.</li>
      <li>I love it, subtle but elegant.</li>
      <li>The veil seemed a little cheap when I took it out of the box, but actually hung really nicely on her and looked fine next to her class mate&#x27;s veils.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s cheap and won&#x27;t last.  </li>
      <li>The cross in the back is a nice touch.</li>
      <li>Simple and sweet.</li>
      <li>the little cross definitely adds a beautiful touch to it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>it just didn&#x27;t say wow!</li>
      <li>This is a very classic and very simple communion vale.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t noticeable unless you were holding the cross, really.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for a girl&#x27;s first communion if you&#x27;re not interested in spending a lot of money.</li>
      <li>The bow itself did look a little different than the picture, but was fine, I guess.</li>
      <li>I think the little silver cross is fine.</li>
      <li>The little cross makes for a cute little accessory to an already pretty veil.</li>
      <li>The little cross also had a huge indent which looked like it should have had a &amp;#34;jewel&amp;#34; that had never been placed or fallen out.</li>
      <li>The veil itself is stiff and does not lay right.</li>

    <li> Perfect for her communion outfit.  She loves it.  The clear comb is good quality.  I think the little silver cross is fine. The tulle doesn&#x27;t lay right when you take it out of the box, but we hung it for a day or two and then I ran steam from the iron over the top and smoothed with my hands.  For the price, we are pleased.</li>
    <li> Great item, would recommend!</li>
    <li> It is getting three stars because the bow does not look like the picture. It is much smaller and thinner. It works fine though and is minimalistic, just like my daughter likes.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, exactly as described! A nice, simple, affordable communion veil! Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Veil ripped the day she wore it without bring very hard on it- so it gets the job done but it&#x27;s cheap and won&#x27;t last.  Don&#x27;t expect to hand this town to your granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Terrible, This product arrived with clumps of hot glue stuck to it, tiny holes in the bow and the bow was crushed. The little cross also had a huge indent which looked like it should have had a &amp;#34;jewel&amp;#34; that had never been placed or fallen out. I had to return it. It is a shame as it looks adorable in the sellers picture.</li>
    <li> The bow itself did look a little different than the picture, but was fine, I guess. There were three pearls strung around the center section of the bow.  This bow has a comb as the way to secure it.  It did stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair. Others mentioned an indent in the cross that looks like maybe it is meant to have a stone there.  It does have that indent.  It wasn&#x27;t noticeable unless you were holding the cross, really.  I did receive several compliments that he&#x27;d veil had the cross.  The veil seemed a little cheap when I took it out of the box, but actually hung really nicely on her and looked fine next to her class mate&#x27;s veils.</li>
    <li> This veil is pretty but I wish I had gotten a different one. It was rather poofy up by the comb and never really laid nicely. But it fulfilled its purpose and was a good price. Her pictures turned out great and she had no complaints.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughters first communion through Amazon Prime. It arrived in 2 days as promissed. The quality is pretty good for the price considering she will wear it only once and my daughter is very hard on clothes. I actually ordered a second one for one of her classmates and it arrived the next day just in time. I recommend hanging on a hanger to ger any wrinkles out a few days before. I had a stubborn wrinkle that I straightened out with my blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This veil is darling. Perfect for a little girl. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. I thought I may have to take the bow or cross off if it was &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;. It wasn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> The reason I stated to order from that specific seller is because maybe the negative reviews are veils sold by another seller on here. I received exactly what is pictured from the &#x27;Sincerely Hers&#x27; seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is absolutely perfect! I do not understand what the negative reviews are even about... For this price what exactly are you expecting? It arrived in a Roman Inc. branded box, and the bow and cross are just like the photo. It did not come with any defects. I highly recommend this for a girl&#x27;s first communion if you&#x27;re not interested in spending a lot of money. For only wearing it one time, this is perfect! It looks exactly like the photo and the little cross definitely adds a beautiful touch to it. My daughter loves it too.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I wanted it to be!!!! It broke when I tried to fluff it out........ Ended up making my daughter a veil. very  disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not too flashy. Perfect for first communion. Simple and sweet.</li>
    <li> Should have listened to other reviewers. I loved the bow and the cross, but the veil was like rolled at the top. One side layed nicely while the other stuck straight out. It went back.</li>
    <li> i wasn&#x27;t too pleased with this veil. It wasn&#x27;t a disappointment but it just didn&#x27;t say wow! it&#x27;s ok  and we are still going to use it.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. It was perfect for communion and stayed on her head without any problems for the few hours it took for the service and pictures. The cross in the back is a nice touch. I bought it a while before communion and was able to make sure the wrinkles were under control by that time. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> We loved this veil. It was perfect. We received a ton of compliments. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> nice but the veil its not what i have in mind</li>
    <li> Cute! The little cross makes for a cute little accessory to an already pretty veil.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made even for the price. Had to by a replacement for it because it was put together lopsided and in even.</li>
    <li> The cross looks like it was supposed to have a gem in the middle, but fell out. The veil itself is stiff and does not lay right.</li>
    <li> Great value.Beautiful design.My granddaughters love the veil.!!!</li>
    <li> I received this in just a few days which is definitely a plus but was not at all like the picture.</li>
    <li> Pretty, dainty, and not over the top!  It is perfect for my daughter&#x27;s first communion.  I was looking for something that would be very subtle, but pretty, and this was the perfect veil for the job!</li>
    <li> I love it, subtle but elegant. I can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to wear it for her First Holy Communion.</li>
    <li> This is a very classic and very simple communion vale. My daughter really liked the appearance of the vale when she saw it. It went great with her dress</li>
